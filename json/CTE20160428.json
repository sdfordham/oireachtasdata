I might also come back to some issues later on if that is okay.  First, I thank the committee for the invitation to address it and for inviting me and my officials to today's proceedings.  Second, as the Chairman is aware, because there was some comment, I was unable to attend here on Tuesday simply by the fact that I had to attend a Cabinet meeting.  I think some people may have thought I missed it but it was obvious I could not attend because of a Cabinet meeting.  However, I am glad to be here today at the committee's second sitting.  I congratulate the Chairman on his role and the committee on its initiation and set-up.  While the timeframe is short and it has a huge amount of work to do, I genuinely wish this committee well.  It is a good initiative and it can achieve things.  I will be very open with this committee today as regards solutions and I will be positive because we have to be positive.<\/p> <p>  I will introduce my colleagues, Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa, assistant secretary of the housing section, and Mr. Barry Quinlan, principal officer in the housing policy area.  I am also joined by Mr. Niall Cussen, principal planning adviser, and Mr. Brian Kenny, principal officer in the homelessness and housing inclusion section of my Department. <\/p> <p>  Housing matters, rightly, have been the focus of serious and considerable media commentary in recent times, usually based either explicitly or implicitly on a simple supply and demand model.  In a simple model, supply and demand adjust and prices respond accordingly.  However, and this is a key point, the housing market is not a normally functioning one at the moment.  That is the real cusp of the issue.  It is not a normally functioning market.  I know that while there are children and families in emergency accommodation, it will remain the headline story in terms of housing.  I understand and accept that fact.  However, it is important to recognise that this is a symptom of much deeper supply issues and can only be dealt with through increasing supply of social, private and rental properties.  In the meantime, we must continue to strive to help these families and I consider rapid build is the best immediate answer along with greater investment in social housing, increasing housing supports and services, and continuing to improve services for families in difficulties.  <\/p> <p>  Every player, State body or otherwise, has a part to play in solving this housing problem.  A multiplicity of different Departments, agencies, outside agencies, private bodies, local authorities, etc., all have a role.  It is really a huge, intertwined web of various organisations and issues that are involved in the solving of this problem.  Any long-term solution needs the entire housing system pulling in the same direction to a common goal and this committee is a move in the right direction in terms of getting a cross-party approach to repairing a broken system.<\/p> <p>  I will try to set out what I believe are the key systemic weaknesses and questions we need to answer as well as meaningful recommendations for what needs to be done into the future.  The first point I would like to make is that when we are discussing housing, we need to separate out the issues in order to generate real and true learnings.  There are issues all over the sector, including issues relating to private housing, social housing, the private rented sector, homelessness, those who are caught in excessive mortgage debt, working couples who cannot get mortgages, etc.  All of these issues collectively interact and impact on each other.<\/p><p>I support the committee's efforts to discuss them individually but they are interconnected and that is a critical point - they cannot be separated out piecemeal.  This is because there is no one cure-all to the housing situation.  The remedies to the problems are not all to be found within my Department.  That is not to say we do not have a major role; of course we have a major role as the Department with responsibility for the environment.  However, all the levers are not in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Many pieces of this conundrum need to be aligned for it to be solved but they are not all within my Department.  Issues around construction input costs, how building materials are taxed or the price of land are relevant examples but none of these come through the lever of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We need to be really creative when formulating solutions and I encourage the committee to carry out its work in that vein.  Despite differing political ideologies our end goal is the same, namely, more and better affordable homes with adequate infrastructure to service the demand as well as an end to the boom to bust housing cycle.<\/p><p> The State, including elected members and non-elected officials, needs to come up with bold and innovative solutions.  We must bring all the stakeholders in the private and public spheres with us.  The simple fact is that our construction industry is not building enough houses to meet the needs of our people.  New supply is very low, with 12,300 houses completed last year.  Almost half of these are one-off and some are finishing out from the overhang of incomplete construction.  This is a significant and real number and I believe it is not going to move quickly.  The numbers being delivered are about half of the estimated required new supply given the country's growing population and economy.  With the addition of new private supply so low, we really have to reassess the scale of the role of the State in the provision of housing broadly.<\/p><p> Social housing in Ireland makes up 9% of households, as compared with 15% in France, 22% in Germany, 31% in Netherlands and 20% in the United Kingdom.  One of the effects of this is a considerable reliance on the private rented sector for the provision of social housing in Ireland.  It must be made clear that the share of social housing as a percentage of all households will increase substantially under the social housing strategy.  The central question for the next Government is how much of our housing problem can and should the State solve.  The State has traditionally supplied approximately 10% of homes through social housing for those who cannot afford their own.  This is a very real question.  If that dynamic is to change dramatically as a result of inactivity from the construction sector then there are significant consequences for our overall budgetary programme.  Increased funding for housing has to come from elsewhere, whether from health, education, etc.  I will not talk about any other topical issues at the moment.<\/p><p> It is a time for big ideas and considerations.  Between NAMA, the social housing strategy and the mixed-use developments that local authorities like Dublin City Council are pioneering, there will be major State intervention in the supply of housing.  I believe a balance is necessary and I believe in such intervention but I also believe that in the short term the State is going to have to increase its role in the provision of housing and it should be supported in doing so.  At local authority level, elected members need to ensure better use of limited land supply in urban areas and they need to embrace higher densities and potentially high-rise living in cities.  We need to future-proof our housing supply, ensure our ageing population - we are all included in that cohort - is catered for and ensure that the system is sufficiently flexible to deal with increasing demand.  Collectively as politicians we need to ask ourselves whether we are doing all we can to ensure housing projects are supported and promoted at all levels of the planning and development process.  I am referring to the political process beyond these Houses to local authority level, which has a key role.  We need to come back to this point during our discussions.  For example, I genuinely believe it is contradictory to have politicians of all persuasions and none calling for urgent action to deal with areas where there are housing shortages only to object to the very housing projects needed, either on an individual basis or on a multiplied basis or whatever.<\/p><p>Politicians of all political persuasions need to address some of the negative associations that go with social housing development if we are to get a speedier resolution to our housing crisis.  There are many objectors to social housing developments, even where they are being carried out by the Peter McVerry Trust or the Simon Community or, more recently, in Beaumont.  Dublin County Council recently provided my Department with a list of 16 projects last year, all of which are being met with objections.  There is no question in my mind but that NIMBYism and an incorrect negative perception of social housing leads to objections which delay local authorities in their work.<\/p><p> We also need to face up to the cold hard truth that, with the cost of constructing a new home now being significantly higher than second-hand prices in most parts of the country, we are going to have to improve the economics for the private market to supply badly needed additional homes.  The sums do not add up.  If it is not beneficial to build houses, builders will not build them, if they cannot make at least a modest profit.  Comparing these costs with the new affordability dynamic created by the new Central Bank rules, which in general I support, it can be seen why many potential builders are waiting before they build.  The Department has been to the fore in deploying a wide range of measures to bring the cost of constructing homes more within reach of what ordinary people and families can afford to pay, but it appears that these measures may not be enough, and that we must go further.  I spoke earlier about levers.  We addressed issues within our domain, but many of the issues relating to costs are not within the Department's domain.  Reductions in local authority development contributions, a streamlining of Part V social housing requirements, more consistent application of minimum apartment standards and, recently, a targeted development contribution rebate scheme have together reduced the input costs by anything from &euro;20,000 to &euro;40,000, depending on whether apartments or houses are being constructed.  We need to go further.   <\/p><p> The next Government will have to grapple with the basic economics of housing on the supply side in this country if it wants to see a significant uplift in activity by the private market.  That is one of the key messages I want to get across here today.  Recent history should demonstrate to us the dangers of over-reliance on the private market, but we do need to decide what exactly is the appropriate mix of private and public housing.  The housing action report, Laying the Foundations, which I published a fortnight ago and which I take it everyone here has had a chance to read, provides further information on 31 major actions taken across the housing spectrum in the past 21 months to increase the supply of housing, including social housing.  Every one of those actions is important and will have a positive impact on dealing with the problem, but, evidently, we must go further.<\/p><p> Some are calling for a relaxation of Central Bank lending rules as the answer, but with what result?  It would clear the way to go back to the failures of the past, which we all know about, when families ended up paying &euro;500,000 for a family home and then worried for 30 years afterwards how or if they were going to pay for it.  Surely if two people on the average industrial wage of &euro;32,000 can afford something, say approximately &euro;200,000, is that not the type of house, built to proper standards and regulations and in good locations, that we should be aiming to provide with every strand of public policy?<\/p><p> As a nation we must also think seriously about our attitude to renting.  If we can reform the rental market to make it more secure and attractive to tenants, I believe it can become a real long-term option for future generations, but the sector needs further reform.  The rental market in Ireland has doubled between 2006 and 2011 to approximately 320,000 households, around 20% of total Irish households.  In Dublin, rents are now back to 2007 peak boom-time levels.  The measures I put in place last November will bring much-needed stability to the sector, but to really offer a secure, stable and attractive housing option, the rental sector needs more supply, with the associated competition that would bring to the market.<\/p><p> If we, the democratically elected parliamentarians, wish to see more people get access to the homes they deserve, at prices or rent they can afford and in locations they desire, I believe we are going to have to go further and address a number of questions.  What is an affordable price or rent for a home?  What exactly is the State&rsquo;s future role in housing provision?  How do we reduce input costs, including direct and indirect tax take - currently more than one third of the cost of delivering a new home?  Is the negative perception of social housing developments leading to unfounded objections causing major delays?  I think we all know the answer to that.  Do local authorities and approved housing bodies have the capacity to build sufficiently?  How do we guarantee that any reductions offered by the State in respect of these input costs will be passed on to households by developers?  Where will the money come from to invest in the infrastructure needed to prepare land for development?  How do we make land available over many years at fair prices?<\/p><p> Addressing these real issues raises politically and socially important questions.  It also gets to the core of our problems.  Many of them are very sensitive questions.  We are going to have to face up to the fact that, if we truly believe people's incomes rather than the demands of the market should determine housing costs, the a number of things must happen.  For example, the State should set real housing output targets and set out the wide-ranging, time-bound actions required to meet that objective, not just for social housing - which I have done - but for housing in general.  Targets for big reductions in housing construction costs are going to have to be set and delivered on by all stakeholders, including developers, suppliers and the State.  Perhaps the State could lead on this.  Local authorities must be encouraged and incentivised to invest for the future in preparing housing lands for development.  A grown-up conversation needs to take place on Article 43 of the Constitution in order that we might achieve a better balance between the rights of individuals as property owners and wider social needs, including housing needs.  I have a number of other recommendations which I would like to share with the committee later.<\/p><p> Social housing is arguably the one part of the housing system that is turning a corner.  The last summary of social housing assessments in 2013 showed that there were almost 90,000 households on local authority waiting lists at that time.  In April last year, as part of the Social Housing Strategy 2020, I announced over &euro;1.5 billion in funding allocations in respect of social housing to be provided by all local authorities for the period out to 2017, via a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes, to meet the housing needs of 25% of the housing list.  As members know, the various projects across the country are listed in this document.  From the capital budget alone, in excess of &euro;680 million has been allocated for over 3,900 social housing new builds, turnkey developments and acquisitions.  That is just the capital budget and does not include approved housing bodies, AHBs, etc.  I want to see local authorities advance these projects as soon as possible and have assured them that funding is available to fully support their efforts in this regard.  There are no issues.<\/p><p> In all, over 13,000 sets of keys were delivered to people and families in 2015, the first full year of implementation of the strategy.  This represents an 86% increase in unit delivery over the figure for 2014.  These figures are independently verified in the other document on social housing output, which was compiled by the Housing Agency.  This level of delivery was achieved in a very difficult operating environment and represents a good start to the implementation of the strategy.  I am not saying anything other than it is a good start.  I expect in the region of 17,000 social housing keys to be delivered this year.  Local authorities have been geared up again to deliver at scale and well in excess of 450 staff have been allocated to them.  That takes time and the announcements I made will be delivered in the years ahead.  That is why this document is called Laying the Foundations.  We have to be realistic; houses do not appear overnight.<\/p><p> I would argue that investment in and delivery of social housing are not the main issues provided we can get the housing market functioning appropriately again.  The latter is key.  Almost &euro;3 billion in capital funding will be provided under the capital plan up to 2021, as well as other funding models such as public-private partnership, PPP, in order to deliver social housing.  The real issue is supply for the other elements of the market and, particularly, supply of housing that is intrinsically affordable for the average or lower income household.<\/p><p>This is the cohort I am most concerned about - namely, those who are put to the pin of their collar paying rent while, in some instances, trying to save for a deposit.  We all know it is a catch-22 situation.  Without the required supply of housing coming on stream to take the heat out of the rental market and provide a supply of homes at an affordable price, we are simply storing up problems for the future.<\/p><p> In the short- to medium-term, the focus needs to be on the residential construction sector and boosting supply.  It is taking time to recover from the economic downturn and, as a consequence, supply from that sector is lagging significantly behind demand.  As I said earlier, private market housing is currently delivering circa 50% of the estimated annual requirement of 25,000 dwellings nationally.  Lack of supply is having an adverse effect on the rental market and, along with causing all of the problems I have alluded to, will impact on our competitiveness.  <\/p><p> We have the housing system we have because of political and social choices made in the past.  To a certain extent, because of the financial crisis and its impact on the housing sector, some of those choices were probably made for us.  During my time in office I have used the powers available to me not to solve the problem in its entirety, because that was virtually impossible, but to lay the foundations for a long-term and sustainable solution to this problem.  The 31 major actions taken in the past 21 months will have a substantial impact, but I need to stress that I and my team could only directly take the necessary actions that fell within my areas of responsibility.  This is a key point for the committee and the incoming Government when they ask what decisions we should be taking now to put our housing system, by which I mean all elements of the spectrum, back on a sustainable footing.  <\/p><p> To truly crack this nut, my successor, whether a Minister for housing or for the environment, needs to be able to exert sufficient influence over all of the levers that will bring us to that end, including certain elements of taxation, and the powers to introduce changes that will impact on the viability of development for builders and ensure that any reduction in input costs is passed on to homeowners so that we have affordable homes in the true sense of the word.  <\/p><p> I have heard a lot of talk that we should have a Minister for housing, and such a recommendation may come from the committee.  I have no objection in principle to that.  Appointing a Minister for housing and taking the function from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is a waste of time.  We will have a Minister for the environment, who will have a particular role, but unless sections are taken from the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Social Protection and other agencies and included in such a ministry, a new Minister would be left in the same position as me and the former Minister of State, Paudie Coffey, were over the past 21 months.  I admit that we had a significant role to play, but it was part of the overall pie.  <\/p><p> If we are going to increase the supply of homes to the extent needed, we need to take a comprehensive action-based approach that is broad in scope and recognises all tenures.  It needs to be an approach that boosts supply, helps tenants as well as home-buyers and recognises that, alongside new homes, we need to address the issue of how zoned land is made available for development so that we make the very best of existing infrastructure investment, land and buildings.  <\/p><p> We also need to have a grown-up conversation about Article 43 of the Constitution, and getting the balance right between the rights of the individual, as regards property rights, and the common good.  The two specific items that were directly affected by this were the vacant site levy and the protection of tenancies during the property sales.  On the vacant site levy, while I am delighted that it is now enshrined in our laws and it is something in which I believe, my original proposal, following my work with the former Minister of State, Paudie Coffey, was to have it at 6% to 7% of the market value of the land and for it to be introduced later on this year or in 2017.  To ensure it is safe from a constitutional challenge, that provision was amended.  Similarly, when it came to residential tenancies legislation, the Constitution acted as a barrier against protecting tenancies in cases in which a property was sold.<\/p><p>There has been much commentary on this.  I say this not to attribute any blame to the Constitution but because for this committee I need to be open and honest about the situation as I faced it.  For the record, because there was commentary on this, I never suggested that the matter of compulsory purchase of land for housing was not an option for local authorities.  We might discuss that later.  It is not a panacea.  There are issues with that as well and it can go on for years.<\/p><p> The key question for the committee is what the appropriate role for the State is in all this.  Some might say we should go back to the massive public house building projects because the house building sector will never deliver.  That is a deeply flawed approach that accepts failure.  Yes, we need a vibrant public housing sector but do we seriously think nationalising all housing provision in this State is the answer?  Have any of us here today any sense of the budgetary implications that would pose and the schools or hospitals that we would be unable to build if we diverted a huge level of Exchequer resources into housing to the detriment of other needy sectors?  We have this famous fiscal space, a serious amount of which needs to go into housing.  Everyone in this room will argue for a section of that pie to go to other sectors.  My point is that we need to have a mix.  Do any of us here really believe that the answer to our broken housing system is the re-creation of vast swathes of local authority estates which in some cases have taken billions of euros to regenerate?  Would it not be better to fix our broken housing market and bring about social housing with it rather than dancing around the edges and pointing out the weaknesses without the political bravery to fix them once and for all?  I believe that housing economics in this country is an eminently fixable problem if the collective will is there by us, as parliamentarians, and all the other stakeholders.  It cannot be beyond our ability to deliver housing at a cost that ordinary people on average incomes can afford to rent or buy.  I certainly believe it is possible and I want to do everything to deliver that.<\/p><p> In addition, in an ideal world, public policy would not only espouse but deliver a plan-led supply of land for housing, acquire it at reasonable cost if necessary and then prepare it with the necessary infrastructure before making it available for public and private housing development in sustainable communities, capturing the uplift in value arising from the zoning and servicing of land and paying for the infrastructure through that process, which we might describe as active land management.  That is another topic I believe we should get back to.  I might add that, having debated this issue during the general election, I did not see or seek a quick answer or silver bullet in any political manifesto to resolve this overnight.<\/p><p> The committee heard from local authorities on Tuesday - I did not see their contribution but I went back over it - that there is a time lag of about two and a half years when it comes to housing development and that we need to buy and lease in the meantime.  There is quite an amount of information in the documents, Social Housing Output and Laying the Foundations, both of which I have shown to the committee and which I am sure its members have had time to study.  We can collectively create the ideal scenario.  Perhaps the Thirty-second D&aacute;il, through this committee, will grasp that opportunity.  It might be the springboard and might take the lessons learned over recent years and the recent decade and develop a national strategy for the delivery of all housing in Ireland that addresses all types, tenures and sectors and, above all, the needs of our citizens.<\/p><p> In my contributions here, I want to be positive, solution-based and work with everyone.  The election is over.  We spoke about water yesterday but in my time in the Department this took up 90% of my time because it is the most pressing issue.  Collectively, working together, we certainly can find some solutions.  I have put forward four recommendations and at some point later on, I would like to put forward more based on the collective experience of this theme over recent years.  I thank the committee for its time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#C00200","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement.

It may well be a good idea and I am open to it.  I am being totally frank and honest.  If we want a Minister for housing who will drive all of this and be the tsar at the top of it, he or she would need to have control of the levers or be the person answerable for all the levers at the very least.  In recent years the former Minister of State, Mr. Paudie Coffey, and I certainly did not have access to all the levers.  I will say this out straight.  If we are to have a Minister, he or she will have to have control over certain taxation measures.<\/p> <p>  Let us be frank about this.  Will any Government take those powers away from a Minister for Finance?  I would be amazed if that were allowed to happen.  That is the first point.  Approximately 38% of the cost of building a house goes to the State.  That has to be addressed.  However, that is up to the Department of Finance and not the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The person to be in charge has to have that area.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to public expenditure, whoever is the future Minister in charge of allocating funding etc. has to consider the overall pie that I spoke about earlier, involving education, health care and everything else.  By the way, I have to say I got great co-operation from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.  Getting &euro;4 billion at an incredibly difficult time was a huge amount to get.  However, into the future, I would bet my bottom dollar that that will not be handed over either.  There is the area of social protection and the lever relating to rent supplement.  I was very interested in Tuesday's contribution by the CCMA regarding that lever.<\/p> <p>  There is the whole role of NAMA.  Who has responsibility there?  What is the future of NAMA?

However, it is simply a fact that it will have a role in housing into the future because of the nature of that entity.  NAMA was set up with a commercial mandate.  Unless that is changed, it cannot act in other ways.  That is just reality.  We have to accept that or change it.  If we change it, the European Union may have issues with what is on balance sheet and there are a number of areas.<\/p> <p>  I believe it would be tokenistic to appoint a Minister for housing unless those three or four things I have mentioned - I daresay there are others - are all wrapped into that Ministry.  One could envisage some sort of relationship being built with the Department of Finance, but at the end of the day, if a Minister for Finance is controlling those decisions, the Minister for housing is not truly in full control of it.<\/p> <p>  On the Constitution, I have the privilege - for another few days anyway - of sitting at Cabinet.  One has to act at all times in accordance with the law and obviously we take advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  One cannot produce legislation that is contrary to the Constitution.  The Chairman sat there and he knows that.  One must work within that and keep it between the ditches, so to speak.  There will be debate.  I saw the articles in the newspaper in which the Master of the High Court made his comments, but he is not sitting at Cabinet.<\/p><p>I am sorry, but I must take the advice I am given.  I respect the advice, and that advice is from the highest legal office that supports the Government.<\/p><p> With regard to the vacant site levy, I fundamentally believe we have to address the issue of hoarding land because, basically, it is just being left there.  The number of underdeveloped sites between the two canals in this city is incredible.  I wanted to instigate certain powers in respect of local authorities to address that, and I wanted to do it fairly quickly.  On foot of the constitutional issue and the advice I received, however, I had to push it out and, for proportionality reasons, I was obliged to drop the percentage.<\/p><p> I had similar problems when it came to addressing rental issues in a number of areas.  For example, we are all well aware of the issues regarding vulture funds.  I met the people from Tyrrelstown.  In fairness, I was asked to do so and was glad to do so because they are very decent people.  Again, if we were going to introduce legislation which was going to prevent the sale, there were questions from a constitutional point of view and there were also issues in regard to the rental sector and other considerations.  That is just fact.<\/p><p> We have to take the advice.  I am just throwing it out there because everything has to be out there.  I believe in property rights but we have to consider whether there is a balance.  Maybe we can change it.  Maybe we should not change it, but perhaps we should.  I certainly believe we need to talk about it.  That is why I am putting it out there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#J00400","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>My first point is that the Minister is not to blame for the housing crisis, although there is sometimes a tendency for him to get very defensive.

My first question is why the local authority housing targets are so low in the first place.  The Social Housing Strategy 2020 has a target of 35,000 new units from 2015 to 2020, but only 11,200 are to be new social housing units to be built or acquired by councils or housing associations.  If that is broken down, given there are roughly 100,000 families on the housing list, only one in ten would be catered for by the acquisition or building of a social housing unit, based on those targets.  The rest of the 35,000 new units were to be 11,000 leases, 2,300 refurbishments of voids and 9,000 units bought or leased under Part V, although that is dependent on the private sector building the units in order for them to be acquired.  The Minister can see how, with a continuation of this policy, the social housing lists are never going to be impacted upon in the way that is needed.<\/p> <p>  Another issue that arises in regard to the Minister's document is that the targets are proportionately lowest in the areas worst affected by homelessness.  While Dublin is not the only place affected, it is at the epicentre of this tsunami.  To take the four Dublin local authority areas, there were 22,000 on Dublin City Council's housing list in December but what the Minister is talking about would only have an impact on 21% of that list.  In the case of Fingal, the figure is would be 23%.  All of the other areas have higher outcomes, so the Minister can see how targeted intervention in the worst affected areas is just not happening.<\/p> <p>  The other question is on the breakdown of social housing.  The Minister said that the share of social housing as a percentage of households will increase significantly under his strategy.  However, last year - the first year of the strategy - there was only a maximum net increase of 268 genuinely new social housing units across all the schemes.  I want to break this down.  The Minister referred to 13,000 units in respect of which sets of keys were delivered.<\/p><p>Of that figure, 2,696 are renovated voids, 125 have been regenerated, 1,096 result from local authorities acquiring second hand homes, 64 are new local authority completions, including from Part V developers, and 401 have been built or bought by housing associations.  Of the figure of 33,000, only 1,561 are new permanent social housing units provided by local authorities or housing agencies.  Some 8,933 units are rented or leased from landlords or developers.  We have had complete reliance on the private sector.  Will the Minister at least admit, now that he is leaving his post, that this was an error?<\/p><p> Why is the capital spend in this area so low?  The Minister has continued to talk in the D&aacute;il about the money that has been thrown at this issue.  The money that has been thrown at it is now lower, with it being a third of what it was in 2008.  We have a housing crisis and the money allocated to address it must be increased.  Some &euro;11 billion has been taken out of the allocation for housing since the recession began.  It must be put back into if we are to solve the housing crisis.  <\/p><p> The Minister mentioned those people who say we need loads more money to provide social houses; he was probably referring to the people on the left.  He also said the money has to come from somewhere else and he asked if it is to come from the allocation for health or education.  The answer is \"No\", it is not.  It could come from the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, which has &euro;3 billion in its cash reserves.  Delegates from NAMA will appear before the committee, so I do not want to focus on NAMA but there is money in its cash reserves and the Government could have ordered NAMA to change its remit at any time.  The Minister could also consider taxing wealth in this country.  That is the other place in this respect.  The fiscal space the Minister has talked about cannot resolve the housing crisis or the other issues in health and education.  It is too small.  The Minister needs to get more wealth and use it for the vast majority in society but he has not been willing to do that.  The Minister mentioned the percentage of social housing in Ireland has always been very low but in the 1960s it was almost 20%, so it was not always low.  <\/p><p> On the private rented sector, the Minister mentioned today and previously in the D&aacute;il that he is powerless in the face of the Constitution to keep people in their homes.  The legal advice he got, I assume from the Attorney General, stating that people could not be kept in their homes if a property is being sold should be published because it has been disputed by others.  The Minister mentioned Mr. Justice Edmund Honohan and, hopefully, he will appear before the committee.  We are meant to have a session on legal issues that need to be examined to resolve the housing issue.  <\/p><p> The Minister did not enact most of the claimed improvements in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act yet.  For example, the provision relating to the statutory declaration landlords are required to provide if they intend to sell a property has not yet been enacted.  Perhaps the Minister suddenly introduced a ministerial order to that effect, but it was not enacted when I last checked.  The only other element to which the Minister has pointed is the two-year lease.  Will he acknowledge that, given that rents will increase by 10% this year, the provision has not worked?  The two-year lease provision simply doubled the increase that landlords imposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#K00400","speaker":"1254","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Can the Deputy give the Minister time to respond, as other colleagues wish to contribute?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>On the situation in Tyrrelstown, which the Minister mentioned and I thank him for agreeing to meet those concerned, will he ask local authorities to enact a measure to provide that if the council acquires homes that people are already renting, it cannot start to evict those people?

I congratulate him and his colleagues on their efforts in Government over the past number of years.  It was a period that was fraught with difficulty at times, particularly in respect of access to finance.  This must be acknowledged.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Coppinger about the extent to which the public housing programme can have an impact on the market.  The shift from the direct-build local authority housing programme in the 1980s to a reliance on the private rental sector, supported by the Department of Social Protection, was the wrong decision, and I have spoken about it many times.  I believe the evidence is there to support that.  There are two issues.  One is the immediate emergency.  We need to accelerate everything we can do in terms of procedures to ensure we address this issue in the shortest possible period.  I ask the Minister to put particular emphasis on that, whether it be by way of direct build, modular housing or acquisition of existing private new or second-hand housing.  <\/p> <p>  The rolling over of property has been a serious feature in making housing very expensive in this country.  During the boom, it was not unusual for a site to be acquired for a sum of money and then passed over to a second, a third and a fourth owner, resulting in up to ten times the original cost of the site being borne by whoever was going to buy or build a house on that site.  The Chairman and the rest of us all know of instances where this happened.  I do not believe we have an obligation to facilitate that kind of thing, because the first priority in respect of those seeking private or public housing must be to make it as affordable as possible.  <\/p> <p>  The use of developed private sites by local authorities was very well applied in times past and was very effective in enabling people on the local authority housing list to build their own homes to their own specifications without impacting on anybody.  The next issue is local authority housing loans, which have effectively been gone for years.  That was part of the switchover from the public housing programme to a reliance on the private rental sector.  It was, as it were, stolen.<\/p> <p>  We need to plan for the future.  The previous plan was to rely on the private sector.  This is no reflection on the private sector, but the plan was wrong and could never work.  During the 1980s, roughly 1,000 houses became available per annum for that income group - those on the average industrial wage - in my county.  That was about 25 years ago.  We have nothing to replace that except the private rental sector, which is subject to the fluctuations of the market, which makes it impossible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#M00500","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his team for coming in.

How do we control that?  What are the Minister's views on this?<\/p><p> The local authorities are under awful pressure, not so much in trying to provide housing but actually dealing with the housing situation from social workers right through to people declaring as homeless every day.  This is not just confined to Dublin or to the cities but happens in every town.  Has the Minister any thoughts on how the local authorities could be better equipped with resources to handle that?<\/p><p> Another area where local authorities&rsquo; ability is questionable is in how they manage estates once they are built.  I have seen numerous cases where fine estates are built but, within weeks, houses are boarded up again.  This is a criminal waste of money and public resources.<\/p><p> From his experience of the past 20 months in the Department at the coalface of this problem, does the Minister have any specific further recommendations for the committee or any changes or advice he would offer?

On top of that, 11,000 units will come through pure leasing and 2,300 through restoring voids, with which we have been incredibly successful.  We had to ramp up our building.  Whatever anyone says about building houses, they take two to three years to build, except rapid-build housing which we should discuss later.<\/p><p>I did not lay the foundations for any of the houses now being built - I do not mean that literally - and they were commenced by my predecessors.  There are 5,000 houses in the process of being built across the country.  It takes time to churn it up.  Those houses that have been closed off in the past year or so came about because of what was done three years ago.<\/p><p> If we were to produce a large volume of houses immediately in this year, they should have been planned three years ago.  The simple fact is we did not have the money for it.  We need a continuous pipeline of social housing.  I have set out through the social housing strategy how to achieve a pipeline where in excess of 10,000 houses can be built every year.  That is where the rebalancing happens but it will not happen overnight.  I accept that the number of houses being built is small but the facts are the facts.  This year, hundreds of houses will be built in many cases because of work that was done preceding my time in the Department.  The year after that, thousands will be built, and the year after that it will be near the figure I want, which is 10,000 houses.  That is the way it has to work.  We need to discuss rapid building as that is an important sector.<\/p><p> We have spoken about building houses and I agree with some points but in many cases, the local authorities simply buy or, working with the approved housing bodies, lease a property because it is cheaper.  Some people have questioned the way in which houses in Ballymun have been put up and we can talk about that.  I am fine about it.  People are asking why houses are not just bought because that would be cheaper.  We are doing that as well on top of everything to create more housing.<\/p><p> The Deputy referred to the capital budget and is right that it is lower than it was in 2008.  By 2008, we had seen a decade of the housing capital budget being ramped up because of a significant boom period in the State.  The simple fact is we have just emerged from the worst ever economic crisis.  In 2014, the capital budget was &euro;299 million; in 2015 it is &euro;430 million; and in 2016 it is &euro;528 million.  That is a fairly significant increase by any percentage year-on-year in our current position.  In the total budget of the Department for this area, there has been a significant increase.  It is now up to &euro;933 million from &euro;583 million in 2014, which is not that long ago.<\/p><p> I will address an issue relating to waiting lists.  We have had much discussion in this country about how many people are waiting for social housing and what is the true figure.  We have the 2013 figure and the figure given by others when they calculate statistics from local authorities, etc.  The housing agency used to do this figure every three years and 2013 was the last time figures were produced.  I have now insisted on and initiated a process where it is done every single year because we need that data and what we are really addressing.  Analysis in that period has demonstrated that the figure for people seeking social housing and the numbers bandied about simply do not add up.  Analysis has been made in which the figures for local authorities is totted up but that does not take into account that some people are on social housing lists for a number of years but do not need it any more.  In some cases, people are on housing lists but there is no requirement or they are on the list for other reasons.<\/p><p>There are people, certainly in Dublin, who are on multiple lists or are being double-counted and there are also other issues.  That is not to play down the fact that we still have huge figures.  This is important information.<\/p><p> Cork city did an analysis of choice-based letting - I want to talk about this later on - which I think should be rolled out across the country.  It found there was a 25% drop in the number of people requiring social housing.  Once choice-based letting, whereby the properties are put out there, became available, it was found that 40% of the people who were on the original list were not even active.  They were not actively looking.  It is important that we engage that information.<\/p><p> On ramping up local authority building, which a couple of representatives mentioned, it did take time.  I gave co-operation.  More than 450 staff have been put into local authorities.  I got co-operation from the majority of local authorities, but I was disappointed that some of the recruitment still has not happened.  Local authorities got out of social housing and now they have got back into it.  They need the personnel to do that, but they have the capacity to do it.<\/p><p> In respect of the percentages of local authority housing, I believe they are quite ambitious.  Anyone who looks at them can see the volume of funding that has been allocated to each local authority.  I will pick at random.  Cork County Council has &euro;80 million up to the end of 2017, Cork City Council has &euro;124 million, Dublin City Council alone has &euro;292 million, and South Dublin County Council has &euro;73 million.  If we go down to the likes of Kilkenny, the county council got &euro;43 million.  Even a smaller county like Carlow has in excess of &euro;20 million.  There is a considerable amount of funding available for local authorities up until the end of next year.  Overall, when we look at the total targets in Dublin, it comes to 30% of the total.  I will break down the figures if the Deputy wants: 3,347 units in the Dublin City Council area, 1,376 in Fingal, 681 in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, and 1,445 in South Dublin, which makes a total of 6,849.<\/p><p> I have met the representatives of Tyrrelstown.  I am quite circumspect about getting into details on this because there are negotiations and discussions going on to which I am privy and I do not want to influence that.  I have spoken about the issue with the sale of houses and the article in the Constitution, but in general there are options available to the tenants, working through the local authorities, and I have made sure at a local authority level that they will be facilitated in any way possible.  I want to point out one fact that is not widely known.  We have to be quite careful because a higher than average percentage of people who are involved in various schemes for purchasing their local authority houses, etc., are now in arrears.  We have to be very careful about that.<\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Canney's remarks on the area of land management.  He asked me what my recommendations would be and I thank him for asking that.  I will do that at the end.  I have more than two, by the way.  We need better land management.  It is a critical issue and it needs to be more co-ordinated.  My colleague has maps in respect of the volume of sites and zonings available across Dublin.  There are 27,000 houses with planning permission in Dublin.  There are also another 20,000 with very little that has to be done.  They will probably get planning because the services are there.  That is 50,000 houses that can be made available pretty quickly.  That raises certain issues.  We must find ways in which actively to develop such land.<\/p><p> In respect of the Deputy's question on costs, 38% of the cost of building a house goes to the State.  The big one is VAT.  There is obviously Part V, which I think I have addressed in a fair way, and the issue of development contributions.<\/p><p>I agree with the Deputy that there is no point in reducing the VAT to zero if that does not get passed on to the house buyer.  One must have a process by which one can ensure that happens.  In other words, one must have conditions built in, which we did recently with regard to developments in Dublin and Cork, whereby we kept the prices below &euro;300,000 and &euro;250,000.  The sale price of a house or apartment must be at a certain level before a developer qualifies for such an exemption.  That is what I would recommend.  We must map and zone that all over the country so that if a developer is building a house or apartment and wants to avail of a special VAT rate, he or she must, with no underhand stuff, sell the property for a certain amount, depending on the location.  That amount should be set at a national level.  That would be my recommendation in that regard.<\/p><p> The last question the Deputy asked related to estates.  Significant progress has been made in this area.  In 2015 approximately 5,000 voids were remediated while in 2016 we have provided funding for a further 1,600.  A lot of work has been done in the area of unfinished estates but a perennial issue in this regard is the taking in charge of estates.  One of the last items signed off by the Government before the general election was a five-year plan for a fund and a process for the taking in charge of all estates in this country.  Estates were put into various categories.  Some estates only have minor issues to be resolved relating to kerbs, lighting and so forth but others have much more serious issues with their water and waste systems, for example.  A fund has been put in place to deal with all of these matters.<\/p><p> Virtually all of the changes concerning rental space have been put in place and the regulations the Deputy asked about will be signed on Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#N00700","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Oh, it will be signed on Tuesday?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#Q00200","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Yes, because from a legal perspective it took some time to write up those regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#Q00300","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#Q00400","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>That is a positive thing.

I am not convinced that there is an acceptance of how bad things are.  The way we have been dealing with this issue in recent years will not fix the problem.  We are not making progress.  People do not like to hear the word mentioned in this House, but there has been a neoliberal approach to the delivery of housing which is very problematic.  It does not work and we need to do something different.<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about the role of the State and said that the supply of social housing in Ireland has generally been at around 9%.  I support the new Central Bank rules because I do not see why we should drive people to despair in the future with mortgage repayments that they cannot meet.  However, the flip side of that is the expectation that in the future, the Irish State will have to help approximately 30% of its people with housing.  That is a huge game changer.  The average figure is 9%, although I know it reached 15% in certain periods during the lifetime of this State.<\/p><p>That is likely to go to 30% and we have to accept that.  I ask whether the Minister agrees with that.  <\/p><p> The Minister asked if local authorities have the wherewithal to build the housing.  Obviously, local authorities are not in a position to directly build.  When we talk about directly building local authority housing, we are talking about local authorities organising it and the State paying for it.  Obviously they have to be put out to tender and get builders to build it.  They do have the capacity to do that.<\/p><p> To be parish pump about it, Wexford County Council has approved 31 units for 2016, 36 for 2017 and 55 house acquisitions for vulnerable groups in 2016 and 40 in 2017.  I know two projects that are ready to proceed.  Taghmon is ready to start on 16 houses but funding has not been approved.  It is a ready to go site but it has not got approved funding.  Carrick-on-Bannow is ready to start on ten units but funding has not been approved.   Given the demand what is delaying the decision to approve the funding?<\/p><p> The Minister said the waiting list was inaccurate.  In Wexford there are 3,800 on the waiting list.

The Minister mentioned the site levy of 7% and said he would like to introduce it in 2017.  I am glad to hear that.  Does the Minister agree that the vacant site levy introduced before Christmas is a joke?  The yield from it is so little it will not speed up the development of sites.  Is the Minister going to tell me otherwise?  If an individual has borrowed the money to land bank, the Minister is not asking that person to pay tax on it or asking to pay a levy.  The rate is 0.75% if he owes more than 75% of the money.  Of course he owes more than 75% of the money.  He would be off his head if he was not borrowing to acquire land for land banking.  Will the Minister admit the State has refused to address the problem of land banking?  Land banking is probably the biggest problem in terms of affordability around private housing in Ireland.  Last week a site for 27 units was sold in Clontarf for which the developer paid more than &euro;220,000 per unit.  We have not dealt with the issue.  It is an absolute scandal that the State has not dealt with land banking.  The Kenny report published in 1974 is gathering dust on the shelves.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said that nationalising all aspects of housing is not the answer.  Nobody is saying it is the answer.  We expect the majority of housing still to be in the private sector.  However, in the region of 30% of social housing units will need to be provided by the State.  The Minister asked where the money would come from.  He is probably tired listening to me saying, and I said it in the House yesterday, that if the Government is serious about building social housing through the local authorities it will have to challenge the fiscal rule.  Italy, Spain, Lithuania and Austria will all break the fiscal rule this year.  Why cannot Ireland do the same?  We have a very good reason to do so.  France will break it for security reasons because it is dealing with ISIS and we cannot break it to deal with the emergency in housing.  I do not understand the reason the State is not challenging the European Union so that we can borrow money at less than 1% to build housing.<\/p> <p>  The Minister made the point that it takes two or three years to build houses.  I am well aware that it takes a long time to do things.  I have done it all my life.  From start to finish, large projects take between two and three years.<\/p><p>With regard to a site like Taghmon, when the design is completed, planning is approved and funding is approved and ready to go, does the Minister know how long it takes to actually build them?

This country is full of small sites.  Dublin city has loads of them.  Would the Minister not admit that there is a major concentration by local authorities on the big bang effect of big sites?  Why are the small sites not happening and why do we not get the small builders back in the game?  There are small builders all over the country dying to do work and they are not looking for a profit of &euro;20,000 or &euro;40,000 a unit.  The builders I know are probably different from builders that Frank Daly might know but they are not looking for that kind of profit.  If they made between &euro;5,000 and &euro;10,000 profit per unit they would be delighted with themselves and more than happy.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the Minister could clarify if it is possible to activate a lot of the smaller sites and get the smaller builder back in?  However, we are then back to the finance problem again.  Can the State start organising finance for smaller builders because the banks will not give finance to them?  The banks do not want to lend to them.  Most of the building which goes on in this town today is being done by investment funds and the Irish banks are not funding it.  However, those guys come up with their own money and they are dominating what is being built at the moment.  Developers such as Kennedy Wilson and Hines are building now but they are only building for the rental market and do not have to worry about having to sell the units at a low price.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#S00300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Time please Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#S00400","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":68,"content":"<p>My final question to the Minister is if he thinks it would be possible for the State to start funding these small projects and to help the builders build housing, be it 50% social, 50% affordable or even private?

The discussion has been wide ranging and the Minister has made the point, correctly, that our housing market is a result of political and social choices.  That is really, in essence, the project of this committee; to make political and social choices going forward.  Having heard what has been said so far, my concern is that repeating the same mistakes will not give a different outcome.  From the Minister's comments today, and from much of the documentation I have seen from the Department, it appears that mistakes are being repeated.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has said that the heart of the matter lies with what the State's role is in housing provision.  That is the point.  He is correct in saying that the social housing list is not the numbers that are bandied around.  There have always been people on the social housing list who, ultimately, may not have wanted a social housing house.  They may have been on the list in order to access rent allowance.  We all know this, many of us being from a local authority background.  However, this is not the issue.  Is the social housing crisis worse now than it was a number of years ago when those problems existed? The answer has to be that it is worse.  When I was a councillor there were never situations where people got letters telling them their average wait to be accommodated would be ten or 12 years.  Does the Minister accept this or does he think we do not have a problem?<\/p> <p>  The figure of 13,000 given by the Minister - this gets to the heart of the matter - which he says were the number of social housing units provided, is not correct.  Some 8,000 of those units were either rent supplement arrangements reclassified as HAP or they were RAS accommodations which were coming on board anyway.  These were not new units.  If we keep doing that - the Minister said there is no problem with investment - and if one is investing in the private sector to deliver all the time, we will have the same problems.  With regard to the pie, I would like to hear the Minister's comments on taking money from other areas.  Does he acknowledge that if one accepts the size of the pie, then we are not going to get a solution since the amounts of money needed are quite vast?<\/p><p> I would like the Minister to comment on some direct initiatives because the State has to have a more direct role.  For example, a lot of housing stock is underutilised.  There are those who want to downsize and so on.  Dublin City Council, for example, has a list of approximately 500 people who want to downsize to older people units and single dwellings but they cannot because the unit for older people is not there and because of the one-bed provision and so on.  We have stock out there.  What of the idea of the State directly encouraging initiatives for people to give up that stock in the way people used to sell their dwellings and give one third to the council in return for being re-accommodated?  What of the &euro;100 sites that used to be there?  There are a lot of pocket sites held by local authorities.  Three or four people could get together and build a house for themselves.  This was the old way of doing affordable housing.  Unless we tilt the direction back to more State provision, would the Minister not agree that there will not be a way forward on this?<\/p><p> I have two quick questions.  The Minister correctly posed the question as to how we make land available.  We had the answer to that question in the Kenny report.  Has it been looked at really?  There was a huge problem in the lifetime of the last Government with the advice of the last Attorney General - I suppose she is still the Attorney General - on constitutional issues.  Constitutional issues are only decided by the Legislature and the courts.  We need to either test these in the courts or change the Constitution.  The Minister and his Government were quite willing to change them on really ridiculous things such as the age of the President.  This is more important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#S00700","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#T00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Good, we will be all on the same side then when it comes out on that.<\/p> <p>  My last point concerns rapid builds and the Minister's point about objections from communities to social housing, which is a little unfair.  People in many areas would object to any type of housing if a cul-de-sac is being opened up and their whatever is being interfered with.  However, the Minister mentioned Beaumont.  Would he not accept that it was not sensible to buy a big block for fewer social housing units?  It might have been better, and would have been for all sorts of reasons, to buy the whole lot, offer to sell 50% of it for private housing and use that money to acquire social housing in a different area.  That is precisely the point about rapid builds.  The Minister said, and I would like him to explain it, that the Department is spending money buying houses.  We know that.  However, if we take the rapid build project the Minister has planned for Balbriggan, he is planning to spend &euro;3 million more on those rapid build units than it would cost to acquire the same number of units across Balbriggan, which would free up that amount of money.  Therefore, the Minister is not spending the same amount of money.<\/p> <p>  The Minister might also deal with the amount of time taken to deliver rapid build houses, which are now not modular units but timber frame houses.  If they were to go through the normal planning permission process and so on, they would not necessarily be any quicker than any other timber frame dwellings. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#T00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":74,"content":"<p>The Minister might hold his replies for a moment.

In 2013, when it was carried out in my city of Limerick, 1,690 people disappeared off the list.  I believe many of those still had a housing need and that it was not done properly.  I would be concerned that if we do a needs assessment, it is done accurately and that we ensure those who are on the list are contacted.  I do not believe it was done properly in Limerick.  Some people allegedly got one letter, but I believe some people did not get the letter.  To this day, we are still dealing with people who believe they are on the housing list who are not on it.  I, therefore, am concerned that if we do it that we do it exactly right.  It is important that we have a correct list and that we can look at solutions which deal with the number that is actually on the list.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the procurement process, as have many other Deputies.  I have a concern about it and why it cannot be speeded up.  Will the Minister explain some ways in which we could do it faster?  On the rapid build houses project in Ballymun, why can we not just change the process quickly to deliver houses more quickly?  The Minister stated there were objections to a number of applications and Deputy Daly dealt with that matter very well.  There have been objections, but there were also a number of projects and I will mention Limerick again in this regard.  We have a regeneration project but, seven years into it, no houses have been delivered in St. Mary's Park or in the Ballinacurra Weston area.  There would be no objection to any plans for those areas.  We could have built houses and put people into them years ago.  We reviewed the project in 2014, as the Minister knows, but we still have not built a significant number of houses in most of those regeneration areas.<\/p><p>There are about 50 houses built in the Moyross area but we have knocked approximately 300 houses there.  The project has not delivered what it was supposed to deliver.<\/p><p> The Minister said the Department housing strategy up to 2020 was the largest social housing investment in the history of the State.  I was interested in that comment when I read it.  The Minister repeated his statement in the D&aacute;il on a number of occasions.  Will the Minister detail the capital spend per year over the six years of the strategy and what will be spent year-on-year?  Will the Minister compare that with the capital spent in the six years prior to the strategy being implemented?  He might even go back to 2007 or 2008, etc.<\/p><p> Let us consider some of the projects the Department has undertaken.  There is one in my area, although I have no wish to be harping on about Limerick all the time.  One project was supposed to deliver 11 houses in what was called the Shelbourne Square area of Limerick.  Some private developer popped in and bought it before we could.  It was a NAMA-type property.  Do we know of any others throughout the State were that has happened?  Are there projects on this list which will not be built or delivered for us?  In this case there were 11 units in Limerick.  Will they be replaced by another 11 units or something similar?  Is that happening to other local authorities throughout the State?<\/p><p> We have a deep concern because the Department's housing strategy was reliant on delivering up to 80% private rented properties.  Again, we saw figures for Limerick yesterday and there were five one-bedroom apartments available.  The rent sought was between &euro;600 and &euro;750 for one-bedroom apartments in Limerick.  Given a rent supplement of &euro;375 for a single person, that is not really going to work.<\/p><p> I have a concern about some of the projects.  Obviously we want to get them delivered as fast as we can.  However, in Hospital, County Limerick, we are building 20 units at a cost of &euro;185,000 each.  That figure comes from dividing 20 into the money that has been allocated for the project.  However, it is possible to buy a house in Hospital at the moment for &euro;75,000.  A number of houses are available in that area for &euro;75,000, some &euro;100,000 cheaper than the cost of the houses in the capital project.  The Minister said himself that these figures do not add up.  Is there provision under this review whereby if we were going to build something and the money has been allocated then we can simply buy available houses?  We can deliver the housing far quicker that way.  Obviously, if we can build houses, it is far better because we are putting people back to work as well.<\/p><p> Another issue was raised and there is some confusion about it.  The credit unions have been in touch with all Deputies.  They have sent their housing policy in to us along with offers of moneys that we could access.  Can the Minister update us on what contacts we have had with the credit unions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#T00500","speaker":"1327","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I do not mean to interfere but the committee had previously arranged to meet the credit unions specifically on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":78,"content":"<p>That is my final comment.

I am going to have to leave shortly to speak so I apologise in advance for that.  I have some brief questions because many of the points have been made and there is no point repeating them.<\/p> <p>  My first question relates to the targets for year 1 of the strategy.  Is it possible to get a county-by-county breakdown?  I appreciate the Minister might not have that information to hand, but can we get it forwarded to the committee?  Can we get the figures for housing assistance payment tenancies?  How many of these are new tenancies?  How many are recycled and involve people coming from existing rent supplement schemes?  How many are actually coming off the list or coming from homeless or potentially homeless scenarios?<\/p> <p>  I have some other questions relating to the homeless situation.  Many people who are experiencing homelessness have highlighted the immediate measures we could take.  An important step is to decide the immediate measures we can take.  One possibility is raising rent supplement limits.  I do not believe we should do that in isolation - that would be a disaster in terms of rents increasing for everyone.  However, it could be linked to rent certainty.  What is the Minister's opinion on raising rent supplement along with implementing rent certainty?  We need some immediate measures in this area.<\/p> <p>  I have made a point previously about rural homelessness.  It is very different to homelessness in an urban area.  For example, in my constituency there is a good mix between urban and rural because it includes Carlow and Kilkenny.<\/p><p>Many people experiencing homelessness in a rural area cannot take up the option of emergency accommodation because it is so far from where their children are at school or if they have part-time work they cannot travel.  Has anything been done in the Department to address that specifically because many small villages and towns do not have hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation?  For example, in Kilkenny there are three facilities that provide emergency accommodation but someone who is homeless in Urlingford or Callan is a 15 or 20-minute drive away.<\/p><p> The Minister mentioned private property in his statement.  We all know of properties in our towns, villages and cities that have been empty for ten, 15 or 20 years.  I know property rights are an issue but surely given that there is such a housing crisis we should be considering how to acquire those properties, refurbish and use them.  The Minister also spoke about large developments of social housing but there are empty houses all around the country that we could consider taking over.  There must be something we can do despite the property rights because not only is it bad for every estate to have empty houses because that leads to anti-social behaviour but it would be better for everyone if someone lived there.  That would also help to address the housing and homelessness crisis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#U00600","speaker":"1266","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Funchion's last question on property rights, that touches on Article 43.

Choice-based letting should be rolled out across the country.  Let me just say that out straight.  It may need to be tweaked a little or whatever - I am open to that.  It is a good policy.  When people are written to by local authorities and they do not engage, I do not know what local authorities are meant to do.  There has to be some form of responsibility for re-engaging.

I agree with the Central Bank rules.  They may need to be tweaked and definitely needed to be monitored but, in general, they are correct because the price of houses cannot rise to &euro;500,000 and we cannot have people worrying about how they will pay for such houses over 30 years.<\/p> <p>  We cannot go back to a boom-and-bust situation where developers and builders entered the market and people ended up with large mortgages which they were unable to pay.  That leads to social issues, such as estates not being finished, and developers and builders owing the State millions, if not billions, of euro which the chances of recovering are very low.  We cannot go back to that and allow the people who engaged in such activity to re-enter the market.  We cannot allow profit margins to be with the developers and builders.  I acknowledge that they have to make a profit, but we should act on behalf of those who need housing.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Wallace asked about the local authority process.  I was very taken by the question.  I have changed the system.  I ask the Deputy to revert to his local authority and ask it why it is taking so long.  I presume the Deputy has read the report on all the projects in Wexford.  They include: St. Aidan's Road in Wexford town, comprising 14 units; Barrystown in Wellingtonbridge, comprising 16 units; Ballyowen in Gorey, comprising nine units; Killeens, comprising ten units; Cherryorchard in Enniscorthy comprising eight units; and others.  They are all small projects and there is no reason in the world for them not to proceed as quickly as possible.  They have all been sanctioned.<\/p> <p>  Committee members may not be fully aware that I changed the process by which approval for small projects is granted.  Virtually all of the projects I mentioned would come under that process.  Smaller projects previously had to engage in a four-stage process with the Department, but there is now only one stage for projects comprising fewer than 20 units.  Such action was necessary.<\/p> <p>  I ask Deputy Wallace to allow me to finish because he asked many questions.  Local authorities have the capacity to engage in that process.  There is an information gap or misinformation about what is happening.  The capacity of local authorities to take control through a one-step process for small projects is in place.  I instigated and demanded the process because I agreed that the process needed to be speeded up.<\/p> <p>  There are requirements for planning, design and all of that.  Local authorities have the capacity to engage with such projects but very few, if any, take up the chance of engaging with smaller projects through that process.  That is a question the committee may want to address.  The process has been in place for a while, but local authorities have not engaged.  It is something which will be very fruitful into the future.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct about social housing percentages.  Of course the figure of 9% has to increase, and that is why we have put in place a new process.  In regard to the vacant site levy, I disagree with the Deputy.  Local authorities are actively planning for how they are going to use the process and are very happy with it.  I speak as a person who wanted to do a lot more, but I have already outlined how I was prevented from being as ambitious as I wanted to be.<\/p><p> On the issue of funding, it is not for me to suggest, but perhaps the committee should bring in the outgoing or incoming Minister for Finance to discuss housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#X00500","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":112,"content":"<p>To be helpful to the Minister, depending on the timing, that is our intention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":113,"content":"<p>That would give us a fuller picture.

The Minister said his Department cannot control all the factors affecting housing, which I understand.  Deputy Funchion spoke about rent supplement.  I represent the people of Waterford city and county.  The rent supplement in Waterford is &euro;520.  That is one of the issues because people cannot rent houses in the area for less than &euro;650 or &euro;700.  There will need to be joined-up thinking involving both Departments.<\/p> <p>  The chief executive of Roscommon County Council appeared before the committee on Tuesday.  He pointed out that local authorities are not developers.  His submission stated, \"Even if we had the adequate resource to build on our lands, the regulations stipulate that we can only build 10-15% for social housing.\"  I am very concerned about that because the Department is putting most of its eggs into on basket in terms of the local authorities supplying housing and the chief executive of Roscommon County Council stated, on behalf of the County and City Management Association, that they can only build 10% to 15% for social housing.  As a short-term fix, does the Minister see merit in putting extensions on existing social houses within local authority stock in order to meet family demands as opposed to waiting two years to move them into other houses?  I refer to extending houses that are not for people with health-specific problems.  That should definitely be considered because it would be a quicker fix.<\/p> <p>  I feel we missed an opportunity to support social housing through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.

It is said the construction industry will only deliver 50% of what it needs to deliver, so what is being done to address that?  Changes are proposed to Part V from 20% social and affordable housing, with the opportunity for local authorities to get money instead, to a new regime of 10%.  At a personal level, I would be disappointed if it does not remain at 20%, with that 20% perhaps being social housing.  Does the Minister believe the 20% was a barrier to delivering housing?  If so, are we seeing any improvements?<\/p><p> The Minister talked about the need for local authorities to be incentivised to provide land.  How might that work and can the Minister share his thoughts with us to help us with our future work?  The Minister highlighted the issue of the supply of affordable housing.  Given people are paying such high rents, they are not able to save for deposits.  What does the Minister see as a solution to this problem?<\/p><p> The Minister said any input cost reduction must go to homeowners, and I absolutely agree with him on that.

Will there ever be a solution to that issue?<\/p><p> What plans has the Minister to address the issue of the powers of the Private Residential Tenancies Board when a property is sold?  Can anything be done in that area?<\/p><p> The Minister referred to the timelag of two and a half years but he also talked about buying and leasing during that lag period.

The 10% to 15% target for the local authorities in regard to social housing is an area that has to be reconsidered.  No one is arguing for 100% large estate builds but there is a problem if the local authorities are heavily involved in building that 10% to 15%, and I think this should be looked on as a limit.<\/p> <p>  I want to give the Minister my personal thoughts on this and get his view.  The local authorities entering into the market, buying houses on an ever greater scale, even at this moment are beginning to create a distortion in that part of the market in which they are trying to buy.  I have been contacted by people who, on a number of occasions, have lost out to the local authority - these would be people who were trying to buy at a particular price point.  It is a supply-side issue.  We need to build, and I know that, but if the local authorities enter too much on the buying side, there is a problem, so that balance needs to be looked at.<\/p> <p>  I am not looking to have a row with the Minister.  I have met him on many occasions and respect him.  However, as a former councillor who has voted for every single Part VIII that came before my council, I do not like terminology that refers to, in particular, hypocrisy on the part of public representatives who make a decision for what they believe to be legitimate reasons, even if the Minister said this only refers to some of them.<\/p><p>A councillor can be 100% in favour of the principle, and probably every elected representative is, and still have a right as a public representative to examine any issue that comes before him or her and make a decision. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#AA00200","speaker":"1310","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I accept that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#BB00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":150,"content":"<p>Where council officials come back with a proposal that an elected representative examines and genuinely decides he or she cannot support, that does not mean that he or she is hypocritical.

I would never want to fight with Deputy Brophy either.  I stand over what I said.  I was very conditional in what I said.  I did not say it was everyone.  I respect that everyone has a choice to make in every individual situation.  This is not confined to local authorities.  It might be more prevalent in places other than in local authorities.  I have found in the overwhelming majority of cases that councillors have been of the Deputy's view when he was a member of a local authority.  I know of many, dare I say it, brave councillors who would face a fairly significant crowd and stand by their principle and I know of many who did that recently, and I truly respect them.  It would be wrong of me to say that I have not experienced the other case as well where people have lectured or waxed lyrical about the need for housing in a certain area and demanded such provision and then, when a proposal was put forward, had the opposite opinion.  I am not talking about a generic case of someone opposing something because they believe in it and still demanding social housing.  That is one thing, and that is fine, but where an elected representative says that social housing is needed in a certain area, they get a page spread about that in their local newspaper, and when a proposal is made two weeks or one month later, they oppose it.  That is contradictory whatever way one looks at it.  I accept these are all individual cases.  I am not talking generally.  I am not talking about everyone.  In the majority of cases this does not happen, but it does happen on occasion and there is no point in saying that it does not.<\/p> <p>  I very much take the Deputy Brophy's point regarding local authorities entering the market.  A few members, including Deputy Brendan Ryan, mentioned this.  To be fair to them, local authorities do not enter the market in many different areas.  For instance, they do not enter where first-time buyers are actively seeking to buy and so on.<\/p><p>If they find out it is a first-time buyer, they generally pull out.  There is a balancing act here and the Deputy knows what it is.  We will not have the supply coming on stream for a couple of years so we need to supply houses so they need to use their judgment there.  There is an element of trust in respect of local authorities using their judgment to go out and get houses but I take all the points that have been made.  It is a well-made point because it is obviously pushing it up on others but the guidelines around how to do involve not hitting first-time buyers, actively observing the area and ensuring they do that.<\/p><p> The question of the 10% to 15% is one for my successor, whoever he or she may be.  It might be the Deputy.  It could be anyone.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#BB01100","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I do not think so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#CC00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":161,"content":"<p>There has been much commentary about rapid builds.  We have plans for 500 of these.  A lot of learning was accrued from the first set of them but they are excellent houses and the fastest ever built.  To be frank, one pays for time.  Another tender is out at the moment and I believe it will create other economies and learnings that will ensure that there are even more savings.  I understand there is greater competition this time around.  Last time around, there was only one respondent.  It was a case of either do it or do not do it.  As we are sitting here, 22 families are viewing the houses they have been allocated today.  We all talk about the need to do this.  In fairness, there are 22 families with children viewing the houses today.  That is the pendulum.  I believe that will certainly work its way through and that it is a very progressive thing to do.<\/p> <p>  In respect of Deputy Butler's question on rent supplement, if we are to have a housing Minister, there is an issue relating to the protocol, the 7,670 people who came in through the upfills and the 2,030 people through the threshold who received an increase when they went to their community welfare officer.  This debate is one we have had many times.  I have heard varying views on it today.  Does one chase the landlord, do something similar to the Central Bank rules on housing or leave it like that?  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to what the chief executive of County and City Management Association said.  He is right because it is not just social housing.  It involves the approved housing bodies doing their work and leasing but it also involves the private sector so it is a pie mix.  <\/p> <p>  Local authorities have some discretion when it comes to funding to extend houses.  Perhaps my successor should look at a specific scheme which will keep people in their houses that is just dedicated to extending houses.  I would take that as another suggestion.  <\/p> <p>  When the Minister for Finance appears before the committee, he will deal with the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  The Deputy's last question concerned local authorities.  Deputy Wallace was going to jump in and build them.

Members should trust me when I say that we push them all the time to deliver units as quickly as possible.  There was a major issue when I took over this Department.

Earlier, I spoke about the various pieces of the jigsaw and the range of components.  It is important if one can create a process whereby, whoever is in charge in the future, will ensure all the components are aligned and facing in the same direction.  Within our domain, we have done our lever, for want of a better phrase.<\/p> <p>  The construction industry question relates to the land and costs issues which I spoke about earlier.

I did not agree with that and stopped it.  I also changed it so that now the developer has to hand over an actual house rather than a site.

I strongly recommend that it be done as part of the recommendations from the committee.  We need to consider in a constructive way how land is being managed or made available for social housing.  Effectively, we need an asset management system nationwide relating to housing and how houses are managed.  We need to look at Article 43 in an open way.  I repeat that neither I nor anybody here has all the answers, but it is worth discussing.  I absolutely believe that a housing Minister would be a good idea if he or she has all the levers I have spoken about <i>ad nauseam<\/i>in here; if he or she does not, frankly, it would amount to pure tokenism.<\/p><p>I will run through a few other issues.  Choice-based lettings should be brought in nationally for all local authorities.  There should be a national system.  The example in Cork is excellent, and I complimented the two individuals who ran it, but we should introduce the process nationally.  It is evidence-based and a good policy.  We have started a process where houses are not just voids but are derelict.  That should be concluded, as it would bring back some more stock.  Local authorities must take some ownership and embrace the changes brought about in building small numbers of units across the country.  They have the capacity through one step to do this.  The census will help local authorities in dealing with vacant houses across the country that are not being used.  There are a number of relevant tax schemes, including the home renovation scheme and the housing assistance payment, or rental accommodation scheme tax breaks.  A scheme using such processes would be a progressive step.<\/p><p>The current housing issue is very difficult and I absolutely believe we must consider how to cut the cost of building.  This relates to both the State side, which must lead, and also the developer, material and builder side.  It should be across the board, as it is a real issue, particularly given the conditioning that exists because of Central Bank rules, with which I agree.  There is a real issue from a political perspective in ensuring that everybody from the body politic can work together from local authority level up to here in the provision of both private and social housing.  In that sense, local authorities in particular will have to work on the policies and help to ensure their implementation to a greater degree.<\/p><p>This committee should make some recommendations on the future role of NAMA.  The members will be delighted to hear me say that.  We must accept where NAMA came from and the boundaries of its commercial mandate.  It was set up when the Chairman's party was in government.<\/p><p>Certainly there are assets, knowledge and so on that need to be utilised.  That needs to happen.  A number of leasing schemes that have been brought forward through my Department regarding the involvement of private investment need to be concluded.<\/p><p> The issue of credit unions has not been raised as I hoped it would be.  I met with the credit unions and I would love to see them engaged.  Let me just nail one myth: I am not stopping it.  They have to get sign-off from the regulator.  When they get sign-off from the regulator, they can come back and there will be full engagement with whoever my successor is, I presume.  That needs to happen.<\/p><p> I believe the housing needs assessment, which will state how many people are in need of housing and will happen year-on-year, is needed to manage the process and the decision-making into the future because we are shooting in the dark.  We have the 2013 figures and then we have the 2015 figures, but nobody knows if the latter are accurate or not because they are taken from local authorities and for all the reasons I outlined earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#EE00100","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and my colleagues.

We have prepared an opening statement and have also submitted a body of material which we thought might be of assistance to the committee.

I am joined by Mr. John O'Connor, chief executive officer, and Mr. David Silke, our director, who will assist in answering any questions members may wish to pose.<\/p> <p>  The Housing Agency was founded in 2010 and our vision is to enable everyone to live in good-quality, affordable homes in sustainable communities.  The agency provides a wide level of expert advice, support, research and training activities for local authorities, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, approved housing bodies, the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and many other public and private sector organisations.  Together with its research, the many activities in which it is involved provide the agency with a unique vantage point from which to be able to offer this committee advice and observations on current housing issues in Ireland and how to make progress towards improving the situation.  We have taken what the committee has asked us to do very seriously.  In the material submitted, we have specifically identified a series of issues and what we see as potential solutions for members to consider.<\/p> <p>  Housing in Ireland consists of many parts and successful policies and actions must be co-ordinated across all of those parts.  If we have one message for this committee today, it is that there is no single solution that will work in isolation.  All of the parts must be understood by all of the actors and all actions must take account of their effect on other parts.  We urge the committee to ensure that decisions on priorities in terms of spending, sequence and action take account of the whole sector and to be aware of the potential for one to affect the other.<\/p> <p>  We must remind ourselves that a house is many things, ranging from deeply personal and emotional issues that surround the word \"home\", to practical considerations of a house as a financial asset that involves, for example, complex building and planning regulations.<\/p><p>We adhere to and promote the reality that shelter is a human right while at the same time one's address is often a social signal of one's status.  We draw attention to the fact that the cost of housing is the single biggest factor that determines the consumer price index and, therefore, is the single biggest driver of wage inflation in Ireland.  The house is also the biggest financial deal that most people ever make and that our mortgage or rent repayment are probably our single biggest household payment every month.  That means that nobody is neutral about housing.<\/p><p> We have a sector that is full of contradictions.  For example, the couple who enjoy the increasing value of their home in a rising market will, at the same time, rue the fact that their children cannot afford their own new home.  The Department of Finance is likely to gain revenue from increases in house prices and house building while the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will view the same increase as lost international competitiveness.  All these factors need to be part of the committee's considerations in trying to make plans for the future of our housing in Ireland.<\/p><p> To provide a background and to remind ourselves of the context, we need to bear in mind that we are looking at a wide and rapidly changing range of households and their needs in Ireland.  The biggest single thing the agency says at every opportunity it gets is that we have to be very careful about not carrying over habits of thinking from the past out into the future.  The future is going to be dramatically different.  For example, many people are very surprised to learn that Irish national home ownership peaked 25 years ago at 80% and it has fallen every year since then.  Now 70% of housing is owner-occupied and 30% is in rental.  In Dublin, tenure is divided equally between ownership and rental.  These trends are consistent with international trends.  Ireland is becoming a normal European economy.<\/p><p> The rental housing consists of both private rental, one third of which receives State support, and social rental housing.  These changes can be explained in part because we have gone through significant demographic changes in the past 40 years with a rapid reduction in household size.  There is an average of only 2.7 people per household.  The reality is that 75% - three quarters - of the housing requirement for the country is for households of three persons or fewer.  All the recent publications of the agency ask people to draw attention to the dramatically different types of houses that will be needed into the future, not just the numbers.<\/p><p> It is critical that the work of the committee is based on the need of these new and emerging types of tenure and the types of house.  We must avoid the bitter recent experience of other countries such as Spain and Germany where attempts to recover from housing crises were stymied by the realisation, which came too late, that they had built houses for sale when the new markets mainly wanted homes built to rent.  We must not make that mistake.<\/p><p> Actions to increase supply must maintain a focus on providing the right types of accommodation while also making housing affordable to buy or to rent.  We say to the committee and anybody who will listen that affordability is the real challenge.  There is no point in us building houses for people concentrating on supply if house supplies cannot be afforded.  That would be a tragedy.<\/p><p> The committee needs to be mindful that a third of the population will need to get some level of State support.  To clarify, that does not mean a third of all housing in the future will be local authority housing.  It is that a third of our housing will need some level of support and there are sliding scales of that requirement.  It is a very nuanced field.  We need to ensure the majority of households can afford housing from their own resources while also ensuring the State can provide the necessary supports for that third of the population that require them.<\/p><p> The committee invited the agency to identify how the obstacles that are impeding progress on housing can be surmounted as well as the specific actions that need to be taken to achieve urgent implementation of those measures.  On that matter, the Housing Agency wishes to remind the committee of the need to ensure the right issues are addressed in the right priority; specifically, that the biggest priority is that because Ireland has no overall plan, priorities or focus for housing, there is a very real danger that attention will focus excessively on short-term issues at the expense of long-term progress.<\/p><p> More important, we advise that all sections of housing are deeply interconnected.  For example, a crisis in market housing, even in Aylesbury Road, is quickly transferred into pressure on the private rental sector which, as we have heard this morning, increases pressure on social housing.  Therefore, solutions to homelessness will only emerge when the workings of all housing is stabilised and improved.  The big message for us all is that homelessness and rough sleeping are the symptoms.  We need to address the deep causes that drive people into those circumstances.<\/p><p>Addressing the wrong priorities, in the wrong sequence, will condemn Ireland to an unending process of catch-up and, worse, to sowing the seeds of the next housing crisis.  For instance, table one in my presentation shows the overall numbers of types of households in Ireland indicating that homelessness, which comprises people who are living in emergency accommodation or sleeping rough, accounts for some 3,400 households - a figure which is the subject of vigorous debate &ndash; while more than 200,000 households are in mortgage arrears.  On top of that there are more than 200,000 homes lying vacant.  These are big figures.  We want to ensure the committee's priorities recognise that.  These examples illustrate that while homelessness is indeed an acute problem, our priorities also need to be directed towards issues that affect nearly 500,000 households and 500,000 properties.<\/p><p> We have supplied the committee with material that sets out the agency&rsquo;s opinions on a wide range of issues and how the problems might be overcome.  We are here to answer questions about that.  I ask that members look at the further table which illustrates what the Housing Agency does.  The agency has only been in existence since 2010.  In some ways we are a standing symptom of what is going on in Ireland in housing - that there is a huge amount of work taking place across a very wide range of issues of which many people are unaware.  We have a wonderful chief executive in Mr. David Silke.  The agency is involved in wide ranging issues such as repairs to homes affected by pyrite, dealing with agencies that have tranches of property being transferred, unfinished housing estates, supporting the introduction of the housing assistance payment, HAP, and keeping statistics and carrying out research.  It is a huge field and covers a wide range of activities, which is the reason we are able to share with the committee the type of advice and opinions that may be of assistance to it.  We have summarised in simple form our very high level description of what we see as being the obstacles, the solutions and the actions.  We are not suggesting that the obstacles are not the ones that people are talking about but that it is the lack of an overall plan, the lack of priorities and the lack of focus that are the real issues.  That is what we would like to discuss with the committee this afternoon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#TT00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Skehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I thank  Mr. Skehan.

It must be put on the table that affordability is key to all our efforts going forward and we all must accept that it is too expensive.  Second, the cost of housing is made up of a number of elements, all of which need to be separately examined.  We hope to bring to the attention of the committee and others the work the agency is doing to examine how to value engineer down the various components.  We take our inspiration from the electronics sector and people like Michael Dell who brought the cost of computers down from &euro;5,000 to &euro;4,000 to &euro;1,000 to &euro;500 a unit.<\/p><p>We think the same potential exists for the housing sector by examining the position in respect of things such as land.  In the rest of Europe, land makes up 10% to 15% of the cost of a house.  The figure is many times that in Ireland.  We can examine elements to do with expectations of profit and the financing of the sector.  As I heard Deputy Wallace say this morning, the financing costs of our deals are exorbitant and not affordable by many traditional developers.<\/p><p> One of the big issues, and this is a new thing for people to think about in Ireland, is scale.  I also heard Deputy Wallace outline the fact there are many fine builders of a small scale all over Ireland but the reality is that the smaller the scale, the less easy it is to achieve economies of off-site construction and large scale purchasing.  One of the main things we are saying is that for public and many other types of housing, with a transition to building at scale - I am talking about building in units of 500 at a go - one starts to get dramatic decreases in costs of things such as labour and mobilisation of skills and skilled labour.  Those are the two big things, namely, land and scale, if I wanted to give the committee a simple one.<\/p><p> I cannot see it in front of me but in terms of detail, we have prepared a table of measures.  Again, we have been listening to the questions the committee has been asking people during the week and we have identified 12 short and medium-term actions - really quick ones - that would increase and accelerate housing provision.  We will leave those with the committee also today.  However, on cost, there is no one thing.  It is engineering down all of them, but scale is the big one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#VV00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Skehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>On the issue of scale, I realise it costs a great deal more to build ten houses per unit than to build 100, but we must also take on board the fact that the guy who builds 100 wants a higher profit per unit than the guy who is building ten.

The other part of that though are the people Deputy Wallace just mentioned such as the land bankers.  The land bankers themselves are seeking to recover land costs which were incurred at a period when people were excessively optimistic, to put it charitably.  Many people in the sector must understand that that particular component of the price - the land price paid in 2004 - will never be repaid.  They will never get that money back, in particular.

I do not mean plans with details of the exact type of house but rather what is needed to get the necessary social mix and facilities in place.  We could deliver big projects.

This seems to have become a theme in recent days.  If we continue to look at small-scale social housing projects we are never going to deal with the housing crisis.  That must be grasped and accepted by everyone.  The idea that we can build ten houses here, 20 houses there and 30 elsewhere makes no sense.  We are not going to house 100,000 families that way.  We can argue about the scale of the waiting lists, as the Minister has done today, but there are large numbers of people who are not on the waiting list and who would like to get on it.  There are bus workers in my constituency whose income is too high for the list.  Let us suppose 100,000 is a representative figure for now.<\/p> <p>  I wish to take up this demonisation of social housing.  I am not saying it is on the part of the Housing Agency but it is a general theme that has come up.  Who says we cannot have decent communities made up of a few hundred houses?  It seems to be a demonisation of people.  We need to deal with poverty.  People have been made poor in recent years by austerity and many other things.  I was brought up in a housing estate of 500 houses, but almost everyone had a job and that was different.  The way around this is either to increase eligibility for social housing and have a greater mix of people, some of whom would be working.  That would give higher rents to the local authorities or housing agencies.  I know many people who would go for that.  Another thing we need to look at is affordable housing.  The private sector is not going to build affordable houses.  Many workers are paying &euro;1,400, &euro;1,500 or &euro;2,000 rent per month and they would gladly take an affordable house.  I do not agree with the constant view proffered that we must only have small-scale.  We cannot deal with the problem that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#XX00400","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I wish to take that question first, because it is an interesting question.

The Deputy is right, we need a mix of housing for people of different income levels and affordable housing across the board.  We also need to build on the small sites.  The land mapping shows several large sites and if we want to meet the targets, we have to build on those and provide housing for a range of income groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#XX00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Skehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":202,"content":"<p>The committee needs answers about the cost of houses.

We need a breakdown of the position in this regard and in respect of the cost of an average private home.  Instead of building temporary houses - modular or rapid build, whatever they are called - which cost &euro;150,000 on average but much more in Dublin, would it not make more sense to reduce the cost of building?

The idea of setting out the parameters, as it does, validates the Housing Agency in the first instance.  It is really strategically important and we will not grapple with the issue unless we do as it does.  Now I am agreeing with the witnesses.<\/p> <p>  The points about changing family size and the stock come up a lot.  The demographics of the population and how we use empty stock and stock occupied by ageing citizens, and the interconnection between these elements, comes up.  There are many older citizens who would happily downsize.  Any of us would aspire to the development of more communal older citizen accommodation, which is independent but with a bit of support, as is the case with group housing.  However, it is not in the Irish culture to deliver that.  If we were to do so, it would free up a great deal of other stock that growing families could occupy.  Does the Housing Agency have any specific ideas or initiatives to encourage people out of accommodation where they are over-accommodated?  Examining the position in the context of big or small developments is to engage in a false debate.  Many of the big developments have been riddled with the greatest social problems and these have had knock-on effects.  It is a question of lack of social mix and scale.<\/p><p>There is a difference between cities and areas outside of cities in terms of what is possible.  For example, and I do not know if the Housing Agency has done any work on it, small scale works very well in rural areas.  My constituency is in Dublin but has huge rural parts.  We would have small pockets of land where traditionally people came together collectively - we could call it a sort of a mini-co-operative.  In some instances the council provided a site on a cheap basis and five or ten families got together and built collectively.  They got the economies of scale more than they would have for one-off houses.  Small is better.  Has the agency done much on that and is there anything to be explored?  The local authorities would find it easier to deal with big projects; it is in some ways the lazy approach.  I know there is an economy of scale but it can bring a lot of problems if it is not done properly.  They are just some aspects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#YY00500","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Daly for her kind words about the role of the agency.  We have only been here since 2010 and are trying to put ourselves in a central position so there is one source of objective data and ideas that does not have skin in the game.  With great gratitude to the Department, we have been told to go off and be more independent, more like the EPA and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and to tell the Department things it needs to hear even if it does not want to hear them.  We are going to continue to do that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's question allows me to answer another which I neglected to follow through on with Deputy Wallace.  When we talk about scale, it is not necessarily about building 500 units all in the same place.  For instance, going back to Deputy Coppinger's figure of 100,000 units in the next ten years, we as Ireland Inc. might go to the market for ten years' worth of roofing tiles, windows, doors and radiators, and buy a range of them so that the architects who are designing 50 units here and five there have a variety available to them.  Ireland Inc. would then have bought at scale, using procurement as a weapon in our favour instead of a scourge on our backs.  That is one of the ways in which scale could operate.  It is certainly relevant to Deputy Wallace's point that our needs can often be met by developments of three, five and 35 units, especially outside Dublin.  We have to remember that we have a whole country to deal with here.<\/p> <p>  To go back to Deputy Daly's point, we not only have vacant houses but under-utilised houses.  There are 1,500 small towns and villages in Ireland.  If we challenged each of those to bring forward four new houses every year that would be 6,000 a year which, as Mr. O'Connor said, would both bring villages back to life and allow us to reach those very onerous targets very quickly.  We would also be spreading the benefit out and using the installed houses and the streets, sewers, pubs and shops that surround them.  We would achieve many goals at the same time.  All that comes from regarding housing not as a building exercise but in terms of managing our housing stock, part of which is building, part of which is renewing and part of which is bringing back into use.  <\/p> <p>  The last point was about ageing.  Mr. O'Connor will talk about this.  The Deputy is absolutely right about trying to free up existing stock.  We have to learn from our neighbours in Britain and see the disaster that was the poll tax, the disaster that was trying to get older people to leave their homes.  Sticks do not work; we have to use honey and carrots to get people out.  Exactly as the Deputy said, we have to give them something that is so attractive that they would want to leave their houses for something better in the same area with the same parish priest and pharmacy that they have been used to.  That is the way forward to increase the yield out of what we have.  It is about managing as much as building.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#ZZ00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Skehan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":208,"content":"<p>On Deputy Daly's point about the age profile and so forth, we had the Minister, Deputy Kelly, in this morning and he referred to housing construction as a pipeline that was being ramped up over a number of years.

I am concerned about using large-scale developments comprising 300 or 400 houses to solve the problem.  In various local authority areas throughout the country there is an over-concentration on what could be called socially deprived areas.  Large developments might make for good economics but they do not make for good social cohesion.  We all deal regularly with the issues arising from such an approach.<\/p> <p>  One of the contributing factors has been that since the local authorities slowed down or stopped direct building, there seems to be a concentration of people who fit into a particular category with the local authorities, while others are catered for by voluntary housing agencies.  The suggestion has been made by local authority members that cherry-picking takes place.  An over-concentration of social deprivation in one area is lethal.  It does not work and I would strongly advise against it.  The evidence seems to suggest that in the region of 40 houses would have an impact.<\/p> <p>  Economies of scale can be achieved in the same way, as the Chairman said.  Housing can be bought or ordered in bulk over a period.  A number of builders in the country specialised in building housing in several locations at the same time and using the same model and dimensions, such as roof trusses and so on.  They engaged in such work for many years, were very successful and built very good houses.  The same can be done today.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the quality of housing.  For example, the design of duplex houses needs to be done very carefully, such as in the case of external stairways.  Older people or children may be blown off such stairways in a gale.  We have all seen examples during wintertime where ice caused people to slip.  The worst element of design is having an entrance to somebody else's house under a stairs.  It is a classic example of maximisation in terms of economics, but it is not a good approach to living conditions or a good place to put people.  We should never try to do that because we are penalising people in a way that makes it impossible for them to live, exist and have a reasonable quality of life.  I strongly urge that we do not go down that road.<\/p> <p>  We have to build houses.  Economies of scale can be achieved in the way that Mr. Skehan has mentioned, but I strongly advise that we avoid the creation of ghettos.

There is not necessarily a contradiction between the two positions.  Deputy Coppinger is absolutely correct that our vision of social housing as being something that is solely for poor people - if I am not misquoting her - is something that we have to move away from.  We have to start to understand that, exactly as we and our publication have said, one third of our population will need some form of support and the support will be graduated.  The wonderful thing about something like the housing assistance payment is that it now allows people, like the bus driver mentioned by Deputy Coppinger or a trainee garda or young nurse, to live in a place.  There are a whole range of people who are in full employment who need to have some form of support.  That is the first issue.<\/p> <p>  The second issue is the type of mixture we are talking about.  Deputy Durkan is dead right to haul me up on it.  If I gave a mistaken impression that I am talking about building slabs of 500 semi-detached houses for local authority consumption, the Deputy is absolutely right - there is no future in that.  What there is a future for is developments, perhaps 500 at a time, of which 50 are for a local authority, another 50 are for housing for the aged, and another 50 for very expensive housing, and that they are all going ahead at the same time.  That is the idea.  The points the Deputy has made are absolutely correct and we have to learn from them.  We will have to have standards that leave things such as duplexes in the past.  There should be completely new types of mix because, as we are saying to the committee, there will be mixtures of type - small, medium and large - and of tenure - owned by the State, owned by AHBs and owned privately - all mixed up together.  It is a completely different type of project.  We have not even really started doing it.  <\/p> <p>  The last thing is that we have them among us.  We can go down to places like Cherrywood, which is already under way, where we have exactly those types of mix.

From a lot of my dealings with people trying to qualify for the scheme, I am aware that there are huge difficulties around red tape, paperwork and people being told that their houses are too big.  It could be a couple whose family have grown up and moved on, who live in a three-bed house and have been told they cannot qualify for the scheme because of that, which makes absolutely no sense.  What is Mr. Skehan's opinion on that?  A lot of people who could qualify are falling through the cracks because of really stupid things like that.  It is not as if they are living in a mansion.<\/p> <p>  The recommendation in the document for State support to households that do not qualify for social housing support is a good idea, but what we really need to do is to challenge the banks when people have mortgage difficulties and ensure they are negotiating with them and sitting down with them, because a lot of the problem is that sometimes the banks will not talk to people.  I deal with people on a regular basis who are willing to pay, in many cases, a considerable amount of the mortgage.  It is a good suggestion but we need to be careful that we do not let the banks off the hook in that regard.  Mortgage-to-rent needs to be looked at because an awful lot of people who are going onto the housing list now are going on it because of repossession, and it is increasing homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#BBB01000","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising that issue about which we feel passionately.

I need to be careful about what I say, but the Central Bank and the Department of Finance would be focusing on it from the banks' point of view.

It is managing our stock in a smarter way.  That is the first point.  Managing does not only mean providing houses but also controlling their price.  We as a nation must set targets for ourselves as to what constitutes an affordable house which is a reasonable multiplier of the disposable income of households.  We must bring about a situation where our development sector builds to price and not one where it has all of us scrabbling around trying to bring whatever money we have up to whatever prices it sets for us.

We welcome this opportunity.  The Chairman introduced my colleagues, Dr. McManus and Ms Gallagher.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Council for Social Housing is the national federation of approved housing bodies.  We have 270 members which are spread throughout the country.  We provide over 30,000 homes and related supports in about 500 communities in urban and rural areas.  We provide a range of housing from what is termed general needs to what would be considered specialist needs, namely, that involving the elderly, the homeless and people with learning disabilities.  We have grown over the past 20 years with the aid of Government funding.  We are actively engaged as one of the pillars of the Social Housing Strategy 2020 and try to work with the Department and other bodies to ensure this is implemented.  We are actively engaged with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive in terms of participation on the consultative forum and in the implementation and advisory group, which is trying to inform and advise on responses to homelessness in the city.  <\/p> <p>  There is a need to reference where we are and where we were.  In 2009, the approved housing sector produced over 2,000 new types of social housing homes nationally.  This was in a context where about &euro;400 million was made available for the sector around 2008.  In 2013, that funding had been reduced to about &euro;40 million so we have had to operate in a very constrained context over the past number of years.  Capital funding spend for social housing in 2008 was about &euro;1.4 billion.  In 2014, it was reduced to about &euro;270 million.<\/p><p>There has been a significant change for us to adjust to this different financial context.  Up to 2011, we were reliant on 100% capital funding from the State to acquire or design and build.  Since then, we have had to engage in different types of business and gear up for it through engaging with the private sector, developers, financiers, receivers and NAMA to enable the provision of new types of housing units.  The sector has delivered nearly 2,000 NAMA-controlled units via leasing options, acquisition and the fitting out of distressed assets.<\/p><p> The funding context in which we operated previously was a 100% grant regime.  The regime is now fundamentally altered to a maximum of 30% construction or acquisition costs funding from the State with the rest borrowed from the Housing Finance Agency or from banks to enable acquisition, design and build.  We are into a different business model of development.  It is a significant change for us but we are not afraid of it.  However, in similar northern European countries, such as Holland, Britain, Germany and France, the transition from 100% capital funding to primarily private funding happened over a ten to 20-year period.  We have been expected to adjust to this in a five-year timeframe.  That is the context with which we are currently grappling.<\/p><p> Up to 9% of the housing stock in Ireland is social housing.  We consider that far too small.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, has commented on this in different reports over the years and has recommended 200,000 social housing units should be available to meet social housing need.  We endorse that, believing social housing should account for 17% of national housing provision.  It will obviously vary from region to region, area to area, based on social housing need.  In its recent reports, NESC stated one third of people in need of housing will be unable to afford it from their own resources.  Most people aspire to home ownership, but the reality is that there is a discordance between the aspiration to and the affordability of home ownership.  That is where social housing becomes a central platform and an important one.  Our fundamental message is that its provision needs to be increased.<\/p><p> One of the policy options in Social Housing Strategy 2020, with which we are linked, is the development of the affordable or cost-rental housing model.  We believe this would meet the needs of people who are starting off, such as teachers or nurses who are on lowish incomes, but cannot get a mortgage.  We support that type of provision where they would be able to rent at a reduced market rate and would live in mixed tenure schemes of social and affordable housing.  We see that as being important for the way ahead.<\/p><p> In the area of homelessness, the maintenance of adequate rent allowance for people is critical.  An inadequate allowance is the main driver of people becoming homeless in the Dublin area because of the unaffordability factor.  The housing assistance payment, HAP, a key point of the social housing strategy, will not be cost neutral.  It needs to be aligned with market rents and there needs to be security of tenure for people in that option.  One can see from the homeless figures that those families presenting have mainly come about because of the lack of affordability.  It is a key element of consideration for the future.<\/p><p> We provide high levels of housing support and are mainstream housing providers.  Our dedicated purpose is to provide housing, which we believe we do reasonably well.  We have to grapple with a more complex operating environment with regulation, funding and finance, however.  Some of the developments we have tried to undertake over the past several years, particularly with some of the NAMA schemes, have been stymied by planning, technical and financial issues.  They are not the impediments but the issues we have to deal with to get developments across the line.<\/p><p> In 2015, the sector provided 1,300 new units of accommodation via acquisitions and design and build.  It is not always recognised publicly that we have reached that level of new provision.  It is important that we rise to the challenge of delivery and enhance that.<\/p><p>Our paper represents some of the issues we think could make that easier for us.<\/p><p> One of the key issues, referenced clearly in the submission we made, is the assembly of suitable sites for housing.  There was a low-cost subsidised sites programme administered by local authorities in the 1980s and 1990s.  That was absolutely beneficial to the establishment of the sector, providing economy of scale and stability.  That is critical.  We also want to engage with the Part V provision, and we alluded to that in our submission, stating it should be 20% rather than 10%.  That would provide good value for money.<\/p><p> An important point to consider in the submission is that when the Celtic tiger's housing market was booming in 2005, land costs were in some schemes totalling 40% of the cost.  That is untenable and we have made recommendations about sites and unused State land being made available for the sector.  That is critical.  We also reference the Judge Kenny report from the early 1970s about land value.  The Oireachtas committee considered that 20 years ago, indicating that it was not unconstitutional and should be implemented.  It is back to the Department or the Minister to endorse that.<\/p><p> Housing associations have changed very much from what we were ten years ago.  We have to deal with loan finance and housing management and we work in partnership with local authorities, developers and the Housing Finance Agency.  There are 13 members accredited with the Housing Finance Agency and able to borrow money.  That enables an additional provision and better value for money for government grants and loan finance that we borrow and repay via State funding.  That enables development.  We are also trying to look to the future and have alternatives to the Housing Finance Agency.  We are trying to create a special purpose vehicle committee that would enable investors to come in and fund the sector for the provision of new housing.  The larger member associations are very actively working at that to see if we can possibly avail of credit union money to enable the kind of investment that is required for us to access funding for the delivery of new housing.<\/p><p> We provide many schemes in rural areas; it is not just an urban problem.  In County Clare there are many schemes for the elderly pioneered by people in local communities.  It is a very vital contribution to Irish life.  What is really needed in maintaining those elderly schemes is some sort of assisted independent living funding.  When older people become less able they need more assisted support.  They do not need to go to nursing homes but there must be a source of funding coming to the housing body so they can live independently.  We have called for that for 20 years and got nowhere with it.  We can make the case again but it is a very important contribution to community life, particularly in rural areas.  To my mind, it is something that is often unrecognised as an example of what capital funding from the State has enabled over the past 20 years.<\/p><p> We welcome the idea of the cross-party committee.  It is important in bringing the different stakeholders together and perhaps it could be ongoing and active, reviewing the delivery by different stakeholders, developers, ourselves as approved housing bodies and local authorities.  We made particular recommendations in our report that the committee might wish to clarify or seek further information on, and we will happily engage on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#FFF00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justin O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":266,"content":"<p>The full report will go on the website after the meeting, and I acknowledge the recommendations and so forth that were made in it.

Smaller local associations that may not have access to cash or be able to borrow may not go down that route, but in urban areas some of the larger associations are looking at that for older people.

I know there are some very small housing associations, but if there are 270 organisations providing 30,000 houses, that is an average of 110 units for each housing association.  We had a discussion earlier about economies of scale, and this is one.  How many staff, including administrative staff, are there in those associations?  How many of them have chief executives or directors of finance?  How many have separate offices and so on?  I am not saying this in a nasty way.  I think these are very valid questions because years ago we did not have housing associations, except maybe for specialist accommodation for people with disabilities or whatever, where one could see a certain role.  Generally the local authorities did this.  It smacks to me of middlemen.  I know there is an issue with the fiscal space and there is a function for housing bodies as a mar dhea version of borrowing money.  I am not saying I agree with that, but there is a certain logic in it.  However, beyond that I honestly do not know why local authorities are not performing this function.

In essence, the housing associations were here before the formation of the State.  The Iveagh Trust in Dublin was one of the earliest initiatives in voluntary housing for working class people in Dublin.  It provided social housing prior to the local authority doing so.  The latter played a strong role from the 1920s onwards.  Housing associations, not just in Ireland but throughout the European Union, predate public authorities which are very generic and do many things, including housing, planning, finance and so forth.  Housing associations in Ireland and many other countries are dedicated to housing management and provision.  That is their sole focus.<\/p> <p>  The added value provided by housing associations is that they have a long-term commitment to the provision of rental housing in the areas in which they operate, as well as to the provision of supports.  Local authorities do not have a focus on providing supports.  What is needed is both housing and support services, whether for homeless people, the elderly or people with disabilities.  Initially housing associations after the 1920s would have been in a niche area, providing for special needs groups.  Such groups were well catered for in this way because the local authorities at that time would not have had the strands of expertise to provide for such client groups.  In this context, one is not just talking about bricks and mortar.  One is also talking about support services.  <\/p> <p>  On the question of the scale of housing associations, there are three classifications, namely, tiers 1, 2 and 3.  The majority of the 30,000 homes are managed by approximately 15 larger housing associations in the so-called tier 3 group.  There are approximately 180 smaller housing associations in the tier 1 group.  They do not have any staff.  Most of those associations are voluntary and started from the ground up.  They may have obtained sites from local parish councils, received funding through the capital assistance scheme, which was mentioned by Deputy Harty, and provided housing.  They would not have staff in place although they would have boards.  One of the biggest challenges we have been dealing with in recent years is in trying to consolidate some of those associations.  Some of the older board members have moved on and we are trying to get a structure in place to help to consolidate the sector.  That has happened to some degree in that there have been a number of mergers of smaller voluntary housing associations.  Many of them do not have any staff at all.  They may have caretakers but there are no chief executive officers, directors of finance and so forth.  Such staff operate in the tier 3 housing associations.  I can obtain the figures from the regulation office on how many people are employed in the tier three associations.  That is where the bulk of the staff in the sector are employed, as finance directors, chief executive officers and so forth.  The small voluntary organisations would not have the rental income-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#KKK00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal McManus"},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":280,"content":"<p>In terms of the larger housing associations which do have significant rental income, how many are we talking about?

They would have housing staff and support staff for tenants.  They would also provide education programmes.  Housing associations do not just provide housing and housing support; they also provide social programmes.  I will supply the Deputy with the details on the numbers of staff employed.  The larger tier 3 associations with significant stock would employ staff.  The larger an association becomes, the more staff it will have to employ to deal with various issues.<\/p> <p>  Some of the mid-sized housing associations with between 300 and 400 units have come together and amalgamated.

The centre has about 12 apartments where people live as they get older.  The centre has technological assistance in terms of sensors whereby if the residents get up late at night, a light comes on automatically in the bathroom, or if water spills over in the bath or in the kitchen, an alarm goes off.  The residents are interrogated medically in terms of \"Did you take your pills today, Mary?\", or \"Let us check your blood pressure\", and so on.  That is the type of wonderful work that is needed in the future.  I like that; I think it is good.  I also like the fact that the community can add and build on.  If there are people in the community who are dedicated to a voluntary body or an ideal, they can do much more than a local authority.<\/p><p> I understand where Ms Gallagher is coming from and I do not disagree with her.

We are talking about getting commercial developers back into the business.  They are not coming back at the moment, but if we could get voluntary organisations working, we should support them as they can build at a far cheaper cost.  They will have much more support from statutory agencies.  What new initiative could be supported?

As Mr. O'Brien said earlier, those people who were housed were either off the waiting list or included in the 25% mentioned by Deputy Harty.  That gave some housing associations the scope to house some people within the scheme who may not have qualified for social housing in the traditional sense.  A person may have had an asset such as land but may have lived in very poor conditions.  That is the scope that has enabled these schemes to work.<\/p> <p>  In terms of beyond the bricks and mortar, what has happened in the past is that the community supports to the tenants in those schemes are provided either by volunteers or the wider community and the housing association has primarily absorbed that cost.

It seems to me that it is obviously related to the financial issue because of this off-balance sheet aspect - the EU fiscal rules - but I am questioning whether it is ideological as well.<\/p> <p>   On the problems with housing agencies versus local authorities, as someone who was on a council for a period, one of the things I found dealing with the housing agencies, which were increasingly being given housing estates in the area, is that councillors are not in a position to represent any of the people living in those estates like they are with the council.  That is a real disadvantage for those people in those houses because they have no one to bat on their behalf.  At least with councils, we can go in and argue about rent, arrears, anti-social behaviour or whatever.  There are a few things.  I mentioned three of them, one being pyrite, about which a housing agency in my own area, Respond!, has not done anything.  If that was the council, I would be best placed to go in and make representations but I have not got anywhere.  Another thing is the replacement of windows.  There are housing estates in Mulhuddart which are controlled by NABCO and others.  They have not done window replacement and the tenants are living in freezing cold houses.  At least with the councils there is a process and a certain democracy as well.<\/p> <p>  I have a problem with the fact that it seems councils are being obliged to hand over their land to housing associations.  That is what is happening.  Again, to mention my constituency of Dublin West, we have a massive housing crisis and a massive homelessness crisis but, according to the Laying the Foundations document, only 22 houses will be built and that will be done by the housing agency Cl&uacute;id.  They will be just for generalised population.<\/p><p>Why is a housing agency being given all these estates when no specialised group is going to be in them?  Let us be clear: housing associations are not batting on behalf of a sector that needs proper care, for example, the way ALONE used to argue for the elderly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#NNN00400","speaker":"1254","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":304,"content":"<p>You have asked the question.

The first part was a question on the either-or aspect.  Deputy Coppinger clearly referred to either local authorities or approved housing bodies.  I do not see it as a question of either-or.  Obviously, the bulk of the capital funding goes to local authorities.  We can see this in terms of the output, construction and acquisition.  At the moment, local authorities have the bulk of the capital rather than AHBs.  We have only 30% of the capital funding.  The capital assistance scheme is &euro;70 million for the country and 30% of capital is available under the capital advance leasing facility, amounting to &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million.  In other words, the bulk is still within local authorities at the moment rather than AHBs.  Initially, we played a complementary role.  Moreover, we provide more family-type housing and we take people off the waiting list.  Obviously, all elected members know people on the waiting lists.  Whether it happens through local authorities or approved housing bodies I imagine members want people off the waiting lists.  That is one thing AHBs believe they can alter.  In some cases they may have to acquire the properties or talk to receivers to buy properties in different estates.  Anyway, they take people off the waiting list.  Their key motivation is to house people.  In some cases they need sites.  In recent years more of the sites have been provided by the private sector whereas in the past it may have been religious bodies or local community organisations that provided the sites.  That would have been the path for land.  Anyway, I do not see it as either-or.  We have a housing crisis at the moment and we have to put all hands to the pump, whether local authorities or AHB.  We have no wish to be competing when it comes to taking people off the waiting list.<\/p> <p>  There are two regulators at the moment.  There is a regulator for landlord tenant relationships with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  We have moved on with the PRTB.  Tenants have a remedy and can go to the PRTB in the end if there are any issues.  That is one positive thing for the landlord-tenant relationship.  There is regulation of organisations as well.  A new regulatory structure was put in place in recent years and it will probably be statutory from next year.  That will provide a public level of accountability and hopefully there will be an independent regulator for the sector.  There will be regulation for the organisations and regulation for the landlord-tenant relationship.  That is important to build up confidence among everyone in the sector, including elected members and others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#OOO00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal McManus"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I will complement some of what Dr. McManus has said.  We are meeting the same housing need.  All the people we house come from the local authority waiting lists.  They give the names to us and then we interview and agree the selection with them.  Therefore, we are meeting a public need for housing.<\/p> <p>  We are a dedicated housing body.  There are important regulations, particularly for larger tier 3 associations.  As part of regulatory compliance we have to produce a 30-year asset management plan and get it verified and approved by our boards.  The purpose is to ensure we know the money we need to set aside for the replacement of component parts of housing, such as windows, roofs, etc.  That is what we have to do as part of business modelling.  In that sense we are probably more disciplined than local authorities.  The truth is that local authority rent goes into the central coffers of local authorities.  It does not always go back into housing.  We use all the money we get on rent to maintain and manage the properties.  The indications are that the key performance indicators we have are generally better than local authorities, but people operate in different contexts.<\/p> <p>  In that sense I take on board the issue Deputy Coppinger raised.  I cannot speak for the bodies she referred to.  I can only speak for my association, Circle Voluntary Housing Association.  If a public representative contacts me with an issue for a constituent, I will respond to it.  It is simply part of what I have to do.  I respect the right of a public representative to do so and I would try to respond and give an explanation in respect of housing need or where a person is.  If there is a complaint about maintenance, I would try to explain how we are trying to deal with it.  That does arise.  I am simply saying that this is not to delegitimise the rights of public representatives to advocate on behalf of the people we house or the people they represent.  That is not the position.  That is the context in which we have to operate.<\/p> <p>  Further to what Dr. McManus has said, it is not a question of either-or.  We may have the capacity to get funding from one source and the local authorities have to rely entirely on public funding.  We are trying to work together and broaden the funding regime to deliver the necessary social housing.  If the capital advance leasing facility and the payment availability works, then for every 30% the Department puts in we will have to raise the other 70%.<\/p><p>That is a better value equation for the State in terms of new provision.  If there are limits on the Government balance sheet for the capital spend, that is a serious factor facing the country and it affects us as approved housing bodies, AHBs, as well.  That is why the capital programme was decimated between 2008 and 2015.  It began to increase slightly only in 2015.  It was decimated for local authorities and for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#OOO00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justin O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":308,"content":"<p>We will follow up on some points in Deputy Coppinger&rsquo;s questions when we deal with the finance section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#PPP00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I want to ask about the co-operation between the local authorities and the voluntary housing sector.

I do not know whether that is a national issue or whether each local authority decides.<\/p> <p>  In my constituency, if, for example, Respond! has a bungalow that would be suitable for somebody in a local authority house, there does not seem to be any room for a transfer.  I agree with some of Deputy Coppinger&rsquo;s points about it being more difficult to deal with some of the housing agencies than with the local authority.  I know of a situation where people are expected to pay for central heating to be put into their homes.  That would be very different in local authority homes.  I know Mr. O&rsquo;Brien cannot comment on individual cases but it is worth bearing in mind that a better approach to dealing with tenants and their public representatives is needed.

We have done that numerous times.  Each person would interview the potential new tenant and agree, work out that there are no rent arrears or that an anti-social tenant is not being transferred from one place to another.  There is a process.  The biggest problem for us all, even within our own stock, is that if families increase in size, the capacity to transfer them from a small to a large unit is limited.  In most local authorities and AHBs, the turnover of tenancies is very limited.

I will start with the special purpose vehicle.  We have been involved in trying to get a financial vehicle set up for the last three or four months.  There is a need to bring more finance into the sector that is off the balance sheet of the State and off the balance sheet of the housing associations, as we are carrying debts on our balance sheets.  There is a Welsh model which we were looking at very closely initially.  Five associations set it up, drew in a lot of money from financial bodies and acquired properties on the private market.  We are looking at a financial vehicle that draws money in from the investment sector - such as pension funds or credit unions, which lend out to housing associations at very favourable rates.  That was the overall context.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, with any financial model we can have plenty of finance but no product.  That is what we are facing.  There is loads of finance floating around but there is no product in the private sector.  This is a more structured vehicle.  We are looking at the possibility of joint ventures with the private development sector.  If it has product, then we can use that finance to acquire the units.<\/p> <p>  We had discussions with Limerick City and County Council about regeneration involving a number of associations.  We have been down there for a couple of years to see what role we can play in Limerick in spreading regeneration.  Again, that could be a use for the loan finance mixed funding regime.  It has been considered in the context of recent issues, as the Deputy mentioned, as well as in the wider context of drawing finance into the sector.<\/p> <p>  At the end of the day there is a huge ask on all of us, with 35,000 homes to be produced by 2020.  The local authorities can play a role, as can we.  We have to use these different vehicles to draw money in.  Although the new vehicles can be complex, people are working their damnedest to get these solutions in place for the likes of Limerick and others, in terms of both regeneration and new building and acquisition.<\/p> <p>  We do need product and we depend on the private sector being active.  There is no point in the private sector being inactive.  We are all intertwined in terms of failures in the housing sector.  I hope that, in its deliberations, the committee will reflect on the fact that the private sector does affect us in terms of new supply.<\/p> <p>  Returning to Deputy Quinlivan's question, we are sad at the moment because we came very close to having a model together.  We do not want to over-egg it or do it prematurely.  We want it tied down and to get the people and the associations committed.  We can then show people it is not just talk but is actually something we have achieved.  Hopefully in the next couple of months we will have something concrete.

The truth is that very few new associations are looking for membership of the Irish Council for Social Housing because the context of delivery is very difficult.  Some 15 years ago a housing association could get a 100% capital grant and grow, but that is no longer the case.  It is the complete opposite.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked what our purpose is, if local authorities are doing everything right.  We need to have an honest conversation.  I am not trying to dismiss local authorities.  They have delivered social housing over the lifetime of the State.  A considerable amount of social housing has been sold via the process to enable people to buy their homes.  Political choices were made.  We see ourselves as complementing the provision of social housing in the country.  That is our main purpose.  We are a single-purpose organisation dedicated to social housing and need to enhance our ability to do that.<\/p> <p>  There are often changes of personnel in local authorities when people move from one section to another.   As I said, we believe that with the funding available we can add value and grow what is in place.  It is not a case of one body being against another.  Most northern European countries, including Holland, Germany, France and the United Kingdom, have different approaches, but they have fairly vibrant social housing sectors alongside public housing bodies which are meeting social housing need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#RRR00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justin O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":323,"content":"<p>Like Deputy Daly, I do not want to be pejorative and it is not my wish to be in any way offensive, but we are discussing the kernel of the housing situation in terms of the public sector in this country.  For a long time I have been an opponent of the replacement of the public sector building programme, as suggested by Deputies Daly and Coppinger, with housing provided through voluntary agencies.  They are ideally placed to deal with sheltered housing and special needs.  Local authorities are not in the same league and could never do such work.  There are reasons for that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the delivery of the main thrust of the requirements of local authority type housing throughout the country, it is the wrong vehicle.  If we continue along this road, in five years' time the Chairman will be sitting in the same spot discussing the same issue.  The member states of the European Union agreed to have a particular vehicle to deliver housing in order to ensure an off-balance sheet situation.  It does not work.<\/p> <p>  A 100% capital grant, plus a maintenance grant, all of which, I presume, was available to local authorities, were given to housing bodies.<\/p><p>There is a replacement by the voluntary housing agencies of what the local authorities were doing.  The biggest housing agency owns about 5,500 houses at present.  It is the biggest landlord in the country.  The point I want to make in particular is that the local authority housing officers will tell one straight out that they are competing with the voluntary agencies for the same funding coming from the same source.  I cannot understand for one moment how the capital going from central government to the voluntary agency is agreed, is quite all right and in accord with all rules and regulations but the capital funding going to the local authorities to do the same thing is not.  There is no reason for that.  It is a technicality that was introduced for a particular purpose.  To my mind it was a total and abject failure.  My reason is that in this country there was a baseless theory, which still exists, that we should get away from owning houses, that Irish people were preoccupied with ownership and so on and that we should become like the Europeans who lease or rent their houses.  We are not the same and we do not have the same traditions as people in all areas across Europe where they have different traditions.  It works very well for them but it does not work here.  Irish people want to have the potential of owning their own house for two reasons.  They want to be able to improve it, expand it and call it their castle and part of their investment in life.  They cannot do that with the voluntary agencies - it is as simple as that.  <\/p><p> I want to emphasise that it is for this purpose that I am sitting here.  I have dealt with this before and I know that we will be here in five years.  This is no disrespect to the housing agencies at all but they are not the appropriate vehicle to deliver the volume of housing necessary in this country or any country with a similar requirement at this or any other time.  For special needs and sheltered housing, there is no doubt in the world that they are by far and away the best providers.  There is McAuley Place and various other places like it all over the country, which are excellent.  The local authorities cannot compete with that.  If we do not address this issue and deal with, we will not solve this problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#RRR00500","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I am sorry for interrupting the Deputy.

However, more importantly, the capital allowance scheme provides for 100% capital funding - 100% for the site, 100% for the loan to build the houses and a grant thereafter for the maintenance of the houses.

Many local authorities approach housing associations to manage their properties.  If that is evidence of failure, I do not know where we are.  They have asked housing associations to manage properties.  In terms of measuring failure, I do not think it is.  There is huge demand for housing association properties in many areas because they like the standard of management that is provided to tenants.  That is not a failure.  Local authorities have approached us to regenerate their own properties.  To be truthful, there were failures in local authorities over the past 30 years.  There have been various regeneration schemes in different local authority areas and the State has had to pick up the tab.  The sector believes it could have a role in redressing that.  I would challenge that it has been a failure.  Perhaps for some people it has been a failure, but I would say that the tenants living there would not claim it was a failure and they are the people who matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#TTT00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal McManus"},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":337,"content":"<p>There are nearly 8,000 people on the housing list in County Kildare, so I would not think it was a success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#TTT00400","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":338,"content":"<p>The Deputy has had a fair hearing on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#TTT00500","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I am sorry, Chairman, but it is a burning issue with the people I represent.

I was at another meeting.  I welcome the witnesses.<\/p> <p>  I will offer a bit of positivity.  In my experience the housing agencies involved in projects in my county are considerably better equipped to carry out the management of the housing stock when it is in place.  Accommodation that was built in approximately 2000 is as good and as well kept today as it was when it was built.  I have proof of this, because I was involved in the construction.  The local authorities have failed to maintain their housing stock as well as the housing agencies have.  It seems to be down to resources.<\/p> <p>  The witness said that whatever rent roll the Irish Council for Social Housing gets is used for maintenance and future work, whereas when local authorities get in their rent roll they put it into the Central Fund and it is dissipated.  We can build all the houses we are talking about, but if we do not maintain them, we will be back at it again.  I see it in my own county.  We built houses about 20 years ago and we will probably knock them down now to rebuild them.  That is not how we want to operate in the future.  We have to look at housing and estate management.<\/p> <p>  Obviously the Irish Council for Social Housing has a way of doing estate management that the local authorities do not.  Would the council be willing to share that expertise with the local authorities in order that we can genuinely protect our housing stock?<\/p><p>That is the first question.<\/p><p> Second, one of the issues I have with the housing associations, which relates to the housing lists, is that an association gets a list of prospective tenants from a local authority and chooses from that.  I think this is wrong.  If the local authority has a housing list and the housing association has 20 units, the local authority should give the association 20 families to go into them and that should be it.  The housing association should not have the veto on who is let into the houses.  The position in this regard has to change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#TTT00800","speaker":"1260","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Canney for his acknowledgement of where he thinks we have reasonable performance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#UUU00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justin O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":344,"content":"<p>The witnesses needed something.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#UUU00300","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1461835800,"counter":345,"content":"<p>That is affirming and I want to recognise that.  I was trying to express that earlier in terms of saying we are primarily housing providers, so that is where the resources go.  It is true that, in the context of local authorities, rents go into the central fund.  There have been issues where some stock has not been well maintained over the years.  On a very important point, however, under the regulation code we must have asset management in place that is verifiable and is signed off on by our board, and we have to adhere to that and make provision for it financially.  Therefore, there are strictures on what we can and cannot do.<\/p> <p>  Sharing expertise is important and we would be very open to it.  It is not that we are the best boys in town all the time and that we know everything.  People work in different contexts and it would be very good to get that sharing of expertise.  For people working in our sector, there is relatively more insecurity, particularly for housing bodies which are starting off - before they get reasonable economies of scale - as compared to local authorities.  People have sometimes gone from the AHB, sector into the local authority system and there is now a bit of transfer the other way, which is very good.  It would be good to look at enhanced learning through the SPCs.  It is a question of what works and what does not work in a local area, and how learning on this can be translated for the common purpose of shared intelligence.  I believe that would be sensible for each SPC to undertake.<\/p> <p>  The context for nomination and selection is that we are getting the top people on the list from the local authority.  Rather than doing what they do in the UK, where they simply take people, the housing body is trying to get a balance within its scheme.  The waiting list is sometimes very blunt so what we always try to do is get a mix of ages of children and of adults, and of working and non-working people, so they are not all lumped together.  There has been experience, particularly in Dublin and the urban areas, where some schemes were overloaded with the same category of person.  This has had disastrous social consequences because the communities became unbalanced and were socially deprived and  then became very difficult to manage.  Some effort has been made in this regard.  We are not trying to cherry-pick, to use a word that is often said about us.  My approach is that we are trying to get a balanced community within the 20 units or 50 units - whatever the figure is - so there is some vibrancy within that community.  I do not know if that gives Deputy Canney some clarification of the question he asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CHH2016042800002#UUU00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justin O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1461835800,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Yes.
