I do not know whether he frequents the Connemara pony show but I am aware that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has been there on numerous occasions.  Indeed, I saw him there two years ago.  Obviously, the Connemara pony is specific to the region for which it is named.  We are extremely proud of the breed and of the heritage relating to it.  However, concerns have been raised in respect of the inspection and classification programme for the Connemara pony.  A recent report, compiled by Dr. Jack Murphy, raises serious questions with regard to the classification and inspection regime.  In the executive summary to his report Dr. Murphy states:<\/p><blockquote>The onus is on the custodians of this wonderful animal (individual breeders, producers, owners and studbook officers of the Connemara Pony Breeders Society [CPBS]) to ensure that these husbandry responsibilities are fully [served].<br \/><br \/>Any shortcomings in this regard reflects a dereliction of duty and [are] tantamount to negligent dysfunctional behaviour.<\/blockquote> <p>He goes on to state:<\/p><blockquote>CPBS officers charged with responsibility for inspection and quality control should only be awarded that privilege by demonstrating clear and unambiguous competencies to do so.  All of the Inspector personnel should undergo appropriate training regularly, be capable of demonstrating proficiency and complete bi-annual competency examinations.<br \/><br \/>Any members exhibiting shortcomings in demonstrable inspection skillsets should absent themselves voluntarily from inspection panels or face permanent exclusion.<\/blockquote> <p>He further states that &quot;all Inspectors should only serve a maximum of a three (3) year office and thereafter remain off-panel for a minimum of at least three years&quot; and notes:<\/p><blockquote>Classification may be problematic for breeders, owners and Inspectors.  Currently some 95% plus of females attain Class 1, but this is statistically and biologically improbable.  Providing a lifetime classification status to an animal at 2 or 3 years of age leads to errors and in all likelihood, there [are] other invalidity within the current classification system.<\/blockquote> <p><!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2363\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->He says the world of animal breeding is littered with countless examples of errors in classification and that these mistakes were originally based on predictive scores that were never ultimately tested.  He goes on to say most stallions fail to live up to expectations as sires and beget progeny, the vast majority of which are not as good or talented as the sire.  He further says that although stud book objectives focus on breeding better animals, the monetary value of these animals will also be influenced by supply and demand.  The challenge is to breed and produce the better quality, correct individual, while producing the optimal numbers at any given time to maintain both market share and the return on investment.  He notes that linear profiling, LP, provides a perfect opportunity to inspect the inspectors who he says complete LP lower beam inspections.  He recommends this extremely important and necessary validation exercise.  He also notes the need to set out clearly defined qualification and selection criteria for inspectors, those who wish to ensure the classification system operates in the correct manner and those who wish to instil confidence in the entire process and handle errors within the stud book system correctly and report truthful, accurate and reliable records.<\/p><p>These are strong comments that raise serious questions about the industry.  Fears have been expressed to me that there are individuals working within the industry who are working in their own interests.  If we do not have a classification system that is open, transparent and fair to all, fears and allegations such as these arise about such issues.  It is felt a small group of people control the industry and the society and that there is a closed shop, secretive mentality.  We need to know where the Department stands on the issue of the international inspection classification of the Connemara pony because the Connemara pony industry is not just an industry in Connemara but also nationwide.  It is international industry, with breeders all over the world.  Therefore, it is vital that the integrity of the system is maintained.<\/p><p>In his discussion document Dr. Murphy highlights numerous errors in the inspection system.  Is the senior Minister and the Minister of State aware of these issues?  Have they been brought to the attention of the Minister of State and what does he intend to do about them?  I understand there is substantial funding provided by the Department for the Connemara Pony Breeders Society.  Are there implications in that regard?<\/p><p>We all want to see a thriving industry that can be maximised for all of the people of Connemara, in particular north Connemara, in order that the show there and related shows around the world will be examples of excellence.  We need to ensure the playing field is fair and that adjudications and inspections of horses, stallions and mares coming through the show are conducted in the best possible manner and are up to the highest international standards.  For that reason, I ask whether the Department has full confidence in the inspection classification regime being implemented by the Connemara Pony Breeders Society?  If not, what does it intend to do about it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#A00600","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to bring clarity to the situation in regard to the Connemara Pony Breeders Society.  The society's is one of a number of equine stud books approved by my Department in accordance with EU rules and the relevant domestic legislation, namely, the European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011.  The society holds approval valid up to 28 November 2016 to maintain a stud book for the Connemara pony breed in Ireland.<\/p> <p>In regard to inspections conducted for a stud book such as that of the Connemara Pony Breeders&rsquo; Society, on foot of European Commission Decision 921353, stud book holders are required to have established principles for the division of their stud book if there are different conditions for entering the horse family, or if there are different procedures for classifying the horse family entered in the book.  European Commission Decision 96\/78 outlines the qualifying criteria for entry into the main section of a stud book and states this section may be divided into several classes, according to the animals&rsquo; merits.  Therefore, as part of its breeding programme, the Connemara Pony Breeders Society has developed an inspection process which is available to all members to establish a classification for their animals within the main section of the stud book.  The attributes which determine admission to the different classes within a stud book are matters for the individual or breed society holding the approval.  The Department&rsquo;s oversight is to ensure whatever standards and classifications are determined by the stud book operator adhere to the relevant requirements of EU and Irish legislation.  Stud book holders are required to ensure the inspection processes include adequate safeguards to ensure transparency and fairness and that inspections are carried out in a non-discriminatory fashion.  It is also required that there be an appropriate mechanism for owners who are dissatisfied with the outcome of an inspection of their animals to have access to a transparent appeals procedure.<\/p> <p>The procedures of the Connernara Pony Breeders Society for inspections are as follows.  Owners who wish to put their animals forward for inspection are required to apply in writing.  The society will inspect colts aged three years and over and fillies aged two years and over.  The animal&rsquo;s lifetime document must be in the name of the owner at the date of application, or otherwise the society will not conduct the inspection.  The lifetime document must be presented by the owner at the time of the inspection.  Applicants with animals for inspection must pay the appropriate fee charged by the society.  No applications are accepted after a closing date stipulated by the society.  Markings on a pony, for example, flesh marks, socks, etc. should not be concealed or altered when the animal is being presented for inspection.  Inspectors appointed by the society inspect each pony.  Ponies also have their microchips checked and height measured at the inspection centre by the society&rsquo;s veterinary surgeon.  A written result of marks attained will be given to the owner on the day of the inspection, as marked by the inspectors at the inspection.  <\/p> <p>According to the rules of the society, animals that receive sufficient marks at the visual inspection to be eligible for class one or class two will be offered a full veterinary examination by the society&rsquo;s veterinary surgeon on the day of the inspection.  Animals that do not attend for veterinary inspection will remain in class three and their owners will have to reapply to the society should they wish to have them reclassified.  Owners of animals being put forward for inspection are liable for the fee for the veterinary inspection of their animals and it is payable on the day of the inspection.  All ponies not previously microchipped are microchipped by the veterinarian on the day of the inspection and owners are also liable for this cost.  The society takes the submission by an animal owner of an application form for classification as an indication that the owner concerned is willing to abide by the rules and regulations of the Connemara Pony Breeders Society and the decision of the inspection committee. The decision of the inspection team is given to the owners of animals on the day of the inspection and no owner is permitted to enter into discussion with or make any approach to any member of the inspection team.<\/p> <p>Owners of ponies that are not successful at an inspection may present them again an unlimited number of times.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Tom Hayes:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1807\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1807&amp;amp;pid=TomHayes&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is appropriate that studbooks keep their inspection procedures under review in the light of changing times.

This is where Liam Mellows and his comrades originally congregated on Friday, March 24 1916.  On that day, Mellows was arrested by the RIC, Royal Irish Constabulary, and deported to the UK.  The importance of Athenry to the 1916 Rising cannot be understated.  This is underlined by the fact that it is one of just four locations which will be marked by major commemorative celebrations next year and the only one in Connacht.<\/p> <p>For the Minister to agree to hold the ceremony at the Back Lawn in Athenry would be a great boost to the local community and the organising committee which takes great pride in the role our town played in fighting for independence.  It would be ample recognition of the significant progress the committee has made in developing a commemorative garden at the site.  For these reasons, the local area would be honoured by the wreath-Iaying ceremony of such an important occasion taking place at this spot in Athenry.

An extensive programme of formal State ceremonial events will take place around the country next year, focused on remembering and honouring those who took part in the Easter Rising and those who lost their lives.  Significant regional events are planned in Athenry, Ashbourne, Enniscorthy, Cork and Kerry, to reflect the special importance attached to these locations during the events of 1916.<\/p> <p>On Easter Monday, 28 March, 2016, synchronised wreath-laying ceremonies will take place in Athenry, Ashbourne, Enniscorthy and Cork at 1.15 p.m., the time the first shots of the 1916 Rising were fired.  Each of these four regional events comprises a significant community and cultural element, which will reflect the special significance of the 1916 Rising in that part of the country, and the formal State ceremonial element, which will include the synchronised wreath-laying ceremony.<\/p> <p>The 2016 project team has been collaborating with the relevant local authorities to develop the programme for each event.  These local authorities have been taking the lead role in working with all stakeholders to develop the programme content, as well as the arrangements for the community and cultural element of the ceremony.  The format for the State ceremonial element has been developed in consultation with the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, in accordance with the relevant military protocols and, as such, is not subject to change.<\/p> <p>Galway County Council is developing a fitting and imaginative programme for the ceremonial event taking place in Athenry on Easter Monday 2016.  The council has been assisted in this process by the Ireland 2016 project team, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.  In particular, the 2016 project office and these other stakeholders have been working with the local authority to assist it in selecting the most suitable site in Athenry for the commemoration.<\/p> <p>They have visited the site and met with the relevant local representatives involved in the event.  The most critical factors that determine the selection of the site of the wreath-laying ceremony in Athenry are issues around public safety and the capacity of the site to accommodate the large crowds expected to attend this event.  The local authority, in consultation with the 2016 project team, formed the view that the most suitable site that can accommodate the logistics and practical arrangements required to successfully deliver an event of this scale, in accordance with the protocols required for a formal State ceremonial event of this nature, is the town park adjacent to Athenry Castle.<\/p> <p>The location of the commemorative garden at Back Lawn is undoubtedly of special significance, as it is the site on which Liam Mellows trained volunteers from the county in the lead-up to the 1916 Easter Rising.  The ceremony programme for the event in Athenry on Easter Monday will recognise the significant role played by Liam Mellows and the Galway Volunteers while the community element of the event will include a re-enactment to reflect the history of Athenry.<\/p> <p>The selection of the site of the wreath-laying ceremony is a matter for Galway County Council, based on advice from the Ireland 206 project team, the Office of Public Works and the Defence Forces.  However, the Minister has asked her officials to explore with Galway County Council other possibilities that might be found, outside of the formal State ceremonial event on Easter Monday, for incorporating the commemorative garden into the plans in Galway to commemorate the important role played by the Galway Volunteers in the events of the 1916 Rising.<\/p> <p>The event planned in Athenry will be a fitting tribute to all those in Athenry and the surrounding area who took part in the events of 1916.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#C00700","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for this detailed response.

If it is the most suitable for it, there is little I can do about it, however.  I am glad the Minister is looking at having a separate event at the commemorative garden.  Some side event should be held there, given the significance of the Back Lawn where Liam Mellows congregated with his comrades in 1916.

I am sure all Senators have received representations at their clinics and advice centres in respect of these delays.  The delays in question have occurred at the same time in each of the past several years and are caused by the need to take satellite photographs, to digitise data, etc.  I checked the position in Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim just before I came to the House and discovered that some 6,000 farm families are awaiting payments due to them under the areas of natural constraints scheme - previously known as the disadvantaged areas scheme - and also basic payments.  This is completely unacceptable.  Farm families, like many others in business, are trying to make ends meet.  At this time of the year, many of them are obliged to make insurance payments and loan repayments and they need to buy feed and fodder in the normal way.  We acknowledge the added financial pressure to which the Christmas season gives rise for all families.

The delays they are experiencing with regard to the payments due to them - which, in effect, represent a form of income - are unacceptable.  They require the money involved in order to make vital payments or repayments of their own.  I request that the Leader make personal contact with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and ask him to accelerate these payments as a matter of the utmost urgency.  I referred to 6,000 families in Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim but I am sure that there are similar numbers of people in the Leader's county of Waterford, in Cork and in other counties who, for no good reason, are also awaiting these vital payments.

If these people could not afford the rent yesterday, they will not be able to afford it today.<\/p><p>There is nothing in this for accidental landlords, those people who bought houses which they were forced to rent out because they could not afford to stay in them and had to move into another rented property.

The compromise that has resulted from the internal parliamentary tiff between the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, has produced nothing for the struggling renting population of this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#G00500","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Yesterday, I asked for a debate on the new package of measures for the protection of tenants and on stabilising rents and boosting supply.

It is, none the less, very welcome to see these very practical measures put forward and I take issue with Senator MacSharry's points, in particular his suggestion that landlords all across the country are raising rents today.

It seems quite obvious that the banks are steering people away from their doors.  They are striving to get everybody, including the elderly, to use machines.  We saw what happened last week and they had to row back on another effort to keep people away from their doors.  I do not blame the staff of the banks but this seems to be policy coming from the highest levels of the banking sector.<\/p> <p>Last week, my assistant tried to buy a bank draft in a bank in Dublin.  First, he could not pay for it in cash.  Second, he had to give a reason he wanted the bank draft, which in this case was for a wedding.  Third, he could not make it payable to the happy couple because he had to know whether they had a joint account.  After 20 minutes of frustration, he went across the road to the post office and got a post office draft in 45 seconds with no questions asked.  If one rings one's local bank, and everyone has their local bank number, one will get through to Dublin so the banks are doing everything in their power to frustrate people.  A lady from Elphin who wanted to get Australian dollars when she went into the bank was told that it did not have them but to ring back later.  She rang back later and got through to Dublin.  What are they going to do for her if she wants Australian dollars?<\/p> <p>What appears to be happening here is that the banks are trying to move to staffless and machine-led operations.

I believe that people should move to their local credit unions and post offices.  These outfits view them as customers while the banks view them as a nuisance.

I am particularly pleased to note from today's newspapers that An Post is in the process of rolling out a banking system.  Perhaps the Leader will indicate whether - given that it has already frustrated the credit unions, by way of restrictive legislation, from providing business loans - the Government is on the side of the banks.  According to newspaper reports, the Government is delaying the roll-out of the banking service by the post office system across the country.  According to those reports - I am sure the Leader will clarify the position in respect of them - the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is delaying the proposed roll-out by An Post of its banking service.  Is that true?  If so, is it doing it in order to defend the banks again?  I find it somewhat ironic that at a time when Bank of Ireland is proposing to limit the access of customers to banking services, it is also rolling out a business enterprise concept countrywide in an effort, in my opinion, to portray itself as one of the good guys.  As already indicated in various earlier contributions, Bank of Ireland is attempting to stop individual customers going into its branches.  That bank is doing everything in its power to encourage people to bank online rather than visit its premises.<\/p> <p>I am not trying to score a political point.  Whatever about the merits or otherwise of the credit union legislation, if An Post is advanced in its plans to roll-out of a banking service, including credit cards, online banking, debit and credit facilities, current account facilities and so on, in its 1,000 plus outlets across the country, I am sure Members on all sides of this House would welcome that as a third banking service.  I will nail my colours to the mast and say if that if a full banking service is going to be provided through the post office system, I would find it an attractive alternative.  Perhaps for the first time, the pillar banks, particularly Bank of Ireland in the context of its launch in the past week of a particularly terrible initiative, will be hurt financially by the rolling out of the An Post service.  There is a moral obligation on the Government, apart from a practical one, to ensure that people are given an alternative as Bank of Ireland withdraws its public service banking system, which has been the mainstay of banking in this country since banking became a reality.<\/p> <p>I am requesting a debate on the banking system in the context of the roll-out of a third service and that said debate be taken by the relevant Minister, be it the Minister for Social Protection or the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.

The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, is extremely disturbed by the fact that anybody can walk into an organisation as large as Clerys and close it in 30 minutes.  That is outrageous.

The installation of a computerised services does not cost a fortune.  The main cost in that regard is around the development of software and the price of electricity.

Unlike in every other country in Europe our rental sector has been neglected for a long time and we are starting from a low base.  In terms of the announcement made yesterday, there has been little mention today of the many positive steps taken with regard to rent reviews, longer notice periods, tenancy terminations and security and, particularly, the deposit retention scheme and measures to increase housing supply, including by way of changes to the development levy and tax incentives to encourage landlords to accept tenants on the housing assistance payment or rent supplement.  These will all be very beneficial.  I would go a step further and incentivise landlords who are in mortgage distress to take on tenants of the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, schemes.  While a lot has been done, there is much more to do.<\/p> <p>I ask that the Leader make provision for a debate on gender equality in the Irish media.  A recently published report on the Irish media indicates that Irish radio in particular is male dominated.  Some 82% of Newstalk staff are male and 18% are female.  Staff at Today FM are 70% male and 30% female.  The RTE Radio 1 programme \"This Week\" fared worst in that 99.5% of its staff are male.  It is not that women have nothing to say - they have a great deal to say.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator C&aacute;it Keane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2359\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2359&amp;amp;pid=CaitKeane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The female was always accused of being the chatterbox.

Waking up almost five years into its term of office to a crisis in housing provision is not good enough.  We urgently need the commitment of capital expenditure to building council houses.

It starkly sets out what abortion is.  Many people are talking now about the repeal of the Eighth amendment of the Constitution but what they are really talking about is abortion.  What is abortion about?  Abortion is the sundering of the bodies of unborn babies.  I would recommend that article to anybody here, whichever side he or she is on, who may have to face this topic in the future.  It is enlightening.  That needs to be central in the focus of the debate we will have.  I hope <i>The Irish Times <\/i>will continue to be much more balanced because it has been little less than a pro-abortion publication for many years.

We need a forthright debate on this area.<\/p> <p>I also support the call for an update from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the delay in farm payments.

Farmers are under severe pressure at this time of year to pay contractors and to meet various bills and it is important that the logjam be freed up urgently. <\/p> <p>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s announcement last week that &euro;28.5 million is being made available for the payment of minor works grants to primary schools around the country.  Schools can use this funding to improve their physical infrastructure, to purchase furniture and physical education and information technology equipment.  This funding will be greatly appreciated by boards of management and school principals and will be paid at the rate of &euro;5,500 per school plus &euro;18.50 per mainstream pupil and &euro;74 per special needs pupil.

I have tabled this amendment which is, admittedly, extraneous to the specific purposes of the Bill but this is an ideal opportunity to address a legal anomaly in cases of child care proceedings brought to my attention by the child care law reporting project and by FLAC.  The child care law reporting project, under the direction of Dr. Carol Coulter, has a statutory remit under section 3 of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2007 and in accordance with the 2012 regulations made under the Act to promote transparency and accountability in child care proceedings in the courts, to publish reports and to provide information to the public on the operation of the child care system.  In the past hour, the Taoiseach acknowledged in the D&aacute;il the significant work of the child care law reporting project and that it has shown us the significant need for prevention and intervention.  This is very much to the heart of the amendment I am proposing.<\/p><p>There has long been a sense, particularly among parties to such proceedings, of a lack of certainty and consistency around the administration of child care proceedings.  As such, the reform of the <i>in camera<\/i>rule that enabled the child care law reporting project to attend proceedings and carry out its reporting function was widely welcomed.  It has lifted the veil of secrecy around how child care law is administered, it has promoted the public confidence in our child care system and it has assisted in shaping law reform and policy-making into the future.  The shift from a blanket <i>in camera <\/i>rule to protect the privacy of the children and parties relevant to the proceedings to allowing for a reasonable public scrutiny and reporting, subject to strict conditions to protect identities,  is very much in line with the direction taken by courts in the UK and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.<\/p><p>As it stands, section 29 of the Child Care Act 1991, as amended by section 3 of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2007, inserted a statutory framework for reporting on child care proceedings.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jillian van Turnhout:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2391\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2391&amp;amp;pid=JillianVanTurnhout&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It creates a presumption that members of the child care law reporting project may attend child care proceedings and access relevant court documents.  However, the court can limit this right in individual cases, for example, to prevent the identification of children.  In this regard, I must further note that the child care law reporting project operates a strict protocol to ensure the anonymity of any children, parent, guardian or foster parent who is the subject of or party to the proceedings being reported.<br\/><br\/>The anomaly my amendment seeks to remedy has come to the fore in the recent decision of District Court President, Judge Rosemary Horgan, not to provide the child care law reporting project with a copy of a social work report submitted in evidence as part of a child care case.  It is standard practice for social workers, guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>and other expert witnesses to swear their reports at the beginning of their evidence.  In many cases, these reports will have already been read by the judge and the parties to the proceedings, so frequently such witnesses will not be taken through these reports in any detail.  This is particularly true when applications are not being actively opposed.  Without the content of the report being read aloud or sight of these reports parallel to the proceedings, it is difficult to fully understand the issues arising and at play in a case.  It can, therefore, also be difficult to report accurately and holistically on the case.  As such, the current legislative arrangement frustrates the child care law reporting project from carrying out its reasonable public scrutiny function.<br\/><br\/>Although Judge Horgan's decision has yet to be published on the <i>courts.ie<\/i>website for verification, her rationale was not necessarily that social work, guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>and expert reports should not be regarded as relevant court documents in child care proceedings but rather that the court is precluded from doing so since the legislation to amend the statutory regime for reporting on family law proceedings, conferring a presumptive right to access relevant documents, was not actively extended to child care proceedings.  My amendment seeks to do this through a similar amendment as made by section 31 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008 to section 40 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  The important and stringently adhered to safeguard whereby the child or parties to the proceedings must not be identified is not affected or undermined in any way by my amendment.  Nor is the safeguard whereby the court directs that relevant court documents be restricted due to the specific circumstances of a particular case.<br\/><br\/>The child care law reporting project does not seek to copy any relevant court documents, does not seek to remove them from court buildings and should return them to such person as may have provided them without delay once inspected.  These practices can be incorporated into court directions, further to section 29(5), whenever necessary.  The child care law reporting project has provided us with invaluable insights.  As access to social work reports is allowed in other cases, will there be consistency in the law regarding these specific reports?  It will ensure when we are legislating and making policy decisions that they are based on facts, not on partial information coming from cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#U00900","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":109,"content":"<p>The child care law reporting project, an important project, does not have a statutory remit.  It is permitted to report on child care proceedings under section 29 of the Child Care Act 1991.  The amendment would provide for a definition of relevant court documents for the purposes of section 29 of the Child Care Act 1991.  The section in question provides for the powers to report on child care proceedings before the courts, where it is likely that such reporting may assist in the better operation of the Act.  Under regulations made under this section, the child care law reporting project has been examining cases before the courts over the recent past.  All such reporting must be anonymised, as Senator van Turnhout pointed out.<\/p> <p>Her proposed amendment would provide access to all documents lodged with the courts in child care proceedings.  Such an amendment would not only apply to the child care law reporting project but to any future body given access to report on court proceedings in a similar fashion.  In many child care cases before the courts, information of an extremely personal and sensitive nature is submitted.  This may encompass everything from financial to psychological reports, reports on addiction issues and alleged cases of physical and\/or sexual abuse which relate not only to the child but to their parents and wider family.  The balance in providing access to such information must be carefully weighed.  The potential for a positive impact in what an examination of such reports might yield for policy or operational gain must be considered against the right to privacy of the individual.  This must be examined from a constitutional perspective, as well as under obligations under international treaties to which Ireland is a signatory.  I remain to be convinced that the intrusion would be appropriate or proportional to intended potential gain.<\/p> <p>I will keep an open mind on the matter and have sought, as a preliminary step, the views of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, on the matter.  An in-depth legal and policy examination of the issues associated with any such amendment would also be required.

I am grateful to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service for preparing a detailed analysis of the Bill.  In section 5, the Minister is changing the principal Act significantly.  We had put down an amendment - it was ruled out of order - concerning those over the age of 23 who were previously in care and who are now pursuing full-time education.  That is not at all unusual.  There are many young people over the age of 23 pursuing education.  Take, for example, the Minister&rsquo;s profession of medicine.  It involves six to seven-year course and it would most definitely engage young people over 23 years.<\/p><p>The Library and Research Service digest states, in the context of the Child Care Act 1991:<\/p><blockquote>Where a child leaves the care of a health board, the HSE can assist him for so long as the board is satisfied as to his need for assistance up to the age of 21 years (or later if continuing in education).  There is an option rather than an obligation to provide aftercare.<\/blockquote> <p>However, on the Minister&rsquo;s proposal with this Bill, the digest states:<\/p><blockquote>Tusla must prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or an eligible adult following an assessment of needs.

I wished for the word \"may\" to be changed to \"shall\".   The whole purpose behind the Bill - the heart of the Bill - is to ensure that the safety net is there every day for children who are aging out by turning 18.  The safety net should not be at the discretion of anybody else.  It should not be that it may be there but rather that it shall be there.  There are too many caveats in the Bill and too much discretion on the agency side.<\/p> <p>The amendments being ruled out of order just proves the point.  The ruling was because of a potential charge on the Exchequer.  The Minster is telling me it will be there - well then there will be no charge on the Exchequer.  This what the safety net is about, which is the purpose of the Bill.  We do need to ensure that when children are blowing out those candles on their 18th birthday, they are absolutely assured.  We talked about this on Second Stage in the Seanad.<\/p> <p>Yes, the large cohort is absolutely assured at present and this Bill will not make a difference to them.  The system is working for those children who are in foster care.

It would be nice to know that the supports were still in place for them because they do need it when they are in education - they need the back-up supports.  If the Minister is telling us that they may be there and will be there and that there is no problem, then I fail to see why we cannot change the wording from \"may\" to \"shall\".

It has been ruled out of order in any event as it would involve a charge on the Exchequer, which is not allowed under the rules of the House.  The amendment seeks to provide Tusla with the ability to extend - at its discretion - the duration of aftercare support to a young person who has attained the age of 23 years by up to one year.  It also seeks to establish an appeals mechanism through which a young person in receipt of aftercare would be entitled to submit an appeal to request an extension of their aftercare support and resources for up to a year.<\/p> <p>The current provision in the Bill takes account of the fact that most young people complete third level education in their early 20s.  It also has regard to possible delays in commencing third level education for young care leavers.  It is considered, therefore, that the existing provision gives ample flexibility to assist young people leaving care in the pursuit of their educational goals.<\/p> <p>Additionally, to accept this amendment would place an undue focus on those care leavers who are in education.  Consequently it could reduce the focus on those who are not in education and who may be in need of other supports.  Furthermore the amendment would extend the period over which an eligible young person would receive support while in full-time education, which would carry additional costs for the agency.  On the establishment of an appeals mechanism, currently under Part 9 of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, a person may make a complaint in respect of a service by the agency.  Moreover the Child Care (Amendment) Bill before us, under section 9, provides that Tusla shall conduct a review of the operation of an aftercare plan on request by a young person or someone acting on their behalf where there has been a significant change in the circumstances of the young person; or where the assistance being provided under the aftercare plan does not meet the need identified; or where additional support requirements for the young person have arisen.  Such reviews are to be conducted within three months of receipt of a request.  They may subsequently result in alterations to an aftercare plan, having due regard to the resources available to the agency to implement the updated plan.  To amend the Bill to insert an additional appeals mechanism would amount to a duplication of resources and I cannot accept the proposed amendment.<\/p> <p>The aftercare plan provided for in the Bill is a huge improvement and movement forward.  In respect of Senator Mooney's contention that this is a change, the 1991 Act - I do not have the note in front of me and am speaking from memory - referred to there being an entitlement.  However, the operational policy was always that it ceased at 23.  The Bill under discussion today provides that, where the circumstances dictate, the agency has the authority to prolong support for somebody in a longer course in college, or if someone lost a year, if there was an illness or other extenuating circumstances.  I think it is a fair and appropriate approach to take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#W00400","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  It is rather interesting that earlier he seemed to suggest that those who pursue further education are somehow creating a financial difficulty in the context of Tusla's resources because their continuing in full-time education is taking away resources from those who are not doing so.  It seems a rather strange definition of care if somebody wishes to pursue education and is under the care of Tusla.  The Minister might also clarify his statement that there was a statutory obligation.  My understanding is that there was no statutory obligation under the Child Care Act.  According to the wording contained in the analysis, \"where a child leaves the care of a health board, the HSE can assist.\".  However, it does not say that the executive must do so.  The Minister said the practicalities were that it did not assist, yet he is changing the legislation.  He has also indicated - he should please correct me if I am wrong in my interpretation - that Tusla will be flexible in its approach to those over the age of 23 who are in full-time education.  The Bill, however, refers to the end of the academic year during which the person turns 23, whichever is the earlier.  Which is it?

As for the Senator's interpretation of my previous comments, we are talking about limited resources as is always the case.  In such circumstances, there always has to be a balancing of what is available to those who may be in further education and those who need other supports.  Of course, we are very strongly supportive and very proud of the fact that many of the children in care are in education when they leave and that they remain in education.  We know that people who go to third  level or complete secondary education have better employability and better prospects.  There is no doubt that we want to support people in this regard.  I revert to the fact that, as it would create an additional charge, inserting the word \"shall\" is not a step that would be taken without having regard to the Department of Finance and Government generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#W00600","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>On Second Stage, the Minister referred to the pre-legislative process and the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  Interestingly, the analysis by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service provides the full list of joint committee recommendations.  I want to put on the record that a number of them were not part of the Bill.  One recommendation was that consideration could be given to broadening the eligibility criteria to include young persons deemed to have exceptional needs.  I would take that as meaning that exceptional needs could be seen in educational terms.  That is not part of the Bill.  The Minister has already dealt with the question of replacing the word \"may\" with \"shall\", which would impose an obligation on Tusla, the HSE and any other State bodies identified by way of regulation to co-operate in planning for the needs of children and young persons leaving care.  That is addressed in part.<\/p> <p>Something else that is not part of the Bill is a recommendation that consideration could be given to ring-fencing a budget for the provision of aftercare services.  They are not part of the Bill either.  I acknowledge and commend the Minister for managing to get an increase in his budget.  I think it is &euro;36 million this year.  The overall cost in his Department for Tusla is almost &euro;700 million so we are not talking about small money here.  I fully acknowledge that.  I do not wish to in any way diminish the difficulty the Department has, particularly as a spending Department, in trying to get more money out of the Exchequer but there seems to be a very genuine concern that has been expressed by Senator van Turnhout about \"may\" and \"shall\".  If one looks at the response of the relevant agencies involved in this area, one can see that time and again, they make reference to resources.  The wording of section 45 has given rise to debate with stakeholders, including Focus Ireland, maintaining that there is currently no statutory obligation on Tusla to provide the services.  In essence, this means that once a child reaches the age of 18, he or she is no longer deemed to be in care.  While the legislation does empower Tusla to make continuing provision for young people formerly in its care, it is a purely discretionary power.  One can understand why there is concern among those engaged in the area of child protection.  Time and again, it comes up that the Bill only guarantees a plan, not its implementation.  Barnardos has said that.  It is rather interesting that it makes the distinction.  It said that it is a crucial difference in that it guarantees a plan but not its implementation.  <\/p> <p>Again, I am sure this affords the Minister an opportunity to reassure all those organisations and individuals involved in child care that insofar as is possible given permissible resources, he will have a totality of approach to this and that he will ensure that where possible, funding and resources will not inhibit the work of Tusla in ensuring that children in care are provided for.  I was very concerned about those over 23 continuing full-time education.  Despite the fact that I was of the opinion that care and the financial resources of Tusla would stop after the age of 23, if I am correct the Minister has stated that this would not be the case and that flexibility is built into the system.  In other words, it is reassurance.  Could the Minister confirm this view?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#X00100","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I am very happy to confirm that and this is why those words are there.

Clearly, the supports were not there and that was a very big concern for everybody involved in this area.  This is a serious step forward in addressing that situation.  There will be ongoing support and a clear plan and they can know that if support is required, it will be available to them.

However, I do want to pick up on something the Minister said in the last part of his contribution.  There is no doubt that this Bill is a huge step forward.  Regardless of the amendments that have been tabled, which have sought to strengthen the Bill, the Minister has given a very clear explanation as to why he could not amend some of them.  Even if we are not entirely happy, there is no doubt it comes from the right position.  We will certainly be in a much stronger position to make sure that all children in State control will get the proper and adequate supports regardless of whether they are in State care or leave.  This Bill definitely goes in the right direction.  <\/p><p>The aim of this amendment, which is the only one that was not ruled out of order, is to compel Tusla to draw up a comprehensive aftercare plan at least 12 months before the young person reaches the age of 18 rather than six months.  It means that it can start planning far earlier for the eventuality and make sure that the plan is comprehensive and tailored to suit the needs of that individual.  We think 12 months would be more suitable than the six-month period.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#X00800","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I know the Senator feels that what he is proposing is helpful but were it to be adopted, the amendment would require that aftercare plans would have to be prepared one year in advance of a child leaving the care of the State.  A year in the life of a young person is an eternity from their point of view.  As a parent, I know the difficulties that present in teenage years.  Things that are important and of major significance one week are replaced by something else the following week.  I am not being frivolous but we remember that advertisement where the teenage girl comes in, gives out about her friend and says that she is never going to speak to her again.  The next day, she is talking to her dad and says she is going to the pictures with her.  Her dad says, \"I thought you were never talking to her again?\" to which the girl replies, \"Don't be stupid, that was yesterday\".  I am not being trite when I say that but we know that things, even very big things, change for children.  Event occur that change their requirements and their circumstances change.<\/p> <p>What is common to all young people in the care of the State or otherwise is the fact that issues that are of importance change and change frequently.  This would include a young person's goals for an aftercare plan.  Some children in the care of the State have a particularly chaotic and vulnerable history or come into care late.  The idea of discussing options for when they leave care possibly just after a placement has been settled would be counter-productive in the extreme.  In other words, it might be a case of them saying to themselves, \"I am only in the place and they are already talking about getting rid of me\".  Even in placements that are settled, the commencement of aftercare planning too early can prove disruptive and unsettling.  It must be handled with great sensitivity.  For many children in long-term placements, having a discussion too early might give rise to fears that foster parents are looking for them to transition out and create worries and fears that are unfounded.  Children may feel that they are only in the place and people are planning to get rid of them.  <\/p> <p>The provision as it stands was crafted in such a way as to enable best social work practice to decide when aftercare planning with the young person in question would take place.  A \"just in time\" approach tailored to the individual with the safeguard of being no later than six months before the end of the care placement is seen as the appropriate response.  For those who have been in care for some time, aftercare planning would form a natural extension of the care planning process.  For those who have entered the care system late, the provision gives the flexibility to social work teams to determine the appropriate time to engage with the young person, albeit with the best interests of the young person to the fore.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Accordingly, it was felt ensuring an aftercare plan was finalised six months before a young person left care was the best approach.  While I understand what the Senator is seeking to achieve, nothing in the provision, as drafted, prevents the Child and Family Agency from agreeing an aftercare plan in advance of the deadline stipulated in the Bill, if that is the desire of the child.  I see the potential for such arrangements in instances where the child is either in a long-term stable placement and anxious to have certainty about the possibility of remaining with the foster parents after he or she reaches 18 years of age or, alternatively, where it is clear that the child will not remain within a foster placement, for whatever reason, and may need assurance on what will happen next.  However, we must have regard to that cohort of children in State care who, for whatever reason, are not yet in the frame of mind to discuss and contribute positively to the development of their aftercare plan.  It is for these reasons that I do not propose to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#X00900","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

The Minister has made the point that children have different needs and will come into the system at different times and so on, such that providing that a plan be drawn up in either six or 12 months is, possibly, not the way to go.

It is a tricky one.  One of the concerns I would like to impart, with Senators Norris and &Oacute; Clochartaigh, is the perceived independence of the appointment process.  Does the Bill, as currently drafted, offer a guarantee that the transparency, clarity and independence of the appointment mechanism towards board appointments is as clean as a whistle?  I would like to hear the Minister's view and believe she might need to examine this before Report Stage in terms of bringing forward an amendment to satisfy the need for independence.  While I want to hear what the Minister has to say on that, let us assume there is a process that can guarantee transparency, the right expertise for the board and equality in terms of gender but also in terms of the listed experience and expertise.  From having served on boards and as a CEO to boards, I know the balance of expertise is very important.  My position differs slightly from that of Senators Norris and &Oacute; Clochartaigh in that I believe there needs to be somebody who can assess the needs of a board.  At present, that is a chairperson.  However, as each four or five-year term evolves, boards of arts organisations and national organisations will have different and varying strategic interests, and these will change over time.  For example, the National Concert Hall might make a board appointment of someone with experience in philanthropy or, indeed, someone who will give money.  Who mediates this and who will decide on that expertise?<\/p><p>In the Bill, there is a sense that the chairperson is the one who is most suitably qualified, subject to the fact he or she has been appointed properly, with full transparency and a sense of fair play.  My concern in teasing this out is that I think the chairperson is the most appropriate person to assess the necessary skills and to work with the Department, the Minister or the Public Appointments Service.

The effect of Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment would be to provide that the chairperson would be elected by the board members.  The chairperson of any State board holds an important position of trust and competence as head of the board which has responsibility for managing the institution and directing operations.  He or she forms a very important link between the board and the Minister.  The chairperson is chosen by the Minister from the members of the board.  The members of the board have been appointed and each of them will have gone through the PAS system which is now applied to all boards within my remit.<\/p> <p>Senators can rest assured that the chairperson will have all of the necessary skills which will have been agreed with the previous chairperson and that he or she will have acquired all of the skills to come through the system in the first place.  Part 3 of the legislation states: \"The chairperson and ordinary members of the Board shall be appointed by the Minister, from among persons who, in the Minister&rsquo;s opinion, have experience of, and expertise in matters connected to music, dance, the arts, finance, business, administration, marketing, fundraising, philanthropy, corporate governance, human resources or venue management\".  The PAS system requires a certain skill set for each national cultural institution and a lot of expertise in many areas before admission to the boards.  The Minister will appoint the chairperson of the majority of State boards and the Public Appointments Service plays an important role in all board appointments.  Under the new arrangements, all appointments to fill vacancies on State boards must be advertised on the State boards' websites.  An independent panel assesses the applications received.  We have recently received up to 90 applications from fantastic people.  We have made two sets of appointments in the past while, the most recent being yesterday when two chairpersons appeared before the joint committee.  The independent panel assesses all applications received and presents a shortlist to the Minister who makes the final decision.  <\/p> <p>The new transparent assessment process operated by the Public Appointments Service allows for applicants to indicate their interest in being appointed as chairperson and highlight the skills and experience they would bring to the position.  They can tick a box to say they wish to be considered for the position of chairperson.  This increases the information available to the Minister in making the decision.  It is appropriate that the Minister of the day continue to appoint the chairperson of a public body such as the National Concert Hall because it is very important that the chairperson and the Minister have a good relationship.  The chairperson is the key link with the Minister of the day.  I, therefore, cannot accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#EE00700","speaker":"973"},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":181,"content":"<p>The Minister may have noticed that, tempted as I may have been to do so, I did not get into the question of political appointments to boards and I will not do so at this stage because what she has said actually strengthens our argument.  It is welcome that people will be appointed through the PAS system as it will depoliticise the process.  However, the Minister of the day might not personally know the people appointed and might have never worked with them.  Board members will appoint the chairperson, but most of the time they will spend together will be at board meetings where they will make decisions.  The best way to decide who the best person is to run meetings effectively is to sit in at meetings with the candidates.  We probably have all had experience of being on boards where we did not have a good chairperson and things did not move as quickly or efficiently as they should have, just as we will have had experience of boards with a very good chairperson who allowed everybody the space to make his or her points.  The board members would be in a much better position to make this decision than the Minister.  The Minister has appointed people who technically have the competence to be chairperson and have passed through the PAS system; therefore, they should all have reached the necessary level of expertise, not in every respect but enough to be on the board.

This year's production of Hansel and Gretel featured the children sitting in cardboard boxes.  The programme notes helpfully added that this was to reflect the neoliberal economics in Europe where Ministers practised austerity policies and, therefore, the festival could not afford sets as normal for the production.  I must say that the music performed was sublime.  Those are the kinds of details that one does not need to get involved in but it happens all of the time.<\/p> <p>At present there is a play on the condom train to Belfast.  The sale of contraceptives was against Government policy at the time but we are allowed to celebrate the genius behind the train.  There is a play on the series of concerts that were scheduled to be performed by Garth Brooks that were cancelled by the chief executive of Dublin City Council, which is something that is subversive in terms of Government policy.  What were Yeats, Lady Gregory, Se&aacute;n O'Casey and J. M. Synge doing except precisely critiquing Government policy at the time?  Now we cherish their legacy.<\/p> <p>The play \"Sive\" was rejected on the first occasion it was submitted to the Abbey which was wrong and the people of Ireland have proved that to be the case.  We have such a record of censoring books, films, etc., that censorship should not be extended.  Colin Murphy writes all of the time about the disastrous people, as Senator Norris has said, who caused the financial collapse of this country.  Does this mean that the musical on catastrophic bankruptcy by Colin Murphy shall not be performed in the National Concert Hall because it will undoubtedly contain critiques of people who were out of their depth in financial matters?  If people want to sing about such matters or set them to music then that is fine by me.  The legislation seems to be in the old Lord Chamberlain territory of censoring the arts.  I can assure the Minister that we do not need to go there and believe the section should be removed.<\/p> <p>The Royal Irish Academy organised a seminar on these issues and on that occasion Mr. Pat Cooke of the UCD school of arts history and cultural policy, said in terms of pursuing cultural goals, \"The history of national institutions in Ireland reveals a fundamental ambivalence about whether they should be treated as functional arms of government or arm&rsquo;s length bodies with independent boards.\"  In terms of pursing cultural goals, they are not arms of the State.  Ministers and senior civil servants should grow up and allow a free theatre and free musicals to develop which would be beneficial for the rest of society and for all of us.<\/p> <p>This section is completely out of touch with the way younger people feel in this country at the moment.  The arts must be creative and if that annoys some old fogeys then tough.  Let us develop a creative society, one which we are always talking about doing in this country.  Let us stop this kind of silly censorship.  The chief executive officer is entitled to have whatever musicals he or she thinks will stimulate the cultural development of this country and, therefore, section 9 should go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#GG00300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I am not in favour of section 18(9).

In tandem with this accountability, there is an obligation on the director not to question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy.  This provision is limited and relates only to the appearance of the CEO before the Committee of Public Accounts on the issues outlined in subsection (8).  They mainly relate to financial issues.  This relates only to subsection (8).  This provision is not unusual and has appeared in a number of recent pieces of legislation, such as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 and the Education and Training Boards Act 2013.<\/p> <p>This is not gagging the CEO.  Nor indeed is it undermining the CEO.  A director can say what he or she wants, where he or she wants and when he or she wants, except in one place - at the Committee of Public Accounts.  That is the only place the director is asked not to comment on policy.  Section 27 requires the CEO to appear before other Oireachtas committees, where this restriction does not apply.  The CEO can say what he or she wants in front of any other Oireachtas committee and there is no intention to subject him or her to a different standard from that to which other CEOs of State organisations are held.

For example, if there was a directive from a Minister that touring would not be allowed and money was not to be spent on touring by any member of the National Concert Hall and they were not to go outside of Dublin, that would be reflected in the accounts.  Somebody at the Committee of Public Accounts could ask why no money was spent outside of Dublin or on touring.  Surely the CEO should be allowed have an opinion on that.

The Minister says the CEO can say whatever he or she likes to any other committee or to the media.  What is then so special about the Committee of Public Accounts?  I know it deals with money but this is taxpayers' money and the taxpayers are surely entitled to an understanding of the manner in which their money is spent or misspent.

The Minister and Senator Coghlan have recited various other committees and so on where something similar happens.

I challenged them, as did the former Senator, Joe O'Toole, when they were first introduced and we never received an appropriate answer.

I was happy to answer them; they were about programming, artistic stuff, touring.

I was not satisfied that this was the case.  Basically, it is increasingly emerging from this debate that what is at issue is making the Government uncomfortable and the expression of a contrary opinion on policy by the CEO might make the Government uncomfortable.  I think that is a damn good thing.  Governments should be made uncomfortable on a regular basis.  It is part of the whole process of accountability.<\/p> <p>The section refers to \"the regularity and propriety of the transactions recorded or required to be recorded in any book\".  Do they just say, \"Oh, yes, that's wonderful\", and maintain themselves in what has been described as neutral mode even though they know there is something absolutely stinking there as a result of Government policy?  Surely they should be allowed to warn.<\/p> <p>The section also refers to \"the economy and efficiency of the Board in the use of its resources\".  What would happen if, as a direct result of a Government policy, inefficiencies are created?  The CEO is not permitted to answer on that.  The section also refers to \"the systems, procedures and practices employed by the NCH for the purposes of evaluating the effectiveness of its operations\".  If something in Government policy inhibits this, again they are not able to say.<\/p> <p>So their testimony to the Committee of Public Accounts is thereby rendered virtually useless.  It is of no help in teasing out issues.  If something is wrong, instead of covering it up in order to render the Government more comfortable than it would be if the situation was open, they should actually expose the situation so it can be amended.  I feel quite strongly that there is no reason the chief executive should not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such a policy.  I think it is critical that they be given the freedom to do so.<\/p> <p>I presume that if there is a fundamental disagreement on policy, CEOs, if they are an honourable people, would remove themselves because they are not in a position to continue to fulfil a policy with which they disagree.  This happened to me as a member of a board.  A policy I proposed was opposed by one other member who engaged in very devious stratagems in order to discomfort me and ensure the policy sank.  She was successful and I immediately resigned because I said, \"A fundamental policy of mine, as CEO, has been destroyed.  Therefore I have lost the confidence.

Let me ask myself and inquire within.  Does it mean that he or she is one of the Taoiseach's nominees?  Senator Coghlan is nodding vigorously.  Then it is grammatically incorrect because it should read &quot;nominated to Seanad &Eacute;ireann&quot;.  I am nominated as a Member; I am nominated at every election.  I have to find a nominator, a seconder and eight other Senators to be nominated.  This means that from the very moment of my nomination, whether I am successful, and in the intervening period, between the nomination and the election, I am not available to the National Concert Hall, which is complete nonsense.  Because of the way it is phrased the Minister is ruling out candidates.  It is technically wrong, as well everything else.  I maintain that the board of the National Concert Hall would be enriched by allowing Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to be on it.  It may well be that no Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann will take up such a responsibility, but it most definitely should be open to Members of the Seanad to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#JJ01600","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Not for the first time, I find myself in almost total agreement with Senator David Norris.

In reference to section 11 my understanding is that somebody will cease to be a member of the board if he or she is adjudicated to be bankrupt.  Although Senator Diarmuid Wilson said he was pleased to see that bankrupts could be on the board, he is completely incorrect.  They cannot be members of the board.  That is a grey area.  I do not see why they should not, depending on the circumstances of the bankruptcy, but in my Second Stage speech I referred to the next sentence in subsection (3)(b), which reads that a person shall be excluded from membership of the board if he or she &ldquo;makes a composition or arrangement with creditors&rdquo;.  Harry Crosbie is someone for whom I have the greatest of respect.  He is responsible for the Grand Canal Theatre and has created something vital in the artistic life of this city.  He has made a composition with his creditors.  It is absolute lunacy that he would not be allowed to be a member of the board and I said so at the time.  I do not see any reason to include such a provision.  Unfortunately, my good friend Senator Diarmuid Wilson is wrong, bankrupts are not allowed to be members of the board.  Those who make arrangements with creditors are not allowed to be on it.  That is ridiculous, in particular in the case of members of the artistic community where people take a gamble on a production.  A Broadway show could go down the drain just like that; everyone is expecting it to make millions, but it just bombs.<\/p> <p>The Minister has parroted the phrase that the measure is included in other legislation.  That does not make it good legislation and does not render it immune to examination or scrutiny in this House.  She also instanced the issue of funding.  Why should someone who is involved at the coalface in the theatre or the National Concert Hall not come into this House and express a clear, cogent and factual position?  We are entitled to know.  Again, that is gagging.  Members of this House are entitled to receive full information.  I simply do not understand this.  It is not as if the individual Member was grubbing around in his or her wallet and going to put in a counter bid for something.  That would be a conflict of interest, but this is not.  This is a convergence of interests where the fact that a person is a Member of the Seanad and a board member puts them in a position where he or she can give a particularly illuminating answer to questions raised in this House.  The Minister can push the Bill through and use the force of numbers to win the vote, but if she wins it, she will not win the argument because there is absolutely no reason to include this provision.  That it is tradition is not an argument.  It is not a good idea, regardless of the fact that it has been included so many times in legislation and the Ministers responsible have got away with it.  It is not a good idea if it is bad legislation.  I am convinced that this is bad legislation and it is also insulting to the House.<\/p> <p>Senator Diarmuid Wilson referred to members of county councils.

I understand we are to be joined by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, who will also contribute to the Bill I have proposed, the Education (Welfare) (Amendment) Bill 2015.<\/p> <p>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 to increase the minimum school age from 16 to 17 and to allow vocational apprenticeships, the primary purpose of which are educational, to count as school attendance.  The Bill also proposes to amend the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996 and change the minimum age of employment for young people from 16 to 17.  I hope it is not a sign of things to come but as I was preparing my speech for the debate, my computer blew up so please excuse me if I go from one to the other.  It literally blew up while I was typing not that there was anything explosive in it.<\/p> <p>The Bill comprises five sections.  Section 1 deals with the amendment of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.  Section 2 deals with the amendment of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996.  Section 3 deals with vocational apprenticeships.  Section 4 deals with the commencement and section 5 deals with the Short Title and collective citation.<\/p> <p>I am delighted the both Ministers, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and Deputy James Reilly, will contribute to the debate because while primary responsibility for the implementation of and any amendment to the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 lies with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the Minister for Education and Skills retains responsibility for a number of schools and further education and training related provisions.  While it is the Department of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, which has responsibility for setting the school leaving age, the proposals contained in the Bill also impact on the policy remit of the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  This is a good all-rounder and is cross-departmental and we need to see more of this.<\/p> <p>As spokesperson for education and as a person with many years experience in the classroom and having seen young people leave school at a young age with no formal qualification, I hope this Bill will improve the lives of young people by ensuring they have a better education and or qualification on leaving.  That was the purpose behind drafting this Bill.<\/p> <p>In 1972 the school leaving age increased from 14 to 15 years of age.  The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 increased the age to 16 years or on completion of three years of secondary education whichever is the later.  Thankfully, I have noticed a decrease in the number of early school leavers in latter years.  In fact, Ireland's early school leaver rate has dropped from 9.7% in 2012 to 6.9% in 2014, which is well below the EU average of 11.2% for 2014.  When all the EU countries are considered, Ireland is ranked tenth out of 28 and below our target under the Europe 2020 strategy, so we are well on course.  It is clear that many students are staying on to complete the leaving certificate.<\/p> <p>The figures for the junior certificate released by the Department of Education and Skills' analysis of school retention rates among State aided schools last February noted that from the numbers who enrolled in 2008, as first time enrolments, 96.8% sat the junior certificate in 2011 or 2012 and 90% sat the leaving certificate in 2013 or 2014.  The numbers are also increasing in DEIS schools in recent years with its current level at 82.1%.  The discrepancy between DEIS and non-DEIS schools is clear.  While these figures are encouraging, it is important that we do more to ensure our young people, particularly those in DEIS schools, get every opportunity and encouragement to stay at school until at least the age of 17 years.<\/p> <p>The report notes that the true education retention figure comparable to upper secondary level education is probably higher as the report does not have any analysis of students who pursue different educational pathways which can provide qualifications equivalent to that of the leaving certificate or the national framework of qualifications.  For example, some apprenticeships, PLC courses and so on can attain level four and level five on the national framework of qualifications which is the same as the leaving certificate but are not included on the retention analysis.  My colleague will address the issue of apprenticeships.<\/p> <p>&Oacute; Fiaich College in my hometown of Dundalk is very supportive of young people who have left school early.  Recently, it has introduced a level four course for people who left school early and who wish to return to education.  It is brilliant that colleges and institutes are doing so much to encourage people back into education.  Dundalk Institute of Technology, one of the leading institutes of technology, is offering opportunities to further study for people who have completed apprenticeships and qualifications to move up the scale to a level six or level seven qualification.<\/p> <p>It is appropriate to note that of almost 3,000 apprenticeships registered with SOLAS in 2014, only 1% was 16 years of age, 4% were aged 17 or 18, 19% were aged 19, 15% were aged 20 and 44% were aged over 22.  It is good to note they are staying on.  Some 25% of these apprentices had completed the junior certificate and 68% had completed the leaving certificate, with 7% having other qualifications.<\/p> <p>Figures indicate that the majority of dropout at second level occurs between fifth and sixth year or within the last two years in school, with 3.5% leaving school around this time.  It is probably the most vulnerable time when they are growing up and asking what their chances are.  Around this age, it is important to try to hold on to them in school.  Approximately 2% leave school directly after the junior certificate.<\/p> <p>The Department of Education and Skills undertook a report on early school leavers from post-primary schools, pupils enrolled in 2009-10 but not in 2010-11, entitled Early Leavers - What Next?, which showed that a considerable proportion entered other forms of education or training.  Almost 70% had moved into PLC courses, F&Aacute;S courses, education or training outside the State, Youthreach or private educational institutions.<\/p> <p>We need to address the reasons for early school leaving.  A school leavers' survey was conducted by the Department of Education and Skills in 2007, eight years ago, but the reasons for leaving then are still pertinent today.  Some 62% of those who left school early cited school factors as the reason, 60% cited economic or work factors, 14% family factors and 5% health factors.  A further study by the ESRI in 2010 on the dynamics of early school leaving noted that those who left school early did so because they felt rejected by the school, reporting a lack of encouragement from the school or, in some cases, being expelled.  Some felt rejection of the school, dislike of school, rules, teachers or other students or feelings of under achievement.  Labour market opportunities were also cited as were personal issues and sometimes a combination of all four.  Even since 2010, schools around the country are doing what they can to improve and to encourage students to stay.  When the new junior certificate comes on stream the syllabi will be even more interesting and will relate to the person's individuality and interest.  That will be another positive step forward.<\/p> <p>Thankfully, the vast majority of our students today sail through school with no problems and complete their education at 17 or 18 years.  However, it is the small minority who need encouragement.  We have many resources and second chance opportunities such as Youthreach, community training centres and apprenticeships.<\/p> <p>In regard to Traveller culture, I have known students who have left school immediately after the junior certificate or on their 16th birthday in order to marry.  I have spoken before of one particular student I had who was particularly gifted at school but who did not return after her junior certificate.  Within two years, she had three small children.  We need to ensure that every pathway is available for these people to return to education and when they make the decision to leave that the door is always open for them to come back into education.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Moran:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2388\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2388&amp;amp;pid=MaryMoran&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have met students who left school at 16.

It is great that two high profile Ministers have taken an interest in this Bill and that it is to be accepted.<\/p> <p>The purpose of this Bill is to ensure children remain in formal education as long as possible.  For those who are interested in education and want to have a leaving certificate behind them or go on to college, this Bill will have no affect at all.  It is highly unlikely that children as young as 16 years would sit the leaving certificate examination.  Ensuring children continue in education and training until the age of 17 could bring about positive results.  This will incentivise our young people to stay in school and further their education so that they will have an opportunity to enter the knowledge-based economy.  A further year spent in education, on a vocational course, on an apprenticeship or in a job with a certain amount of training will help ensure that young people who stay in school until they are 17 years of age will have better prospects and will be better prepared and equipped for their journey towards meaningful employment.<\/p> <p>Earlier today we dealt with the Chid Care (Amendment) Bill 2015 and during the debate, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, said that children who sit the leaving certificate examination or go on to third level education have better employment opportunities and, generally, better prospects in life.  However, there are children who drop out of education.  These are the children we must protect and help.  We must put in place programmes and supports that will entice them to remain in education.  These young teenagers have no income as they cannot access social welfare benefits until they are 18 years of age.  Some, of course, may be lucky enough to find employment but there are those who do not.  Having nothing to do and all day to do it can lead to multiple problems for these children.  Some may experience mental health issues, others may resort to petty crime and, often, more serious crime while others may delve in drugs or alcohol.  I am not suggesting that all early school-leavers will end up going down this road but, unfortunately, many do.  I hope that by ensuring they remain in formal education for as long as possible, they will see education as the best route out of poverty and the best way to enhance their prospects and to equip themselves with the skills needed for their future lives.<\/p> <p>According to a McKinsey report, the primary reason young people are held back is because some of them lack the skills relevant to the workplace.  There are school-leavers who are not academically inclined.  Our concern over the years has been that young people who leave compulsory education will enter the labour market without adequate skills and basic qualifications.  This problem needs to be tackled.  We are now in an era where unskilled jobs are slowly ceasing to exist.  Manual labour and manufacturing is on a decline.  Based on a study from the expert group on future skills, there is an increasing growth in the demand for skilled labour.  These skilled jobs that are reasonably well paid require a level of skill and education.  The Department of Education and Skills Youthreach programme has so far been successful in leading early school-leavers aged 15 to 20 back into education.  It is a fact that not all students are academically-minded.  I know a young teenager who is not academically-minded but could cook for Ireland.  I have been encouraging him to train as a chef.  The Minister and I recently visited the Kerry College of Further Education in Tralee which runs a chef training course which is accessible to students outside of the CAO process.  There is something out there for everyone.  The provision of education and training in all areas is key to ensuring all people have access to education.<\/p> <p>According to Dr. John Bamber, there is a need to recognise and value non-formal learning in a creative and innovative way, raising the visibility of skills acquired outside the formal system and fostering complementarity between non-formal and formal learning, while at the same time promoting equal opportunities.  Youthreach provides young people with opportunities for basic education, personal development, vocational training and work experience in respect of which they acquire certification, following which they can then choose a career that best suits them.  The programme, which operates full-time and throughout the year and has a continuous intake policy also gives the school-leaver the opportunity to participate in any leaving certificate applied course or to take up an apprenticeship.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Kerry Diocesan Youth Service which operates four Youthreach programmes, each of which caters for 25 students.  It is doing fantastic work.  During my engagement with those involved, I asked about the progression rate in respect of people who participate in its Youthreach programmes.  The following are data in relation to only one of its programmes.  One student progressed into PLC level 5, sports and recreation in Tralee; eight young people went on to do the leaving certificate applied; four moved into PLC courses in the Kerry College of Further Education; three moved into level 4 in Tralee community training centre; one became a new mother but rather than give up on her educational plan took up night classes with KETB in the area of beauty and will follow this up in 2016 with a full-time course; one gained employment and one had a baby and decided to stay at home parenting for the next year.  One can see from this information just how valuable Youthreach programmes are.  It is important they are supported in continuing their work.  I understand Youthreach programmes and apprenticeship providers receive a small amount of funding.  We must ensure that education-type training leads to employment.  I welcome that under this Bill children of 16 and 17 years of age who take up an apprenticeship will be deemed to be furthering their education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#OO00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I thank the Labour Party Senators for introducing this Private Members' Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting its passage through the Houses but will be tabling amendments to it on Committee Stage.  There is merit in this legislation in the context of the many issues currently affecting our young people.  Countries across the developed world are increasing the age in respect of which children are legally obliged to remain in secondary education and for a number of reasons, some of which are pertinent in Ireland, including the high level of unemployment among young people.  This is a difficulty being experienced by not only Ireland but across other countries in Europe, including Spain and other southern European countries.  There are benefits to increasing the age limit in this regard from 16 years to 17 years, all of which have been well documented.  Ensuring children remain in education for longer helps in tackling the issue of youth unemployment.  <\/p> <p>In 1972, the UK increased the age at which a student may leave secondary education to 16 years, at which time changes were also introduced here.  The UK further increased the age in this regard to 18 years in an effort to tackle youth unemployment levels.  According to reports youth unemployment among the under 25s in the UK is approximately 23%.  I understand the percentage for Ireland in this regard is similar.   In particular parts of Northern Ireland, youth employment is close to 50%.  I recently read an article by Danny Blanchflower, a famous footballer, in which he said he expressed grave concern that the high level of youth unemployment in Northern Ireland could undo the good work of the peace process.  The level of youth unemployment in some parts of Derry and Belfast is so high it is impacting negatively on communities.  Any measure that supports young people must be welcomed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2261\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2261&amp;amp;pid=BrianODomhnaill&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, retaining young people at second level does not necessarily translate into greater opportunities for them and issues have emerged and will emerge such as the quality of education provided.  I have read that in Spain the age until which a student was legally obliged to stay in school was raised, but what happened was that students who did not wish to be there retaliated and this led to an increase in the level of teacher absenteeism.  Consequently, there are issues in this regard that must be challenged.  It should not be a one-size-fits-all approach because certain pupils may not be academically inclined and may be more suited to apprenticeship programmes and so on.  I look with envy at the Germans because of the way in which they have manufactured their apprenticeship programme.  I remember that, as late as 2010, the construction sector was on the floor but building courses were still being offered by F&Aacute;S in County Donegal to young apprenticeship students.  The system was not fit for purpose.  Therefore,  the apprenticeship programme as a whole must be considered.  Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice, in particular, has raised this issue in the other House and brought forward proposals in that regard.  Those students, particularly male students, who may not be academically inclined must be provided with opportunities to excel in apprenticeship programmes.  I note, for example, that Roy Keane, one of Ireland's most senior soccer internationals of all time and one of the best players in the world, came through a F&Aacute;S apprenticeship programme.  There are sports apprenticeship programmes that could be made available.  In this context, I note that the country has a massive obesity problem.  The new SOLAS initiative is excellent, but it must make its apprenticeship programmes more attractive and fit for purpose.  This challenge must be addressed in conjunction with this legislation.<br\/><br\/>Obviously, Ireland now operates in a global economy and the skill sets required are much greater than in the 1960s and 1970s when the age until which one stayed at school was much lower.  This issue must be examined.  The globalisation agenda and multinational corporations are driving the employment agenda worldwide, not just in Ireland, and Members must ensure graduates emerging from school or third level colleges are fit for purpose.  As I mentioned, there are problems associated with raising the school leaving age, in that pupils who did not wish to stay in education might become disruptive.  However, the recent ESRI report on school retention outlined that lack of access to high quality career guidance was detrimental to kids aged 16 and 17 years.  The lack of such a service has been detrimental to many second level schools.  While I am not being political on this issue, the move away from career guidance provision on an<i>ex quota<\/i>teacher basis was incorrect and has had a major impact.  I recall that when I sat the leaving certificate examination at 17 years of age, I did not have a clue about what I wanted to do and had it not been for the career guidance advice available in the school, I could have ended up anywhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#OO00300","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":265,"content":"<p>In politics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#PP00200","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":266,"content":"<p>The career guidance offered at the time certainly did not include politics, but my point is the provision of career guidance must also be considered.

I am sharing time with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly.  As Senator Mary Moran stated, while responsibility for setting the school leaving age comes within the policy remit of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the proposals contained in the Bill have significant implications for the areas that come within my remit in the Department of Education and Skills.  I wish to make it clear that the Government will support the passage of the Bill through Second Stage and it is welcome to hear that the Opposition is also supporting it.  Any proposal that seeks to retain children in school is welcome and I acknowledge the initiative of Senator Mary Moran in preparing the draft legislation and bringing it before the House.  My own objective for all children and young people is that they engage positively with education and complete their schooling, having achieved a qualification at upper second level.  I am particularly conscious of the need to maintain supports for schools aimed at tackling educational disadvantage.  As Members are aware, the Department is reviewing the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, programme.  The review which I announced earlier this year is under way and a particular priority of mine.  Through it, I wish to ensure those children and young people most of risk of not progressing and reaching their potential in education are adequately supported.<\/p> <p>I certainly welcome the Bill and the Government is supporting it, but there are a number of issues that should be considered, some of which I note were raised in the contributions of the three Senators who have spoken thus far.  It is important to note that the provisions of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 generally, including those relating to the minimum school leaving age and vocational training, were introduced following extensive consultation with all relevant education and other stakeholders.  As engagement with the relevant partners is something that generally happens in the education sector, I suggest a similar engagement would be a good idea with regard to this legislation.  A key stakeholder group on this occasion is, of course, that comprising the children and young people, and their parents, who will be immediately affected by the proposed changes.  Ireland has an early school leavers rate of 8.4%, which is below the European Union's Europe 2020 target of 10% and close to Ireland's own adopted target of 8% by 2020.  In addition, as Senator Mary Moran mentioned, my Department's most recent school retention figures show the overall rate of pupils staying on to complete their leaving certificate examinations has increased to just over 90%.  It also is known that the majority of students who drop-out at second level do so between the first and second years of senior cycle, usually at the age of 17 or 18 years.  School retention data do not, of course, take account of participation in apprenticeship and out-of-school programmes and other training within the first year of leaving school.  I will turn to these three sectors shortly as they were raised by the three Senators who have spoken.  Rraising the minimum age to 17 years may result, therefore, in students being required to remain in school for transition year or the first year of senior cycle before pursuing these options and it would be helpful to consider why 16-year olds are leaving school early.  It is possible, however, that a large number do not leave to take up employment or apprenticeships; rather, 16-year olds who leave school are likely to have experienced significant challenges in the school system, either in managing themselves or being managed, and evidence of this view is expressed in the Youthreach learner interviews during evaluations carried out by my Department's inspectorate.  Again, Senators Mary Moran and Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to studies carried out of early school leaving.  In circumstances such as these a key question would focus on a school's capacity to continue to manage a student who has particular problems in school, who may be unhappy in school or who may have repeated challenging behaviour.  Thus, some schools, particularly DEIS schools where early school leaving is more prevalent, might require further supports to assist them in managing the retention of students to 17 years.<\/p> <p>As Senators Mary Moran and Marie Moloney referred to Youthreach, Senator Mary Moran referred to Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, and SOLAS and all three Senators referred to apprenticeships, I wish to comment briefly on them.  An increase in the school leaving age would also have an impact in centres other than schools such as Youthreach and community training programmes where the training allowance payable to 16 and 17-year olds is &euro;40 per week.  Senator Marie Moloney suggested that perhaps these participants might be counted as being in school.  This may be a point at which Members must tease out the issue because I do not believe any of the Senators who spoke was suggesting they be considered early school leavers.  Perhaps this is a point to which we might return after the debate.  This level of payment, &euro;40 per week, is not regarded as an incentive to attract young people away from school, but it provides some encouragement for those who have dropped out of school to attend an alternative provision.  Youthreach is my Department's response to early school leaving and provides places for learners to continue their education when they have dropped out of mainstream school.  However, it is important to state that while Youthreach is a second-chance programme, it fulfils the requirement of compulsory school attendance in certain limited circumstances where returning to mainstream school is not a possibility.  Again, this point could be teased out.  As a general principle Youthreach centres are not encouraged to accept anyone who is of compulsory schoolgoing age.  An increase in the entry age to 17 years would have implications for the demand for places and the profile of allowances.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Jan O'Sullivan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1754\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1754&amp;amp;pid=JanOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I do not think the intention is to in any way limit what Youthreach does. <\/p><p>The foregoing examples show that engagement with education and other professionals working in this area is essential to ensure any policy change will meet its objective and that it will not have unintended consequences for the target group or students generally.<\/p><p>The implications for SOLAS and employers of the inclusion of apprenticeships within the scope of educational welfare legislation also require careful consideration.  The specific proposal to allow apprenticeships to be regarded as school attendance may be somewhat at odds with the fact that apprentices are employed directly by the enterprise sector.  That issue would need to be teased out.  We do not want apprenticeships to be seen as an opt-out from formal education; the nature of apprenticeships has changed in recent years and even many traditional apprenticeships have become more technology-focused.  A basic leaving certificate qualification is now regarded as desirable for entry into apprenticeship and almost 70% of entrants present qualifications at that level.  It is important that key stakeholders such as employers are included in the consultation process on this provision.  Senator Mary Moran referred to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation as being the third Department involved in this proposal.  The new apprenticeship system which I announced recently is an example of the approach needed for effective programme development and was based on widespread consultation and a collegiate approach to policy development.  It includes chefs, as mentioned by Senator Marie Moloney.  It also includes butchers, the drivers of articulated trucks and areas such as financial services.  It is quite broad and 25 will come on stream this year.  <\/p><p>The proposed change to the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996 would represent a significant change in the law for employers and my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has asked that there be consultation with his Department to allow full consideration of the proposed legislative changes.  <\/p><p>I hope these comments have identified some of the key issues that need to be considered and further teased out during the passage of this legislation.  I also hope they have been helpful as I have made them in an attempt to positively influence the proposal.  I again thank Senator Mary Moran for her initiative in bringing forward this proposal and look forward to the comments of other speakers and engaging further on the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#PP00500","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#QQ00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address Seanad &Eacute;ireann in response to the Education (Welfare) (Amendment) Bill 2015 put forward by Senator Mary Moran.  Any proposal that seeks to raise the education and skill level of young people when they leave school and set out to make their way in the world must be welcome.<\/p> <p>Government policy objectives are laid out in a national policy framework for children and young people, Better Outcomes, Brighter Future, which aims to support children and young people as they are today and who they can become in the future.  Unsurprisingly, ensuring children and young people can achieve their full potential in learning and development is a key national outcome in the framework.  This is a goal that is relevant at every stage of a child&rsquo;s life, from the first months through to adulthood.  The Bill addresses the latter part of that cycle, the minimum age at which a young person can leave the formal education system.<\/p> <p>From my perspective as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the most important aspect to consider in this regard is the level and nature of education and skills young people have the opportunity to acquire, rather than the young person&rsquo;s age.  Young people must have the education and skills they need to make a decent and independent life for themselves and, I hope, their families in the future.  There are a range of measures in place to support children and young people&rsquo;s participation in education.  They include fostering an inclusive school environment, bringing a whole-school approach to health and well-being as the basis for effective learning and ensuring a commitment to equality is firmly embedded in school planning arrangements in order that children in all their diversity have the opportunity to flourish.<\/p> <p>It is important to recognise that one path does not suit all children, provision should promote different learning styles and recognise the acquisition of different skills and competencies.  During consultations on the recently published national youth strategy, young people ranked learning and development as one of their top three priorities.  They stressed the need for an adaptable education system which supported all young people, including those less academically oriented, by providing alternative opportunities, practical skills and vocational education.  In that context, I welcome section 3 of the Bill which proposes that participation in vocational apprenticeships should satisfy the school attendance requirement, while noting the comments of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, and recognising that this proposal requires further consideration.  I also acknowledge the role of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in this regard, in supporting non-formal learning, both in and out of school settings.  This year some &euro;50 million in funding will support the voluntary youth services providing these opportunities for almost 380,000 young people.<\/p> <p>The Department of Children and Youth Affairs works closely with the Department of Education and Skills to secure the best outcomes for all children and young people, but the children at risk of early school leaving and educational disadvantage must be of particular concern to us all.  Some 8.4% of children leave school early.  That figure does not take account of those who go on to apprenticeships or other out-of-school training programmes within the first year of leaving school; it is lower than the EU 2020 target of 10% and there have been improvements in retention rates among children in disadvantaged areas in recent years, but the figure is still far too high.  Where young people leave school without the education and skills they need to allow them to create a decent and independent life for themselves and their families, we have failed.  While that failure impacts most severely on the young people concerned, we all suffer the lost potential of each of the children who leaves school early.<\/p> <p>As part of the Government&rsquo;s fundamental reform of provision for children and families, responsibility for educational welfare has been brought within the remit of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 requires that every child receive a minimum standard of education and Tusla&rsquo;s educational welfare service includes several key supports for educationally disadvantaged children, including educational welfare officers, the school completion programme and the home-school community liaison programme.  Effective responses to these issues must be outcome-focused and determined in collaboration with children and young people, their families and schools, as well as other agencies, where relevant.  It may sound obvious, but it is easily forgotten that if we want to achieve better outcomes for children and young people, we must listen to them and work to support their parents and families.  Parents are the primary educators of their children and the evidence tells us that family involvement is one of the key determinants of educational outcomes. <\/p> <p>We must take account of the evidence about what works best for children and families when it comes to good educational outcomes.  The recent Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, review of the school completion programme highlighted the need for improvements in governance and management, which are being implemented by Tusla, but was generally positive about the impact of the programme.  Supporting children at critical transition points from preschool to primary and from primary to secondary school is also important to successful outcomes.  Fundamentally, prevention and early intervention are much more effective than \"cure\".  Appropriate early intervention, allied with high quality early years services, is the best way to ensure every child has a real and meaningful opportunity to realise his or her full potential, something that we all want for our children.  <\/p> <p>The fundamental reform of child and family services that the Government is implementing provides a real opportunity to change the way we interact with children and families to combat educational disadvantage.  We need to leverage all of our investments in children and families to get the best results.  I recently announced a major expansion of free preschool education and believe this investment, together with the ESRI review of the school completion programme, provides a real opportunity to embed the learning about early intervention and working with children and families to develop more effective responses to the issue of educational disadvantage.  The first step in developing that more effective response must be listening to children and families.  I am deeply committed to including children and young people in decisions that affect their Iives, not only because it is the right thing to do but also because it helps us to develop better policy.  Nobody knows better than the children who have been through the system what needs to change.  Last June I launched Ireland&rsquo;s first national strategy for children and young people's participation in decision-making, 2015 to 2020.  In that context, Senators may be interested to know that the topic selected by young people for the next D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g, which takes place on 27 November in Croke Park, is \"The need for young people to have a stronger voice in their education and schools\".  l am very pleased, therefore, that the Minister for Education and Skills has agreed to join me at the event and address the young people attending and participate in the question and answer session.<\/p> <p>The question of school leaving age is certainly one that should be discussed with children and parents, but the members of D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g will vote at the November session on the priority aspect of the education system they want to change.  The 31 young people from the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g national executive will follow up on that objective in the following two years, supported by officials in the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs and Education and Skills.  <\/p> <p>I commend the Senator's initiative in bringing forward the Bill which has the potential to strengthen the legislative framework within which Tusla undertakes its work.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Educational welfare service can involve an early intervention which may be relatively brief in nature or, where the problem is more complex, educational welfare officers can provide a more intensive and ongoing support for the child and family.  Last year there were more than 17,000 early interventions with more intensive support being provided to over 2,400 children.<\/p><p>Under the school completion programme, Tusla provides a range of targeted supports, which can include homework clubs, breakfast clubs, mentoring, learning support, social and personal development as well as a range of out-of-school supports to approximately 37,000 children to enhance their participation in and engagement with education and school life.  The home-school liaison aims to build on those important links between families, schools and local communities to support children's learning.<\/p><p>I know Senators will appreciate the need for consultation with a wide range of stakeholders to fully consider all the impacts of such a change.  We have the policies and structures in place to ensure children and young people can have their say in the policies that most impact on their lives.  Their perspectives are important and their input can enrich the discussions about this important measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#QQ00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I can only give the Minister a C1, as he went slightly over his time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#RR00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  The Bill is interesting and I compliment Senator Moran - in fact I should have introduced such a Bill, myself.  It is interesting to have both Ministers responding and we should have more of this because both of them have responsibility for that age group.  The reason I say I should have introduced such a Bill is that in 2010, the Oireachtas committee did an early school-leaving study and I was the rapporteur at the time.  I worked with the Educational Research Centre as the expert group.  We just stopped short of recommending moving the age to 17.  So this is timely.<\/p> <p>In 2010 early school leaving rates were at 16% and the Minister is now saying it is 8.1% or 8.4%.  I might query his figures because I recently heard it was at 11%, but we will not fight over it.  That is a national figure.  Obviously in middle-class well-to-do areas there is no early school leaving at all; they are all doing their leaving certificate examinations and going on to college.  However, in some disadvantaged areas that figure is 20% to 25%.  Early school leaving is an issue and it is a benchmark for inequity and poor life chances.  As other Senators rightly mentioned, we need many pathways to futures.  The Minister has said he wants better outcomes for brighter futures, which is the key.<\/p> <p>When we interviewed the children who were leaving school early we found six at-risk groups.  One was children with learning difficulties and special educational needs.  Another was LGBT children because they found it difficult to deal with their sexuality while at school.  ADHD children was a very big group and many of them ended up in prison because children with an attention deficit disorder act without thinking and create many behavioural challenges, not just in the classroom, but in society.  Children with family, home and intergenerational issues formed another group.  The one group that was a big surprise comprised children with ill health.  The Minister might say that is no surprise, but a factor that emerged was that girls who were raped at second level school also left school early because they were not believed by the school system.  The final group at risk were Travellers, which again was no surprise.<\/p> <p>While I am discussing the issue of ill health, the Minister will be familiar with the concerns about the HPV vaccine, Gardasil.  At the moment 106 girls have documented their experiences of ill health since receiving the Gardasil vaccine.  Their levels of absenteeism are very high.  One parent recently brought me a certificate showing that her child had 50 absent days owing to feeling debilitated and not being able to get out of bed.  Some of these children are spending 18 to 20 hours in bed.  One mother told me that her daughter was vomiting up to 11 times in an hour between dizziness and fainting, etc.<\/p> <p>I had tabled a motion on this issue this week but it was ruled out of order by the Cathaoirleach.  I am glad the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is hearing about this now from me.  We need a dedicated multidisciplinary team appointed to the assessment and treatment of those girls because they are sick children.  They are all within the remit of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs because they are under 18.  It is affecting their life chances and their outcomes, which is also within his brief.  That is an aside and I am deliberately using this motion to highlight the issue because ill health came up as a reason for children leaving school early.  I am not saying the vaccine is a direct cause but an outcome of it is that children have been getting sick.  There seems to be a pattern of sporty and athletic children who are getting quite sick.  It is very worrying and we need to look at it.<\/p> <p>I return to the recommendations of our study.  The Minister will not be surprised that to achieve better outcomes the foundation is investing in family and education.  The recommendation was to invest early.  Obviously, the Government is putting resources into that with the funding of the second preschool year.  I acknowledge that and I am delighted with it because it was one of the key recommendations of our study.  However, there are other issues around that.<\/p> <p>The other requirement is to track at-risk children.  Senator Jim D'Arcy will be very familiar with much of this because in the educational system we know that certain children are at risk and the teachers can identify those children very early.<\/p> <p>As the Minister said, in education one size does not fit all.  We need to be very aware of children's learning styles and to teach using creative approaches.  Another recommendation from our study was the need to teach children how to learn and how to study.  Not every child knows how to learn.  Having many pathways is vital, as is good career guidance, as Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill mentioned.  Career guidance in this country has been very poor.  I believe we have 499 children per guidance counsellor, which makes things impossible.  They are not just giving career guidance but are also providing counselling.  With more children having mental health issues, personal issues or interpersonal issues, which are very common with children going through puberty, we need more career guidance teachers in the system.<\/p> <p>It is good to see a focus on apprenticeships and I know the Minister for Education and Skills has a clear commitment to this area.  Apprenticeships are vital because children learn differently and learning in the workplace is a style that will suit many.<\/p> <p>There is a lot to say about what provides a good quality of education for the child.  There is a lot to say about the importance of investing in the family because those with a good family and a good education are well on their way.  I thank the Minister for listening and I thank Senator Moran and her colleagues for introducing the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#RR00300","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I commend Senators Moran and Maloney, and the other Labour Senators on introducing this Private Members' Bill, the purpose of which is to increase the school-leaving age to 17.  Many children for one reason or another do not thrive in the normal school setting and either drop out early or do not succeed in having a successful outcome to their secondary education.<\/p> <p>For many years now the Irish education system was a pyramid with academic achievement at the top of that pyramid.  Academic achievement is very commendable and for those with university degrees the outlook is usually good.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jim D'Arcy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2383\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2383&amp;amp;pid=JimDarcy&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The reality is that there are different paths to success and fulfilment, a point which the Government recognises.  As a member of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Committee on Culture, Science, Education and Media, I was involved in the report by Mr. Piotr Wach of Poland, Raising the Status of Vocational Education and Training.  In it he stated, \"It is time for a strategic vision to restore vocational training to its rightful place, including urgent measures to improve its quality, increase its attractiveness and bring it into line with employers&rsquo; needs\".<\/p><p>The Government has done great work in raising the status of vocational education and training, not least through the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 and the Further Education and Training Act 2013.  I am pleased the Bill makes specific provision for the continuing education and training of young persons aged 16 and 17 years who have left school early to take up employment.  It provides for the registration of early school leavers with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and for the agency to assist them in availing of appropriate educational and training opportunities.<\/p><p>There are different paths to success and fulfilment which have, historically, been underexplored in this country.  It has been said we should aim for a third-level entry rate of 70% of secondary school leavers.  In Germany, the largest and most successful economy in Europe, the figure is 50% with a corresponding higher rate of entry into the vocational, skills and apprenticeship sector.  In Ireland, everyone aspires to third level as the summit of educational achievement.  We need a change of attitude which values all forms of education equally, a point on which the Government has proactively pursued.  In this respect, it is worth noting the skills and training sector has traditionally provided the entrepreneurs and wealth creators that our country so badly needs.  In Finland, a country often lauded as the exemplar for good educational practice, about 50% of children move into the further education sector upon leaving secondary school as their first choice.<\/p><p>The raising of the school age to 17 will not work completely for positive outcomes for individual children unless the further education and training sector is expanded, with the consequent need for more resources.  For several years, due to the significant economic downturn, we have been working within the limits and tolerances of the medium in the provision of resources.  For example, there is still a cap on post-leaving certificate places, which should be removed shortly.  We need to upgrade the status of vocational education and training to the level of esteem in which third level is held.  We must increase the number of apprenticeships.  Currently, we have 27 with a further 25 planned, while in Germany there are over 300 apprenticeships.<\/p><p>Another way to promote retention at school longer is through the provision of traineeships.  Cavan and Monaghan Education and Training Board has a traineeship in engineering, developed and running in conjunction with Combilift, for an original equipment manufacturer technician.  At the end of the course, the student can go into the workforce as a semi-skilled engineering operative or move on to an apprenticeship.  Combilift awards a student bursary of &euro;5,000 per year to successful applicants, paid weekly at &euro;100, to each successful student.  This is one way to encourage young people to stay in the system.<\/p><p>When the school leaving age is raised to 17, the challenge is to educate and train for the labour market, not because of the market.  In that sense, course provision must be further expanded and resourced to ensure students stay at school because we have provided them with the opportunity to make suitable choices that lead to career progression opportunities, not because they are forced to stay.  We want them to stay as it will offer them a bright future and contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s future growth and development in a holistic way.  We must ensure they want to stay because they will get access to the courses they want and need, and which will offer them the opportunity to transfer learning and skills.  More importantly, these courses must offer them upward progression through the national framework of qualifications and career development.  It should be about the provision of courses that people will want to do to ensure progression with proper supports to success in a choice-based system that leads to personal fulfilment and success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#RR00400","speaker":"1166","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I thank both the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, for contributing to this debate.  When a cross-departmental issue is debated, it is good there is more than one Minister in the House and that the different Departments take an interest in it.  I thank all my colleagues who voiced their support for the Bill.  I am delighted this will not go to a vote or that there are any major objections to it.<\/p> <p>Both Ministers raised some issues, of which I was aware, about how the Bill is currently drafted.  However, we all agree the basis for the Bill is there.  I look forward to moving this on to Committee Stage.  I agree that before that, consultation is necessary between all stakeholders, namely the schools, employers and young people.  I am delighted the next D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g will be debating this issue and look forward to its recommendations on it.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Education and Skills raised a valid point about the issue of making supports available for those students with challenging behaviour to ensure they will remain in school.  There is also the point about the onus being on schools to maintain those students.  It is important we ensure all the supports necessary are on hand and available for them.  I know from speaking to people involved in the school completion programme how important it is to ensure the resources and funding are in place.  Last weekend, I was speaking to people about the cuts which have been made in the programme.  It is vital these students are supported and the funding remains available for them.<\/p> <p>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to taking Committee Stage in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#SS00200","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447237800,"counter":278,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":279,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#SS00400","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1447237800,"counter":280,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015111100002#SS00500","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447237800,"counter":281,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 17 November 2015.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447237800,"counter":282,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 12 November 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
