I extend my best wishes to the Senator for her term in the Seanad and look forward to her contribution to debate.  I note her arrival coincides with a week where very little is happening in the House.<\/p><p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to move motion No. 7 on the Order Paper.  I do so in response to the Government's decision to set aside Standing Orders on Friday by going above the heads of members of the established Committee of Selection.  Chaired by the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the cross-party committee deals with the replacement of members of committees. <\/p> <p>We withdrew for the first time ever from the House last Friday, on the basis that the Government had just tried to ram these changes through.  We also noted Senator John Kelly's remarks on Friday that he did not consent to serving on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs in replacement for Senator James Heffernan.<\/p><p>This is a serious matter.  Does what happened this time mean that if anyone else is to be removed from a committee, it will simply be done by way of a motion on the Order Paper that is then rammed through the House?  That is not the way to do business.  We try as best we can to be co-operative, although we disagree on many issues, but that is fine.  That is what politics is about.  However, why have Standing Orders and a Committee of Selection or a Committee on Procedure and Privileges, if the Government can, when it suits it, decide to set these aside and make the changes it wishes to make?<\/p><p>Therefore, I intend to move an amendment to the Order of Business today providing for the reversal of the decisions taken by the Government.  What we are asking is simply that the issue be allowed go to the Committee of Selection.  I do not see what the rush is.  Senator Heffernan lost the Labour Party Whip a number of months ago but he has remained on the committee up to now.  The obvious reason for the removal of the other Members from committees is that they did not toe the party Whip.  They are being thrown off their committees, regardless of their expertise or experience in those areas.  This a further example not just of the creeping centralisation of power, but the most overt centralisation of power, which is now vested in the Taoiseach and the Government Chief Whip.  I do not believe this House should be told what to do by the Government Chief Whip as he has nothing to do with this House.  Therefore, I intend to move this amendment today.<\/p><p>In regard to tomorrow's Order of Business, will the Leader confirm that the Taoiseach will come to the House tomorrow for the debate on the Thirty-Second Amendment of the Constitution (Abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann) Bill 2013 as he said he would on Second Stage?

The T&aacute;naiste reminded us over the weekend that we are in the fortunate position of having the saving on the bailout deal that many predicted we would not make.  Considering the comments made by Professor Ashoka Mody, formerly of the IMF, it would be worthwhile having a debate in the House to tease out the issue of austerity and the extent to which we can ease back on it in the coming budget in October.  I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate on that soon after our return in September.<\/p><p>I welcome the publication by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, of the new fines Bill, which provides for attachment of earnings orders.

We would all be hopeful the new Bill will have the desired effect.  Unfortunately, the previous Bill did not and was not fully implemented.  In the context of the new Bill, I call for a general debate on penal policy and prison conditions.  We had a good but brief debate in the House on the Bill dealing with Cork Prison.<\/p> <p>In recent weeks, we have seen reports by the Inspector of Prisons setting out some serious criticisms about our prisons.

The Executive is not the sole purveyor of good policy.  He asks that we look at what has been happening in new legislatures in Cardiff, Belfast and Edinburgh, as we suggested here recently, and says that we need to be active rather than reactive in influencing the national policy agenda.  He writes that the need to rethink how Parliament can protect and promote the public interest has never been more pressing.  What we need is a new standard of parliamentary government.  The power of the Executive is something which should exercise us far more because, rather like the hidden elite which our new Senator says is running Galway, there is a hidden elite running Ireland, and we need parliamentary accountability.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on Dr. Muiris MacCarthaigh's article early in the next session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200006#E02100","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1374501300,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I too welcome Senator Naughton to the House.  There have been many heated debates for several weeks.<\/p> <p>At the same time we have been enjoying a spell of fine hot weather, with the country basking in Mediterranean temperatures between 20&deg; and 30&deg; Celsius.  Similarly high temperatures are expected in the coming weeks.  This type of heat brings with it water shortages and appeals to the public to be more conservative in their usage of that resource.  The warm weather also brings certain dangers.  Tragically, 11 people have lost their lives by drowning since the beginning of the hot spell.  That is 11 families who have lost loved ones ranging in age from 16 to 65 years.  Irish Water Safety has predicted additional deaths by drowning in the coming weeks, in quarries, lakes, rivers and open seas.  I take this opportunity to offer to my condolences to the families who have lost loved ones in recent weeks.<\/p><p>The solution, unfortunately, is not to be found solely in teaching primary school children how to swim and partake in activities on the water safely.  The answer is more to do with people's attitudes to the responsibilities that should be exercised by anybody partaking of our waterways.  There must be a change in this regard.  I was particularly saddened to learn that the 11th victim was Mr. Joe Grinsell from Tipperary, who drowned in a disused quarry this weekend.  I was fortunate enough to be Carrick-on-Suir for the June bank holiday weekend where, together with Senator Denis Landy, I attended the Maurice Davin memorial service.  During that weekend I came out of retirement to participate in a one-mile charity run in the course of which I fell into step with a young boy.  As we approached the finish line, the boy was eager for us to overtake a gentleman in a tight green vest and shorts who was in front of us.  I held back, however, and let the man cross the line ahead of us.  When I saw the photograph of Mr. Grinsell in the newspaper today, I was very saddened to realise he was the gentleman who had crossed the line before me and my running companion.  I will never forget him turning around to me at the end of the race and exclaiming that he could not wait to tell his family he had beaten a world champion.  I appeal to the public to be more conscientious when using our waterways as we go on through the rest of the summer.  I convey my condolences, once again, to the families who have lost loved ones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200006#E02200","speaker":"1165","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374501900,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I welcome Senator Hildegarde Naughton to the House.  I congratulate her on her new role and wish her well in the years ahead.<\/p><p>It is okay to admit it when one is wrong.  We saw this at the weekend in the comments by Mr. Ashoka Mody, one of the architects of Ireland's bailout programme and the resulting austerity agenda under which so many people have suffered in the course of six budgets in five years.  Mr. Mody acknowledged that he got it wrong, that austerity is not working in this State and that we must abandon it if we are to allow the economy to grow.  He called specifically on the Government to take the opportunity for an easing of austerity in the budget this autumn.  I hope the Leader will accommodate a debate on this issue.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have been saying the same as Mr. Mody for several years.  Unfortunately, however, the Government has pressed on with austerity.  We have had members of the Cabinet clapping themselves on the back, giving themselves an A minus on job creation and claiming they have sorted out the banks.  The reality is something different.  Unemployment under the Government's stewardship has fallen by only 0.7%, in a context in which 180,000 people have emigrated in the same period.  When one considers the commitments the Government parties made before the election and in the action plan for jobs, its failure is particularly clear.  As I said, 180,000 mostly young people have left the country because of the austerity policies pursued by this Administration.  If one of the architects of the bailout programme is prepared to admit he was wrong and advise us to back off from austerity and focus instead on policies that foster growth and investment, surely the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste can do the same?  We should have a debate in this House in the run-up to the budget on how we can reduce our deficit in a fairer way, which would involve imposing taxes on higher earners in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200007#F00300","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1374502200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I, too, wish to welcome Senator Naughton to the House.

I have been contacted by parents, siblings and family members since the news of this development was broken to people on Friday morning last via a letter.

If this is the case, I will be quite happy for the committee I chair to be put into the long grass and forgotten about.  However, there is concern in this regard and what happened was inappropriate and unnecessary because the Committee of Selection could have convened fairly promptly.

It is a very valuable report on which work has been ongoing for six years.  The second tranche of the report, the ESRI report, has demonstrated that qualifications in centre-based child care are relatively low.  I compliment the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, because she announced last month that she is taking steps to intervene in this regard to ensure qualifications will be enhanced.  Today, I ask for a pre-budget debate on child care because it will be too late to have it after the budget.  Obviously, we cannot do anything without money.  Money speaks but one does not need money to do everything.  The Minister has demonstrated that in her innovative ideas since she entered office.  According to the ERSI's findings, women more privileged in terms of income and education were more likely to take additional unpaid leave after their children were born.  The Minister is implementing a targeted early-intervention programme for the disadvantaged.  We have found out that 14% of children who end up in care do so because of family drug problems.  Therefore, the whole family support system, and not just child care, must be debated before the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200010#J00300","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1374503400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I am very happy to welcome Hildegarde to the Chamber.

Not alone will she articulate the views of the west very strongly, she will articulate the views of Ireland strongly.<\/p><p>This weekend has been one of contradictions.  We had the fantastic weather, as well as Riverdance breaking records again, as it has done nationally and internationally.  We also have had tragedies on our waters.  Last week, I called for water safety awareness and training to become mandatory in primary schools.  I noted over the past several days that Irish Water Safety also said this should happen.  Education and appreciation of our water is critical among our young people.  I commend the swimming pools, particularly in rural areas, that stay open in winter and summer to provide critical swimming lessons and training, as well as water awareness to young people.  Will the Leader organise a debate in September with the relevant Minister on the issue of water safety?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200011#K01700","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1374503700,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I welcome Senator Naughton to the Seanad and am delighted to have her on board.

We are allowing our children to see material that a decade ago would have been accessible only in an extreme fetish club.  If people do not believe me, they should type youporn or redtube into Google and see the options that come up.  The effect on children is devastating.  They think these gross scenes are normal and set out to copy them as they take their first steps in getting together with other people in sexual activity.  I never thought I would stand up in the Irish Seanad and feel nostalgic for <i>Hustler<\/i>, <i>Penthouse<\/i>or <i>Playboy<\/i>but we must now admit that we must think of them as part of the good old days.  What can be done?  We must warn our children that they are likely to come across pornography but also warn them that it is not what most of us think of as sex.  I will not go much further.  Twice in the past couple of days and over the weekend, we have seen that the Minister has come out and said he will not force Web forums to block pornography.  Half of the children in this country have access to a smartphone and all of them have access to a computer.  Let us not pretend for one minute that we all know what they are looking at.  I ask all Members to join me in asking the Leader for a debate on this issue to ask the Minister why he is not forcing the Web firms to block pornography to our children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200011#K01800","speaker":"1169","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374504300,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Like my colleagues, I also welcome Senator Naughten to the House.  It is great to see the Galway contingent within the Oireachtas growing.  I can firmly attest that she served the city of Galway brilliantly during her term as mayor and as a city councillor.  It is great to see more young female politicians in the House.  I wish her the best in the remainder of her term here.<\/p><p>  I wish to raise an issue that needs to be addressed by this Government when it comes to cash cows and the medical profession.  I am led to believe that some time ago doctors negotiated a fee of &euro;150 per prescription to dispense methadone to people who need it.  I think we would all agree in this Chamber that this is a lot of money but what is even more outrageous is the fact that the amount remains the same for a repeat prescription.  We must be mindful that Ireland has one of the highest numbers of heroin addiction cases per capita in Europe with between 8,000 and 10,000 methadone recipients in the State.  Despite public perception of heroin abuse, it has become a very real problem in rural Ireland, affecting small towns and villages.  In my own constituency of Galway, 131 individuals throughout the county subscribe to a methadone programme.  The idea that doctors who provide a valuable service to the State and its citizens have negotiated a fee per prescription of this amount in the current economic climate is opportunistic in the extreme.  It is quite clearly a large fee earner for GPs and the worst kind of money spinner.  By allowing the situation to continue, we are permitting a situation where a prescription is more expensive than the product, which is ludicrous.  Something needs to be done about this.  I ask the relevant Ministers, including the Minister for Health, to come to the House to debate medical costs in this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200012#L00200","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1374504300,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Ach an oiread le mo chomhghleacaithe, ba mhaith liom f&iacute;or chaoin f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Seanad&oacute;ir Hildegarde Naughton.

I am convinced that dialogue can be exceptionally helpful.  There is nothing to be gained from provocation or confrontation.  When we saw a difficulty arising from the incarceration of Marian Price, an all-party group from the Seanad and the D&aacute;il met the appropriate people on several occasions and, subsequently, the British ambassador came here to meet us, which I would like to acknowledge.  A short time later Marian Price was released.  We have visited Maghaberry Prison where we have dealt with not only Republican prisoners but also loyalist prisoners, which is important.  If dialogue, perhaps with the help of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, was opened quietly and with a low profile, there is a possibility we could bring a further commitment to the peace process by all of the people of Northern Ireland.  I would not like to think we were taking our eye off the ball and believing everything was fixed and settled.  It only takes something small to reignite the difficulties.

I note the points he made in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator Eamonn Coghlan and other Senators have referred to the 11 drownings that have occurred in recent weeks.  He has said there is a need for a change of attitude to prevent such appalling tragedies.  I compliment Irish Water Safety which does tremendous work.  Senators Pat O'Neill and Martin Conway have asked for water safety to be included in the school curriculum.  That valid point was made by Senator Feargal Quinn and other Senators a number of weeks ago.  I extend my own condolences and those of the House to the families of those who drowned in recent times and all others who have been bereaved by these events.<\/p> <p> Senator David Cullinane also raised Ashoka Mody's claim that we should ease up on austerity.  This is the policy the Government has been pursuing for some time.  When the Government was formed, we determined that the route to recovery could not be by budgetary consolidation alone and that we also needed a strategy for job creation and growth.  We introduced a stimulus package which was announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin; a strategic investment fund of &euro;6 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund; the Action Plan for Jobs which the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, has been advancing, and the Pathways to Work scheme, on which the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has taken a lead.  We derived a dividend of approximately &euro;1 billion from the deal we negotiated on the promissory notes.  As a result of this careful negotiation, the Government will assess, as part of the budget process in September and October, how to deploy this saving.

The proposals are to be welcomed. <\/p><p>Senator Michael Mullins welcomed the energy efficiency measures announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, which will benefit the tenants of more than 5,000 local authority homes.  These measures are to be welcomed. <\/p><p>I assure Senator Marc MacSharry that the full rigour of the law should fall on any person who assisted in bringing down the State, especially in the banking sector.  <\/p><p>Like Senator Colm Burke, I welcome the statement issued by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on some of the matters raised in the House last week.<\/p><p>Senator James Heffernan complimented the efforts of the London football team.

The amendment proposes the term &#8220;medical procedures&#8221; would be interchangeable with &#8220;abortion procedures&#8221;.  Many people found the graphic descriptions of those abortion procedures which operate in other jurisdictions gruesome, barbaric and medieval.  Some people were so upset by the graphic nature of these descriptions, that they regarded it as horrific.  My hope is that any Member who regarded them as horrific would vote in accordance with the revulsion they felt.<\/p><p>  I am grateful the Minister, during a break on Committee Stage, had gone to the trouble of checking the procedures practised in Ireland.  He stated:<blockquote>I have spoken to the master of Holles Street and I am assured, as of this afternoon, that the practices Senator Walsh describes do not take place in this country.  In pregnancies of under 12 weeks, while surgical options are available, the procedures used are primarily medical.<\/blockquote>I had described both medical and surgical procedures on Committee Stage.  For those who want to disassociate themselves from me or criticise me for giving these graphic descriptions, I must point out it was my third attempt to elicit from the Minister what procedures were allowed under this legislation.  The first time, he said he did not want to be prescriptive.  The second time I asked whether they were surgical or medical procedures, he also did not answer that.  At that stage, I spelt out clearly the different abortion procedures that I had researched well and asked if any of those would be allowed under the legislation.  The Minister checked and informed me what procedures are in place.<\/p><p>  I accept the procedures are primarily medical.  In my earlier submissions, I stated the majority of abortions are medical abortions.  The Minister, in his reply to me on Committee Stage, stated:<blockquote>In cases where the pregnancy is more than 12 weeks, the baby is induced and if it is viable, it will be looked after and saved. Sadly, this cannot be done if it is not viable.<\/blockquote>We know the overwhelming majority of babies cannot survive because most abortions are done in the first trimester when there is no possibility of the baby surviving.<\/p><p>  I also noted that last Friday afternoon, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists stated it wanted to allay the fears of the public following statements made in the Seanad.  It stated:<blockquote>The destructive methods described for second trimester termination of pregnancy are currently [note the word &#8220;currently&#8221;] not carried out in this jurisdiction, nor will they be in the future.<\/blockquote><\/p> <p>I accept that they are not currently carried out.  I certainly hope they will not be carried out in the future but neither the institute nor I nor the Minister nor anybody in this House can guarantee they will not be carried out if we legalise them.  The current construction of the Bill legalises each and every graphic procedure about which I spoke in the House.  <\/p><p>I went further over the weekend.  I am sure some, if not all, Members would have visited the website of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and, in particular, looked at the section on guidelines on the care of women requesting induced abortion.  It is worth putting some of what they say on the record.  As one can see, it is quite a tome so I do not intend reading other than a few relevant extracts.  It states that &quot;abortion on grounds relating to the physical or mental health of the woman or of any existing children can be performed within the law at gestations up to 24 weeks.&quot;  We are allowing it for gestations up to 39 to 41 weeks.  <\/p><p>The guidelines also state that &quot;at all gestations up to this limit, abortion can be performed using either surgical or medical methods; however, different abortion techniques are appropriate at different gestations.&quot;  They go on to describe a method I described last week and state that &quot;vacuum aspiration is an appropriate method of surgical abortion at gestations up to 14 weeks.&quot;  They talk about dilation and evacuation, which the Minister assured us would not take place.  I am not contesting his belief that it may not take place.  When discussing dilation and evacuation, page 63 of the guidelines state that &quot;surgical abortion by dilatation and evacuation (D&amp;amp;E), preceded by cervical preparation, is appropriate for pregnancies above 14 weeks of gestation.&quot;  This is from the Royal Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the UK.<\/p><p>I am quoting selectively from some of the guidelines rather than reading the full page.  The guidelines state that &quot;D&amp;amp;E is a safe and effective method of surgical abortion following specialised training.&quot;  We should note in this that there is no form of abortion that is safe and effective for the baby, which is my fundamental point.  There is none whatsoever.  The guidelines also state that &quot;overall, women who underwent medical abortion were significantly more likely to have a complication than women who underwent D&amp;amp;E (29% versus 4%).&quot;  It is very significant for women.  We are talking about medical abortions which the Minister and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists here told us would primarily be the form of abortion used.<\/p><p>The guidelines talk about a recent study from the US which involved a retrospective case note review of 242 women between 14 and 24 weeks gestation undergoing either D&amp;amp;E or medical abortion.  The guidelines state that &quot;medical abortion (induction of labour) was associated with higher rates of morbidity compared with D&amp;amp;E for both groups of women.&quot;  We are talking about medical abortion, in other words, induction of labour, which is what the Minister is planning for here and which the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is happy to see happen.  The guidelines state just as an aside but an aside to which we might return later that &quot;the use of real-time ultrasound scanning during D&amp;amp;E can reduce the perforation rate.&quot;  There are other aspects in the guidelines, which I have just flicked through, to which I will refer in the debate on other amendments.  <\/p> <p> What I am asking for is simple.  I did not recall it, but I was told on my way into the Chamber today that the Minister had stated at the outset of the debate that he would not accept any Seanad amendment.  Will he clarify the position?  That decision would horrify me, as the purpose of the Houses is to debate issues.  We can debate them as robustly as we wish, but Senators should commit to ensuring the legislation is as good and humane as it can be, regardless of which perspective one has on it.  There is no possible way abortion should be allowed under section 9.  I fundamentally disagree with that section and will oppose it when we reach it.<\/p><p>This part of the legislation presents a challenge to us all, even those on the Government side who are pro-choice or those who, while being pro-life, have been coerced into supporting the Bill.  I use that word advisedly.  We must consider what we are doing.  &quot;Medical procedure&quot; - the abortion procedure - is defined in the Bill on which Senators voted on Second and Committee Stages as including &quot;the prescribing, by a medical practitioner, of any drug or medical treatment&quot;.  It does not mention what is excluded because nothing is excluded.  The Minister stated he did not wish to be prescriptive.  People were so disgusted by my comments because the barbaric practices that I had described were tantamount not just to killing the unborn baby but also to torturing it to death.

I hope that there will be no need to revisit those issues because latitude will be given to Senators to express themselves on the issues as they see fit, and according to their mandate.<\/p><p>  I support Senator Walsh's amendment.  My concern is about abortion techniques to be used and the related issue of pain killing as arose with Committee Stage amendments, and will arise again.  The Minister has fallen back on his line that he does not want to be prescriptive.  It makes a lot of sense not to be prescriptive where to be prescriptive might interfere with a doctor's ability to do a doctor's good work.  That cannot be what we are talking about here.  We are talking about the avoidance of destructive procedures.  It is welcome that the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has stated: <blockquote>The destructive methods described for second trimester termination of pregnancy are not currently carried out in this jurisdiction, nor will they be in the future.  The procedure currently practised in the Republic of Ireland is induction of labour using medication called prostaglandins.  This will not change as a result of the enactment of this legislation.  If a viable foetus is delivered, all efforts are made to preserve its life where possible.<\/blockquote>Presumably, the statement should have said &quot;his or her life where possible&quot;.  That is all very well.  The institute does not make law and it does not, ultimately, decide what could be lawful, or not.  It cannot even tie its own hands into the future and has no authority to do so.  It is slightly less than reassuring when it says that the procedures to be carried out &quot;will not change as a result of the enactment of this legislation.&quot;  Nobody is saying that it will.  We are saying that the legislation, as it currently stands, leaves open the possibility that the procedures could change in a way that would not be desirable from the point of view of respecting the dignity of the unborn child in this situation. <\/p><p>  I shall raise an issue that I have raised before, namely, the use of intracardiac potassium chloride injection into the heart muscle for late-term abortion to termination of pregnancy at 22 weeks onwards, as recommended by, among other people, Dr. Arulkumaran in his scholarly article that I quoted on Committee Stage.  This is the gentleman who was bizarrely put in charge of the HSE's investigation into the tragic death of the late Savita Halappanavar.<\/p><p>  Perhaps the Minister for Health can assist me, and us, by saying whether he regards the injection as being permissible under the legislation should the relevant doctor or medical organisations decide that it was appropriate for some reason.  Does he regard the injection as part of a surgical or medical procedure?  What is intended by an intracardiac injection?  I would find it helpful to know the information.  It is not inappropriate of me to ask my questions given the profound nature or tromch&uacute;iseach of this legislation.<\/p> <p>It is not enough to say we will not tie doctors' hands.  We should not tie doctors' hands where they are doing good work but doctors' sometimes do bad things and they certainly do so in abortion jurisdictions.  There is no doubt but that we have a culture which is changing.  Culture always changes and will change into the future.  Therefore, it is very much the responsibility of legislators to shape the circumstances in which medical treatments are carried out.<\/p><p>I support the amendment put forward by Senators Walsh and Wilson and would be very grateful if the Minister would respond because my fear is that by not being prescriptive when one should be, one ends up with a scoundrel's charter and that must be prevented.  I would be grateful for a response on the potassium chloride issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200026#DD00500","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374510900,"counter":340,"content":"<p>This legislation comes into play where the life of the mother is at risk.  The amendment fails to recognise that medical procedures change, as was clearly evident from the description given last week, something which went on 25 years ago.  Procedures have changed and moved on.<\/p><p>There is a huge commitment among the medical profession to the life of the mother and the unborn but we are losing that in this debate.  The commitment given by all the hospitals and maternity units and by medical consultants, junior doctors, nursing staff and support staff is unquestionable.  People are committed to maintaining that.<\/p><p>I welcome the clarification given by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in which it clearly set out that the procedures described here last week are not carried out in this jurisdiction, nor will they be in the future.  The procedures described would open up the whole area of medical negligence.  Any doctor going down that road would put himself or herself at risk of being sued civilly and in terms of breaching all of the guidelines.  The institute clearly set out that where there is a difficulty and the life of the mother is at risk, medication comes into play.  <\/p><p>The amendment restricts any new developments because it refers to current medical practice.  Some 15 years ago, a baby born delivered at 28 weeks had a very good chance of survival but did not have if born between 24 and 28 weeks.  However, that has changed and a baby born between 23 and 24 weeks has a very good chance of survival which goes to show how medical procedures have changed in that time.

It is not true.  We must stick to the facts.  Sometimes, they are difficult to hear.<\/p><p>We can pride ourselves on the fact that the current practice in Ireland is a two-patient model of care whereby the expectant mother and the child are prioritised.  I infer from Senator Walsh's amendment that this is what he meant.  I understand that &quot;current medical practice&quot; never sits still - it is always evolving through evidence and improvement.  However, we cannot underestimate the importance of emphasising the two-patient model.  Doing well under that model is more difficult than under a one-patient model.<\/p><p>At the weekend, I spoke with an OB-GYN practising in Galway city.  She used the example of a pregnant mother who had cancer and an emergency situation that might arise under sections 7 or 8.  She stated that, under the two-patient model, one knew to give chemo at between 15 and 35 weeks, the safe period for the expectant mother.  She also stated that one knew how to shield the baby in the womb from radiotherapy.  This is real care.<\/p><p>Also at the weekend, I spoke with a woman who stated that she had Hodgkin's disease 12 years ago.  She was pregnant at the time.  One gynaecologist told the other person beside her that it would have been better to &quot;get rid of that&quot;, meaning the unborn baby.  The expectant mother refused and the child is now a fine, healthy 12 year old.<\/p><p>I am sure that the Minister will agree on the importance of continuing to prioritise the two-patient model.  I suggest to Senator Walsh that, instead of the phrase &quot;current medical practice&quot;, he should have used &quot;two-patient model of health care&quot;, under which all efforts are made to save both lives.  Let us not forget that, for quite some time, we have ranked in the top five in the developed world in terms of maternal health care.  For some of that time, we were No. 1.  I see no reason to move away from the current model.  Will the Minister address this point?  Does he agree that this country is safe continuing with the two-patient model of health care in all circumstances so that both lives can be prioritised?<\/p><p>As regards sections 7 and 8, I accept fully that, where there is evidence that the mother's life is at risk for a medical reason, the child's life may be lost, but it would not have been the intention of the procedure.

I note what Senator Bacik and my party colleague, Senator Colm Burke, have said.  The Minister indicated earlier - perhaps it was last week - that the Holles Street people have spoken about the fact that terminations will not be carried out in the way suggested by Senator Walsh last week.  Perhaps we need to know exactly what the current medical practice is.  It is okay to say what it is not, but we need to know what it is.  Obviously, the Minister has the power to introduce regulations.  In fairness, he has said many times previously that he will introduce regulations.  I think it would be very helpful if we knew now what those regulations are because we are being asked to buy a pig in a poke.  I certainly look forward to seeing these regulations as soon as possible.<\/p><p>Colleagues have mentioned, in the context of this Report Stage amendment, the language that was used during last week's debate.  While I accept that the language in question upset some colleagues, I cannot get my head around the possibility that the abortion or termination will involve a stork coming to take the baby, as I said last week.  When we talk about a termination or an abortion, we are talking about the unborn person's life being ended medically, surgically or through a combination of medical and surgical means.  We need to know what the procedures will be when they are prescribed by the Minister by regulation or otherwise, in so far as they can be so prescribed.  If he is ruling out some of the methods outlined by Senator Walsh, that is good.

There is no direct correlation between the two in relation to what we are saying.<\/p><p>Let us just look at the medical procedures.  Senator Colm Burke argued that the Bill is about protecting life.  Yes, it is.  It is about protecting one life over another.  The Bill, by extension, is also about ending life.  The medical procedure defined in the Bill is a medical procedure which will end life.  If we were having a debate here on capital punishment, we would be discussing a procedure that would end life.  Every Member of the House and all the human rights groups outside the House would want to know what the prescribed procedure would be.  It appears to be okay to legislate for a medical procedure, without being sure what that procedure will be, simply because it will be performed on a person who cannot speak - an unborn who is not among us but within the womb.

In support of that speech, 26 of the best medical brains in America wrote to the President and published an article outlining clearly that foetal pain is stronger and more abundant among unborn children after 20 weeks than it is among babies who have been born.  The effect of pain on an unborn child of more than 20 weeks' gestation is greater than the effect of pain on a baby who has been born.

If the Minister and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists are saying that certain procedures do not occur here, there is a simple solution.  It is staring us in the face.  The Minister should simply legislate for the procedures that will be carried out by listing them in this Bill.  Alternatively, he could show us the money - the regulations - now so that we know by law and by statute that none of those procedures will be carried out here.  If we are saying that, and if we are genuine and honest about it, we should have no difficulty legislating for it.<\/p><p>The danger is that if we do not legislate prescriptively here, we cannot be sure that in a few years' time, when we have a new Minister for Health - perhaps the Minister, Deputy Reilly, will have become Taoiseach or there will be a new Government in place - and medical procedures have evolved, the procedures we have mentioned that are used in other countries will not come here.  Nobody can predict the future.  The only way to define the future is to legislate to define exactly what we want to happen in the future.  No Member of this House can say that this will not happen next year, the year after or the year after that.  If we do not legislate to prevent it, we cannot say it will not happen.

The idea that a foetus at 21 weeks could feel more pain than a newborn child is utterly unfounded.  I know that is not part of this discussion, but several Senators have raised it.  In 2005, a multidisciplinary systematic review of evidence in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association<\/i> concluded that &quot;evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester&quot;.  It went on to state that &quot;the capacity for conscious perception of pain can arise only after thalamocortical pathways begin to function, which may occur in the third trimester around 29 to 30 weeks' gestational age&quot;.  When the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in London examined this matter in 2010, its main findings were that the foetus cannot feel pain before 24 weeks because the connections in the foetal brain, between the periphery and the cortex, are not yet fully formed.<\/p> <p>There is some evidence that suggests that the foetus, while in the chemical environment of the womb, is in a state of induced sleep and is unconscious.

As Senator Bacik has said, many people go privately but I can revert to him with more information.<\/p><p>Senator Bradford mentioned the regulations but they were published last Thursday evening.  Perhaps he meant the guidelines of the institutes that are still under consideration.  They are the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and the Irish College of General Practitioners.  Notwithstanding what the medical profession may have said in this Chamber over the course of the hearings, it is part of routine training and there is no need for additional training.  This is part of routine training.  Members will have heard Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill describe how friends of his and members of his family have had miscarriages.  Part of normal training is being able to deal with miscarriage and the complications that arise.  Sometimes a woman does not have a complete miscarriage.  There is a real threat to the life of the mother if retained placental parts are left inside the womb so they must be dealt with.  <\/p><p>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  As I stated during Committee Stage, it is intended that medical procedures, under the terms of the Bill, will be carried out in line with current medical practice.  It is neither desirable nor appropriate to enshrine clinical practice, which constantly evolves and changes, into primary legislation.  What is best practice today could change next year and each time practice changes and improves we would have to return to the Legislature to re-legislate.  To me, that would be a very bad place to go and, to be honest, would be impractical and unworkable.<\/p><p>The idea that the Legislature would have a say over the actual mechanism of how doctors practice, as opposed to what they should be doing, was raised last week.  We are prescribing what they are to do.  We are not prescribing how they are to do it because that would be wrong, in my view.  As I said, the medical and nursing professions in this country and across the world have a reputation for care and compassion that has been built over centuries. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200030#HH01100","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1374512400,"counter":387,"content":"<p>Not in Britain, they do not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200030#HH01200","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374512400,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Yes, they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200030#HH01300","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1374512400,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Virtuous in Britain?

First, it totally ignored all of the professional evidence presented over six days of health committee hearings.  Second, a significant number of amendments were tabled in the D&aacute;il but they have been ignored.  Third, we have only reached the first amendment so far today.  I guarantee the Leas-Chathaoirleach that when we reach amendment No. 62, or No. 86 as it was numbered for Committee Stage, every amendment will have been ignored by the Minister.  He is in a rush to introduce legislation that will not advance the protection of women in any shape or form and will probably have an adverse affect on many women who will have abortions under this legislation.  Obviously we all know the effect that it will have on unborn babies.<\/p><p>With regard to some of the points made by the Minister, at 18 to 21 days a baby has a heartbeat and at around 41 days professionals and research have shown that a baby has brainwaves.  I have read into the record here that babies at 11 weeks have a placenta around them to supply food and oxygen.  They can make complex facial expressions and can even smile.  All bodily systems work at 11 weeks.  At 16 weeks the child can use its hand to grasp which ultrasound can prove and he or she can swim and do somersaults.  At 18 weeks the child is active and energetic, flexing muscles, punching and kicking.  Any woman who is pregnant will be well aware of the child's movements at that stage.<\/p><p>We have the scenario where what I described is regarded as disgusting and, by some people, language that we should not have used.  There are people who would love to see this language sanitised to the extent that people are unaware of the barbaric effects of abortion.  That is how the evil abortion industry has survived and grown across the globe.<\/p><p>I applaud the Minister for stating the reality of the tobacco industry.  A relative of his died from smoking and my mother died from smoking.  The tobacco industry prevented the disclosure of medical research and information that could have saved many lives.

If they press the red button, they should make no mistake but that they are legalising everything I described on Second and Committee Stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200032#KK01300","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1374513600,"counter":433,"content":"<p>Senator Walsh accused the Government of acting in a cavalier manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200033#LL00100","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1374513600,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I am asking Senators-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200033#LL00200","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1374513600,"counter":435,"content":"<p>On a point of order, we have spent more than an hour discussing this amendment.

The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, said that by deleting this part, I would prevent the three Dublin maternity hospitals from being registered and designated.  The reason I have made this proposal is that I do not want to see clinics such as the Marie Stopes clinic being approved to carry out abortions.  Even many of the people who have a different perspective on this issue from mine and who are pro-choice feel the Marie Stopes organisation is not an appropriate one to which we should refer any woman about whom we care.  The amendment amends the proposal I made on Committee Stage.  While I still seek the deletion of the same part, I wish to include the words &quot;any institution listed in the Schedule&quot;.  This part of the Bill would then read: &quot;The Minister may by order, where he or she thinks it appropriate for the purpose of this Act, specify any institution managed by the executive or any institution listed in the Schedule&quot;.  I hope the Minister will see his way to accepting the amendment.  This morning we read an account in the newspapers of the unfortunate death of a woman in England who attended the Marie Stopes clinic.  This is not the type of clinic we would like to see established here.<\/p><p>  On this issue, there was a significant debate in the Northern Ireland Assembly about three months ago on a motion tabled by Mr. Paul Girvan, MLA, chairman of the justice committee, which asked for such procedures to be carried out only within NHS facilities.  Unfortunately, the motion was defeated by Sinn F&eacute;in on the basis of the cross-community provisions.

It is important that institutions or private practices such as those referred to by Senator Jim Walsh be categorically excluded from the legislation.  It is important that in the future, for example, where a public facility is unable to carry out the procedures mentioned in the legislation, the HSE not enter into any form of service level agreement with any private operator, as happens in other services within the HSE budget.  Such operators are part of a private industry and while the HSE does not propose to go down the road of opening this up to private industry, it is important to state this in the legislation.  Organisations such as Planned Parenthood in the United States made a profit of almost $80 million and the Marie Stopes organisation is heading in the same way.  These organisations are looking at what we are doing with our legislation.

Not to include these hospitals would have grave consequences for the safety of women in the Dublin region and beyond.<\/p><p>  I understand the Senator has concerns about the possibility that the wording may leave open the possible future inclusion of private clinics.

I will comment briefly on Senator Harte's rambling musings on the issue.  Along with many other Members, I am familiar with the expertise of doctors in delivering babies which are at full gestation.  However, that is not the issue.  Senator Harte seems to have missed the point completely.  This Bill is about removing babies at 23 weeks  - and indeed before that, when they have no chance of survival.  At 23 weeks, 24, weeks, 25 weeks, 26 weeks, 27 weeks or 28 weeks, such babies will require intensive medical care.  All I am looking for is that they be given that care.  My concern is that if these facilities are not on-site it is logical that there will be a period of delay.  If these young babies have only a 25% chance of survival without being seriously injured, the 25% who will be injured should be given the best possible service.

We are discussing the test for reasonable opinion with regard to sections 7,8 and 9 of the Bill, and more particularly in the context of section 9, which is where the mischief exists.  The test for reasonable opinion is very subjective.  The opinion has to be noted of those who are certifying the abortion, not those who would be carrying it out.  The reasonable opinion as defined does not require any court test of reasonability at all; it merely has to be an opinion formed in good faith.  As the Minister of State, with his legal background, will well know, it is very difficult to prove bad faith.  The other requirement is that the certifying person must have regard to the need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable.  That appears to invoke the test of the Eighth Amendment, but that contains an undertaking to defend and vindicate the right to life as far as practicable.  The need to respect the equal right to life of the unborn is not qualified in any way in the Eighth Amendment.  Therefore, these amendments would strengthen the requirement for the certifying medical personnel to form an opinion which respects the equal right to life of the unborn.  That is the constitutional mandate.  They would have to have regard, where practicable, to the duty to deliver the viable unborn alive.  That is the effect of amendment No. 6 on section 7, amendment No. 11 on section 8 and amendment No. 17 on section 9.  <\/p><p>  We have been given many sorts of reassurance that where a child is at the cusp of viability or is viable, not only will his or her life be preserved if born alive, but he or she will be protected through the procedure so that he or she can be born alive.  This reassurance has been given informally and is certainly not in the legislation.  I would like the Minister of State to restate that assurance.  However, even if he does, it is quite clear that it is not required in the legislation.  It is the certifying physician who is supposed to have regard to the duty to preserve the life of the child where practicable but there is absolutely nothing in the legislation about the lawfulness of the procedures themselves that imposes the requirement to preserve the child's life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200037#PP01500","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374515700,"counter":525,"content":"<p>I second amendment No. 6.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200037#PP01700","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1374515700,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I am speaking on amendment No. 16, which concerns the risk of loss of life from suicide.  At the risk of being interrupted, I will do my best to formulate thoughts which have been put to me by people in the medical profession.  In the case of suicide, according to this legislation, where there is a real and substantive risk to the life of the mother, it is deemed that to save the life of the mother the baby's life must be taken.  This includes the threat of suicide.  What is the legal status of the unborn in this case?  The expectant mother is not looking for a live baby at the end of this procedure.  The State is making a commitment that it will deliver a live baby where possible.  We have a terrible record of State care.  It is a surreal scenario.  I ask the Minister of State if there is anywhere else in the world where it happens that a mother believes her pregnancy is the reason her life is at risk from suicide, and therefore she is seeking a termination of that life, but the State decides to deliver the baby alive.<\/p> <p>Where else in the world does this happen?  What is the status of any such baby and to whom does he or she belong?  What surname will the baby be given?   I accept completely that we are talking about women in a distressed condition, women who are perhaps mentally unwell and might even be in a psychosis.  My concern, however, is that a month later, the mother will recover and her first question will be about her baby and where he or she is.  Dr. Jacqueline Montwell made that point very clearly during the committee hearings.  A woman in those circumstances might want the baby, or she might say she never wanted a live baby.  In the latter case the baby will be placed in State care, which could have a further negative impact on the mother's mental health.

There are certain syndromes or conditions whereby an otherwise healthy baby will threaten the life of an otherwise healthy mother.  Senator Jim Walsh says that such cases do not exist, but they do.  They consist mainly of syndromes which present the risk of pulmonary hypertension in the woman.  I will not mention other syndromes because I do not want to distress people who might suffer from them.  It is important that we contain ourselves in this discussion.

In fact, we have very much taken into account all the scientific evidence that was presented to us.  I support this group of amendments and particularly the comments by Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen.  Regardless of who brings the challenge or commences the case, this legislation will almost certainly be tested from the point of view of its constitutionality.  The final case for the defence of the Bill, when all the hard questions have remained unanswered, particularly in regard to section 9, will come from the Minister and his colleagues who will point to the current protection for the unborn as per the Constitution.  That particular protection is very specific in its language.  The Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, is much better than I at legal language, but I urge him not to ignore this series of amendments.  He said previously that he is not interested in any amendments other than minor technical amendments.  He has undertaken to reject any and all substantial amendments; at least he was reported by our friends in the media as having said so.<\/p> <p>If this legislation is to stand up to constitutional scrutiny, then it must tie in with the 1983 amendment to the Constitution.  The question of delivering a viable unborn life, where practical, is a matter upon which the Minister of State, as a legal scholar, must reflect.  He must also have regard to the duty that must be imposed on medical personnel.  As drafted, the Bill does not provide the security which, in the context of their intentions, was to the fore in people's thinking when they voted in the 1983 referendum.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the fact that amendments are not being accepted, I ask the Minister of State to provide us with his legal opinion on why the measures being put forward are not in accord with Government policy.  This has been a lengthy process and the last thing anyone wants is for the legislation, when it is finally passed by the House, to be deemed unconstitutional.  I am aware that we cannot be presented with the advice provided by the Attorney General.  One of the bizarre aspects of parliamentary procedure is that when the Attorney General advises the Government, we are not allowed to see that advice in order to assess its strength or discover whether the various pros and cons have been examined.  In the context of amendment No. 6, will the Minister of State indicate how he and his colleagues in government are so comfortable and content that what is being proposed is fully constitutional and that what is contained in the amendments is not constitutional?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200038#QQ01600","speaker":"1121","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374516900,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I am struggling to understand the intent behind these amendments.  Perhaps the Minister of State will provide some clarification in respect of them.  The amendments relate to the judgments which medical professionals and practitioners will make in respect of situations where women's lives will be in danger.  Amendment No. 6 suggests that the phrase \"being an opinion which respects the equal right to life of the unborn\" be inserted into the legislation.  The inference is that medical professionals will not respect the equal right to life of the unborn.  One could infer something even more sinister from the wording used.  It is the latter which gives rise to my concerns.  What would be the result if the amendment were to be accepted?  The amendments under discussions all relate to sections 7 to 9, inclusive.  Those sections are all very clear and address the Supreme Court judgment which refers to a substantial and real risk of loss of life to the mother.  Essentially, it is that matter which is under discussion.  The medical practitioners who will be obliged to make decisions in this regard - in good faith - will have to do so on the basis of assessing the level of risk to the life of the mother.<\/p><p>I cannot understand why anyone would want to include the phrase &quot;being an opinion which respects the equal right to life of the unborn&quot;.  As already indicated, the inference here is that medical professionals would not be making their decisions on the basis of the risk to the life of the mother but rather for other reasons.  I cannot accept that and I do not believe it is what medical practitioners making decisions in good faith would do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200039#RR00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1374516900,"counter":545,"content":"<p>There are two parts to amendment No. 16.  The first of these relates to the reasonable opinion of medical practitioners.  I refer here to opinions formed not just in good faith but also on reasonable grounds.  I understand, from discussing the matter with legal people, that reasonable opinion on reasonable grounds could be interpreted separately and that including the term \"on reasonable grounds\" actually strengthens the degree to which judges might interpret the defence of the unborn.  It is for this reason that the term is included.  I tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage.  Both it and amendment No. 16, which is currently under discussion, suggest removing the reference to the need to preserve unborn life as far as practicable and replacing it with the phrase \"which has regard to the right to life of the unborn\".  The latter is taken directly from the Constitution.  I may be wrong but I believe that on Committee Stage the Minister, Deputy Reilly, - although it could have been the Minister of State - emphasised the fact that the phrase \"as far as practicable\" would be removed from the legislation if the amendment I had tabled at that point were accepted.  In this context, the Constitution says, \"The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.\"  I do not believe, therefore, that attaching the phrase \"as far as practicable\" to that of \"to preserve unborn human life\" interprets the intention of the constitutional amendment accurately.  I am of the view that the phrase \"as far as practicable\" applies to the obligation of the State, in its laws, to defend and vindicate the right to which I refer.  I see a certain distinction in that.<\/p><p>The Irish version of the Constitution is probably even clearer in respect of this matter.  It states, &quot;Admha&iacute;onn an St&aacute;t ceart na mbeo gan breith chun a mbeatha.&quot;  The term &quot;ceart na mbeo gan breith&quot; is much clearer than the English version.  What is meant by the word &quot;unborn&quot; needs to be defined and some people would dispute that meaning.  The rights of the living who have not been born is the literal interpretation of the Irish version of the Constitution.  I am of the view that this is a more accurate description and it strongly underpins the equal right to life.  The Irish version also states &quot;an ceart sin a chosaint is a shu&iacute;omh lena dhl&iacute;the sa mh&eacute;id gur f&eacute;idir &eacute;.&quot;  We have to defend the latter, which is also an aspect of the English version.  However, we must also defend the ceart na mbeo gan breith.  I suggest that what is contained in the Irish version of the Constitution provides a reason for giving further consideration to this matter.  Many of the procedures that will be legalised and the instances in which their use will be allowed will specifically depend on the interpretation of judges of that section.<\/p><p>The second part of amendment No. 16 comprises the phrase &quot;the pregnant woman has undergone an ultrasound&quot;.  If the amendment were accepted, there would be a requirement under section 9 to have an ultrasound carried out.  I wish to explain why I have worded the amendment in this way.  Senator Mooney tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage which was debated and subsequently withdrawn.  I listened carefully to what the Senator stated and I considered the matter and discussed it with people in the psychiatric field in the interim.  I included this provision in amendment No. 16 as a result of my concerns on this matter.  In the United States one in every four pregnancies is aborted.  In New York the figure is one in two, which is appalling.  Regardless of one's perspective, I do not believe one could provide any justification for one in four or one in two babies being aborted.  I am concerned about the effect of abortion on women who have undergone the procedure.  When one meets such women and listens to their stories, one cannot but be moved.<\/p><p>I wish to quote the president of Feminists for Life in respect of this matter.<\/p> <p>This is a genuine feminist, not the pseudo-feminist from whom we often hear on this topic.  She said that feminists are opposed to force, abortion is a denial of feminism and that exploitation of women, including abortion, is interfering with nature.  That is the reason I raise this and the reason I tabled an amendment on the ultrasound.  This person went on to say that some women who fought against slavery fought for rights of women and also fought against abortion in the early stage of feminism in the US, and that is their history.  She made a point, to which I referred on Second Stage, that whereas financially independent, educated women generally will not need abortion, we pass on this to disadvantaged women.  She reckoned abortion is the ultimate exploitation of women and that it affects so many others including men, siblings and grandparents.  I remember members of Women Hurt saying in the audio visual room that an average of 45 people are affected by every abortion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200039#RR00300","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374517500,"counter":547,"content":"<p>The second part of that amendment is fairly specific in regard to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200040#SS00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374517500,"counter":548,"content":"<p>The amendment is very specific about the ultrasound.  I am giving the reason I tabled it and the reason it is specific.  This person also mentioned that abortion is a reflection that we have not met the needs of women but many states, particularly in the United States, have brought in a requirement that once a woman has made this irrevocable decision, she must be made aware that she can never reverse it.  When she is suffering the anguish and the pain of the decision subsequently, having made it in a time of severe trauma, she is not able to reverse it and therefore it is imperative that if women are informed and are to be informed, they need to see the results of the ultrasound.  My understanding is that in certain states in the United States, up to 90% of those who seek an abortion have decided against having the abortion.  That is good because it informs the woman.<\/p><p>I will conclude by quoting a woman who was in the Women Hurt delegation.  She is a woman who had an abortion.  She said she made the choice of abortion and had a safe, legal abortion.  She has worked in abortion recovery helping other women who have struggled with their abortion experience.  She said that their voices are rarely heard in this debate.  She said that those who would advocate and fight for her right switch sides and attack her, and other women, who dare to say that their choice was the complete unchoice in the end.  She told me that I did the right thing.  Women need to know the truth about what they are choosing.  Otherwise, and this is the point about the ultrasound, doctors must ask themselves if their patients, as women, have fully informed consent when they make that decision.  The truth has nothing to fear from disclosure.  If the Minister is wont to accept this amendment it will ensure that we do not rapidly head in the direction they have gone in the neighbouring island where in almost one in four pregnancies, the baby is aborted and killed.  I do not want that.  I do not believe anybody in the House wants that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200040#SS00300","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1374517500,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I wish to speak to the general amendments and I assume I am allowed some flexibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200040#SS00400","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1374517500,"counter":550,"content":"<p>There are six amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200040#SS00500","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374517500,"counter":551,"content":"<p>Yes.

I get very disillusioned by some of the responses when Members wish to speak.  One is not obliged to agree with what the other person is saying.  However, if an amendment is before the House, it is important that Members examine it.  Moreover, if two views emerge, there ultimately is a procedure for deciding the outcome and this has been evident in the amendments already debated.<\/p><p>I can find common cause with the arguments of Senators Leyden, Walsh and &Oacute; Domhnaill with regard to this amendment and I believe there is a grave danger that Members are not considering at all the life of the unborn child.  If this is the case, Members are then in conflict with the Constitution.  There is no need to get too animated or excited about the debate and I note that on foot of all the debate held thus far and amendments tabled, Members are coming near the end of their consideration of the legislation at this Stage.<\/p><p>However, for such a fundamental issue in all the debate and if this is the only focus that remains, it is important that Members consider the life of the unborn child.  I have been a little worried by much of the debate in this Chamber, in that while Members rightly must consider the life of the mother, this should not be to the exclusion of the life of the unborn child.  I cannot imagine anyone in this House or anyone outside of it who would disagree with a comment based on that premise.  Who would not wish to consider the life of a mother or the life of the child?  Is that not what the amendment is about?<\/p><p>I do not wish to go into the issue of suicidal ideation, which has been dealt with.  It also was dealt with in the hearings and I am unsure whether there has been any great follow-up from that.  It has happened and may be history at this point but no matter how tired Members are, how weary they are or how exasperated they are because they must listen to different views, were they to avoid the fundamental protection in the Constitution for both the mother and the unborn child, as legislators I do not believe they would be doing the right thing.<\/p><p>I am sure the Minister of State will tell Members this matter has been examined legally.  However, Members also are aware of what happened in the past when they were so sure something was copper-fastened legally but this proved not to be the case.  Members still may find themselves in the courts.  Would it not be far better here in this Chamber, as legislators, quietly, calmly and with reflection, to tease out this issue and put Members' own minds at ease?  This is what the people expect from us.  I do not like the idea of name-calling.  I do not like the idea of heckling or interruption.  It does not bring Members anything at the end of the day but I hope this amendment and any other amendment to be tabled right up to 8 p.m. tomorrow evening can be dealt with in the spirit that all Members would like to protect human life.

Senators of course are entitled to do that but I would draw a distinction between efforts along the lines about which the Senator has, very reasonably, just been talking, which is to tighten up or improve the wording or to ensure the wording passes muster under the Constitution and all such issues and the Government is very much open to that.

However, in this group of amendments that is largely not the case.  However, I believe I am entitled to draw a distinction between the two approaches.<\/p><p>As for these amendments, I will respond to amendment No. 16 first, which refers to the wording in the Bill on reasonable opinion and proposes to delete the phrase &quot;as far as practicable&quot; from the Bill.  I cannot accept the amendment.  As was pointed out on Committee Stage, the words &quot;as far as practicable&quot; used in the wording of the Bill are taken directly from Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution.  I understand a distinction has been made by Senator Walsh and earlier by Senator Mullen to which I will return, but as colleagues are aware, these words appear in plain terms in Article 40.3.3&deg;, which states &quot;The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right&quot;.  It is entirely proper that, when one seeks to set out the appropriate wording in the Bill in respect of the need to preserve unborn life, the qualification that is placed on that need should be a qualification that comes from the Constitution.<\/p> <p>When Senator Walsh quoted the Irish version Article of 40.3.3&deg;, he did not emphasise in the way I suggested the very last words, which read \"agus r&aacute;tha&iacute;onn f&oacute;s na cearta sin a chosaint is a shu&iacute;omh lena dhl&iacute;the sa mh&eacute;id gur f&eacute;idir &eacute;.\"  We understand \"sa mh&eacute;id gur f&eacute;idir &eacute;\" to mean \"as best one can\".  It is a qualification that is actually necessary because in neither our formation or that proposed by the Senators is there an absolute requirement.  Senator Mullen, in his amendment, uses the wording, \"being an opinion which respects the equal right to life of the unborn, and which has regard to the duty to deliver the viable unborn alive where practicable\".  Senators Mullen and Walsh, therefore, concede that there is a necessity to qualify their words.  The words are not absolute but qualified with the term \"where practicable\", which implies \"sa mh&eacute;id gur f&eacute;idir &eacute;\" or \"as best one can\".  Nobody is saying the requirement is absolute; everybody is saying it must be qualified.  Therefore, there is no great distance between us in the use of the terminology.  It is perhaps clearer in Irish than English.<\/p><p>In reference to the requirement in the amendment regarding an ultrasound scan, the Minister stated on Committee Stage he does not propose to dictate in primary legislation the practice of obstetrics in the way advocated.<\/p><p>With regard to changing the wording on reasonable opinion proposed in the other amendments in the group, the relevant sections provide that a termination can be carried out only when the medical practitioners have formed a reasonable opinion that the risk &quot;can only be averted by carrying out that medical procedure&quot;.  We are very familiar with this and have gone over it time and again.  <\/p><p>Although I understood Senator Mullen to be saying he is concerned the requirements do not seem to extend to the doctor carrying out the procedure and to inhere only in the certifying personnel, I must point out, with respect, that his amendments and those of Senator Bradford refer to the certifying personnel and not the doctor carrying out the procedure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200041#TT03000","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374518700,"counter":652,"content":"<p>I have another that complements it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200042#UU00200","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374518700,"counter":653,"content":"<p>Later?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200042#UU00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1374518700,"counter":654,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200042#UU00400","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374518700,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I am only required to address the amendments in the group.  Senator Mullen's and Senator Bradford's amendments refer to the certifying personal and not the doctor carrying out the procedure.  Therefore, there is no difference.<\/p><p>I cannot see the necessity for the amendment stating &quot;being an opinion which respects the equal right to life of the unborn, and which has regard to the duty to deliver the viable unborn alive where practicable&quot; given the overarching constitutional and statutory imperative inhering in all the people involved in certifying and carrying out procedures to preserve unborn life as far as practicable and with due regard to the equal right to life the mother.  We are struggling with this all the time in the debate.<\/p><p>At an earlier stage of the debate, perhaps Second Stage, Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, whom I hope I am not misrepresenting, stated as part of his main line of attack that there was plenty of protection for the life of the mother and precious little, if any, for the unborn.  That is a fair expression of what he said.  I reject that characterisation of the Bill.  What the legislation seeks to do, in what is admittedly a very difficult area for any legislator, is put into statute law the provision set out in the Constitution that the mother and unborn have an equal right to life and that the protections must have regard to this.  The difficulty concerns what happens when there is a conflict and when it is not possible to be immediately absolute about a particular outcome.  The difficulty is when, in practice, there is a need for regard to be had to both rights.  It is a question of how this must be navigated and that is why we are putting into legislation what is rightly a very onerous requirement on doctors to ensure that when they are certifying under sections 7, 8, 9 or 13 that there be a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman according to their reasonable opinion, &quot;being an opinion formed in good faith which has regard to the need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable&quot;.  These words are not meaningless in the way implied.<\/p><p>The wording &quot;has regard to the need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable&quot; is a quite legitimate and correct requirement on doctors but it is quite profound and is not to be easily dismissed.  Second, the medical procedure is to be carried out by an obstetrician at an appropriate location.  It must be the case that the risk can be averted only by carrying out the medical procedure.  When one considers the strength of this language, one concludes it is unnecessary to include the wording, &quot;being an opinion which respects the equal right to life of the unborn, and which has regard to the duty to deliver the viable unborn alive where practicable&quot;.  What is intended to be conveyed by the amendments put forward by Senators Mullen and Bradford is suggestive of a scenario absolutely contemplated by the Bill, as drafted.  There is a constitutional imperative, and a requirement to have regard to the need to preserve unborn human life is given force in statute.<\/p><p>Irrespective of one's view of the Bill, it is not accurate, fair or reasonable to criticise it in a way that suggests it does not have regard to the right to life of the unborn.  I have some sympathy with the tone of the remarks of Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, who said we may need to go further and that the balancing is not quite right.  We could have that discussion and have had it for months actually.  We have, quite rightly, arrived at this set of very various onerous requirements on the medical personnel involved.  I understand the objective of the amendments but they are not required.  The statutory scheme being put in place does have regard to the equal right to life of both entities.<\/p><p>I have covered most of the points.  With regard to the point on the wording &quot;as far as practicable&quot; having a slightly different context in the eighth amendment than in the legislation, it is true.  The kind of provision in the eighth amendment, in Article 40.3.3&deg;, is directed towards the State and its laws.  That is what it is about.  Nobody would suggest that the Constitution could prescribe specifics along the lines we are talking about.  It is always going to be directed towards the State and what it should do in its laws, as far as practicable, to vindicate the right to life of the unborn with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother.  It is quite proper that we should draw on that language when seeking language to describe the need to preserve unborn life and to determine how we should qualify it.  It is not absolute, as the Senators agree.  In trying to find language, it is absolutely prudent and correct to draw on language in our Constitution rather than any found elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200042#UU00500","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1374519300,"counter":656,"content":"<p>I do not wish to interrupt the Minister of State, but can I have a reply to the terms \"reasonable grounds\" and \"in good faith\"?

I remind the House that is what we are doing here.  We are putting in place legislation which relates to circumstances where the mother's life is in danger - where there is a risk to her life.

The Minister of State himself spoke about the need to shape this Bill within the wording of the Constitution.  He even referenced the equal right to life, as set out in the Constitution, but it is not in the Bill.  In fact, my amendment would invoke directly a more objective requirement on those certifying the procedure that they would not just form a reasonable opinion.  There is a real dishonesty, not in the Minister of State's words but in the words of the Bill, to suggest a reasonable opinion.  It certainly avoids frightening the horses but when one goes on to define that opinion and what is required in subjective terms - namely, the requirement of good faith - then the wool is being pulled over people's eyes.<\/p><p>The alternative proposal would make that more objective and would say that the person has to form an opinion which respects the equal right to life of the unborn.  One finds the words of the Constitution there, but not in the Bill.  As the Minister of State rightly said, we should fully respect that the duty to deliver the viable unborn alive should be carried out as far as practicable.  That is the State's obligation, by its laws, to defend and vindicate the life of the unborn.  <\/p><p>There is no difficulty with section 7 and section 8 procedures because, in the end, one has a coincidence or coalition of interests - a mother who is very sick and her unborn child whom she would want to save, and a doctor who wants to save both the mother's life and that of the unborn child.

In more general terms, we know in regard to those situations where a person has autonomy and is threatening their life, that one must always believe a threat of suicide.  Senator Gilroy himself and the eminent experts in suicide prevention who attended the hearings at the Sub-Committee on Health and Children pointed that out.  Therefore, by definition, a threat of suicide must be taken seriously and must be deemed to constitute a risk to life.  Therein lies the danger and injustice of section 9.<\/p><p>This amendment would require that where that threat becoming a risk arises in situations where it would be possible to bring the baby out alive, and ensure that it is born as safely as possible, as distinct from doing a destructive abortion, notwithstanding the aspirations of the person who has presented to the psychiatrist, that there would be such a duty.  It seems that it is the antithesis of respect for the equal right to life of the unborn to exclude that duty, both at the level of certification by the medical professionals involved, but also - this was my point to the Minister of State, as I have provided elsewhere - that those carrying out the procedure would be subject to the requirement that they do not intend to end the life of the unborn where such life is viable. <\/p><p>On that basis, I would submit that the overarching constitutional and statutory imperative to which the Minister of State referred, to defend and vindicate the right to life of the unborn, appears to be ignored.  I do not know where the Minister of State finds the overarching statutory imperative to defend and vindicate the life of the viable unborn, given that the legislation does not provide for it in terms of what is a permissible lawful procedure. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200043#VV01600","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1374519300,"counter":672,"content":"<p>I call an tAire St&aacute;it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200043#VV01700","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374519300,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I have nothing to add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200043#VV01800","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1374519300,"counter":674,"content":"<p>Is amendment No. 6 being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200043#VV01900","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374519300,"counter":675,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200043#VV02000","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1374519300,"counter":676,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1374519300,"counter":677,"content":"<p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1374519300,"counter":678,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 7 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1374519300,"counter":679,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 8 arises from committee proceedings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200043#VV02400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1374519300,"counter":680,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 8:<blockquote><br \/>In page 9, to delete lines 4 and 5 and substitute the following:&#8220;(b) that medical procedure is carried out at an appropriate institution by--<blockquote>(i) an obstetrician, or<br \/>(ii) a medical practitioner of a medical speciality in respect of which he or she is registered in the Specialist Division of the register, and which is relevant to the care or treatment in respect of which the risk of such loss arises, not being a psychiatrist or a general practitioner.&#8221;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>This amendment is designed to protect medical personnel other than obstetricians who legitimately give medical treatment under section 7 where such medical treatment might have the effect of ending the life of the unborn.

This matter relates to the ongoing deliberations on Irish Water, the privatisation of the water supply and the appointment of regional contractors.  Will the Minister advise us of the names of these contractors?  One can only assume this will be a matter of public record, given that public funds are involved and it is a public natural resource.  Will there be clarification on the appointment of subcontractors also?  My understanding from the information provided so far by the Department is that there is no obligation on the three regional contractors which have been appointed to hire subcontractors from an approved list from the Department.  This is alarming because the subcontractors on the departmental list are in each geographical area.  They applied to be included in the list and carried out work previously to get on it.  If they can provide value for money, it is wrong that they would be excluded and other contractors could take their place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200044#WW00700","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1374519900,"counter":690,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter with which I am dealing on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p>The programme for Government and the memorandum of understanding with the European Union, the IMF and the European Central Bank, with which the Senator will be familiar, provide for the introduction of domestic water charges.  The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  International evidence has shown that where meters have been installed, significant reductions have been achieved in the level of consumption.  This is also borne out by the water savings achieved with metering in the group water sector.<\/p><p>Irish Water will be responsible for the domestic water metering programme and the collection of water charges from households.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government estimates that approximately 1 million households could be metered initially.  A pre-installation survey to provide further information on the scope of the metering programme is well under way.  Regional management contractors are due to be appointed by Irish Water shortly, following a competitive public tendering process.  The procurement process for the subcontractor panel was developed by the Department, in consultation with Bord G&aacute;is Energy, to ensure small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, had an opportunity to compete for contracts.  The tender criteria were developed to ensure subcontractors would have the capacity to carry out the scale of work involved to the necessary high standard.  The approach taken for the subcontractor panel is consistent with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's guidelines for facilitating SME participation in public procurement.<\/p><p>The procurement process for the subcontractor panel has now closed and following assessment of the applications received, a total of 159 subcontractors have been included in the panel.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has provided the final panel for Irish Water.  The list of the pre-qualified subcontractors will be provided by Irish Water for the regional management contractors.  It is expected the successful regional management contractors will be utilising the resources of the pre-qualified subcontractors for the purposes of delivering the meter installation works.  They may supplement this approach by applying their own resources or additional subcontractors.<\/p><p>The installation of meter boxes and domestic water meters will be rolled out nationally as quickly as possible.  A social inclusion commitment will form part of the regional main contractor's contracts.  It will include requirements that at least 10% of the people working on the metering programme be drawn from SMEs, 10% from the unemployment register and 5% be apprentices, graduates or school leavers.<\/p><p>The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary of the Bord G&aacute;is Energy group and assigns the necessary powers to allow Irish Water, a public body, not a private body, to undertake the metering programme.  The Act also assigns to the Commission for Energy Regulation the power to advise the Government on the development of a regulatory framework for water services.  Further legislation will be published later this year to provide for the transfer of water services functions from the 34 county and city councils to Irish Water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200044#WW00800","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Supply","time":1374519900,"counter":691,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200044#WW00850"},{"type":"speech","time":1374519900,"counter":692,"content":"<p>The country has been deemed officially by Met &Eacute;ireann to be in drought.  In some ways, this is to be welcomed because we are entitled to a good few days of weather.  After the past five years of rain during the summer, I do not want to rain on anyone&rsquo;s parade, so to speak, and spoil the moment as I am enjoying the good weather myself.<\/p><p>The Internet, Twitter and Facebook seem to have gone into overload regarding the birth of a royal baby.  In the context of what we have been discussing here for several days and what we are trying to achieve during the final days of the current sitting of the Seanad, it would be remiss of me not to wish the mother and baby well.<\/p><p>I have been preoccupied for some time, not just because of the latest spell of fine weather, by the failure of previous Governments to provide for strategic infrastructure in water provision.  The Ahern Governments seemed to regale in the building of houses, with over 600,000 housing units built over ten years but nothing else besides.  What we have been left with are concrete jungles and many housing estates without facilities, including for water provision.  No one thought it through.  It is the same with schools, with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, having to play catch-up in replacing prefab classrooms across the country.<\/p><p>This story is told time and again across urban centres.  Water provision is like Cinderella.  We have been left with Victorian water infrastructure, with water pipes leaking 40% of treated water, costing the taxpayer billions.  It seems absurd that, in a country where up until this year it never seemed to stop raining, that we are now about to run out of water.  I do not want to be part of a Government that allows the country to run out of water.  In recent weeks the Government has been successful in attracting new investment from the Kerry Group, Pfizer and Intel which provides employment in the Leinster region way beyond Kildare where it is based.<\/p> <p>These employees come from Laois, Offaly and Dublin and are glad of that employment.  One of our strategic resources, assets and advantages is our clean, secure and sustainable supply of water.  However, we are on a knife edge because the balance between supply and demand is very precarious and will deteriorate.  Were it not for the recession, we would be at a more critical juncture.  <\/p><p>I welcome the establishment of Irish Water and am perhaps one of the few politicians in the country who is willing to put his hand on his heart and welcome charging for water.  I make no apologies for thinking it long overdue.  However, it is wrong for the Government to emphasise and prioritise the water metering programme and charging for water without simultaneously ensuring we have a secure supply of water.  I believe that can be achieved by the construction of the first reservoir in this country to be built in 70 years.  It is a giant project between Dublin City Council and Bord na M&oacute;na that has been on the books for 12 years.  They had the vision and foresight to pursue this at a time when it was not fashionable and when Bertie Ahern wanted to build the Bertie bowl.  We should have been building and securing strategic infrastructure.  <\/p><p>I welcome the establishment of Irish Water but I want to know how high on its priority list is the provision of the Garryhinch reservoir - a secure and safe water supply that we are in control of.  If we are to aid commerce, industry, foreign direct investment, householders and the agricultural sector and meet our targets under Harvest 2020, we must have a secure supply of water.  As we speak, ten local authorities are already rationing water.  We have hosepipe bans, which are necessary because some people seem to think nothing of watering lawns with treated water.  This is not acceptable and cannot continue but the answer to it is to build the Garryhinch reservoir in Portarlington which will ensure that this country has a secure supply of water for Leinster and the midlands.  It is not a Dublin issue and I hope that Irish Water understands how serious the problem is.  I hope the Minister of State has a positive answer for me this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200044#WW00900","speaker":"1143","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374520500,"counter":694,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue and his thoughtful remarks and analysis, as always.  I am dealing with this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The availability of a long-term, reliable, high-quality and economic supply of drinking water is a key requirement for the future development of the Leinster and the greater Dublin area.  The Dublin regional water supply area consists of all of Dublin city, Fingal, South Dublin and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown along with parts of Wicklow, Kildare and Meath.<\/p><p>The Dublin water supply scheme long-term water source is listed as a scheme at planning stage in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government's water services investment programme 2010-2013.  Dublin City Council is the lead authority for this scheme on behalf of all of the water services authorities in the greater Dublin area.  Studies carried out for the city council and a strategic environmental assessment have identified a preferred option which involves abstraction of raw water from Lough Derg and pumping the abstracted water through a new pipeline to a proposed storage reservoir at Garryhinch cut-away bog in County Offaly, forming part of a proposed midlands water-based eco-park.  After treatment, water would then be conveyed to the west of Dublin where the new supply would be integrated with the existing storage and trunk distribution system.  Dublin City Council has recently carried out a procurement process and I understand it will shortly be in a position to appoint a consultant to advance the further planning of this scheme.<\/p><p>The programme for project implementation has been developed based on the planning and statutory approval phase taking approximately two years.  The detailed design and procurement phase should take a further two years, while the construction and commissioning phase should be completed in three years.  Following their appointment by Dublin City Council, the consultants will undertake the environmental impact statement and other statutory requirements in preparation for a submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la which will adjudicate on the matter.<\/p><p>Following the passage of comprehensive legislation later this year, Irish Water will assume responsibility for the delivery of investment in public water services infrastructure from 1 January 2014.  The programme of investment for 2014 to 2015 is currently being prepared by Irish Water and the implementation strategy agreed by Government provides for the development of a detailed capital programme transition plan to ensure the smooth transition from the water service investment programme 2010-2013 to the Irish Water 2014-2015 plan.  The objective of this plan, currently being developed with programme partners, is to ensure that there is no loss of momentum in capital delivery in respect of projects, be they at construction or in planning.<\/p><p>The Government recently approved the general scheme for the comprehensive legislation and it addresses planning and investment matters, including providing that Irish Water will prepare strategic investment plans addressing a 25-year period.  The plans are aimed at addressing the provision of sufficient water services for domestic users as well as business and industry.  In the course of preparing the plans, Irish Water will be required to consult with the economic and environmental regulators, the regional assemblies proposed under Putting People First and the local authorities.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will also be required to approve the plans.<\/p><p>Irish Water will also prepare water services capital investment plans for the purpose of submitting tariff proposals to the economic regulator.  The capital investment plans will take account of the provisions set out in the water services strategic plan and will be aligned with the next cycle of river basin management plans required under the EU water framework directive.  The plans will have regard to the river basin management plans, local development plans and resources available to the company from Government grants and its own resources.  These mechanisms will ensure continued prioritisation of projects of strategic importance currently in planning in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government's water services investment programme following the hand-over of the capital programme to Irish Water.  The Dublin water supply scheme long term water source is one such scheme.  The establishment of a single water utility should allow for a more streamlined approach to the planning and delivery of the capital programme, which should result in important strategic projects being accelerated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200045#XX00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1374520500,"counter":695,"content":"<p>Has the Senator a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200045#XX00300","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1374520500,"counter":696,"content":"<p>I do.  I welcome the Minister of State's answer.  I think the problem is duly identified and there is a solution afoot.  My concern relates to the answer in that the lead-in time is up to three years.  Time is of the essence.  Three Ministers are involved - the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources; the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government; and the Minister of State with responsibility for the NewERA project who I know are all committed to ensuring this problem is addressed.  However, it is important that we have a coherent strategy that identifies the urgency of this project and the fact that it needs to be addressed without any further delay.<\/p><p>I also pay due regard to the concerns of the Shannon valley and residents along the Shannon basin.  Eighteen counties are involved.  I would not for a second dismiss or in any fashion take lightly their environmental or ecological concerns.  I would not support this project if I thought for one second that it would damage the environment or ecology of the Shannon basin.  I reiterate that the Shannon is in flood for 80% of the year and that the proposal by Dublin City Council, Bord na M&oacute;na and now Irish Water is to abstract 2% to 4% of water from the Shannon when it is in flood.  The water in question very often damages the land and causes serious problems throughout most of the year so I think it is a very viable project.  It is in everyone's interest, not just the Dublin region but the midlands and beyond.  This is a &euro;500 million investment that will create 1,000 construction jobs and thereafter, we will have a resource and asset for the country in terms of strategic infrastructure and a recreational resource comparable to Rutland Water in east Anglia in the UK which will create 250 to 300 sustainable jobs.  I wish to make the point that it would be putting the cart before the horse if we were to charge for and meter water before we provide for the provision of that water.  I urge the Government and Ministers, including the Minister of State with us this evening, to back the message that they must expedite the construction of the Garryhinch reservoir because time is of the essence and because it would be an absolute absurdity to allow this country to run out of water.

It has essentially been asked to do more with less, as has everyone else.<\/p> <p>Women's Aid Dundalk provides a refuge for men, women and children who are fleeing domestic violence.  The funding issue I wish to highlight relates to the moneys allocated by Louth County Council to the refuge for its operational and running costs.  This money keeps the doors open and the lights on and it does not relate to salary or care needs.  Unfortunately, Women's Aid Dundalk is in a precarious financial position and has been unable to agree an adequate service level agreement with the council.  There have been numerous communications between the two but, unfortunately, on 9 July, the organisation was informed that, at best, it would face a 53% budget reduction.  This figure is not even guaranteed, as it relies on three other service providers not using all of their allocation, which is incredibly unlikely.  The 53% figure is the best case scenario.<\/p><p>Women's Aid Dundalk will not be able to continue to execute this incredibly vital service without the proper appropriations.  The board members have identified that they would be able to manage a 33% reduction in operating costs but could not accommodate further cuts without closing their doors.  They were informed there would be no way to accommodate this 33% reduction.  We have continually asked everyone in every sector to &quot;do more with less&quot; but this is absurd.  We cannot ask Women's Aid Dundalk to work with this extreme cut to its budget within a short year.  The Council of Europe has reported that the Louth, Cavan and Monaghan region operates at 38% below the recommended level of refuge provision.  We are behind Bosnia-Herzegovina in this respect.<\/p><p>The Dundalk branch of Women's Aid has been forced to turn away 160 people in need of crisis accommodation since the start of this year.  I am worried that the closure of the refuge would result in further pressing demands on the other local service providers and more people remaining in domestic abuse situations because they have nowhere to go.  In times of unemployment and economic uncertainty, the levels of physical, mental, sexual and emotional abuse increase, which is why it is ironic that the funding for services such as the Women's Aid refuge in Dundalk that provide an outlet for these victims is being reduced.<\/p><p>On 1 August, the current service level agreement with Louth County Council will discontinue and Women's Aid Dundalk will cease to be able to provide refuge services.  We have 11 days to resolve this issue.  Will we be proactive or will we allow this service to become another victim of the recession?  I am also concerned for those currently using the service and what will happen to them on 1 August.  Will the other overstretched services absorb the numbers currently availing of the refuge in Dundalk?<\/p><p>I ask that this service not be forced to close down for even a single day and that the level of funding be revised to reflect the 33% budget cut that has been indicated as manageable.  This service is not asking to have its funding levels restored to that of previous years.  The board members are asking that they be given sufficient funding to continue to operate their service to the best of their ability.  The reduction of 33%, while not ideal, would result in the refuge keeping its doors open.  The three other service providers will be unable to absorb the numbers if the refuge were to close.<\/p><p>Women's Aid Dundalk was thriving in every other area of its work before the issues with section 10.  It was looking to expand to a larger building and increase its accommodation levels.  This has had to be shelved.  The proposed cut to operational funding is the only reason that this refuge provider will close.  Until we move towards a revised policy and an amendment to legislation, we will continue to need the current level and then some of refuge service.  Unfortunately, there will always be a section of society that needs refuge services.  On our part, in the future we need to determine a way in which to separately categorise domestic violence homelessness from homelessness arising from other issues.  As I was told by a representative from Women's Aid Dundalk earlier: &quot;Moving from refuge should be a process not an event.&quot;  I have comprehensively outlined the need for Women's Aid Dundalk refuge to have a presence in my community because, without it, where do the men, women and children go?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200045#XX00900","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1374521100,"counter":703,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the comprehensive treatment she has given to this important matter.  Domestic, sexual and gender-based violence are serious health, social and human rights issues that affect people across society from all walks of life and all cultural, social and ethnic backgrounds and across all age groups.  The majority of victims are women but a significant number of men are affected and abuse also occurs in same sex relationships.  With a view to tackling these serious issues, the Department of Justice and Equality established Cosc, as an executive office of that Department.  Cosc's key task is to ensure the delivery of a well co-ordinated whole of government response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence against women, men and older people in the community.  In March 2010 the Government launched a national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, a four-year strategy to provide a framework for sustainable intervention to prevent and effectively respond to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Responsibility for the implementation of this strategy lies with Cosc.<\/p><p>The HSE published its own complementary policy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, which is in line with the national strategy.  The HSE policy focuses on eight key high level goals and actions, including standardisation of service provision across the country, training for all HSE staff and voluntary-community sector providers and a strong focus on hearing the voice of service users in all aspects of service planning, design, development, delivery and evaluation.  The HSE allocated more than &euro;18.2 million in 2013 to domestic violence services, which is a 2.5% reduction compared to 2012 due to the overall HSE budget deficit.  As with all domestic violence services, this 2.5% cut was also applied to Women's Aid Dundalk, the allocation to which is &euro;425,000 in 2013.  This allocation goes towards funding of support staff working in refuges for the victims of domestic violence as well as those involved in associated support services.<\/p><p>Non-pay current funding is allocated through the local authorities.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government recoups current funding to local housing authorities under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 for accommodation and related services for homeless persons, which can include victims of domestic violence.  A significant portion of the funding provided annually is in respect of domestic violence refuges.  Some &euro;2.5 million was provided in 2012 under section 10 towards the costs of domestic violence-related facilities and initiatives nationwide.  In addition to refuges, victims of domestic violence may also use other mainstream homeless accommodation solutions that are funded by the Department, for example, hostels, bed and breakfast and transitional accommodation.<\/p><p>The national implementation plan for the homeless strategy provided for the development of a more devolved allocation-based system for the provision of accommodation-related current funding to housing authorities with emphasis on increased decision making at local level.  Under these arrangements, responsibility for decision-making on the funding of particular services within available allocations rests with the statutory homeless management group.  In this instance, it is the north-east regional homeless management group led by Louth County Council.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has no function, nor is it involved in, decisions on operational matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013072200046#YY00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1374521100,"counter":704,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister of State's reply but a more direct question must be put regarding the Women's Aid refuge in Dundalk, which services County Louth and surrounding counties.
