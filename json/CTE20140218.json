Changing land use is a slow process, not only in Ireland but internationally, that requires early engagement because it is difficult to manage.  The time horizon is between 2020 and 2050.  The European Commission is preparing a land use directive aimed at dealing with the challenges we will be discussing today.  We would like Ireland to be in a position to inform this process rather than respond to it in ten years' time.  Our work is based on numerous reports and scientific papers but this presentation will be a whistle-stop tour.<\/p><p>  At global level there are two grand challenges facing agriculture, namely, achieving and maintaining food security and sustainability.  By 2050, the world population will have risen to 9 billion.  Particularly in emerging countries, there is an increase in demand for livestock produce.  The demand for food is expected to go up by 60% by 2015.  With sustainability, there is the impact of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change on agriculture.  Globally, agriculture is the largest consumer of fresh water.  There is also pressure on biodiversity.  Wherever agricultural areas expand, it commonly comes at the expense of biodiversity such as with the Amazon rain forests or high nature value farmlands in Europe.<\/p><p>  The question we are facing is how we can maximise multi-functionality of our limited land resources.  Ireland is no different in this respect and can be considered a microcosm of these global challenges.  Food Harvest 2020 is an agricultural policy in response to food security concerns.  We also have a raft of environmental policies coming from Brussels and national level.<\/p><p>  What do we expect from our land?  There are five high level demands on land use, namely, the provision of food, fibre and fuel, water purification, to sequester carbon to offset greenhouse gas emissions, to provide a habitat for biodiversity and a home for nutrients in the form of cow or pig slurry or sewage sludge from human waste.  Over the past five years, Teagasc has conducted a scoping study on the extent to which we are likely to meet all these demands.  Over the short term, up to 2020, there is a real potential to meet these competing demands for land but only if the process is managed from the very start.  That was also the conclusion of the independent environmental analysis of Food Harvest 2020, published by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the past fortnight.<\/p><p>  How can we achieve the targets set out in Food Harvest 2020?  It can be done through intensification, keeping more animals on the same intensively farmed land base to achieve more output.<\/p> <p>Alternatively, the same targets can be reached through expanding the land area intensively farmed and increasing the total number of animals but not the average stocking rate.  The third pathway is what we call resource efficiency where we produce more from the same amount of input and the same number of animals.  In reality, we expect that Food Harvest will achieved through a combination of all three pathways.<br \/>What are the implications for land use categories and land use change?  We are not going into the detail of these figures here.  These are historical figures from the CSO on the broad land use categories and our projections to 2020.  The bottom line is that our projection is that Food Harvest 2020 <i>per se<\/i>will have limited impact on the broad land use categories in Ireland.  The caveat is that within grassland, we expect an expansion of the intensively managed grasslands at the expense of the extensively managed grassland, mainly through new drainage schemes.<br \/>The second demand we are facing relates to greenhouse gases and climate change.  This is where we expect our land to sequester carbon.  The context of this debate is that, as we now know, it is extremely difficult to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions <i>per se<\/i>and that it is a simply a reflection of our ruminant dominated livestock industry.  It is very difficult to reduce methane emissions from ruminant animals.  At best, we can aspire to flat line our agricultural greenhouse gas emissions in the context of achieving the Food Harvest 2020 objectives.  Half of that story is good news because it means a decoupling of production and emissions.  Within the current Kyoto framework, we are stuck with reducing agricultural emissions.<br \/>Post-Kyoto, new thinking is emerging to allow agriculture to take credit for the good things it does in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, mainly sequestering carbon in the soil and displacing fossil fuel emissions or imports through bio-energy and biofuel crops.  We have carried out an assessment of the potential of this off-setting and currently our grasslands are sequestering carbon at a high rate.  Our first generation forestry is also sequestering carbon.  Our arable lands are considered neutral whereas our drained organic soils are a source of carbon emissions.<br \/>We also assessed the future potential.  We may or may not be able to increase our grassland sequestration.  It will be difficult because the rates are already so high.  There is real potential to expand our first generation forestry area and hence increase carbon sequestration.  There is also real potential for bio-energy crops as a sink for carbon.  In December, we published a comprehensive report about it that is available on our website.  The overall conclusion is that there is real potential for agricultural off-setting of greenhouse gas emissions but this will require land use change, forestry and bio-energy.  Before that becomes a reality, there are many obstacles.  These obstacles are regulatory, social and economic, particularly in respect of bio-energy.  There is real potential here for competition with both food production and biodiversity objectives.<br \/>A third demand we ask of our land is the provision of clean water.  Here we are led by the EU water framework directive, which is a very complex directive, but, ultimately, it comes down to two objectives.  The first is to achieve good water quality status for all water bodies across the EU.  If we have a quick look at how Ireland is faring - there is a slide with the 17 original EU member states with Ireland highlighted - we can see that the directive ultimately requires that all the bars are either green or blue.  At the moment, Ireland is not in a bad starting position.  It is in fourth place in the EU in terms of the amount of water we consider to be of good quality.  From our agricultural catchments programme, we know that the nitrates action plan that has been in place for the past ten years will go a long way towards achieving good water quality status.  One important caveat is that this is a very slow process.  Our farmers have implemented many measures to protect water quality under the nitrates directive but it may take many years - ten or 20 years - before this translates into good water quality.  This simply due to legacy effects in our soils.<br \/>The second objective of the water framework directive is more challenging.  Wherever there is pristine water quality, this must be maintained.  This is better than good water quality.  Of particular relevance in Ireland are the freshwater pearl mussel and the catchments in which this shellfish is found.  It is a very rare shellfish that is threatened with extinction across the EU and worldwide.  These are the water bodies where we require pristine water quality to be maintained.  Our overall conclusion here is that additional actions may be required to maintain these pristine water bodies.  One caveat is that any actions must be assessed for cost-effectiveness.  Often one can get the same result for an order of magnitude difference in the cost.  In other words, some actions are very cost-effective and cheap while others can be very expensive.<br \/>This leads us neatly to our last demand, which is to provide a habitat for biodiversity.  Here we are led by the EU habitats directive and the birds directive which have led to the designation of Natura 2000 sites across Ireland in which biodiversity is prioritised.  That is the good news.  The bad news is that according to the National Parks and Wildlife Service survey, the outlook for many of these habitats is either bad or poor.  There are also concerns about high nature value farmland outside these areas.  This has culminated in a negative judgement against Ireland by the European Court of Auditors, which has been well documented.  Our conclusion is that additional action may be required to maintain the rich natural heritage of our landscape but, again, any actions must be assessed for cost-effectiveness.<br \/>This leads to the question of how we can manage these competing demands for land.  We have a limited land base.  How can we manage that?  We know from our work that all our soils perform all functions in response to these demands but some soils perform some functions better than others.  Some soils are better than others at producing agricultural output and some soils are better than others at purifying water.  A solution could lie in the targeted management of our three scenarios - roll out resource efficiency where this is cost-effective.  Intensification may be justified and desirable where we have the soils that can process the additional nutrient loads.  Expansion may be the preferred option where this competes with high nature value farmland.<br \/>The next logical question is how this can be managed.  A particular challenge we are facing is that it is often assumed this can only be managed through command and control or red lining areas for agriculture, sequestration or forestry, but this is not necessarily the case because it can also be managed through what we call soft incentivisation.  Indeed, the EU, including Ireland, has a very long history and tradition of managing land use through schemes like the Common Agricultural Policy; the less favourable areas, LFAs; agri-environmental schemes; and the forestry scheme.  There is no reason this could not also be applied to manage land use in a future context.<br \/>How is Teagasc addressing these issues?  It is fair to say that most of our research, knowledge transfer and education programmes have focused on the resource efficiency scenario - getting more value and more output out of the same amount of input and land base.  Examples are the carbon navigator, the grass wedge and the economic breeding index.  We have a new programme called a soil quality assessment and research programme, which is funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, where we will quantify these five soil functions for more than 150 farms throughout the country.  Another new development is our new sustainability demonstration farm, which we launched in October 2013 in Kildalton, where we will bring together all our knowledge in education, research and knowledge transfer on this resource efficiency.  We also engage with policy.  Our submissions to the review of the nitrates action plan, the climate policy and the development of the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, are well documented.  We are also engaging at EU level.  We have worked with the Commission on the bio-physical criteria of the new LFAs and are now leading a proposal under Horizon 2020 called LANDMARK which is aimed at informing the new EU land use directive.<br \/>The final point that may be of note to the committee is that, this year, Teagasc will launch the Irish soil information system, ISIS.<\/p> <p>It is a five and a half year collaboration between Teagasc and the Environmental Protection Agency which produced the new high resolution soil map of Ireland.  All of our soil information will be publicly and freely available on the web.  The scale will be 1:250,000 which makes it applicable for use at national and regional level.  It is not applicable at field or farm level.<br \/>We have two headline conclusions: in the short term it looks like there is an opportunity to manage our land resources to meet all targets but only if we manage them from the start.  After 2020, however, hard choices on our land use may be required.  These might even be choices between sustainability indicators and we might face questions such as do we want to offset our agricultural or greenhouse gas emissions, for example, through forestry.  This may come at the expense of biodiversity, or <i>vice versa<\/i>, do we want to protect all biodiversity which will reduce the opportunity for carbon offsetting?  Then we have to throw in the other demands, food production and water quality and we may be faced with very difficult choices.  The one thing that is clear is that we can no longer address these challenges one at a time.  We cannot deal with water quality this week and greenhouse gases next week.  It requires a coherent response.  This is a good opportunity for engagement, as we have started, but it is a slow process.  We have heard the first discussions on a successor to Food Harvest 2020, named Food Harvest 2025.  That may be a good opportunity to start thinking about these competing demands for land use to bring it into the process.  This is a timely moment to engage with the EU process.  We would like Ireland to be in a position to inform that process, rather than in ten years time having to respond to its outcome.  <br \/>I thank the committee for its time.  We will welcome whatever questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014021800003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rogier Schulte","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392733500,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Schulte.

I appreciate Dr. Schulte is trying to aggregate them in averages, but how can he be more specific about the different soil types across the country in a way that will help achieve the 2050 goal?

There have been changes owing to drainage and so on which have created different types of soil.  How will that input into his process?

I wrote them down but do not hesitate to tell me if I skip any.  <\/p><p>  The 60% increase in demand for food is a global figure, but there are very different challenges and demands around the globe.  There is great potential for developing countries to increase yields through the use of science and technology and the application of simple things such as fertiliser.  We are working closely with Irish Aid to lend our expertise in agricultural production and have established an international food security committee to co-ordinate that expertise with Irish Aid.  Senator Susan O'Keeffe is correct to point out that 1 billion people are undernourished or hungry.  That is one of the main drivers of our collaboration with Irish Aid.<\/p><p>  There is a certain degree of confusion about the targets set under Food Harvest 2020.  It contains only one volume target, that is, an increase of 50% in dairy and milk volume in response to the phasing out of the milk quota.  All of the other targets are value based.  The changes in the demography of the national herd and land use will be less dramatic than they may appear at first glance.  For example, the projection from our Teagasc FAPRI Ireland model is that we will see an increase in milk volume and the number of dairy cows, but it will be partially offset by a projected contraction of the national suckler herd.  As these additional dairy cows produce more calves, they will offset some of the suckler cow production.<\/p><p>  On whether intensification under Food Harvest 2020 will increase pressures on water quality, this is where management comes in.  Our agriculture catchment programme aims to measure the impact on water quality of intensive agricultural production in compliance with the nitrates directive.  This is a complex programme, with complex outcomes, but the headline is that the nitrous action plan will go a long way towards ensuring good water quality across the board.  When we bring our paper into the equation, a wide range of soils have the capacity to process additional nutrients.  This is reflected in the good water quality status we enjoy in Ireland compared to many other EU member states.  However, certain soils are approaching their maximum capacity for processing these nutrient loads and purifying water to quality standards.  This is where target management comes into play.  Some soils can cope with additional nutrient loads, whereas others cannot.  The most important achievement of Food Harvest 2020 is that it has brought sustainability and growth in the agriculture industry to the same side of the table.  The environment is no longer considered a constraint on production.  We are now building on our green credentials.  Bord Bia is promoting this as a point of differentiation on international markets.  The sustainability of our systems will allow us to grow the industry.  Clearly, we cannot afford to sit still because other countries are catching up with us rapidly.  We have to keep working on sustainability.<\/p><p>  That leads me to the question of genetically modified organisms, GMOs.  This is a complex area.  Perhaps members saw the most recent episode of \"Eco Eye\" which featured some of Teagasc's research on GMOs.  We maintain a completely scientific position on the subject.  There are clear benefits from GMO crops, but there are also perceived risks.  We are researching both the potential benefits and the potential risks in highly controlled and regulated conditions and will await the outcome of our research before taking further steps.  It is worth noting that the field of genetic modification is developing very rapidly and the distinction between conventional breeding and genetically modified breeding is beginning to blur in laboratories.  It may become increasingly difficult to tell one from the other.<\/p> <p>I will ask Mr. Fealy to speak on the issue of incentivisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014021800006#F00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rogier Schulte","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392734700,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank everybody for their questions.  There is a comprehensive list for us to deal with.  I agree with Senator O'Keeffe that we would want to be here for some time to adequately address them all but we will do our best.<\/p><p>  On the notion of incentivisation, Deputy Pringle's question referred to the effectiveness of incentivisation in terms of soft incentivisation versus hard incentivisation.  Most of the work in that area is conducted by my colleagues in the socio-economic area of Teagasc where the effects of different types of incentivisation are rolled out.  However, as a general principle, we view the construction of a framework that avoids red-lining - another question we got a short time ago was on restricting areas of land for particular types of activity - as a particular path that should be avoided.  <\/p><p>  Traditionally, the way we have implemented changes and moves towards best practice was through the incentivisation model.  Ultimately, if we are to expect our farm stakeholders to be the arbiters and those responsible for maintaining our land to the best possible quality in a manner that will lead to the best economic outputs and the best agricultural production outputs while maintaining environmental quality, we must have cognisance of the fact that it is a public good and a service to the public good, and incentives must be designed to meet that end.  That is what is engendering the approach we are now examining with regard to a framework for moving into the future.  A framework needs to be built that takes account of the multiple outcomes of agricultural land use in Ireland, be they for environmental quality or for agricultural productivity.  To date, incentives have been designed with a singular outcome in mind and while the incentive is designed in such a manner that would bring one to that end, it has created what are termed perverse outcomes in that there have been negative impacts that might not have been considered previously. <\/p><p>  Two examples come to mind.  Traditionally, perhaps our management around upland areas and sheep has been shown in retrospect to be misguided, and the issue around overstocking has created some problems, particularly in the western areas.  Also, in retrospect the expansion of forestry onto deep peatland soils with a singular species was not the most productive and useful way to go in forestry, but we are learning.  As research, time and resources are put into these problems we are learning that there are better ways to approach the way we incentivise land management.<\/p><p>  One or two questions were asked about soils.  Soils and soil mapping is a particular area for spatial analysis in Teagasc.  If I understand his question correctly, Deputy Penrose asked how we take account of the finer detail of soil variability in Ireland in a national mapping.  It is a good question and one I have had to deal with for nigh on 16 years in my career in Teagasc.  It is a challenging task.  Depending on the classification system we use there are ten or 11 major soil groups in Ireland, and nine of them have been recorded as occurring in one field in Cork.  Without referring to Cork, that suggests how difficult the task is of mapping our soils.<\/p><p>  In terms of the way we approach this problem, with the production of the 1:250,000 map, we show soils in their generality and we show soils with the proportions that occur in a particular region.  These are called soil associations.  That is the classic industry standard, so to speak, in terms of the way soil mapping should be approached.  We would always add a caveat when people are using the data that soil maps are not to be used for sight-specific purposes.  For any reason, be it for the positive side of farm productivity or a farmer making an assessment within field or regulatory efforts, a national soil map should not be used at point or field scale.<\/p><p>  Senator O'Keeffe asked if we are ahead or behind the curve.  Interestingly, when I started in Teagasc we had drifted behind.  We are now coming towards the front, particularly in light of the near completion of phase 1 of the Irish Soil Information System, ISIS, project.  This is an opportune time to answer this question because we are at the end of phase 1 and it is due to be presented towards the beginning of March.  For the first time we will have a comprehensive database containing all our soils information that has been developed over many years, since the mid-1950s, which will be available to the public via a web browser interface.<\/p><p>  In this regard we have European colleagues and peers on our steering committee, and colleagues of mine have been invited to present to European organisations on the way we have developed that system.  We are using leading-edge technology to both store and disseminate the information, and at this stage we are coming back into a position where we are beginning to lead the curve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014021800007#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Reamonn Fealy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392734700,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I shall follow up on that regarding another question posed on our access to the Commission and feeding into that process.  It is because of initiatives like the Irish Soil Information System, and a representative from the European Commission is chairing the steering committee of that project, that we now have a good working relationship with it, particularly its soils unit in Ispra, in Italy.  Also, the paper the members have before them has been read and commented on by the European Commission.  The landmark proposal to which I referred is a very large Horizon 2020 proposal on soil quality and soil functions that we are leading for that very reason.  We are reasonably satisfied, therefore, with our working relationship with the Commission.<\/p><p>  One of the benefits of being a relatively small country is that we have fairly short lines of communication here compared to other countries in that we have good collaboration between the State agencies and the various Departments that are involved.  It is relatively easy to get a group of people together and come to a position compared to the position in some of the bigger member states that have to go through more layers, so to speak.<\/p><p>  Deputy Penrose asked about the offsetting of carbon emissions.  Our figures suggest that, currently, the offsetting equals one third of agricultural emissions in Ireland and that without action that will not improve because our first generation forestry that was planted after 1990 is beginning to mature.  We will then go into second generation forestry etc., and the potential for carbon sequestration of those is lower.  However, in a report on carbon neutrality as a Horizon point, we also identify actions that can be taken to rectify that, and increasing of forestation is an option in that regard.  There is a difference in terms of the physical land base that in theory is available for additional forestry.  However, the reality is very much restricted by regulation and social dimensions.  It involves forestry, a change of enterprise type, a complete change of business, and there are also social barriers.<\/p><p>  A question was asked on the bio-energy side.  If as a country we want to seriously get involved in bio-energy, it requires a change in our energy infrastructure, and there would be significant economic costs involved in that.  When we talk about bio-energy, like many other countries the thinking is moving away from liquid biofuels because liquid biofuels are considered in direct competition with food production.  When we talk about bio-energy now we are talking about either bio-energy crops - willow, miscanthus - where there is less competition with food production.  <\/p><p>  We are also at a very early exploratory stage of anaerobic digestion of grass in combination with slurry.  The one thing this country can produce very well is grass.  If we chose to we could produce much more grass than we currently do, which could be used for bio-energy without undue competition for land.  There are many obstacles to overcome before that becomes a reality.  Again, it would require a change in the infrastructure of our energy distribution network.  In terms of Horizon 2020, we should not pin our hopes on that but when we are talking about Horizon 2050, it is one of the options that could be explored.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014021800007#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rogier Schulte"},{"type":"speech","time":1392735300,"counter":24,"content":"<p>And Kildalton?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014021800008#H00100","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392735300,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Apologies, it is an exciting initiative.

Also, the Kilkenny area, or the wider catchment area there, is where we see a lot of movement in terms of Food Harvest 2020 - many new entrants into dairy production.  What we are doing there is bringing together all our research on sustainable farming from all our research centres - our dairy production centre, our beef research, our tillage, our rural economy and our soil centres - to showcase options for best practice in sustainable farming.<\/p><p>  It is always difficult in our line of work to make that link, from proving options at research level in experiments to achieving it on the ground on a large number of farms.

We will demonstrate options - going back to the paper - on how to maximise what we get from the land, in terms of food production, water quality and greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p><p>  As to whether we can capitalise on that natural capital that we have there, it will involve a large KT programme bringing both farmers and food business on board.

We conducted a study in the Lough Melvin area.  Lough Melvin is one of these pristine water bodies.  It was a North-South collaboration because it is a cross-Border lake.  We looked at approximately 20 different options to reduce loss of phosphorus, from the land to the water.  Phosphorus was the biggest threat to that pristine water quality.  We found that, in theory, many of the measures would be effective in reducing phosphorus flow, from the land to the water, but the difference in cost was significant.  To give two extreme examples, one measure proposed in the scientific literature is to stop access of animals to the water bodies.  In the Lough Melvin area, the challenge is that there is water everywhere and the stocking rate is low, and one would need miles of fencing to keep each cow out of the water.  If one considers the cost-effectiveness of stopping that one cow from standing in the water, it is an expensive option.  Another measure we looked at was soil testing for phosphorus and customising the fertiliser management accordingly, which came out as a cheap option.<\/p><p>  It is worth noting though that such difference in cost-effectiveness is catchment-specific.  The reason fencing was so expensive on Lough Melvin is miles per cow.  If one goes to a different catchment with well-drained soils, few rivers or streams, and a high stocking density, that equation changes completely.  Also, if one looks at other risks, such as transfer of pathogens, then in that equation for keeping the cows out of the water one comes up with a different figure for cost-effectiveness, but it can differ by orders of magnitude.  In fact, in the Lough Melvin scenario, and if the objective is to reduce phosphorus, then the fencing option turned out to be 100 times more expensive than soil testing if one compares kilo for kilo of phosphorus lost to the water.  It is a real issue.<\/p><p>  On the additional actions for the pristine water quality, the pearl mussel is a peculiar case study.  A map in the presentation shows the catchments where the pearl mussel is found.  It is a slow-growing animal.  It is particularly the young pearl mussels, the juveniles, that are sensitive to both nutrient loss and sediment loss.  Basically, if there are excess nutrients and excess sediment, they get buried and sufficate at the bottom of the stream.  Once they grow to adulthood, they can live for a long time.  They can live for over 100 years.  The challenge is that in all of these blue catchments shown the slide the pearl mussel has been found but in some of these catchments we - by which I mean the National Parks and Wildlife Service, as it, not Teagasc, conducts the surveys - find only adults remaining.  These adults are almost relics of when those waters were pristine, whereas in some of the western catchments there are still viable populations that have a chance of breeding and continuing themselves.<\/p><p>  This leads us to a peculiar challenge.  Under the habitats directive, we are obliged to protect this species but nobody knows whether it is technically possible for these old pearl mussels to start breeding again in some of the more intensively used catchments - hence our hesitation in making straight statements on what should be done.  To the best of our knowledge, the National Parks and Wildlife Service has now also prioritised the catchments accordingly.  It has put the highest priority on those catchments where the pearl mussels are still breeding and there is a chance of success.  That brings me back to cost-effectiveness.<\/p> <p>We are better off putting money into small catchments, where there is a chance of success, rather than spreading it over a large area where it may be difficult.<\/p><p> The first point we are trying to make is that some of the soil functions are tradeable between areas while others are not.  Water quality is a soil function that is not tradeable because we require good groundwater conditions for drinking wherever we are.  We cannot increase the pressure on water quality in one area at the expense of another area and vice versa.  Carbon sequestration is the other side of the extreme.  Technically, from the point of view of the atmosphere or from a global warming point of view, it is irrelevant what catchment, what area or even what country the carbon comes from.  The reason we mention it in the paper is that at regional and national level it may not be the most prudent approach to expect every farmer to put all his energy into soil everywhere for the purpose of carbon sequestration because not all soils are suitable for further carbon sequestration.  We may get more benefits from trading between catchments or regions where people target carbon sequestration and food production.  That is an area we are currently conducting research on so we do not have the final word on it.  It will be a number of years before we are finished.  We are doing a number of scenario analysis projects.<\/p><p> Deputy Pringle is correct to point out the potential difficulties at international level.  Scientifically, the concept holds internationally and, just like in the energy market which we were discussing before we came in, there is a move for southern Europe to produce solar energy in summer and northern Europe to produce wind turbines in the winter.  This can then be traded and it makes the most of our resources.  The same could apply to carbon sequestration if we identify areas that are good at the carbon sequestration and areas that are good at producing grain  It is a very difficult area will prove difficult even within the EU.  Had do we value it and how do we incentivise countries?  Will we export our problems to developing countries?  That is a question mark that can be already placed over the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, REDD, vehicle under the UNFCCC where, as a country, we can invest in credits in developing countries.  There is merit in it and it is a win-win scenario but there is a valid question as to whether we are exporting our problems.  As a scientist, I am reluctant to say as there is no scientific answer to it.  It is a matter of values.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014021800008#H00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rogier Schulte","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392735900,"counter":32,"content":"<p>One point we did not touch on is the green, orange and red table in the presentation.

There should be a certain level of re-evaluation, without compromising it.  Our 20-20-20 targets need to be looked at in that light.

I am accompanied by officials of the Department, Mr. Philip Kelly, assistant secretary, Mr. Tommy Murray, principal officer, Ms Orla O&rsquo;Brien, assistant principal officer and Mr. Garry Purcell, higher executive officer, all of whom work on different aspects of the Competitiveness Council agenda, which is quite broad.<br \/>The first item on the council&rsquo;s agenda is a policy debate on industrial competitiveness. <b><\/b>It is intended that the council would send a clear signal to the March European Council on industrial policy priorities and on ways to improve sustainable industrial competitiveness.  The debate will be informed by four Commission communications adopted in late January.<br \/>The core Commission communication, adopted on 22 January, &quot;For a European industrial renaissance&quot;, was presented by Commissioner Tajani.  It does not promote any particularly new initiatives but sets out the Commission's key drivers and priorities for EU industrial policy and industrial competitiveness.  It also proposes to increase the share of manufacturing in GDP from 15% currently to reach as much as 20% share of GDP by 2020.  <br \/>It<b><\/b>draws on the recommendations contained in the Commission&rsquo;s annual growth survey, found at <i>ec.europa.eu\/europe2020\/pdf\/2014\/ags2014 en.pdf<\/i>, provides an overview of actions already undertaken and puts forward selected priorities to speed up the remaining actions.  It reflects our own belief that we need to focus more on industrial strategy and on manufacturing potential that is probably untapped.  <br \/>The European Commission is urging member states to recognise the central importance of industry for creating jobs and growth, and of mainstreaming competitiveness concerns across all policy areas.  This is the key message of the communication. <br \/>The Greek Presidency will chair a policy debate at the council on industrial competitiveness on the basis of this core communication.  The results of that debate will be fed into the similar debate on energy, climate change and industrial policy which is to take place at the European Council meeting of 20-21 March 2014.  The Presidency has also associated three other important Commission communications recently published, namely, &quot;A vision for the internal market for industrial products&quot;, which builds on the results of the evaluation of EU law in the area of industrial products to assess the regulatory framework&rsquo;s overall coherence and fitness for purpose; &quot;Energy prices and costs in Europe&quot;, which analyses the cost of energy across Europe and proposes actions to reduce energy costs in the context of Europe&rsquo;s global competitiveness; and &quot;A policy framework for climate and energy in the period from 2020 to 2030&quot;, which proposes a new policy framework around energy efficiency, renewables and emissions to 2030. <br \/>The common strand through each of these communications is that, in Europe, a policy supportive of a strong role for European industrial actors needs to address all policy areas in a co-ordinated way in order to promote this transformation.  That means developing better co-ordination mechanisms to address more coherently different policies such as environmental, climate, energy, trade, competition, skills, state aid and regional policies, all in support of sustainable jobs and growth.  For some time competitiveness Ministers have been grappling with the problem of how to achieve greater coherence across the policy spectrum between national and EU efforts.  Our view is that there is an onus on the Competitiveness Council to robustly monitor and track all unintended consequences of other council formations decisions and policies in the context of competitiveness and jobs. <br \/>For example, high energy costs are now a significant threat to Europe&rsquo;s competitiveness.  Therefore, competitiveness and energy must go hand in hand and the new 2030 climate framework must take into account international competitors and the development of an internal energy market and energy infrastructures and interconnections.  The energy price gap is so wide that gas in Europe is three times more expensive and electricity twice as expensive as in the US.  As a result, the transfer of production from Europe to the US is a real threat.  Therefore it is very important that the internal market in energy is completed as a contributor to lower costs for industry and business - the energy-intensive manufacturing sector in particular.  This is a vital component towards sustaining Europe&rsquo;s external competitiveness.  <br \/>While the communication calls for the EU to continue to vigorously pursue free trade agreements, the final conclusions themselves could have mentioned the strengthening of links between trade and free trade agreements and completion of the internal market and the growth agenda in that regard. I believe that we have to exploit the added value and benefits of free trade agreements as a contributor to global regulatory convergence, jobs, growth, the export potential of goods and services, and in particular internationalisation opportunities for SMEs.<br \/>The communication fails to mention the potential for &quot;reshoring&quot; or &quot;in-shoring&quot; of firms and industry back to Europe as a consequence of advances in technology, competitiveness gains, etc.<\/p> <p>Industrial competitiveness can play an important role in rebalancing an economy and boosting growth, and in raising the potential for &quot;reshoring&quot; industry back to Europe.  Furthermore, the pervasive development of global value chains requires a focus on encouraging strong European networking and inter-firm linkages to build competitive advantage and enhance productivity gains.<br \/>The next agenda item is a policy debate on integration of the EU&rsquo;s internal market and aspects of the European semester.  In terms of how member states have implemented the 2013 country specific recommendations in key areas, the report from the Commission indicates that more needs to be done in product and services markets to boost the EU's growth potential and in improving the business environment. <br \/>The commission&rsquo;s second annual report on single market integration presents an analysis of the state of such integration in five single market priority sectors, with the highest growth potential; namely, services, financial services, energy, transport and digital markets.  Based on its assessment of where progress was made and where challenges remain, the Commission identifies further priorities for national reforms, including a more ambitious implementation of the services directive as well as liberalisation of the regulated professions.  Incidentally, this is the first year where Ireland comes into these country specific recommendations, because this process of the European semester did not apply in Ireland as the troika recommendations were applied to Ireland.<br \/>Services markets are important sources of job creation in Europe.  In Ireland, the services sector accounts for 69% of GDP and 78% of employment overall.  The services covered by the services directive amount to 45% of EU GDP.  Ireland has also been ranked as the world&rsquo;s third most globalised nations in terms of GDP.  Both the Commission and the European Parliament consider that a more integrated and better functioning single market for services is vital to contribute to the economic recovery of the EU and to the ability of Europe to trade globally.  In linking this with the other previous agenda items, I believe that enhancing industrial competitiveness necessitates a robust openness to international trade, because trade and competitiveness are interlinked and trade provides the opportunity for SMEs to internationalise and obtain access to global supply chains.  As we know, the productivity gap between the EU and the US is growing partly due to under-investment in ICTs and relevant skills, failure to complete the digital single market and regulatory barriers across services markets, to name but a few.  That is why it is so important that in tandem with completing our own internal market, an ambitious free trade agreement with the United States is delivered - one that addresses non-tariff barriers, takes concrete steps to secure significant regulatory coherence and opens procurement opportunities for European companies.<br \/>The Commission estimates that the measures which member states have adopted to implement the services directive will, over time, generate an additional 0.8% of EU GDP, with the majority of the effect materialising during the five to ten years following implementation.  Economic analysis has shown that if all member states were to abolish almost all of the remaining restrictions, the total economic gain would be more than three times than what has already been achieved.  This amounts to 2.6% of GDP.  Therefore, the Commission is striving to ensure that the unequivocal obligations contained in the services directive, such as prohibition on nationality or country of residence grounds, are tackled vigorously.  The purpose is to put an end to practices by some member states, professions or businesses that unjustifiably hamper access to their services by residents in other member states.<br \/>I will mention the National Competitiveness Council&rsquo;s AOB items only very briefly.  The first item is information from the Commission on the ninth meeting of the Union for the Mediterranean on Euro-Mediterranean industrial co-operation.  The next two items are in respect of an update on the proposal for a Council recommendation on the European tourism quality principle.  The overall objective of the initiative is to bring a certain level or consistency into the quality of tourism services among the participating service providers across the EU.  The next AOB item is about a European strategy for coastal and maritime tourism, which clearly is of interest to Ireland.<br \/>The Italian delegation has requested an AOB item on the impact on the EU <i>acquis <\/i>and internal market of a &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; nutrition labelling system recommended in some member states.  This is an issue that comes under the remit of the Minister for Health.  Italy and a number of other members states are objecting to the voluntary food labelling scheme introduced in the UK under the EU food information regulations.  Some member states are concerned that multiple nutritional labelling schemes might be endorsed, confusing the consumer.  Ireland intends to carry out a public consultation to ascertain public support for such a scheme.  The next AOB item involves an update from the Commission on state aid modernisation.  The discussion at the council will focus on a short update from Commissioner Almunia on the progress of the state aid modernisation initiative.<br \/>The next AOB relates to the proposed directive on disclosure of non-financial and diversity reporting for certain large companies and groups.  The Council will be updated by the Presidency on the state of play in the negotiations with the Parliament on this proposed directive.  Our position on the draft directive has been positive overall.  However, we have looked for some amendments which we believe would improve the text, with the intention of introducing more flexibility and making it less burdensome for companies to implement.  I hope that the current negotiations will result in a workable instrument.  The next item is an issue being dealt with by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and is related to information from the Commission on a proposal for a directive on electronic invoicing in public procurement.  The final AOB item is a state of play report from the Commission on a proposal for a Council regulation on the Statute for a European foundation.  This dossier comes under the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality.<br \/>As we can see, it is a pretty diverse agenda.  I am happy to take any comments or questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021800003#B00300","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392730800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for their attendance.  The agenda is broad at the National Competitiveness Council, but it strikes me that employment and job creation are periphery to this agenda.  The agenda states that the European Commission is urging member states to recognise the central importance of industry for getting jobs and growth.  That is Andrex puppy stuff; everybody loves it.  Where are the specifics in respect of job creation?  The four Commission communications are for a European industrial renaissance, a vision for an internal market for industrial products, energy prices and costs in Europe, and a policy framework for climate and energy.  Are there job creation targets associated with each of those communications?  Or are they just waffle statements with very nice English?  Has a SWOT analysis been done on the implementation of the Commission directives that might cost jobs in some member states?  Surely job creation and job protection should be at the heart of all of those communications.  I do not get a sense of it from this.<\/p><p>  Can the Minister provide an update on the state aid modernisation AOB item?  What is its potential impact on Ireland and our current state aid regime?  I am glad the Minister is going to introduce the \"reshoring\" industry agenda, but the UK has implemented a very successful strategy in recent months.  There was a very good report last night about reshoring industry back into the UK, even heavy manufacturing, which we were told was gone in that country.

Europe has put its money behind it.  The Horizon 2020 programme involved a substantial increase in a welcome sense from an Irish point of view because we are top of the league in terms of access to funds for SMEs under the programme.  The programme has increased the proportion going to small and medium-sized enterprises from 15% to 20%.  The Commission has identified as key priorities advanced manufacturing, key enabling technologies and bio-based products.  The Commission goes through the list in the document.  Clearly, delivery is everything in this area.  There is a clear view within the European Council and the Heads of State, that a growth strategy is needed for Europe and that growth strategy will be a micro-growth strategy.  It is in these areas.  It is a political judgment to say whether there is a sense of urgency but I believe there is a sense of urgency.  Clearly, we would like to see more.  As the committee is aware, a budgetary ceiling was put on what member states would agree to under the European budget for the coming years and, therefore, Europe must work within the budgetary constraints.<br \/>Reference was made to state aid modernisation, which deals with a broad area.  There are aspects relating to reform of the <i>de minimus<\/i>rule.  The Commission is increasing the <i>de minimus<\/i>rule.  There are several aspects but regional aid is the area of most interest for people in Ireland and we need to advance a new regional aid map by the end of June.  In the coming weeks we will be finalising an approach to the regional aid map.  It is currently being examined by the various agencies in respect of the balance that must be struck.<br \/>In the negotiations there was a rather negative starting point.  The proposal was to reduce it such that 25% of the country would have been covered by aid.  However, through the negotiation of the directives we got it back up to 51.28% in an Irish context, which is marginally more than where we were under the previous regional aid map.<br \/>The other hotly-contested issue was the proposal by the Commission to remove large companies from the so-called C regions.  The proposal was that there would be no aid to large companies in the C regions.  Again, that was re-negotiated and, essentially, large company aid is still permitted once it relates to diversification, new products or processes or new economic activities.  Large company aid remains a possibility within the so-called C regions.  Either a country is in regional aid or otherwise and this means the C regions in the context of Ireland.  We do not have any A regions.<br \/>The Deputy is right about the re-shoring.  There was an interesting case recently in Cork involving Tyco, which had pulled out of Cork and left only a small compliance team.  Significantly, the compliance team proved rather strategic within the organisation and this helped to win back significant investment.  We are alert to the opportunities in this sphere.  The Eishtec case involved business process outsourcing but, again, it is interesting that there is growing interest in on-shoring.  Where a high-quality added-value service is delivered, it can compete and the vogue for off-shoring is somewhat less than it was.  There are opportunities for Ireland in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021800005#D00300","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1392731400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Cathaoirleach agus an Aire.  I welcome the presentation.  Like my colleague, I take the view that the document is high on aspiration and low on detail.  How does the Minister envisage that the industrial proportion of GDP will be increased in the coming period?  What key barriers to competitiveness have been identified?  Has there been any prioritisation of these key barriers?  Often the key barriers are focused on workers' terms and conditions, but there are other key barriers which need to be focused upon as well.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to sustainability and energy.  What are the details in the proposals on reducing energy costs without going down the US route of energy generation?  The regulatory coherence concerning the transatlantic trade and investment partnership is attractive but there is a good deal of scepticism about the projected growth.  The Department released a press statement saying there would be a 0.5% increase in the EU GDP.  However, in another press statement the Department said there would be a 2.6% increase in European GDP.  People in this country have heard of the Lisbon treaty bringing jobs and increasing GDP and they have heard of the fiscal treaty bringing jobs and increasing GDP.  Is there any way we can get further detail on that?  Has there been forecasting with regard to the level of jobs that will be created from these competitive initiatives?  That is the crisis issue throughout the eurozone at the moment.  There are concerns with regard to free trade negotiations to the effect that they will favour big business and large agribusiness to the detriment of smaller businesses, smaller farmers and workers' rights.  What efforts are being made to ensure that small businesses, workers' rights and small agribusinesses are being protected?  Has taxation cropped up in any of these competitiveness negotiations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021800005#D00400","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1392731400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and he is welcome back to the committee.  As I said to Deputy Calleary, it is not unlike our own challenge.  Our approach to the Action Plan for Jobs is not altogether dissimilar to the European approach.  It considers a wide range of areas.  It is possible to see this from the headings, which refer to the integrated market and how we bring down barriers within the market.  Clearly, the biggest of these barriers which remain are in the services sector rather than manufacturing.  Generally speaking, manufacturing does not have many barriers left.  However, there is an opportunity through free trade agreements to bring down barriers.  With the United States the tariff barriers would be of the order of 2% to 3% whereas the non-tariff barriers in the areas where they apply run to 20%.  The non-tariff barriers within many of the free-trade areas are the real opportunity.  The idea is to open up markets by having more standard approaches and mutual recognition of standards.  In a country like ours with our pharmaceuticals it represents a big opportunity.  Clearly, if we do not have to replicate the same approval network in the United States and in the European Union and if there is mutual recognition, then it takes out costs and allows us to compete.  To a considerable degree the integration of markets offers opportunity.<\/p><p>  Another area is investing in innovation, new technologies, production inputs and skills.  It is similar to our agenda and involves looking at how we use our research budgets in a way that opens up opportunities in sectors where we have a competitive edge in Europe.  The document has identified areas such as smart grids, digital infrastructures, clean vehicles and advanced manufacturing.  These are areas we would not dispute.<\/p><p>  Access to finance, which is a major subject of debate here, is still a subject of debate in Europe.<\/p> <p>The perceived lack is that we do not have the seed and venture markets typically available in other countries.  In the immediate crisis the banks have retreated from much of their appetite for risk.  This, in, turn creates additional pressures in Europe and the response from European policy systems is not as successful as one would wish.  <\/p><p> On the question of energy, the loss of competitiveness, rather than raw materials, is the reason.  We are out of line in taxes and levies and network costs.  Raw energy costs are at the centre of most of the tension with regard to shale gas, for example.  The report also indicates that there are savings to be achieved in the transmission and distribution networks.  The reference to the public service obligation, in turn, raises the issue of renewables.  A strong renewables strategy raises the cost of energy in the short term, but in the longer term the view is that a diversified portfolio, with a high level of energy from renewables in the system, will mean that we will have a more robust and sustainable energy environment.  It is a case of short-term versus long-term conflict.<\/p><p> Another matter of interest is the funding and integration of energy infrastructure in Europe.  Ireland is in a vulnerable position in that we do not have the same level of integration as in the rest of Europe.  For example, the advantages of a single European energy market are well known to the Austrians because the market is well interconnected.  Ireland's market is only 8% interconnected; therefore, there are particular challenges facing Ireland in dealing with some of these issues.<\/p><p> Skills is a significant theme.  The vogue in Europe is the German model of apprenticeship which has been proved to be very resilient in the crash.  The Germans have a policy structure that has allowed them to soak up the effects of the recession or depression without an impact on their base which seems to be much more robust.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruar&iacute; Quinn, has received a report on the future of the apprenticeship system and the debate elsewhere in Europe mirrors ours.  <\/p><p> We are undertaking some work on the issue of the cost and benefits.  It is a fair comment that in estimating the potential gains some of the models are very conservative, while others are very rosy.  It is tricky to be accurate and we need to do more work which will involve examining the sectors in which we have the potential to gain.<\/p><p> Members worry that free trade agreements will only be for the big guys.  In many ways, the small guys are screwed by trade barriers because they do not have the sophistication to relocate.  It is a common view that free trade agreements are good for smaller trading and enterprises if one can be confident that regulatory approval in one's home market will travel into overseas markets because that would be much easier for SMEs.  A larger company will be able to manage the regulatory pitfalls, but I would not be of that view.  In any free trade agreement and, in particular, the case of the United States there is no question of a dilution of our policy standards for workers' rights and the environment.  We enter into an agreement with these standards intact.  The issues of regulatory standards are to do with drug approval systems and harmonisation, for example.  An agreement is not designed to undermine public policy.  Both sides enter into the agreement with their own public policies which are off limits.  <\/p><p> The Competitiveness Council is not an arena for discussion of tax matters which are the business of ECOFIN and other international organisations such as the OECD because taxation matters are relevant in countries outside Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021800005#D00500","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392732000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his team.  The business of the Competitiveness Council is European competitiveness.  One of the areas in which Ireland is in big danger is energy and I ask the Minister to speak about what we can do ourselves.  Britain has made a decision about fracking, a subject we have not discussed.  The Irish Sea will be the location of fracking.  Recently published figures show that Ireland will be one of the largest importers of energy supplies in future years.  We can do something about this on our own, rather than relying on others in Europe, but we seem to have turned our backs on it.  In the United States ten or 15 years ago the amount of imported energy supplies was making the country uncompetitive.  It has since become competitive because it has found its own source of energy.  What can we do to reverse the position here?  The European Union is not restricting us, rather it is due to our own inability to do something for ourselves.<\/p><p>  Another area in which to provide opportunities for small and medium businesses is e-commerce.  When I was in a small shop in Estonia, I saw that the company was exporting all around Europe.  Half a dozen employees were selling by way of a system of e-commerce.  Borders and boundaries are restricting e-commerce and cross-border trade over the Internet.  What can we do about this?  What is the European Union doing to ensure cross-border barriers are removed?<\/p><p>  The Minister referred to complaints about food labelling.  We introduced legislation on food provenance.  If we were to introduce information on food provenance in food labelling, customers would have more confidence and trust in Irish food than in food products from other countries.  However, we seem to be reluctant to do this and are waiting for the European Union to move in order that there is concerted action.  This would remove Ireland's inability to compete in the European market.  The Minister also raised the issue, although he said it was the responsibility of the Department of Health.  These are actions we could take and which would give us the ability to be more competitive.  For example, the United States is composed of 50 states, each of which seems to have a great deal of freedom to compete and energise itself.  The European Union, including Ireland, tends to be hampered by a system of centralised control.  The United States seems to be able to work so much better and have become much more competitive.  I would like us to follow some of its example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021800006#E00200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1392732000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>They are big questions.  Many energy resources, including nuclear power and renewables, raise significant public policy concerns which are shared by the general public, not just by policy makers.  The Senator's comments are well made.<\/p> <p>If we want to diversify away from our dependence on fossil fuels, we must identify the sources of energy we intend to pursue and develop a strategy for delivering on that objective.  We have seen that debate taking placing very intensively in recent months in respect of renewables.  The building out of the network is necessary if we are to have interconnection and develop our renewables capacity.  I do not dispute that there are public policy issues for the European Union to tackle.  We need to balance the interests of industry and employment with other interests that are genuinely held by many people.  We have a legal framework within which to do this.  I share the Senator's view that we need to be able to move forward in areas in which we identify opportunities.<\/p><p> On the question of what is being talked about in the broad area of energy, the focus is on energy efficiency, new technologies and better monitoring and control of energy use.  These are areas in which we can genuinely make gains.  If we have a smart infrastructure, smart generation capacity, smart homes and smart industrial and commercial premises, there is the potential to achieve significant energy cost savings, irrespective of the primary energy source.  Much of the emphasis is on that aspect at this time.  There is also the issue of integrating markets in order that the European Union as a unit can be effective in harnessing competitive advantages.<\/p><p> In regard to digital marketing, a number of directives are at various stages of implementation.  The directive on alternative dispute resolution in respect of online trading, for example, has gone through.  There is a host of directives under negotiation on issues such as e-signatures and data protection, all of which are necessary to facilitate transactions across boundaries.  There is also a monitoring aspect which allows one to look at where Ireland or any other member state stacks up in rolling out its infrastructure and in terms of its usage of the digital marketplace, the number of SMEs that have bought into it and so on.  We are somewhere in the middle which, for a small open economy, is not good enough.  Only 23% of Irish SMEs trade online, which is far too low for a country of our size.  It is one of the issues we identified last year and we have developed several pilot projects to support businesses to get online.  The local enterprise offices have been involved in that area.  In addition, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is working to design a competitive voucher scheme that will support successful applicants to develop their online strategy.<\/p><p> I am not an expert on food labelling, but Origin Green seems to be a very useful initiative which focuses on the notion of traceability from farm to fork.  It is something I have seen in action on the Senator's supermarket shelves during the years.  It is about offering assurance regarding how production is delivered all along the line, which is really the main selling tool for Irish food.  The downside of the \"made in Ireland\" approach for a small trading economy is that one is likely to lose out when competing in markets where the preference is for products made in France, the United States and so on.  The Origin Green initiative, on the other hand, is about the way in which the product is produced - grass-fed beef, for instance - and is, therefore, a much more robust tool.  The issue of including information on fat and sugar content, etc. on labels is a public health issue, as opposed to a marketing consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021800006#E00300","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392732600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials and offer them my best wishes for the forthcoming Competitiveness Council.  <\/p><p>  Senator Feargal Quinn touched on the issue of energy.  It is remarkable to note that the energy price gap is so wide that gas is three times more expensive than electricity in Europe and twice as expensive as in the United States.  The Senator referred to the increase in production in the United States, importation to Canada and so on, whereas we are largely reliant on certain somewhat unstable countries in the Middle East, notwithstanding the improved situation in Iran.  When we talk about the Internal Market in energy, what exactly is anticipated and what will the impact be?  The Minister has indicated that there is a concern about transportation from Europe to the United States.  Will he expand on this?<\/p><p>  In regard to the country-specific recommendations for the new semester, have we had initial communications on what is proposed?  In its annual growth survey the Commission has confirmed five areas for reform, one of which is growth-friendly fiscal consolidation.  What is envisaged under this heading?

Is that issue likely to feature again in discussions at European level, including at the Competitiveness Council?<\/p><p>  There was reference to the German practice in regard to apprenticeships.  Are there other models in the European Union that are similar to the German model or, on the other hand, more similar to our own in a context of high levels of participation at third level?

Where, for instance, electricity is cheapest in France or wind power is most plentiful in Ireland, it offers the benefit of the cheapest source across the network.  This reduces the stand-by capacity required, a significant factor for a small market, particularly when one is using renewables.  Where markets are integrated, there is no need to tie up so much capital in providing stand-by capacity.  One can buy at the cheapest price and thereby manage the delivery of electricity more cheaply.

This involves trying to restructure one's tax and spending in a way that is least harmful to jobs and growth.  In the context of tax structures, the OECD recommends that property taxes are the best in the context of promoting growth while income taxes are the worst.  It is a matter of the hierarchy of one's spending choices.  On the expenditure side, it would involve investment in human capital and education, and research and development would be seen as something that should be prioritised.  It would also be necessary to identify infrastructural investments that were important and that could be financed from within one's capital spend.  That is what is involved.<\/p><p> The corporate tax rate is not an issue.  Taxes are a member state competence and they would not arise in the context of country-specific recommendations.

The huge growth in third level participation here probably puts us at one end of the spectrum.  As the Deputy correctly stated, approximately half of the relevant cohort in Germany would take the apprenticeship route.  However, there is a route back, and this underlines the strength of the German system.  It is not the case that someone who takes the apprenticeship route in Germany cannot return to the academic track.  The German authorities allow for transfers back.  Austria is somewhat similar to Germany.  Spain is trying to integrate some of the features of the German system into its own.  We are trying to do likewise.  The difficulty for us in this regard is that we need to develop new apprenticeships, draft new legislation and so on.  In the short term, traineeships - which have very high placement rates - offer the sort of opportunities people require.  I would like to see further developments in this area because possibly it is closer to where our industry stands at present.  In the long term, we want to see those in industry committing to apprenticeships in order to develop the skills bases of their sectors.  In the short term, traineeships could have relevance in Ireland because they are not as time-intensive as apprenticeships, they are not as costly from an employer point of view and the placement rates attaching to them are high.  Perhaps there is an opportunity here for a two-phase strategy.<\/p><p>  On the issue raised by Deputy Lawlor, it is not so much a question of competition, because the tariffs in high-energy-use sectors are not that high.  It is much more of a relocation threat - in other words, the prospect that businesses will actually move to the US to avail of the advantage of low costs.

Reducing a tariff from 2% to 0% would be neither here nor there in terms of competition if it is possible to avail of energy prices elsewhere that are a half or one third of those that obtain here.  It is not that TTIP could trigger any change in industry location; it is, rather, the sheer difference in prices.  That is a concern in Europe and it is why there is a focus on how we might facilitate a renaissance of industry in Europe and on identifying the sources of competitive advantage we can develop around technology, skills, niche sectors and the application of key enabling technologies.

I am delighted to hear that food labelling is on the agenda for the forthcoming meeting.  I understand that sugar is the main issue in this regard, particularly with regard to the number of ways its presence can be disguised in food through labelling.  Sugar is linked to obesity, especially in children.  I do not know what is the nature of our contribution in respect of this matter.  However, if we can ensure that from a European perspective it is identified as just what it is - namely, sugar - then people will know how much of it is contained in the foods they are eating.<\/p><p>  Senator Clune referred to finance and SMEs.  There is a need to try to obtain funding in order to encourage entrepreneurs to set up operations.  I welcome the recent report from Mr. Sean O'Sullivan on this matter.  We discussed this matter during our recent visit to Brussels.  There is a need for new and innovative ways of obtaining finance.  There appears to be a challenge for all of us in this regard.  I would welcome the Minister's views on that matter.<\/p><p>  In recent times I have been talking a great deal about commercialising research.  I sent a report to the Minister on the matter and I am aware that he wants to discuss it with me.  We face a major challenge in establishing how we might commercialise all of our research.  A huge opportunity exists in this regard because Ireland is one of the countries that is best suited to facilitating collaborations between big and small industries and bringing innovation to reality as a result.  This is an issue to which we must give consideration.  As I have stated previously, Ireland is the only country in the OECD that does not facilitate research technology organisations.  Under the OECD model, money can be drawn down by organisations that are not institutions of education.  A major barrier exists in this regard and it must be addressed.<\/p><p>  I propose that we encourage the development of a mentoring system across Europe.  If such a system were established, then businesses here trying to expand their operations into Europe could do so through what are called \"closed networks\".  Mentors from all over Europe would be connected together by means of such networks.<\/p> <p>We are all in the Single Market and it would be useful if we could talk more and communicate with each other at ground level.  The technology exists to support that.<\/p><p> I welcome the discussion on apprenticeships.  This is an area we have to develop.  While apprenticeships need to be developed in many sectors, they need to be quickly developed in the service industry.  We used to be a leader in that sector for many years and then all our young people went to college and we forgot about the importance to our economy of the service industry, which is very closely linked to tourism.  I acknowledge that it is not a sector that comes directly under the Minister's remit, but this aspect should be borne in mind when are talking about European issues.  The tourism sector is one in which we could quickly develop apprenticeships.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021800008#G01000","speaker":"988","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392733800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I will take one brief supplementary from Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and a response from the Minister, and then we will conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021800009#H00200","speaker":"1023"},{"type":"speech","time":1392733800,"counter":74,"content":"<p>The issue I wish to raise does not relate exactly to the subject of this presentation.  I refer to the idea of increasing our proportion of manufacturing.  One of the major threats to manufacturing is the fact that so much money is being funnelled towards assets, whether such assets be properties in south Dublin or assets on a stock exchange elsewhere.  It is with those assets that we are competing for the location of funds.  As central banks make more funds available, unfortunately, most of those funds are bypassing manufacturing - that is, the production of goods, which creates jobs and is productive in the long run - and going into assets.

Everyone who attends the Council meeting tends to view it from his or her own perspective.  We would see the need for greater interconnection and the need for us, as an isolated energy player, to get more integrated, diversified energy sources.  The approach taken is probably different for different countries.  A new 2030 energy climate framework has just been published by the EU.  That would probably be a backdrop to the discussion.  It is probably fair to say that Ireland is still absorbing what has been set out, and I believe the European Parliament will comment on it.  There are binding targets up to 2020, one being that 20% of energy is to be produced from renewable resources.  It is now setting the targets for the next period, which include a 40% reduction in carbon emissions up to 2030 and that 27% of energy be produced from renewables.  That will be a topic of debate, but I cannot say how the debate will go.  We are still assessing that.  We are very much dependent on other countries as to how they adopt these targets.  Much of the interest in Ireland being a centre for the export of renewables is entirely dependent on what the UK might do.  The debate on this will probably not reach many conclusions.  The reports point to areas in which there is potential for efficiencies, better integration, better use of conservation methods and better examination of the transmission and distribution networks.  They point to things we could be doing and they will probably arise in the debate.<br \/>Deputy Conaghan asked if the discussion about manufacturing jars with the new trends.  It does not really, because with smarter, more intelligent mechanisation, Europe is becoming competitive again.  We have more customised production that is closer to identifying what the customer needs and meeting it exactly in smaller runs, and that is where Europe feels it is getting back into the game.  The application of ICT and smart infrastructure to the manufacturing process is where we are getting back in the game, but having the right conditions for that to emerge is crucial.  I do not think our economy is lopsided.  It is true that manufacturing has lost 20% to 25% of its employment base in the past ten or 15 years in Ireland and elsewhere generally.  We have taken a big hit in our manufacturing base and we have expanded the services sector generally.  This will be the first year that our service exports exceed our goods exports, which is hard to believe.  We are unique in Europe in that sense.  We have adapted well to the services opportunities and many of our exports are in business services.  We are not lopsided in that sense in that we are ahead of the curve.  There has been more rapid growth in trade in the sectors the Deputy mentioned and we have done well in them.  It would be foolish to forget about manufacturing.  As to how are we are fixed in terms of manufacturing, we have some strong sectors, food being one of them, which is on the verge of a very strong resurgence.  We are very well fixed in some sectors.  We continue to be very competitive in the pharmaceutical sector.  As the patent cliff has hit some products, we have successfully moved in the bio-pharmaceutical sector and we are diversifying and staying relatively ahead of the curve.  Our employment in the overall pharmaceutical sector is steady despite the convulsions that are happening within the sector.  We are pretty well placed.<br \/>Where Europe can be competitive is in niches in the value chain, as opposed to the whole process.  Companies are increasingly looking at a global supply chain.  Parts of it can be done in one country with a competitive edge, and that is the way we are seeing this develop.  There are some sectors we could not support and in which we could no longer be competitive but there are other areas of manufacturing in which we can be.  That is where we can fit in.  We published a document on manufacturing last year, the recommendations of which we will start to implement this year.  This involves getting companies to look at where they can build their competitive opportunity.<i><\/i><br \/>On the Deputy Collins's point on food labelling, I know the Italians are worried about a voluntary system where there may be multiple ways of presenting contents, which could represent an indirect barrier to competition.  It is not so much the principle of it; the concern is about barriers to trade as opposed to why there is labelling of the sugar content in the first place.  That is the issue that will be raised in this context.<br \/>The Deputy made a fair point in highlighting that all our research spending is channelled through the higher education institutions, and she also raised this issue during the debate on the Estimates.  To be fair, we require 30% funding for any of the significant budgets.  They have to be able to open up to industry, but there is no doubt that there are some exemplars of good practice.  Many people look to Germany, whose models are more diverse.  It has technology centres that have nothing to do with institutes of higher education.  We certainly need to be open to those opportunities.  We are learning in this sphere.  We are trying to make sure our spend, which is small in international terms, is effective.  We are rated as having a good bang for our buck.  We are feeling our way to make sure we spend money most effectively.  It is an area that is certainly worth examining in terms of how can we open up that possibility<br \/>Tommy Murray has told me there is an Erasmus for entrepreneurships.  That does not quite fit in with the Deputy's suggestion of a trans-European mentoring network.  That is the sort of thing that Commissioner Tajani is very keen on and he is very much pushing the idea that there ought to be European networks for trade missions.  It is something we can certainly pursue with the Commission.<br \/>The Deputy raised the issue of services.  I fully agree with her that the services sector - as was the case some years ago and as we see in other countries - is one that offers very solid employment with a career structure, but that is not the case in Ireland.<\/p> <p>There must be a way of reinventing career structures in some of these service areas. <\/p><p> Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked whether returns on manufacturing are sufficiently high to attract capital.  Capital is attracted by asset plays.  This has certainly been the case here, where some of the decline in our manufacturing and exports can be traced to the high speculative gains that were available in other plays.  I refer to areas in which people could invest money and make shorter and more speculative gains.  That is a genuine issue, which brings us back to the question of how one secures access to capital for sectors that offer a long-term and sustainable competitive edge.  I do not disagree with the Deputy in that regard.  What we are trying to do is to place new sources of capital in the marketplace through the National Pensions Reserve Fund, Enterprise Ireland and so forth.  We have yet to see the impact of these measures.  The only response we can have to this issue is to create access to capital for long-term, sustainable enterprises and enable more small companies to raise capital from capital markets.  This is currently very limited in our case.  I acknowledge that I have not given a full answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021800009#H00600","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392734400,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for their attendance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014021800010#J00200","speaker":"1023"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1392734400,"counter":80,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 2.50 p.m. until 1.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 25 February 2014.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Select Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","time":1392736200,"counter":81},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>The Select Committee met at 15:10<\/p><p>MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Deputy Richard Bruton (Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation), Deputy Se\u00e1n Kyne, Deputy Dara Calleary, Deputy Anthony Lawlor, Deputy \u00c1ine Collins, Deputy John Lyons, Deputy Michael Conaghan, Deputy Peadar T\u00f3ib\u00edn.<\/p><p>DEPUTY DAMIEN ENGLISH IN THE CHAIR.<\/p>","time":1392736200,"counter":82,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2014021800002"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"County Enterprise Boards (Dissolution) Bill 2013: Committee Stage","time":1392736200,"counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2014021800002#A00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1392736200,"counter":85,"content":"<p>The County Enterprise Board (Dissolution) Bill 2013 was referred to the Select Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation by order of the D&aacute;il on 6 February 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2014021800002#A00250","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1392736200,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Sections 1 to 5, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1392736200,"counter":87,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1392736200,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1 is in the name of Deputy Dara Calleary.

I welcome the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton and his officials.<br \/>The relationship between Enterprise Ireland and the local authorities is crucial to how the local enterprise offices, LEOs, will work.  On Second Stage I welcomed the provision of the service level agreement, which is a very detailed document and contains measurable targets.  I want to ensure that local authority funding is robust and open to scrutiny so that people will be able to see that funding levels do not change and that enterprise-related funding does not get subsumed into the overall budget when the local authority comes under pressure.  Let me give an example.  Many local authorities will be under pressure as a result of the storm damage.  I do not want a situation to arise that will allow the funding allocated to enterprise to be moved to another subhead to alleviate specific pressures.<br \/>Amendment No. 3 refers to performance targets agreed in service level agreements, SLAs.  In order for the SLAs to have real effect there needs to be consequences if Enterprise Ireland or the local authorities do not meet their targets.<\/p> <p>The Minister referred to the various schemes such as the micro-finance scheme, the credit guarantee scheme and the essential and very important work of the local enterprise offices in rolling out those schemes.  However, unless there is a consequence for not meeting the targets, the service level agreement will fall and will fail.  We want to introduce a business environment into how the service level agreement is administered.  I refer to amendment No. 4.  The level of funding from the departmental subhead to the county enterprise boards can be identified.  We know how much money the boards have available to spend on local enterprise.  I would like that money to be available to provide local enterprise offices with a separate funding line in the Department so that it can be seen how much the Department is spending on local enterprise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2014021800002#A00600","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392736200,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to have that separate line and this is confirmed in the service level agreement.  My Department will be providing the funding for enterprise support and there will be no question of it being absorbed into the other works of local authorities.  The key to the success of the local enterprise offices is, as the Deputy says, the forging of this new relationship between the staff who were in the county enterprise boards and who will continue to be deployed and the local authority staff who will be coming in.  There will be 120 staff from the county enterprise boards and also 50 staff from the local authority side.  In addition, we estimate there will be the equivalent of approximately 40 staff on the local authority side to provide access to services such as planning advice, who will not be deployed full-time to the local enterprise office.  We reckon that there will be a substantially enhanced service available to local enterprises but it will be made up of enterprise budgets coming from our Department and the provision of staff for some enterprise support services from the local authority.  That is the structure.<\/p><p>  This year's budget will be better than last year.  We are protecting that budget.  It is our view that forging a relationship between the business service units of the local authorities and the enterprise delivery functions in the existing county enterprise boards will result in a one-stop shop with a broader range of services available in a single location.  A key to its success will be to achieve a genuine buy-in to the enterprise agenda by the local authorities.  One of the strengths of the proposal is that local authorities have very significant networks and it is our ambition to harness that network.  The Deputy may know that the City and County Managers Association last year published 2,000 initiatives by different local authorities, approximately one third of which would be specific enterprise supports.  Our ambition is to encourage more of that local innovation from local authorities to support enterprise.<\/p><p>  The Deputy raised another issue which is very much on the money, so to speak, the issue of what happens if a local authority is not delivering.  The approach is not to impose an immediate penalty clause whereby the funding is slashed because that would only mean that local enterprise would suffer.  I refer to the special delivery unit in the health sector which examines individual areas that are not performing to the desired and expected level.  In the same way, the Enterprise Ireland centre of excellence will look at the reasons for any failure with the service level agreement.  The ambition will be to build it up to the expected standard.  There is the possibility for reductions or mergers whereby another local authority could take on the task if there was a complete failure on the part of the original provider but that is not envisaged because we envisage that the delivery will work.  A strong technical support unit within Enterprise Ireland will be a centre for innovative thinking and will help to develop that network to a national standard.  Like most performance-enhancing initiatives in the public service it is about supporting a higher standard of delivery, monitoring and setting standards, encouraging, recognising and rewarding success and supporting those who are not delivering while ensuring that they can enhance service delivery.  We are not planning to take the approach of immediately slashing the budgets of a county that is not performing.  Instead, we plan to work with that county in the interests of the enterprises in that area and to bring them up to the standard that we expect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2014021800003#B00200","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"speech","time":1392736200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>There needs to be a provision in the legislation.

The purpose of this provision is to encourage counties and local authorities to understand that the success of their county depends on the success of their enterprises and in particular the smaller enterprises.  Our aim is to enhance our capacity to reach enterprise by enlisting the support of what is a very significant economic player in the county.  There are long-stop powers to have the service provided by a different local authority but this is not something we would envisage.  A service level agreement of this nature will be organic.<br \/>We want Enterprise Ireland to be innovative.  For example, micro-finance is an innovation which is being delivered through the local enterprise offices.  We would like to enhance mentoring and perhaps reorganise the system of mentoring so that in cases where a county would not have access to specialists that these could be provided through the network.  The service level agreements will emerge and evolve over time but the performance metrics are an inherent part of them so they will be published.  The service level agreement will set out the metrics that are to be delivered.  The allocation of the annual budget will be revised based on demand and quality of service.  If a county is not delivering and is unable to justify the level of activity as against the budget allocation, the first issue will be to examine whether the continuing level of budget allocation is justified.  This is the conversation we envisage.<br \/>Service level agreements are at an early stage of development.  The Department has service level agreements with IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and all departmental agencies and offices and we are learning to use them.  They are a very important way of empowering a Department such as ours to have a better policy input, better monitoring and a better capacity to understand and to drive change.<\/p> <p>That is what a central policy department should be about.  We very much see these as way of the future but we could not lock such agencies into having to come back to get them approved every time modifications are made.

One of the major problems we have in this country is that we do not enforce compliance and regulation, which often leaves workers and people within the system vulnerable.  One of the reasons we have this problem is due to the lack of funding going into enforcement and the lack of processes to incentivise proper compliance with regulation.  We can do this at no cost to the State.  While I have a particular problem with the local property tax, what the Government did was logical.  If a person who puts an extension onto their house wants to apply to claim back VAT over a few years, he or she must make sure he or she is tax compliant.  Therefore, it incentivises people on a cost free basis to be compliant with local taxes.  <br \/>From speaking to subcontractors, a number of them would say that the legislation is positive.  However, there is no enforcement with regard to subcontractors.  We could incentivise compliance among subcontractors by providing that unless they are fully compliant they cannot tender for Government jobs.  We could provide for the same with regard to compliance with employment law and Labour Court judgments.

The reason we established a small business centre of excellence in Enterprise Ireland is to do just as he proposes.  We need to create within national policy institutions a drive to improve the capacity of small businesses at local level to establish and grow.  Implicit in this is that the domestic economy and export orientated sectors are equally important.  We have established a small business unit, whose role, through the transfer of functions, will include the domestic economy, not only the exporting economy.  We are transferring functions that require the small business unit to deliver in this area.  It will be up to the Department, through oversight and the delivery of services, to ensure we continue to support the non-exporting sector.<\/p><p>  There is a clear desire to have a thriving domestic economy as well as export sector.  We are bringing a wider range of business into the heart of Government policy-making on enterprise.  We will not support companies by providing grants but softer supports such as mentoring will be provided.  We continue to believe that grants are not appropriate because if one grant-aids one company in the domestic economy, one is effectively supporting one competitor against another.<\/p> <p>That rationale, which has always been behind grant giving and has been exercised by county enterprise boards as well, will remain.  The remit is clearly wider and, for example, the likes of the seed capital scheme tax relief has been broadened from exporting to include all enterprises.  Micro-finance will also be for all enterprises.  Increasingly, the types of incentives and vehicles being put into the market by the State are available to a wider range of sectors.  I take the Deputy's point but the purpose of this is to broaden the base, and Enterprise Ireland knows that.

I see the role of local authorities not as being token members of a board but rather recognising that this is something in which there should be an interest from a strategic perspective within the county.  Every councillor should be interested in the issue and report back, asking whether more can be done and driving the pace.  Perhaps I have a different view or experience of local authorities.

This means we could have a series of networks and initiatives filtering from the business community that would be taken on by the local authority and enterprise office.  Part of the role is to build that necessary entrepreneurship environment.  For example, I would see a very close connection between the LEO and the community enterprise centres, of which we have more than 100 scattered around the country.

It is a balanced package and even if I was on the opposite side of the House, I would argue in favour of this approach rather than having a token councillor on a board.  In my experience with local authorities, such membership is not anything as effective as when the council acts as a unit and takes on the view of driving initiatives across a county.  That is a better role, and local councillors should take a greater responsibility in scrutinising activities occurring in the area.

We expect LEOs to be working with local business networks and to provide opportunities for people to have an input regarding their work.  This is not to create some sort of detached ivory tower.  I do not believe a board is necessary for what we desire.  What we need is to set a standard and an expectation of how the work should be done.  It is a question of having a pro-enterprise, pro-entrepreneurship location in the county and using influence and power to create the appropriate environment.  An absolute requirement is that the LEOs would be networking regularly with their client base.  I agree that we need to have the offices plugged into local enterprise.  I do not agree that we need a board to do that as the system we have can deliver it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2014021800007#F00200","speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1392738600,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1392738600,"counter":144,"content":"<p>Section 7 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1392738600,"counter":145,"content":"<p>SECTION 8<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1392738600,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2014021800007#F00600","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1392738600,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 8:<blockquote><br \/>In page 5, line 31, to delete &ldquo;Every right&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Subject to <i>subsection (5) <\/i>of <i>section 12<\/i>, every right&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>Section 12 provides for Forf&aacute;s, Enterprise Ireland or local authorities to accept into their employment staff who were previously employed by the county enterprise board on terms and conditions no less favourable in regard to remuneration.

I am the chief executive officer and am joined by my colleagues Mr. Kevin O'Donovan, chief development officer, and Mr. Peter Harte, chief technology officer.  The company was established in 2008 and specialises in the development of onshore wind electricity generation.  It has a presence in 16 countries.  We have Irish offices in Tullamore and Cork city.  Through our Greenwire project, we propose developing 40 wind farms on 20,000 ha of land in the midlands to generate electricity for export to the United Kingdom on a new, dedicated grid connection.<\/p><p>  Public debate on topics of national importance such as this is always welcome.  It provides us with an opportunity to discuss the benefits of our proposal in a national forum and set out how the project can be a catalyst for economic recovery in the midlands.  I acknowledge the anxieties that have been expressed by many in regard to wind energy in general, and the proposal for the midlands in particular.  I am very much aware that we have an obligation to allay concerns and provide answers to many questions raised.<\/p><p>  We are moving towards a European energy market where a trans-European power network connecting countries across Europe would facilitate surplus power flowing to where electricity is needed.  It would make Ireland more self-reliant in the event of a crisis.  In Ireland, we have an abundance of wind, much more than we need ourselves.  Therefore, we have an opportunity to create a new export industry, such as our beef and dairy export businesses, creating thousands of jobs.<\/p><p>  In its document Strategy for Renewable Energy: 2012&ndash;2022, the Government has identified the exportation of renewable energy as one of five strategic goals.  With that in mind, the Irish and British Governments are hoping to deliver an intergovernmental agreement, IGA, very soon to facilitate the trading of renewable energy between the two countries.  A strategic environmental assessment and new planning guidelines are being drafted by the Irish Government.  Our project, therefore, is in line with Government policy.<\/p><p>  The Greenwire proposal is very timely in light of developments in the United Kingdom energy market.  Our British neighbours have been energy-independent since the discovery of North Sea oil and gas in the 1970s but these reserves are nearing depletion and the United Kingdom is once again facing reliance on imported energy to meet its demand.  The United Kingdom is also decommissioning its ageing nuclear and coal power stations, which currently supply 20% of its energy.  The United Kingdom has made a commitment that 30% of its electricity will be from renewable resources by 2020.  While it has three times as much onshore wind as Ireland, it will need another 12,000 MW of renewable energy capacity before 2020 to achieve this target.  This is why Britain's energy challenge should be seen as Ireland's opportunity.  However, it is important to note that the United Kingdom has other options for meeting its energy needs, including offshore wind energy, hydroelectricity, thermal energy from Iceland and nuclear energy from France. Ireland must take the opportunity or risk missing the chance to create the new export sector.<\/p><p>  The midlands possesses an enormous and largely untapped natural resource in wind energy.  Tapping that resource could have a transformative effect on the economy in the region.  Our planning laws require that for projects of such scale there must be a community contribution.  If granted planning permission for Greenwire, Element Power intends to establish a comprehensive community-benefit programme to assist the community where the wind farms are located, particularly people living closest to the turbines.  The entire local community would reap the dividends from our project, not just landowners, local authorities, businesses, tradesmen and others.<\/p><p>  The community benefit programme would be established prior to construction and would operate for the duration of the wind farms' commercial lifetime.  We have met numerous voluntary community groups, development associations, local enterprise bodies, sports clubs and societies across the five counties where the project is proposed.  These meetings have taken place as a part of a series of public information days in addition to an extensive consultation programme, which has been under way since 2012.  The feedback garnered to date has been extremely positive on many levels.  The community benefit programme would have a number of components, particularly a near-neighbour fund for those living closest to the turbines, a local community fund, an educational fund and an enterprise fund.  The near-neighbour fund would include the financing of practical energy projects for individual households.  It would be established such that those living closest to the wind farms would receive direct supports from those farms.  We propose that all families living within 1 km of a turbine benefit directly from the project.  We are engaging with the community to see how best the fund might operate.<\/p><p>  The local community fund would distribute finance annually to deserving projects within the communities where the wind farms are located.  We have met over 100 community groups over the past two years that are interested in participating in this programme.  The educational fund would help to finance educational initiatives for students in communities where wind farms are located.  The local enterprise fund would foster local enterprise and employment creation through the support of small and local businesses.<\/p>  <p>We propose a total investment of &euro;250 million into the midlands by way of community benefit for the 3 GW project.  That would have quite an impact on communities in the midlands.  This &euro;10 million per annum benefit scheme added to the &euro;50 million in rates and rent each year would see Element Power contribute a minimum total of &euro;1.5 billion to the local economy over the 25-year lifetime of Greenwire.  The payments to local authorities in Offaly, Westmeath and Laois would amount to between 40% and 50% of the entire rates incomes which those counties currently enjoy.  That represents many additional services or it could be used to create a reduction in the rates burden on hard-pressed businesses of up to 50%.<\/p><p> In terms of employment potential, the construction works required for up to 3,000 MW of wind power as well as installing an electrical network underground can create approximately 10,000 construction jobs.  The only way this project will be delivered is with locally sourced employees.  It is normal procedure in Ireland that the balance of plant is sourced locally.  The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, is already working with its members to ensure they can harness the benefits of such an enormous construction project.<\/p><p> There are more than just construction opportunities.  Personnel with a range of different skills will be sought during pre-construction and construction of the projects, such as ecologists, scientists, environmental engineers, mapping and geographic information systems, GIS, specialists, experts in acoustics, landscape architects, archaeologists and hydrologists.  Road construction companies, quarries and other building material suppliers, construction workers and so forth will be required to develop approximately 1,000 km of road networks.  Civil and structural engineers, electrical and power engineers, geotechnical experts, transport and traffic engineers, wind assessment wind analysts, monitoring and mast direction crews will also be required.  Logistics, travel, lodging and material supply will generate significant additional local revenue over the three year construction period between 2016 and 2019, meaning a spin-off for local shops, hotels, garages, construction companies, haulage firms, plant-hire operators and many other service providers.<\/p><p> Element Power is already working in the midlands to raise awareness of the need for training courses to equip local people with the requisite skills.  We are liaising with education providers to add modules to existing courses and develop conversion courses for already qualified persons.  Ireland already has a wind energy industry of almost 2,000 MW which currently employs 3,400 people, and that is without any turbine manufacturing.  We are aware of interest from major international players to develop manufacturing facilities in the midlands should Greenwire or other projects proceed, but the job of bringing them here is one which rests with IDA Ireland.<\/p><p> Ireland has the potential to be involved even more significantly in the supply chain of the wind energy industry.  Greenwire would act as the enabler for Ireland to become a key player in this sector.  However, if we are to develop an export project in the midlands and capitalise on this pioneering opportunity, we must act swiftly.  The window will not stay open indefinitely as Britain needs this renewable energy by 2020.  If we are to embrace this opportunity, the Irish and UK Governments need to finalise a detailed intergovernmental agreement quickly, which will allow the trading of renewable energy between both jurisdictions.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources must complete a strategic environmental assessment and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government must swiftly conclude the new planning guidelines for wind energy.  These are some of the key requirements from the Irish side.  We also must have strong signals and actions from the UK side, such as contracts for difference, CFDs, and a commercial strike price.<\/p><p> A project such as Greenwire cannot proceed without community support.  We have had positive engagement with hundreds of voluntary, sporting and community groups in the midlands for the last two years.  We have more than 1,000 farming families in the midlands that are anxious to see this project proceed.  The views of local communities should not be casually dismissed because their voices are not heard daily.<\/p><p> Several claims were made to this committee on 8 October last by a group from Westmeath.  Many of these claims were not based on fact and presented very clear evidence as to why much misunderstanding about the wind industry prevails.  Our investors are not in the business of backing projects which might prove injurious to local communities.<\/p><p> Greenwire is, of course, a private development.  It will not cost the Irish taxpayer one cent.  We are proposing the creation of thousands of jobs and billions of euro by way of local spend by harnessing a natural resource.  There will be no overhead lines and our infrastructure in Ireland and subsea cabling is completely independent of the Irish grid.  The cost of the electricity generated will be borne by the UK consumer.  While the clich&eacute; \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" is sometimes overused, Greenwire does represent such a prospect.  It is innovative, and it can place Ireland firmly at the forefront of the cleantech industry.  Let us seize the moment and develop this new clean export industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Cowhig","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392733500,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Cowhig.

We have made our submission to the committee and I will not read it laboriously.  I will just make some comments on the wider context.<br\/>Unless one understands the concept of climate change, the need for limiting unrestricted further penetration of fossil fuels, greenhouse gases and what they are and how they impact on global temperature and climate, it will be hard to convince any member of this committee of the benefits or otherwise of renewable energy and low-carbon energy.  The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its panel, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, have published reports clearly linking greenhouse gas emissions, global temperature increase and climate change.  Indeed, this committee, in November 2013, referenced the conclusion that a 2&deg; rise in global temperatures above pre-industrial levels was a trigger for dangerous climate change.  This thinking has impacted on the global response and how the globe is trying to manage this clear threat to the world.<br\/>Restricting the rise in global temperature to 2&deg; will require reductions of greenhouse gas emissions by 80% to 90% below 1990 levels by 2050.  This equates to approximately 450 parts per million of CO<sub>2<\/sub>equivalents.  Actually, we have gone off that trajectory.  This year, we are expected to breach the 400 parts per million for the first time.  This has a massive impact and it is being clearly demonstrated.  It has an ecological impact for wildlife and we see it already in rising sea levels.  In Ireland, for example, it has been exacerbating the flood effects of heavy rainfall.  These so-called one in 50 year weather events - Bord na M&oacute;na is familiar with this area and has very clean data dating back to the 1950s and 1960s - are now happening annually.<br\/>There has been little media or other comment regarding the devastating floods in Cork, Limerick and elsewhere pertaining to the impact of climate.  It has been very much focused on response and whether we were ready for them.  However, one person who must be listened to is the head scientist of the British Meteorology Office, Dame Julia Slingo.  She said that while none of the individual storms had been exceptional - she was talking about Britain but one could reference it to Ireland - the clustering and persistence were extremely unusual.  She said:<blockquote>We have seen exceptional weather.  We cannot say it's unprecedented, but it is certainly exceptional.  Is it consistent with what we might expect from climate change?  Of course, as yet there can be no definitive answer ... but if we look at the broader base of evidence then we see things that support the premise that climate change has been making a contribution.<\/blockquote>In response to this global threat and notwithstanding the absence of a fully agreed global deal, the EU has embarked on a path to a low-carbon future, with targets to reduce 2050 emissions by 80% to 90%.  Indeed, the recently published EU framework proposal for 2030, which is a follow-up to its 2020 framework, would see renewable energy targets of 27% above the 20% penetration and a greenhouse gas emissions reduction of 40% below 1990 levels, which is double the 2020 target.<br\/>In this global and regional environment, Ireland must recognise our outstanding renewable energy resources.  We have outstanding renewable energy resources, not just in wind but also in biomass.<\/p>  <p>However, in the face of significant challenges from its agricultural and transport sectors, Ireland has adopted a target of 42% renewable energy penetration by 2020.  This equates to approximately 0.3 kg of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour in its electricity generation.  This is a continuum of very good progress that has been made over the past ten or 15 years.  In 1990, we were producing approximately 1 kg of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour while by 2011, that had fallen to approximately 0.5 kg per kilowatt hour.<\/p><p> Consequently, given the clear policy objectives for the European region, achieving Ireland's targets regarding efficiency and low carbon will require a greater degree of interconnectivity.  This is recognised in a European policy framework and will require greater integration of all the regional electricity networks.  Moreover, rather than individual member states meeting individual targets in a much narrower mindset, there will be a requirement for greater energy co-operation.  Having spoken about the global and regional markets, from a national perspective Ireland is recognised for its effective and secure management of a relatively isolated system.  Instantaneous wind regularly meets 50% of the demand and the target is to push this even higher.  However, this will come through enhanced integration.  Ireland's wind resources have been well flagged and discussed at this and other committees.  Those wind resources and the capacity factors for turbines for wind generation in Ireland are such that further interconnection capacity will provide a broader grid system across Ireland and the United Kingdom to balance the system and optimise the penetration of intermittent renewables with fewer constraints.  In addition, it provides an opportunity to export Ireland's considerable excess renewable resources, thereby generating a new source of income, employment and strategic environmental and economic opportunity on the island of Ireland.<\/p><p> Bord na M&oacute;na is of the view that this opportunity should be explored fully.  I will not go into the details of our proposals in this regard, which are contained in the submission.  However, this is a unique leveragable strategic opportunity.  It is not tactical and is not imitable in other markets and geographies but is highly strategic not unlike Ireland's water resources of which I have spoken to this committee previously.  If we wish to capitalise on this opportunity, we must carefully site our turbines and clusters of turbines in those areas that are designated.  For instance, isolated post-industrial cutaway peatlands are ideal for this purpose.  There must be a proper and diligent planning process, because this is all about planning.  I do not believe there is a major debate about the resources but the issue centres on where these turbines should be sited.  Bord na M&oacute;na and I accept fully and endorse the need to have a proper planning process.<\/p><p> As for what are the benefits, they are massive sustainable investment on a scale that rarely if ever, has been seen before in Ireland.  In addition, they include value-added sustainable job creation in both supply chain and maintenance - my colleague from Element Power has spoken a little bit about that - and huge import substitution.  This morning, I heard the chief executive of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland point out that a relatively small amount of wind energy, namely, 2 GW, has caused import substitution of 20% on Ireland's imported fuel bill.  This equates to approximately &euro;1 billion.<\/p><p> Finally, this obviously provides the opportunity for a massive increase in export revenues.  I revert to the point that a robust planning process is critical, encompassing clear spatial planning, objectives, targets and rules that are implemented.  Wind farms, like one-off housing and ribbon development, cannot be inappropriately sited.  As some of my colleagues like to quote celebrity economists, allow me to conclude by quoting one celebrity economist from whom the joint committee may hear, as I understand a submission already has been made to this particular committee hearing.

I have more than 25 years' experience in industrial design over a wide range of industrial projects encompassing food, drink, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and power stations.  Moreover, I have spent ten years and more travelling to and from central and eastern Europe while helping to bring in the environmental legislation into the new and emerging member states.  I have nothing to sell and do not have a dream.  However, we seek one thing, and that is what Turn 180 is, namely, to turn around, go back and re-evaluate the situation, particularly within the legal framework in which we operate.<\/p><p>  We have at present a recently appointed expert panel on pylons.  Had the evaluation and assessments of that project been done three years ago in the legally required strategic environmental assessment process with the proper stages of public participation, we would not need that expert panel.  It would have been done in accordance with the law and the obligation to have public participation and information.  A strategic environmental assessment was never completed for the Irish renewable energy programme and no assessment has ever been done for it.  It was on this basis, having documented it, that the United Nations Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee in Geneva took the communication in my name against the European Union as a party to the convention.  At that stage, Ireland had not ratified the convention and consequently, I was obliged to take the matter against the European Union.  The compliance committee ruled that the European Union had broken the terms of the convention with regard to the manner in which it was implementing the national renewable energy action plans.  It failed to provide the necessary information to the public, it had failed to ensure the public participation was carried out when all options were open and effective public participation could take place and it had failed to take due account of the public participation in the final decision.  Consequently, it has been told to go back and repeat and engage with the public and to do it again.  As this is not happening at present, the compliance committee is engaged in compliance proceedings against the European Union at the forthcoming meeting of the parties' treaty convention in June 2014.  There also are ongoing proceedings in the High Court in my name against the Irish State with regard to this matter.<\/p><p>  The evidence given by the European Union to the compliance committee basically pointed out it is generally recognised that renewable energy - and wind energy in particular - is better from an environmental perspective than non-renewable sources.  The point of it being \"generally recognised\" is what this comes down to, as no assessments have been carried out at European Union or national level to quantify what actually is going on.  In fact, in its opening statement to the compliance committee in Geneva in 2011, the European Union made it clear the Irish public was not entitled to information, other than regarding what was a threat to its environment.  In particular, the public most certainly was not entitled to information on cost-effectiveness related to renewable energy.  Consequently, this matter led to a further communication, on which I assisted, with our near neighbours, the United Kingdom, which also ruled that its national renewable energy action plan had breached the terms of the convention, had not been assessed properly and had not gone through the stages of public participation with the public.  Both countries in which this renewable export programme is being furthered have serious legal failings with regard to information and the public participation process.<\/p><p>  As an experienced engineer who has worked on power generation projects and who has seen things work or not work, one keeps saying to oneself that when it comes to providing a reliable economic electricity system such as we have had for generations, all this talk about outstanding natural resources of wind energy is, I am afraid, bunk.  It will not work.  Experienced engineers are making this point all over the world.  Even my own mother, who has no education beyond secondary school and is in her 80s, can figure this out.  How is one expected to cook a turkey for Christmas when one is waiting around for the wind to blow in order to have electricity in the oven?  That is the bottom line.  Consequently, I refer to recent statements to the effect that the Irish renewable energy programme is a no-brainer and that Ireland will save huge amounts in respect of fossil fuels.<\/p>  <p>Let me put it to the committee this way.  I do not dispute that &euro;6 billion worth of fossil fuels are imported into this country each year, but less than 20% of that goes on electricity generation.  By the time we have invested all that money, which when one clocks it up is rapidly approaching &euro;20 billion, we would be lucky given the massive inefficiencies in our power stations to save &euro;200 million a year.  That is a one in 100 year payback.  A conventional power station will last 35 years but a wind turbine would be lucky to last half of that.<\/p><p> To return to the unfortunate and recurring theme of lack of accurate information, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland published a report that said there was &euro;300 million of fossil fuel savings.  Again and again in its reports it ignores the massive inefficiencies which are occurring in our power generation plants as they opt, like cars stuck in traffic, to try to compensate for the inefficient generation coming on and off the grid instead of running nice and smoothly on the motorways.  We have a serious problem with transparency of information.  We have no basis for the information.  I do not refer to press releases but there is nothing from the scientists and technical people in terms of what is supporting such claims.  That is why we must take a 180&deg; turn and go back, develop the information and get it right.  There is no panic or rush.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Swords","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392734700,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses from the various sectors to the meeting.

That process involved looking at areas that are environmentally designated and carrying out a detailed analysis to identify regions that could be suitable for development.  As part of that one has to meet landowners and see if they are interested in considering wind development projects.  Agreements would be made with landlords to investigate the development of wind farms on their lands.  We have option agreements in place with private landowners and with Coillte as well.  Coillte lands have been used quite a lot for wind development already in other parts of the country.  We are at the stage now of assessing those lands where we have agreements with the landowners to determine if the sites are suitable.<\/p><p>  In terms of the local community dividend and community groups supporting the project, we have an office set up in Tullamore with a team which specialises in going out and meeting local community groups.  We have published thousands of newsletters.  We have a website and a lo-call phone number.  The idea is to get feedback from the community in terms of reaction to the project.  A range of reactions have been received to date.  We found engaging directly with community groups to be very successful.  We try to explain what is involved in the project, the stage it is at and at the fact that there is still a long process prior to the development of the project.

Around 20 of those will be located throughout the midlands.  From those 20 substations higher voltage cables - again underground - on public roads and on private lands, will gather the power to converter stations.

This is a finite resource and progressively over time less of the land will be related to peat production activities.  As an entity licensed by the EPA under the integrated pollution prevention control licensing regime we have an obligation to stabilise the peatlands when we finish the production process.  A team of ecologists is engaged in restoration and rehabilitation work designed to achieve stabilisation of the peatlands.  We have a number of examples of projects where we have successfully rehabilitated and restored peatlands throughout the country, particularly in north-west Mayo and the midlands.  This was recognised recently when the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht published the national peatlands strategy and the review of special areas of conservation, SAC, and natural heritage areas, NHAs.  The review mentioned some Bord na M&oacute;na peatlands would be designated as SACs and NHAs, which recognises the work done by Bord na M&oacute;na in restoring and rehabilitating peatlands.<\/p><p>  One of the great advantages of use of these peatlands for wind farms is, as we mentioned in our statement, it is possible to co-locate rehabilitated and restored peatlands and tourism amenities and activities on lands which are also used for wind farms.  This is one of the great attractions of the wind farm project.  By and large, it is true to state the range of uses for these peatlands after they have finished cutaway is relatively limited.  In a large number of cases they will revert to natural amenities for the communities located in the areas.  It is possible to place projects such as wind farms on these lands, which will help create economic as well as tourism amenity projects in localities throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1392735300,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Turn 180 clearly stated it is not selling anything.

Many technical people do not support the position we are in now.  A one in 50 year flood will occur once every 50 years; one must just wait around.<\/p><p>  The renewable programme was first initiated 16 years ago by the European Union.  No real assessment was done for it.  Under the 2001 directive the European Union was required to conduct an assessment by 2005 of the external impact of non-renewable sources.  External impacts are the environmental damage costs associated with non-renewable sources.  The report was to be repeated every five years.  I looked for it but it was never done.  It then launched into a massive 20% renewable programme.  At no stage was it worked out what was to be built, where it was to be built, what was the impact and what was the cost.  People were not allowed to participate in the decision, which was taken at higher levels.  With regard to climate change, a figure of &euro;25 per tonne was pulled out of the sky because it did not know what carbon dioxide was doing.  It also had a computer model in the National Technical University of Athens which stated we would save X tonnes of carbon dioxide.  Nobody has been able to access this programme.  It is the confidential property of the university.  It is clear from reading some of the side notes to it that it completely fails to take account of the massive inefficiencies we carry on the grid in existing thermal power plants as more and more renewables are put on.<\/p><p>  The 20% target was shared among the member states based on their existing renewable capacity and a factor based on gross domestic product.  The European Union did not know what was to be built in Ireland, what good it was to do, and when we would achieve the 16% target.  All of the member states had to implement in a rush a national renewable energy action plan.  Such plans should have been subject to strategic environmental assessment but this was bypassed.  Section 5.3 of the template for these plans asked for the expected greenhouse gas reductions, the expected costs and the expected to job creation.  The Irish national renewable energy action plan goes from section 5.2 to section 5.4.  The table was never filled out.  It was not filled out in 19 member states.  Other countries such as the UK fudged it.  The UK referred to another document which did not assess it either.

Kilpaddoge Energy has applied to Kerry County Council to install 52 diesel generators in a plant in Kilpaddoge, County Kerry.  On its website it clearly states that the purpose of this plant is to back up wind energy.  We used to have a peat burner in Lumcloon, Ferbane, in west County Offaly.  That will become a gas burner and the website of Lumcloon Energy states that the purpose of that gas burner will be to back up wind energy.  Wind energy is adding more fossil fuel generation to the grid, not subtracting it, because it is not capable of displacement.  Displacement means when one adds 1,000 MW of wind generation one takes 1,000 MW of fossil fuel off.  It is not doing that.  It is doing the opposite.  It is adding, because of intermittency.  On a calm day in this country we produce 95% of our electricity from fossil fuels.  I will give Deputy Coffey a hint, and I hope he can read between the lines.

Wind can be part of the mix.  As Deputy Coffey said, this source of generation can only be included through a suite of measures including wave, biomass and wind.<\/p><p>  Mr. Caulfield mentioned areas such as Tarbert and Lumcloon, which are on the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER's to-do list regarding the provision of energy into the renewable and electricity markets.  I am very disappointed at CER's progress on that.  Companies such as Lumcloon, which has a connection to the grid, a licence and planning permission, can contribute to the energy sector and be a backup to the existing wind energy provisions without anything coming on stream into the future.<\/p><p>  The big issue is that there is massive new technology and larger wind turbines are being contracted at a lower elevations than was previously the case.  Everybody seems to agree that the guidelines are outdated.  Even the proposed guidelines in draft form could be construed to be outdated based on the number of submissions being made.  The other guidelines from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the EPA's guidelines on noise and best practice, published in 2013, have no statutory power.  We must address that issue.  Some statutory power must be given.<\/p><p>  Mr. D'Arcy and I know that Bord na M&oacute;na, in its history, was one of the main drivers of the midlands economy, particularly in my county of Offaly.  It had to evolve and meet changing demands, alter work practices, diversify and seek new revenue streams.  It did that by consultation through communities and with its work force and by negotiation.  No amount of imposition from the top down achieves the sort of results we all desire.  It will be the same in this instance, in realising the potential that may exist, but only if there is proper consultation.  Mr. D'Arcy mentioned that there must be a proper planning process.  That is an indication that the existing planning process is not proper and does not meet with the satisfaction of those who will be affected most and who may benefit most from what is proposed by all and sundry.<\/p><p>  There is talk of the benefits of value-added jobs but the numbers cannot be quantified now.  Both governments have entered into a memorandum of understanding about the export of electricity from this source.  The Element Power representatives said they were anxious that an intergovernmental agreement would supersede and take the place of the memorandum of understanding.  If one does not have proper planning processes in place, and one acknowledges that, one cannot expect the memorandum of understanding to be replaced now with an intergovernmental agreement.  Most of the cutaway bogs are almost entirely cut away.  The day of the public service obligation, PSO, is coming to an end.  We can see that with the proposed sale of power plants in Shannonbridge and Lough Ree.  There is a role, as there has been, for energy production in our region into the future.  The cutaway bogs are the prime location where that should begin.  We will see how it progresses thereafter.<\/p><p>  The new proper planning guidelines must be put in place.  I hear the benefits that can accrue to localities, communities and local authorities.  They would be great and most welcome and they would address many of the concerns and issues that many candidates will have when they put themselves before the electorate for the local authority election in May.  This would make their job much easier when one considers the lack of funding available to them from the sources to which they have become accustomed in the past.  It is simple to say that nuclear power would bring much economic benefit too.  That is not to say it would meet with the approval of the localities where it would be sited.<\/p><p>  We must ask some real and honest questions and I would like to hear the opinions of those before us today in answering those questions honestly.  They might take stock of where they are regarding the consultations that are taking place with landowners in areas of counties that are not designated within county development plans, within counties which have had the foresight in the past to acknowledge the potential that exists in this area and consult with their localities, communities and county with a view to arriving at a consensus whereby areas might be designated for consideration where the experts with the planning expertise who are to protect society and communities thereafter would be charged with the responsibility for adjudicating on any such applications.<\/p>  <p>Do the witnesses agree that the existing guidelines are outdated as they stand?  For example, in my county, Offaly, we devised a strategy in 2009 supported by areas of designation for consideration.  At that time I never envisaged the advancement in size and technology of these fixtures that are in place.  That never resonated with me when we put that in place at the time.  As part of the process, should there be an independent economic review of wind energy seeking an input which might give us an indication of the impact on energy prices and the long-term sustainability of supply to the national grid?<\/p><p> Do the witnesses agree that all counties should have wind energy strategies within their remit as part of their county development plans?  Do they believe and acknowledge that those development plans and the process in which they engage to arrive at a consensus should be given more weight when applications are made for large strategic developments to An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  That consultative process is at its best in the localities where these proposals are being made.  I have seen that at first hand, and the witnesses have all had representatives at various meetings throughout the counties of which we speak - Offaly, Laois, Westmeath, etc.  Do they believe existing guidelines on setbacks are outdated?

Lest there be any view to the contrary, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has shown its process to be reasonably robust regarding planning applications pertaining to wind farms.  Very recently, some of the largest proposed developments in the midlands, of which Deputy Cowen would be aware, have been refused planning permission for exactly the reasons about which he expressed concerns, such as setback distances and impacts.  Deputy Cowen asked whether the guidelines needed to be updated.  First, they are being updated through the strategic environmental assessment, SEA, process.  I take the Deputy's point that perhaps this should have happened some time back rather than waiting for a project of this scale to trip the process of review.  However, it makes sense that processes and guidelines need to be updated, if for no other reason than the fact that technology is moving on in leaps and bounds.<\/p><p>  Somebody made a comment about the longevity of wind farms.  Bord na M&oacute;na was the first company to build, own and operate a commercial wind farm.  It had a total capacity of 7.5 MW with hub heights of 30 m and outputs of 330 kW.  That wind farm was built in the early 1990s in the north west of Ireland and is still operating today.  Technology has moved on.  We are in the process of building a wind farm where the hub height is 100 m and the rated output is 3 MW.  Guidelines need to move alongside technology.  Regarding social acceptance and community benefits, Bord na M&oacute;na is very much a community-based organisation, particularly in the midlands.  It draws most of its support and employees from the midlands.  Some communities in the midlands did not exist before Bord na M&oacute;na.  County development plans need to be aligned with regional and national development plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800009#H00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel D'Arcy"},{"type":"speech","time":1392736500,"counter":199,"content":"<p>It is <i>vice versa<\/i>, to be fair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800009#H00900","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392736500,"counter":200,"content":"<p>There needs to be alignment.

It is necessary to revise guidelines for anything as time moves on.  The interesting thing here is that we are currently erecting 28 3 MW turbines on cutaway peat land in County Offaly.  That project was brought through the planning process in 2010.  We conducted a very significant public consultation exercise as part of that.  We got tremendous support from the local community.  Of course the community had questions.  These were the first large-scale wind projects to be developed in the midlands.  The communities had questions and probed us in that regard.  However, those wind farms received planning permission under the current guidelines.<\/p><p>  The key issue communities want to understand is that noise will not emanate from them that will disturb their sleep or keep them awake at night.  Setback distances sometimes get confused with the need to comply with very strict low night-time levels of noise.  In this instance the noise limits with which that wind farm is required to comply are a couple of decibels lower than the noise limits with which the peat-fired power station just down the road must comply.  There is a lack of consistency here.  That peat-fired power station has been operating in the locality for 14 years.  We have had a very small number of noise complaints operating at 43 decibels and 45 decibels at night.  We do not believe operating a wind farm at roughly 43 decibels will cause any problem for local communities in terms of noise.  In order to comply with those noise limits, the minimum setback distance on the project had to be in excess of 650 m.  There are minimum setback distances and the reality is that in order to comply with the noise restrictions it will be necessary to set back these turbines considerably further from housing.<\/p><p>  Mr. D'Arcy said we are also constructing a farm that straddles three counties in the south, Laois, Kilkenny and Tipperary.  We had to submit three separate planning applications to the local authorities because at the time the planning guidelines were such that the planning application for that size of farm was submitted directly to the local authority.  We had three different interpretations of elements of the guidelines.<\/p><p>  Referring to Mr. Cowhig's point, there is no doubt that the review and tightening up of guidelines is always welcome.  In developing any of these activities Bord na M&oacute;na will not be - nor ever has been - in the business of disturbing or trampling on local communities.  We want to work with local communities and we will only propose to locate wind turbines - in this project or in any project we develop across our land holdings - where it is deemed appropriate to do so.<\/p><p>  I believe it is entirely appropriate for the local authorities to designate areas for wind energy.  That assessment can be looked at, and local authorities and communities can decide where it might be deemed appropriate to locate these, which would help everybody.<\/p><p>  Deputy Cowen asked about having an independent economic review of wind energy.  In a way it is a pity this does not happen because some of the facts relating to the economics of wind energy are clear to see.  For example, in the wholesale electricity market today, the average wholesale price of electricity coming from the mix of fuels we have, gas, peat, coal and renewables, last year was &euro;90 per MWh - &euro;90 per unit of production.  Today, the new wind farms under the REFIT support scheme are receiving &euro;70 per MWh.  In our view the economics of wind energy are clear to be seen.  If somebody wanted to conduct an independent analysis, it might put to bed the debate on pricing.<\/p><p>  On CO2 emissions reductions, in 2006 the electricity sector was responsible for the production of 15 million tonnes of CO2 emissions to meet a demand of 27 TWh.  Unfortunately, owing to the economic recession in 2012, demand fell back to the 2006 levels.  The provisional figures for CO2 emissions recently published by the EPA indicate that emissions in the electricity sector fell to 12.1 million tonnes.  Wind energy has had a major contribution to make to the abatement of significant CO2 emissions in a cost-effective manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800010#J00250","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Reilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392737100,"counter":203,"content":"<p>As regards our planning system here, in the UN proceedings at Geneva the written documentation from the European Union pointed out a number of issues in Ireland.  In particular as regards planning of all medium and large-scale projects such as wind turbines and electricity generation systems, the environmental impact assessment directive dates back to 1985.  It is also part of Article 6, the main component of the Aarhus Convention on citizens' procedural rights.  The EU pointed out that it knew of no other member state that had been involved in so many compliance issues and actions at the European Court over failures to comply with one single directive as Ireland had with that directive.  That is not a good endorsement.<\/p><p>  It also pointed out our failure to transpose properly the strategic environmental assessment directive.  That failure led to EirGrid bypassing the necessary Grid25 SEA and did not engage in proper public participation process.  It only received 22 submissions, of which only three, including one from me, could be identified as having come from the public.<\/p><p>  There is a massive problem with regard to access to justice.  Dissent protects democracy.  Ireland has had major problems with groupthink which led to our economic collapse.  It is right that people should have the right to challenge when they see substantive and procedural breaches.  That is part of the convention and part of people's human rights.  However, we do not have arrangements for proper access to the courts that is not prohibitively expensive.  Last week, the UK, where the cost of access to courts is lower, was ruled to be in breach of the European directive and the convention with regard to being not prohibitively expensive.  Its legal system did not comply.  The Irish Academy of Engineering has pointed out that the regulatory system in Ireland is dysfunctional and unfit for purpose.  It leads to enormous frustrations for developers and citizens.<\/p><p>  As with any development, with wind farms the purpose of environmental impact assessment is to weigh it up and identify the negative effects, which are considerable, and the positives.  There is only one positive - an alleged environmental benefit.  When that is summed up, all An Bord Plean&aacute;la can do, because it is the obligation of it or the local authority, is to make pub talk statements such as \"makes a valuable contribution to climate change\".  It has no figures or data.<\/p><p>  The national renewable energy action plan proposed to develop 7,145 MW of wind energy.  How will we fit that in with a distributed rural population and ensure they will be protected?  We never carried out a strategic environmental assessment before we adopted it to work out the impact on human beings and develop the necessary mitigation measures as required by law.  We put the cart before the horse.<\/p><p>  Pillar 1 of the convention is about access to information, not just press releases.  People want more detailed information and are entitled to it.  When we seek that information from public authorities we are denied it.  When we appeal to the Commissioner for Environmental Information and pay &euro;150, we are told it takes one and a half to two years if it gets addressed at all.  Bord na M&oacute;na refused to comply with a request in January 2012.  It finally went to appeal, which it lost in September 2013.  It is required by law to comply within three weeks and is still refusing to provide access to information when citizens submit AIE requests.  Citizens cannot access information to which they are entitled, such as the cost-benefit analysis for this programme.<\/p>  <p>The swoosh that comes with wind turbine noise is highly different from standard plant noise.

The communities of Taylor's Cross and Garbally were not informed by Element Power that it planned to build a wind farm there; they were told by me.  After seeing the map I telephoned a few people in the area and then decided I had better tell all of them.  I made out an information sheet and headed into the area, which is quiet and rural.  I went door to door and braved a vicious dog or two.  Most of the people in the area had never heard of the export project.<br\/>I also take issue with the Government.  In January I noticed the agreed memorandum of understanding signed by the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, but many people in the population had not noticed it.  Many people do not read newspapers or press statements issued from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  When I told the people of Garbally that they were to get a wind farm, most of them knew very little about it.  That is how the communities of Garbally and Taylor's Cross learned about the wind farm.<br\/>When Offaly County Council drew up a good wind strategy document in 2009, it designated certain areas as suitable for wind farms.  I have problems with why it decided this.  It stated the areas south and east of Kilcormac were not suitable for wind energy project development, having regard to the higher density of housing, the proximity to areas of high amenity and the likely effect on views to and from such areas.  Element Power has since moved into the Kilcormac area and signed options with farmers there.  The Kilcormac community, like the community in Garbally and Taylor's Cross, now finds itself facing an application for a wind farm in the area.  Like many communities in the midlands, we are in a David versus Goliath situation.  We must fundraise to hire planners and consultants to face the huge financial resources of Element Power and Mainstream Renewable Power.  It is very unfair and one-sided and people are under great stress.  There is not much money in the county.  We have set up a committee in the Banagher-Garbally area, some members of which are going door to door to try to get people to contribute to a fund to protect us.<br\/>I wish to quote a short statement from one of the residents of Garbally, an English man, Mr. David Bacon, who happens to be married to a local lady.  He states he represents the Banagher and Garbally wind information group and outlines its experience of renewable energy project development in the area.  He states that if it were not for the efforts of an interested and well informed friend - <i>c'est moi<\/i>- he would doubtless be as ignorant now of Element Power and its plans for Garbally as he was in October 2013.  He states he had a vague notion of wind energy project development in the midlands and did not know any specific information.  He also states he was not alone in this, as not one resident to whom he subsequently spoke knew about Element Power or the 185 m turbines.<br\/>A Garbally resident has drawn up a poster which tries to convey the enormity of the turbines.  I have spoken to many women friends in Birr Golf Club about wind farms in the midlands and most of them write me off as a little batty at this stage.  Outside Birr there is a wind farm at Knockshegowna, but the turbines there are a mere 18 m high.  The turbines planned for Garbally and Taylor's Cross are 185 m high.  The planner Auriol Considine stated the Cloghan wind farm was a significant industrial installation in a quiet rural area.  I was very involved in the appeal against that wind farm.  I went to the extent I did because I am a proud BIFFO - a bright intelligent female from Offaly.  I did not want to see a wind farm anywhere in west Offaly while I was there.  I went to the extent of hiring an excellent planner, Mr. Peter Crossan, to make an observation on the wind farm in Cloghan.  Last year I knew nothing about the planning process and did not send in an objection because I thought as I lived three miles away in Banagher, I would not be eligible to do so.  Then I discovered I could send in an observation.  Mr. Crossan made an excellent observation for me which I believed helped considerably in making our appeal against the Cloghan wind farm successful.

I am heartened in some ways and disappointed in others by the efforts invested in promoting bio-energy, which most of us accept is the most sustainable way of creating energy.  It is done through the use of organic crops, rural-based initiatives and a never-ending crop cycle.  Despite this, we only meet 1% of our energy needs through bio-energy production.  The Government must give direction in terms of policies and subsidies.<\/p><p>  Today I heard the CEO of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, speak about the savings derived from sustainable energy production.  A figure of &euro;1 billion was mentioned.  When I had the opportunity to analyse the document which was, strangely enough, only produced today when the groups were attending, the reality is that, if every conceivable puff of wind was captured in the grid, the savings would amount to &euro;1 billion.  As everyone present knows, however, when the wind blows too strongly, turbines must be turned off.  The figure of &euro;1 billion, therefore, is mythical.<\/p><p>  This feeds into my concern about some of the figures thrown out by others at this meeting when addressing the genuine questions ordinary people like Ms Doolan, others and I want answered.  I support all alternative energy ideas, but I do not buy into the myth that, as laid out today by the SEAI, we are saving money through wind energy generation.  In reality, the cost of energy in Ireland has increased by more than 100% in the past decade.  This is the third most expensive country in Europe.  At the peak of our requirements in January 2010 when we needed 5,000 MW, only 40 MW could be provided by way of wind energy generation.  This figure debunks everything we have been told today.  Wind energy production is not the solution to our problem.  We have been told that it will reduce the cost of energy to the user.  In Germany, probably Europe's most progressive country, it cost each user an extra &euro;300 last year to buy into the concept of wind energy generation.  It will cost the German state &euro;23 billion in 2014.<\/p><p>  Bord na M&oacute;na is proposing to install between 300 and 350 turbines in the Bog of Allen, each of which will be 190 m tall.  It referred in great detail to its concern about communities.  These turbines will be seen from at least 10 km away, never mind the noise generated.  The turbines that produce noise of 45 decibels are only 60 m tall.  What is Bord na M&oacute;na's proposal for the setback from people's houses?  How many turbines does Bord na M&oacute;na intend to install in County Mayo?  The carbon benefit of wind energy was mentioned, but for each of these pylons we need the equivalent amount of concrete poured for 150 houses.  The improvement in the carbon footprint will be done away with in installing such tall turbines.<\/p><p>  Peak demand is 5,000 MW.  If we are to go ahead with everything that is in the pipeline, we will have between 2,000 MW and 3,500 MW of wind energy per annum.  As we have already hit our target of 40%, what will we do with the energy we do not need?  Exporting to the United Kingdom is a dated concept.

Will Mr. D'Arcy clarify that point?<\/p><p>  When it was put to Mr. Brian Motherway, CEO of the SEAI, today that between 25 MW and 28 MW would be generated from wind energy, he replied that we would never reach that target and that most of the projects would not go ahead.  Bord na M&oacute;na is a semi-State company that uses taxpayers' money.  Is it investing that money in projects that will never go ahead?<\/p><p>  When Mr. D'Arcy's organisation made a presentation to us across the road in Buswell's Hotel a number of months ago, it told us that one of the reasons its project was sustainable, as opposed to those of its now strategic partner, Element Power, and Mainstream Renewable Power was that Bord na M&oacute;na did not need to lease land, worry about property devaluation, etc. because it had the Bog of Allen on which to install turbines.  Now that it is linking with the other organisations, how will the taxpayer be satisfied that Bord na M&oacute;na's strategy has changed and how can it square the clear statement from the other companies in the field that they do not intend to run these projects in the long term but to flip and sell them?  The companies' main investors are not from this country and have no community interest in sustainability which Bord na M&oacute;na claims it has.  How can it propose this concept which will increase the cost of electricity and affect our economic well being and use taxpayers' money to do so?<\/p><p>  Mr. Cowhig stated he would underground his network.  Will he confirm that none of the Grid25 build which will cost the taxpayer &euro;2.3 billion will carry any of Element Power's electricity?  This is important from the taxpayer's point of view.<\/p><p>  Can the idea of guaranteed prices be squared with the fact that American energy policy has been changed completely?  America has moved towards fracking.<\/p>  <p>The inconceivable has happened.  The Americans are now exporting coal to Poland.  Apparently it is cheaper for them to do that than use the coal themselves.  We are being asked to believe that the guarantee of price will continue into the next 50 years.

Senator Landy also made reference to our having already hit our 40% target, which I did not fully understand.  We have not hit our 40% target.  The latest indication is that we hit the 20% target for renewable electricity in 2012.  We still have a way to go to hit the domestic targets.  Beyond that, there are sufficient projects in the pipeline between various players, including private developers and some of the commercial semi-state companies, to achieve that.  I do not think anybody expects all of those projects to go ahead.  There are various elements of projects that need to be assigned grid connections and, crucially, planning permission.  Bord na M&oacute;na tries to ensure that it invests in the development of projects that have the best possibility of seeing the light of day.  Thankfully, it has not failed yet.  I cannot say, however, that we would never fail from a planning perspective.<\/p><p>  In regard to the EU abandoning its targets beyond 2030, that is not the case.  The recent EU announcement indicates that the European Union will move from a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 to a proposed 40% reduction by 2030 and from a proposed 20% renewable energy target to a 27% target, which would not, as current targets are, be binding at member state level but at a European level.

There was a failure under the public participation conducted on this in 2012 to provide any information other than the names of the projects.  We requested the information from the Commission's Director-General for Energy, Mr. Philip Lowe, and the secretary general of the European Commission, Ms Catherine Day, and then took the matter to the Ombudsman, following which copies of the project questionnaires were released to us.<\/p>  <p>There is much concern about Grid Link, which is the massive pylon project running from Cork through Waterford and up the Wexford coast in some of the most beautiful areas of Ireland.  These are obvious concerns.  When we consider the information on the project questionnaire for Grid Link, it is clear it is part of an overall process to connect to France and Great Britain, and that is why it is put in the project as a common interest.  It is admitted that if &euro;500 million is spent on building Grid Link, it would reduce generation costs in Ireland by &euro;11 million per annum because of more efficient power station operation.  In other words the money is spent to reduce costs by &euro;11 million per annum.  If interconnection is facilitated to Great Britain or France, the saving could go to &euro;40 million or &euro;110 million, but an interconnector to the United Kingdom would cost an extra &euro;700 million or &euro;800 million, and one to France would cost even more.  We would then be at a figure of approximately &euro;1.5 billion.<\/p><p> It is stated that the investment is planned primarily to facilitate the integration of 1,283 MW of wind generation in the south of the country.  That is what Grid Link is about.  However, they also point out that the connection of such capacity can only be facilitated if further interconnection is installed to provide access for this generation to the British and continental European markets.  We know already that the grid is operating in an unstable manner and we are dumping wind but Grid Link is connected to the building of interconnectors.  If interconnectors are not built, there is no reason for Grid Link other than to save &euro;11 million per annum from inefficient power station operation.

I come from County Laois, in the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly, and many wind turbines are planned for the area, and some have already been erected.  It is a major issue.  There is an underlying concern because for a number of years we went mad building houses and apartments, and we were going to generate wealth selling property to each other at inflated prices.  We know how that ended.  There is a concern, touched on today, about energy on a global scale, particularly energy trends.  I am a passionate supporter of renewable energy but there are some alarm bells in my head when it comes to the wind energy sector.<\/p><p>  I will direct my questions first to the Element Power representatives.  Are we throwing all our eggs in one basket?  It seems to be a questionable means of generating power as it is intermittent and must be backed up by gas or fossil fuel when there is no wind.  We twice had a big freeze in the winter period two and three years ago but there was very little wind at a time when we depended much on electrical power.<\/p><p>  There has been much discussion of how we are meeting our renewable energy targets and reducing greenhouse gases.  This committee has put in much work on a related report, and nobody wants to see the goals realised more than I do.  People in the midlands believe nothing is being achieved to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with the wind turbines because the cable is to be run to an interconnector and we are to help the Brits meet their goals.  This will not help us meet our targets but England and Wales in particular will be helped in meeting theirs.  Will the Element Power representatives address that?<\/p><p>  The structure height is to be 185 m and I do not have a problem with modest wind farms properly located as part of meeting our renewable energy targets.  The size of what is proposed is absolutely enormous on a flat landscape and the project will be seen from Portarlington to Mount Bolus.  The structures will be huge.  What does Element Power consider to be a reasonable set-back distance?  My questions relate to whether we are putting all our eggs in one basket and if we are making the same mistakes as we did with the property boom.  There is also the question of how this will help us meet our renewable energy needs and what is a reasonable set-back distance.  If Mr. Cowhig lived in a rural area, how close would he allow a 185 m high turbine to be?<\/p><p>  I travelled a road the other night which I had not used for four or five months.  It was dark and because it is a rural area, there is only so much that can be seen.  The road is smashed into bits and there are large potholes in it.  I contacted the neighbouring council and our council about the damage done to the road.  When I arrived at the destination the person I met raised the subject and pleaded with me to do what I could.  There have been hundreds of lorries carrying concrete trundling along the road for a number of months.  I had not been on it for three months but I could see that it was smashed to bits.  The representatives of Element Power have spoken about community gain but in the area to which I refer the road network has been completely smashed to pieces.  Would Element Power support the idea of a substantial bond being lodged with local authorities, if it could be retrievable rather than an insurance bond that is too hard to reach?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800014#N00500","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392739500,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I will take the last question first.  There is an obligation on all developers to ensure that when they have a project, it is developed responsibly.  They are not allowed to start development until there is a compliance document with the local authority.  Any reinstatement required is agreed in advance.<\/p><p>  With regard to the turbines being 185 m high, it is important for people to understand that we have not yet decided what size turbine to use.  This is part of the process that must be gone through to see what kind of technology can be used after going through the various steps identifying location.  We do not yet know what size or kind of turbine can be put in place, although we believe the most efficient will be one at 185 m high.  That does not necessarily need to be the turbine height after going through consultation.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked if there will be another property-type bubble with wind turbines.  Wind energy and the development of energy in general is very different from commercial development, where building is done one spec and selling occurs afterwards.  Projects like this export programme will not proceed until all the necessary binding contracts are put in place, and one of the most important elements is a long-term off-take agreement.  One should not end up in a position like we did with the housing boom.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked if we are reducing our own emissions.  This is an export opportunity open to us as a country.  We believe we can meet our own 2020 targets and our UK neighbour has an energy shortage and needs to achieve its own targets.  If we are rewarded as a country - and not just us as a company - it would make sense for us.

Any power system, like Ireland's 15 years ago, requires a great deal of backup plant to make up for the fact that sometimes some plant is unavailable, and, more importantly, for the fact that there is a variation in demand between the peak in the winter, typically in December, and the lowest demand in the summer.  The numbers in Ireland at present suggest there is a peak demand on the island of approximately 6,000 MW and we have 10,000 MW of generation installed to meet that.  Ten years ago, the plant would have cycled day and night with fluctuations in load.  More recently, it is cycling up and down with wind.  Crucially, however, not one new megawatt has had to be built because of the new megawatts of wind.  Over the last ten years we have built over 2,000 MW of new wind and not one new megawatt of conventional generation was required to back those up, simply because they were already there for the purpose of backing up what was previously a day-night fluctuation.  I believe that is quite safe.<\/p><p>  On the question of putting one's eggs in one basket, if Ireland were not to pursue a wind energy strategy, it would certainly be putting its eggs into one energy policy basket, namely, imported gas.  Without wind energy, Ireland was heading to 80% to 90% dependency on gas.  Energy policy in Ireland suggests we will go to 40% wind, and that will remove some of the dependency on imported gas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800015#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Harte"},{"type":"speech","time":1392740100,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I have a few questions for the representatives of Bord na M&oacute;na.

The land rights for the plant and wind farms are being bought up completely off-pitch or off-stage.  With regard to the guidelines, would they support proper statutory regulations regarding the siting of wind farms?  Communities feel the guidelines are a little elastic and that they can be pulled north, south, east or west or be made as long or short as one wishes.  There is a feeling that the new guidelines might not be much better than the old ones.  There are planning regulations for most other things so how would Bord na M&oacute;na feel about reasonable regulations in terms of its developments locally?<\/p><p>  The other question is about the entire alternative energy sector, where there is use of biomass, peat and wind.  We only have a short time so perhaps the representatives would give brief answers.  How much time or focus is given to looking at geothermal, anaerobic digestion and hydro options?  Bord na M&oacute;na might not have many opportunities on site for hydro, but people involved in Spirit of Ireland, in many publications over a number of years, spoke about the potential of hydro.  We have two huge examples of hydro, one in Wicklow and one on the Shannon.  How much investigation has there been of hydro?  I am a little concerned about this reliance on wind alone.<\/p><p>  With regard to height, there is a maximum height beyond what is reasonable.  As some speakers have said today, planning is about a balance and what is reasonable.  Some buildings that were proposed for this city did not get permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la or the city council because it was believed they would be outrageously high.  It is the same in rural areas.  The turbines are 185 m in height, which is almost 600 feet.  We have never seen anything like that and it will change the Irish landscape forever, particularly in the midlands.  If there was something that height within a five or six mile radius of where I am living, I would be able to see it.  Would the representatives be prepared to buy into, or see a need for, a maximum height for turbines?<\/p><p>  My final question for the representatives of Bord na M&oacute;na is about undergrounding cables, Grid25 and the debate about pylons as opposed to the underground option.  Bord na M&oacute;na, like Element Power, is opting for underground.  It might be a different system but it is an underground system to carry the cable to the interconnector.  What made them decide upon the underground option rather than the overground one?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800015#O00300","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392740100,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I will ask John Reilly to discuss the height, the undergrounding and statutory regulations.  I will comment on low-carbon technology.  The Deputy asked if we are looking at various different and alternative technologies.  We have been and are doing that.  There is quite an active innovation process in Bord na M&oacute;na.  Deputy Stanley will be very familiar with the fact that we have a significant solid fuels business and we are developing a range of low-carbon replacement products for these, including briquettes, coal and so forth.  It has required a great deal of technology and new product development, and it is ongoing.<\/p><p>  We have looked at a variety of different technologies.  All of them are proving challenging in terms of energy storage but with developments such as electric vehicles and so forth, it potentially has the opportunity to provide some solutions in that regard.  We have put a great deal of time into areas such as landfill gas, which is another form of renewable energy, and particularly into technology relating to cleaning this gas and making it more useable.  This has got applications throughout Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800015#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel D'Arcy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392740100,"counter":255,"content":"<p>To make a final point on the other technologies which we look at on an ongoing basis, the fact is that on a levelised cost basis, that is, when one looks at the cost of power produced from anaerobic digestion, for example, it is significantly higher than the cost of onshore wind.  It is similar with geothermal and solar photovoltaic, PV.  Germany was mentioned earlier.  One of the reasons Germany is paying such large subsidies is that it has installed very significant levels of solar PV on its system.  Onshore wind remains one of the most cost effective technologies and, in the Irish context, biomass, particularly when used on a co-fired basis with peat, because the stations are already there.  That is the reason Bord na M&oacute;na's focus on renewable energy at present is primarily on onshore wind and biomass.<\/p><p>  With regard to the undergrounding, it is to do with the design of the systems and the distances.  The cabling that happens within a wind farm, the AC voltage cabling, and the distance one must travel there mean that one can, reasonably cost effectively, put those cables underground.  It is similar with the AC network that will be used to link the farms to the central point.  We are not travelling over very large distances.  If one is travelling over very large distances, which will have to happen with Grid Link or Grid West, and moving high voltage electricity over distances, the cost of undergrounding that and the ability to underground it safely is very prohibitive.  In our case, the distances being travelled are quite short so it is possible to underground the cables.  That is the reason for our perspective on it.  The other key issue is that Bord na M&oacute;na's land bank in the midlands is interlinked with the rail network.  We can run the cables between the farms along that route or along that cable network.<\/p><p>  On the issue of planning guidelines, we wish to make it clear that we believe a revision and assessment of the planning guidelines, as is being carried out at present, is appropriate.  There was reference earlier to a wind farm in Offaly that was turned down by An Bord Plean&aacute;la because only the minimum guidelines were adhered to.  From our perspective, on our Mount Lucas wind farm, the minimum setback we have from the nearest residence is over 680 metres.  On the farm I referred to in Mayo, the minimum setback distance will be almost 1 km.  That will be necessary to comply with the noise limits, which I believe is the most important issue.<\/p>  <p> With regard to the height of turbines, there comes a point where structures cannot and should not get any higher.  The turbines we are installing on Mount Lucas are almost 160 m to the tip height and people should take a look at the structures.  Many people in the midlands have commented to us, since the turbines started to go up since Christmas, that they are not as tall as they expected them to be.  There has been so much talk about the heights of turbines.  Nobody is saying they are not tall but, in general, people are satisfied they are appropriate for the large open landscapes in the midlands and that we can erect structures of this size or scale.  Whatever the planning authorities decide and dictate, we have confidence in the planning system.  Projects have been turned down due to the inappropriate siting of turbines and various types of developments.  We will try to work with the planning authorities to ensure whatever we do is appropriate.<\/p><p> Deputy Stanley made a relevant point about local road upgrades.  When one builds a wind farm like the Mount Lucas development in County Offaly, one has to agree a transport plan with the local authority, and that is right and proper.  We had to give indications of the movement of goods and materials along the road and we had to upgrade the road to the required standard before we started to move the goods.  For the Mount Lucas wind farm we invested more than &euro;1 million in upgrading the local road network and 6.5 km of road network was upgraded, including the entire main street of the village of Daingean.  The roads were upgraded to give them a 20-year life in order that the activity of transporting goods and materials during the project would not damage the roads.  That is appropriate.<\/p><p> My final point is on the export piece and putting all our eggs in one basket.  We have referred to the need for energy co-operation between member states, particularly small member states like Ireland that are not historically or traditionally resource rich.  Today, to keep the lights on in this building, we must import almost 77% of the fuel required to do so, the majority of which comes from gas that is imported almost entirely on the back of the UK network and infrastructure of gas.  If we did not have that option to support the Irish economy, we would be in a spot of bother.  We believe in the principles of energy co-operation with our European neighbours because it will drive down costs and use resources across a wider power system.  Interconnection and enhanced co-operation between member states, particularly neighbours, is the way forward in terms of our energy future.  It will help to decarbonise our economies at the lowest cost to consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800015#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392740700,"counter":257,"content":"<p>The group called Turn 180 raised some valid concerns.

Unfortunately, the models that are used to predict a catastrophic global warming scenario have been wrong.  There has not been a rise in temperatures in the past 16 years.  We need to look at all this.  There is huge disquiet that there is a catastrophic scenario and that scenario is deeply controversial.  We can deal with the issue offline at some other time and I do not want to go into the matter.<\/p><p>  As regards alternatives, I have already stated that we have a good generation system.  We invested heavily in it between 1999 and 2012 so we are good to go for 20 to 30 years in advance and we do not have to rush into anything.  We do not need to throw out the good power station that we have and build a nuclear power station but we should look at all of the options and find the right one.  My approach is that the process should be done correctly and that is what the convention is about.  The convention is not against nuclear energy and I am not against nuclear energy.  The convention, as was said, is not against wind energy.  There may be circumstances in which wind is suitable.  Wind energy does not make sense when one looks at it from an engineering perspective and from the perspective of the large-scale roll-out of a scheme. <\/p><p>  One reason it does not make sense is because it causes inefficiencies in other power stations.  We have some of the most modern gas-fired stations.  They are the most efficient stations in the world because they are 55% efficient at full load.  That means that when we put in two units of gas we get more than one unit of electricity.  If we ramp them back to less than 50%, they fall off a cliff and by the time we are down to 40%, we are down to percentages in the 30s in terms of efficiencies, burning three units of gas to get one unit of electricity.  The combustion gases - the pollutants - increase by a factor of three when we throttle them back.  Therefore, when one operates at one third of the load, one puts out the same amount of carbon monoxide and nitric oxide pollutants as one would if the station had a full load.  That is not a sensible way of doing things so we must look at it from an engineering perspective and analyse the whole thing properly.<\/p><p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's report has ignored the fact that these inefficiencies occur on the grid.  Despite this, the REFIT for financing wind farms gives the wind operator &euro;67 and gives the company &euro;10.  They take it because of the extra balancing costs and the extra inefficiencies they incur.  At the same time we ignore the inefficiencies in our emissions calculations.  We need to look very carefully.  As we put in more renewables, the inefficiencies increase on the grid so it is a diminishing return with wind energy.<\/p><p>  There were 11 sources of renewables identified in the directive.  There has never been any consideration of technology alternatives in Ireland, and that is a legal binding from the Commissioner for Environmental Information.  We just ended up with 90% wind.  I spent 180 days working in Croatia between 2008 and 2009 getting the country ready for membership.  Croatia joined in July and brought in its national renewable energy action plan in October.  It has the same size of a population and relatively the same land mass as Ireland but it ruled out the large-scale deployment of wind because it was too expensive and too much of it would be imported.  Instead, it went looking at agricultural sources such as biogas, etc.<\/p><p>  For hydro power to work in a country, nature must do one a favour.  If one was located between Serbia and Romania, where the River Danube is massive and bursts through the mountains, one could barely just generate enough electricity for Ireland.  We only have the River Shannon, from which we get 80 MW on full flow, but we need between 2,000 MW and 5,000 MW so hydro power is not going to work.<\/p>  <p>We have too much slurry going into our waters.  It is correct that biogas is not cheap, but it provides a steady electricity load.  A rough rule of thumb calculation is that we have enough slurry - agricultural waste - to probably squeeze out 100 MW - 400 MW is the figure for 200 wind turbines - but it would give a steady load.  We have waste to energy plants into which we have not tapped.  We only have one working.  Some 50% use renewables into which we could tap.  We have options for heating systems with ground source pumps for heating communities which are not on the natural gas grid.  We have biomass we could use to generate.  However, the key aspect is that we have three modern ready-to-go peat-fired stations which would use biomass, wood chips or whatever else.  They will need no modifications.  We also have the Moneypoint plant, our coal fired station, which could easily be converted, as has been done in the United Kingdom, to using wood chips.  We are going to import massive quantities of cables, turbines, steel and plastic to build all of this.  If we were to import wood chips for our existing power stations, we would achieve the same renewables target at less cost and not blight the countryside with this investment.  There are plenty of alternatives; we just have to go back and follow the procedure, as the United Nations has told us, and assess them.<\/p><p> I refer to the statutory guidelines.  I am a German speaker and have worked in Germany where I dealt with planners.  The statutory German noise regulations are very stringent.  They date back to 1998 and everything hangs off them.  The Germans recognise that they are insufficient to deal with the swish from wind turbines.  When I compare the turbines which are being approved in planning here with the existing German noise guidelines and how they are assessed, there are many places where there are 20 to 30 houses within the zone of influence of a wind turbine which would rule out that planning development in Germany as not being compliant with the existing noise regulations which the Germans know are inadequate.  <\/p><p> We need to look at all of these issues.  There is no panic or rush.  We should turn 180&deg; and review everything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800016#P00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Swords","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392741300,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives of Bord na M&oacute;na, Element Power and Turn 180 for coming.

We believe the scale of the resource and the combined projects in the midlands will probably account for around 3,000 MW; effectively, that is six times bigger than that for the existing cable, which could not accommodate that capacity.  We have proposed as part of the Greenwire project - other projects have proposed similar connections - to build a new dedicated HVDC connection directly to the United Kingdom.  That is the same technology as for the east-west interconnector but at much higher ratings.  It will not look that different in terms of what goes in the ground.  It is still a cable on a public road, but it is the technology which can move that quantity of power with very low losses and at reasonable cost to the United Kingdom.  It has been proved the world over.<\/p><p>  On the question of requiring backup power, it is indisputable that there may well have been a day when Ireland had a demand for power of 5,000 MW and the wind was not blowing, but for every day one can point to in that example, I can point to another when the wind was blowing and provided over 50% of our power supply.  What matters is how much power one ends up with at the end of the year.  Last year nearly 20% of all of Ireland's electricity was generated by wind energy, an impressive figure which will increase to 40% by 2020.  That is what will give us a degree of energy independence compared to the use of gas.  As I said, we can do this without requiring any new fossil fuel plant because we already have a generation fleet in Ireland, to which Mr. Swords referred, which is new, modern, efficient and large enough to cover all fluctuations in terms of wind energy and which is already doing this on a daily basis.  It is still capable of doing so in the future; therefore, there is no requirement for further backup for the domestic market.  <\/p><p>  On the export project, the question of backup is one for the United Kingdom, but I believe is in the same position as we are and can easily accommodate the levels of wind energy it is planning to use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800017#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Harte"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392741300,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I will answer the question on land agreements and how they relate to designated areas, NHAs and SACs.

We approach a landowner and explain the potential for wind development on his or her lands.  There is usually quite an amount of back and forth communication between our land team, based in Tullamore, and the landowner, explaining the concept of the project and then getting into the finer detail of what is involved in wind farm development if the landowner is interested in continuing those discussions.  At the end of that process, if the landowner is still interested, it proceeds to the point of drawing up an option agreement.  The option agreement then goes to the landowner's legal adviser or solicitor.  There is a back and forth process between solicitors to ensure the legal agreement backs up what was agreed with the landowner.  Typically, with wind farm development, an option agreement is put in place during the assessment, feasibility and planning stages of the project.  A lease agreement is only put in place if planning permission is obtained for turbines on the land and the project is about to proceed.<br\/>It is important that this committee has an overall understanding of how we have approached consultation and of what has happened to date.  The committee must also understand that we have a long way to go yet.  Initially, we launched the concept of this project for the midlands in 2012.  At that time, we explained that there was a potential for this type of development in the midlands but that a lot of work had to be done to identify suitable areas and sites.  We have a community-based team in Tullamore who are meeting and working with local groups in the five counties.  We have had public meetings, distributed newsletters and have used various other forms of communication to explain what is involved in the project to the communities.  However, that process is not finished.  There is a lot more to be done and one of the key steps, towards the end of the assessment process, is to hold further public meetings to present to the public the exact location of turbines and the overall extent of the proposed project.  That is a very important step and we are working towards that at the moment.  In the overall context of consultation, the strategic environmental assessment is a key part of the process to allow export projects to be considered for planning permission applications.  That is an important step in the process, particularly in the context of addressing concerns around the Aarhus Convention and the need for full consultation.<br\/>As I understand it, an enormous amount of feedback and submissions were received in response to the first stage of the consultation phase of the strategic environmental assessment process.  The next stage will take place over the next few months and I have no doubt, given the number of submissions that have been made, that there is full public involvement in the process leading towards an overall framework and policy for the development of export projects.  It is probably frustrating for interested parties that they do not have all of the details at the start, but that is the whole idea of consultation.  This is not a <i>fait accompli<\/i>but an ongoing process of interaction between the various parties, including developers, other stakeholders and the public.  That is what is going on at the moment.  There is agreement that issues like planning guidelines, strategic environmental assessments and other parts of the process must be worked on to incorporate the concept of export, but we have long way to go in terms of consultation on these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800017#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Donovan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392741900,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Deputy Corcoran Kennedy asked how the renewable energy will be transported and connected into the UK grid and who will build and own the transmission infrastructure.

We have a very interesting situation in Ireland where we go to sleep at night, unlike most of the rest of Europe.  Demand at night time drops to about 2,000 MW and rises at the winter peak to approximately 4,500 to 5,000 MW.  Following demands on the power system and variations in that demand day to night, over the weekend, winter to summer and so forth is being done all of the time.  The need for backup capacity, as has been explained, is not a new phenomenon.  It is very important for people to understand that nobody here is talking about wind ever producing 100% of the electricity demand in Ireland.  That is not what is in play here.  We need to be sensible about this.  At present, 20% of our electricity is coming from wind and that is being managed very well.  It has been recognised globally that the management of intermittent yet predictable forms of energy is being done brilliantly in Ireland in the context of the isolated nature of our power system.  Increased interconnection with neighbouring power systems will enhance our ability to put more low carbon energy onto the power system, which is a key challenge for Ireland in terms of our de-carbonisation agenda.<\/p><p>  We completely agree that there is a need for consultation but it is sometimes difficult to know how best to do it.

If that is the case, what level of maintenance is required and what costs are involved in maintaining them?<\/p><p>  In the presentation from Element Power we learned that the number of turbines in the midlands and Kerry is 750.  Although the number of turbines is the same, are the heights of the turbines in Kerry the same as in the midlands?  The questions of distance from turbines has been opened up for consultation.  People have raised the question as to whether the distance from the turbine should be related to its height.  Would it be feasible that the turbine be located at a distance of ten times the height of the structure from any building?  We have very dispersed settlement patterns and in the midlands, homes are scattered across the landscape.  It has been suggested there will be 3,000 turbines in the midlands.  How can we ensure they are located so that they will not impact on people's homes as well as not having an impact on sound levels, property values and the health of the community?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800019#S00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1392742500,"counter":272,"content":"<p>To whom are these questions directed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800019#S00300","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1392742500,"counter":273,"content":"<p>Both the energy companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800019#S00400","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392742500,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I will deal with the question of onshore versus offshore turbines.  The offshore wind turbines are more expensive and are more technically challenging.  They are located at sea and it is significantly more expensive to install the foundations as well as getting the cabling out to them.  There is also the challenge of operating in a harsh environment.  Onshore turbines are far more competitive than offshore turbines in terms of the cost per MWh of energy.  The opportunity for onshore wind turbines in Ireland is the ability to deliver power at a competitive price.<\/p><p>  In response to the question on the lower wind speeds in the midlands, there has been significant advances in turbine technology in the past decade to the point that turbines in lower wind speed environments can produce quite high capacity factors and be very efficient.  That is achieved by having a larger graded turbine in that environment.<\/p><p>  As part of the compliance with planning permission, it is normal practice to put in place a decommissioning bond for the removal of the turbines and the restoration of the land.  It is standard practice that an actual decommissioning plan would form part of the agreement with the planning authority of the county council.  Both a decommissioning bond and a plan for decommissioning are put in place before the project is started to ensure that when it comes time to decommission the wind farm, it can be done as per the plan and the secure bond will cover the cost of it.  Obviously, the turbines must be maintained and there are jobs in maintenance and ensuring that the turbines operate within their operating parameters.  They have the capacity to operate in different environments, such as very cold to very warm weather, but there is a requirement for engineers and technicians to be able to operate and maintain the turbines.  <\/p><p>  The technology has evolved so that larger bladed machines are considered more efficient in lower wind speed areas.  Our experience throughout Ireland is that we conduct an assessment on a site by site basis as to the most suitable locations for turbines and the most appropriate turbines for that location.  That is part of the planning guidelines and feedback from the local authority on a particular site.  A key part of our role is to work with each of the five planning authorities in the midlands local authorities as well as complying with the planning guidelines.  The planning guidelines are being assessed and updated at present and, of course, we will comply with the guidelines when the project goes through the planning process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800019#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Donovan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392742500,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Mr. Reilly will take the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800019#S00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel D'Arcy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392742500,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I agree with Mr. Kevin O'Donovan on the comparison of onshore and offshore turbines.  The cost of installing a wind turbine offshore is almost three times that of installing it onshore because one will be working in deep water and face all the challenges of working at sea.  We have been monitoring wind speeds across our sites in the midlands for the past eight to nine years.  The average wind speeds in the relatively flat landscape of the midlands are the envy of other member states such as Germany, where the capacity factors for wind farms are 25%.  In the midlands one would expect with current technologies to get about a 35% capacity factors.  This is one of the reasons that Ireland has a major competitive advantage in that we can produce renewable clean electricity from onshore wind at a price that is lower than anywhere else in Europe because of our wind speeds.  There is no question but that one would need to build at the heights we are building at Mountlucas, which is at approximately 160 m.<\/p><p>  Deputy Corcoran Kennedy referred to a set-back of ten times the height of the structures.  Ten times the height of a 160 m structure, such as in Mountlucas, would require set-back distances of 1.6 km.  In effect, on a site such as Mountlucas that would mean that the turbines would move into a very small cluster right in the middle of the bog.  In terms of complying with regulations, for example, there would be no issue in terms of complying with the noise standards but one would be limiting the ability of the wind farm to capture its resource.  As we have said, we believe there is an appropriate set-back distance and it should be related to noise.  <\/p><p>  Another point the Deputy raised - I understand the reason for the confusion on the issue because we have heard it also when we have spoken to people - is that it is proposed to install 3,000 turbines in the midlands.  Nobody is proposing to erect 3,000 turbines in the midlands.  People are talking about an export project that might have 3,000 MW capacity and using modern turbines that would involve a maximum of 1,000 turbines.  The Bord na M&oacute;na proposal is a 2 GW project and we are looking at in the region of 650 turbines.  We understand that misconceptions such as these are raising concerns among people.  I do not think that one would install 3,3000 turbines in the midlands.  That will not happen.  One would not have appropriate locations across the midlands to put 3,000 turbines.  We believe it is possible to install between 600 and 700 turbines in appropriate locations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800019#S00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1392742500,"counter":277,"content":"<p>We have to try to realise what benefits will result apart from energy security and the impact on climate change.<\/p>  <p>The energy companies involved in wind power generation have already made a significant investment in the projects.

It is correct that Ireland and most of the rest of the world provide subsidies for fossil fuels.  Much of this is linked with energy security.  In Ireland's case, the subsidies afforded to peat-fired energy generation arise from the State's need at a certain time to increase its indigenous production of electricity.  As I indicated, in 2000 Ireland imported almost 90% of the resources required to generate electricity.  This is not a sustainable or secure position.  The European Union encourages member states to use indigenous resources.  Just as the Spanish Government subsidies coal-fired generation in Spain, there are elements of subsidies for various fossil fuels in Europe.  This is allowed under EU state aid rules to encourage indigenous production.<\/p><p>  For the purpose of moving forward, the International Energy Agency has much to state about the cost of electricity generation.  If fossil fuel subsidies were withdrawn, renewable energy resources, for example, geothermal energy and some of the more expensive anaerobic digestion approaches, could perhaps compete better on a level playing field.  That is an issue for policy makers rather than developers.  We will follow policy and the price signals being given to us in terms of development.

Bord na M&oacute;na recently completed a consultation on the development of the Mount Lucas and Bruckana wind farms which are domestically connected.  Neither of these wind farms had prescribed community benefit schemes associated with them through planning.  We indicated, however, that we would put in place such schemes.  Bord na M&oacute;na is involved in such schemes; for example, we have a community benefit scheme as part of our landfill operation.  We wanted to consult local communities on the formal nature of schemes and how they would be operated.  We conducted an interesting consultation before Christmas and are considering the responses we received.  As one would expect, we received a wide range of views from community organisations, local sports groups and individuals.  A couple of themes emerged from the consultation.  Element Power has referred to this issue.  Many people want the benefits to be local with a capital \"L\".  This alludes to the concept of near neighbours under which the people whose houses and properties are close to wind farms should be the first and largest beneficiaries of any benefit scheme.  There is a sense that this is the correct approach.  Bord na M&oacute;na is considering what it can do for near neighbours in terms of educational bursaries or support for energy efficiency improvements in homes, perhaps to the point of contributing to domestic electricity bills.<\/p>  <p>It is an issue that some wind companies in other parts of the island are dealing with in terms of developments.  We are looking at all of that.<\/p><p> The community groups tend to want the money to move into capital projects that would upgrade local facilities which they claim would benefit wider swathes of the population.  There is quite a strong argument in that area.  One of the issues that did not raise its head during the consultation - we were quite surprised - was the concept of community involvement or shareholdings in wind farm developments.  My personal view is that we should examine this strongly in Ireland and give people the opportunity to get involved in investment in this type of wind farm.  We are looking at a model being used in Denmark.  We were surprised it did not come through in the recent consultations.  We will be looking at all of those issues.<\/p><p> With regard to imported fuels, as one who has operated in the energy industry for 20 years I do not think the general public is aware of the enormous challenges this country faces in keeping the lights on every day.  Last year we imported gas that generated 50% of the electricity to meet our needs, all of which comes through a single pipeline in Scotland.  This country is in a very tenuous position and, therefore, focusing on security of supply and enhancing the use of cost-effective indigenous resources has to be looked at.  I just about remember the 1970s oil crisis.  Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy's point is well made.  Something can happen globally, such as the Fukushima nuclear disaster, that can have a very significant impact on the pricing of fossil fuels, as we have seen in the energy market.  We have seen that happen many times in the past decade.  The way Ireland is trying to deal with it through its energy policy is by not putting all our eggs in one basket.  We are looking at a diverse mix of fuels, appropriate amounts of gas, coal and renewables, and using and optimising the indigenous resources available to the optimum level.  That is what our energy policy states.  We are trying to do that in a way that continuously decarbonises our power system.  I believe the policy we are pursuing in Ireland, far from being flawed, is a very good policy.  I accept that we need to continue to review it, but it is the right thing to do in securing our energy future.<\/p><p> The final question was on ocean energy and wave energy.  That is a big-ticket item from a research and development perspective.  Our company's balance sheet would not allow us to investigate everything to the extent needed.  I am aware that other State energy companies are looking seriously at the potential of ocean energy but it is not something in which we in Bord na M&oacute;na are involved at this point in time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800020#T00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392743700,"counter":285,"content":"<p>We concur with most of what Mr. Reilly has said.

It could well be taken out of the hands of the developers, as it could be imposed on us through the SID process in terms of on how that money is to be distributed or who is to manage it.  It is important that community consultation takes place around this whole process.  We are open to looking at issues such as investment bonds and free electricity.

It boils down to whether there will be catastrophic or a mild warming.  The actual catastrophic outcome exists in the models and nowhere else.  As an engineer who works with heat transfer and other things, the idea that we can actually model the earth with any accuracy is appalling - we just cannot do it.  We are failing to do so.  These models have predicted a temperature rise of 0.2 of a degree in the past ten years and we had a flat.  We need to go back and look at these models because if we are facing a mild warming instead of a catastrophic warming, everything is different.  Also, we need to know what is the cost.  If we are spending &euro;180 to negate a tonne of carbon dioxide whose economic damage is worth less than a euro, that does not make much sense.  We have adaptation policies also.<\/p><p>  With regard to fuel importing, I would point out that in Saudi Arabia, where I worked and where there are 27 million people, all food is imported apart from a tiny amount.  For as long as Saudi Arabia can afford to buy food, there is not really a problem.  We export of the order of &euro;150 million worth of farm and life science products and export approximately &euro;150 million worth of other goods, including food and related products; therefore, we have &euro;300 million worth of exports.  If we are exporting, can we afford &euro;6 billion worth of fossil fuel?  Yes, but we have to look, first, at the competitiveness of that industry.  With soaring electricity prices, the American Chamber of Commerce is constantly telling us in budget submissions that its industries are no longer sustainable here.  Let us not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.  We have ended up with an unhealthy situation involving a single gas pipeline going to Moffat in Scotland and running down to Ireland.  There are other gas sources on the market.  Great quantities of LNG are coming on stream.  The US is looking to be an exporter and Shannon LNG is seeking to go ahead and put gas into the network, so there are other options out there.<\/p><p>  Ocean energy is now working out at 22 cent by kW hour.  We can generate electricity in conventional plants at about four to five cents per kW hour.  Ocean energy is erratic.  Wind and wave vary in the same way as on land, and tidal energy does not follow the curve demanded by the consumer; it follows the curve of the moon.  It  is a huge amount of money to force on people when one does not really know the benefit.  What are we actually doing and what are we saving?<\/p><p>  On the issue of fracking, whether we do it or not, other people will do it.  They have already done it.  There are approximately 50,000 wells in the US and it has been a roaring success story for the US.  The way I look at it is quite logical, in the sense that I have worked in pollution control for more than 20 years.  If significant pollution occurs which is unacceptable then we do not allow it to happen; we shut down that particular industry.  If no pollution occurs and if the industry is of benefit to society then, obviously, we let it go.  That applies straight across the board for everything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800021#E00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Swords"},{"type":"speech","time":1392743700,"counter":287,"content":"<p>One thing that is causing confusion in the public mind is the number of projects that are taking place at the same time and that a different approach is being taken to each one.

An important point to understand with regard to many of the bogs in Britain is that the bogs we are discussing here are cutaway bogs.  We have gone past the peat layer into the mineral layer.  The hydrological properties of that land are, as the Deputy rightly points out, somewhat different from the sponge effect of a bog.  Some of these areas, not necessarily those we have identified for our clean energy hub, straddle the Shannon and in many cases are below its water table level.  When the peat is cut away the pumps in many of these areas will be turned off and they will flood naturally.<\/p><p>  Yes, it is possible to combine renewable energy and turbines on flooded peatlands, for want of a better term.  The engineering process to create the foundation and so forth is different but it is eminently possible.  As we are on the subject of water and water management, Bord na M&oacute;na has been before this committee talking about wetlands and flood management and the prospect of storing some of this water, treating, managing and disseminating it to attract water-dependent and other industries into the midlands.

In the past year we filed a rehabilitation plan for each of the 130 bog areas with the EPA.  That includes a hydrological assessment of the bogs.  The rehabilitation plan covers all of that in respect of the future use of those peatlands after peat harvesting is finished and they become cutaway.<\/p><p>  There is some scope for flood attenuation along the Shannon using our bogs.  It is important to put that into context.  A few years ago we spoke to this committee about the serious flooding along the Shannon in 2010.  Much of the midlands was flooded at the time, including many of our peatlands.  Although the extent of the water was substantial and the extent of the peatlands appears substantial, the real contribution it could make to attenuation of flooding on the Shannon is relatively small, between 5% and 10%.  Almost by default we understood in 2010 that it was possible and was a potential future use for the peatlands along the Shannon.

For example, an unnecessary tunnel was forced upon the developer and it is unacceptable that someone died in that tunnel.

We have options.<\/p><p>  On the question of expansion of the electricity grid, I do not share the Deputy's optimism.  If we do not keep the cost of electricity competitive, usage will not increase.  We are in a very serious position because the cost of electricity in Ireland is highly uncompetitive, at 1.7 times the cost of electricity in France and 1.65 times what Finnish industry pays.  The cost of gas in the United States is between three and eight times the cost in Europe; the cost of electricity is two to three times lower than in Europe.  As a German speaker I am familiar with German industries, and they are walking out of Europe and moving elsewhere.

The witnesses are representing energy companies who are responding to Government and EU policy on appropriate investment for the future.  I note that Turn 180 challenges the renewable energy policy, but Ms Doolan described it best.  I agree that the group should have the right to challenge the proposals.<\/p><p>  I am from County Mayo and we have a lot of history with regard to energy.  The first wind farm was at Bellacorick in 1992 and the Corrib gas project is in County Mayo.  The county has the highest wind speeds and probably the best ocean energy off the coast.  This is becoming an issue of national discussion, but it has already been discussed in County Mayo.  These policies have been evolving and the debate is only now getting attention from the media.  If we are all being honest, until something immediately affects us, we are not so concerned about it.  Discussions about carbon emissions and proposed infrastructure might evince a passing interest in these matters, but that is all.  Renewable energy technology has evolved and advanced, which means we should take a second look, because we are asking people in some areas to come to terms with wind farms.  The 350 MW wind farm in County Mayo will be the biggest wind farm in the country and it will be built not far from where I live and near the existing small wind farm.  This will have significant implications for the people in my area.  If we had discovered oil in the midlands people would have concerns about the oil wells, because people regard the visual amenity of their environment as being very important.<\/p><p>  As we try to navigate the future, there will be objections from every source.  Some people campaign against fracking and others campaign against wind farms; I know of objections to bioenergy projects and also to ocean energy projects.  It is reasonable to envisage that some fishermen may not be happy with ocean energy projects.  Green energy and clean technology is the way to go.  All the comforts of modern living require more appliances and it is a certainty that energy consumption will rise.  The need to reduce energy usage will leave some people in poverty and disadvantaged.  These are very tough decisions, which require a debate about energy security.  I agree with Mr. Swords.<\/p><p>  I refer to REFIT and preferential payment for wind energy.  It is more expensive to set up a wind farm, but the wind is free and the farms require only maintenance.  It is agreed that energy security is a problem.  We have been dependent on technologies for the past 60 years which are based on fossil fuels and on oil in particular.  Wind turbines were invented many years ago but it was decided to use oil to provide energy.<\/p>  <p>Perhaps we would not have had so many wars in the Middle East and so on if that had been done.

I ask that he bear with me a little longer.  My point is that we need new thinking on this issue, and education has a role in that.  We must have more engagement in primary schools, such as the green flag initiatives, to teach pupils about the environment, the importance of conserving water and that rubbish thrown on the ground does not simply disappear.  It is about teaching the next generation to be responsible citizens.  Oil and gas are finite resources.  We do not have any of the former in this country and the latter is causing a great deal of trouble.  We must think responsibly as citizens, with a view to moving our eggs out of the basket they have been in thus far.<br\/>It will always cost more to do that.  Renewables are a more expensive endeavour because our lifestyles are based around fossil fuels.  We have been discussing when it should be done and how soon is too soon.  The bottom line is that there is no good time to move towards something more expensive, but we have to take the long view.  An issue we need to address in this regard is the disconnect between the massive plans being brought forward, whether in regard to pylons, wind farms or anything else, and people's perception of the benefits or otherwise of these projects.  The policy documents the Government produces make wonderful reading with their talk of targets, indigenous resources and so on.  I accept we have to deal with the practicalities of engineering etc., but there is a gap between what is being proposed and people's understanding of the potential benefits for the country as a whole into the future.<br\/>As I said, the largest wind farm project in the country is based in my area.  The energy it generates will not be for export but will instead contribute to the 650 MW we are putting into the system under the Gate 3 programme to bring us up to our 2020 targets.  Bord na M&oacute;na has a history in Mayo.  Its peat-fired power station has been dismantled and a wind farm will come on stream once there is some upgrading of the transmission lines.  People in the area are open to this type of project because we have a tradition of energy projects.  Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB are undertaking this project as a joint venture but they are not doing themselves any favours by the manner in which they are proceeding.  We have heard fine talk today about community gain and the delegates have invited us to visit one of their projects.  However, what I mean when I talk about community gain is actual on-the-ground benefits for people in the form of local employment in both the construction and operational phases.<br\/>Mayo County Council has a very advanced renewable energy strategy, including wind energy, which takes into account all potential benefits in a type of blueprint that can be modified.  The council has set out a tangible community gain, for example, of &euro;2,000 per megawatt of wind installed.  Bord na M&oacute;na and ESB will not go even to that amount, notwithstanding the fact that the land they are operating came from local farmers by way of compulsory purchase orders.  What the witnesses from Bord na M&oacute;na are describing does not match what I am hearing at public meetings in regard to their company's engagement with people in respect of community gain.  There must be a recalibration of approach.  As public representatives, we must listen to people and show better leadership.  That leadership should focus on a recalibration of our engagement with the issues to put communities at the heart of the process.  The companies involved in these projects cannot treat communities as an afterthought or present a package and simply say how great it is.  People are much more discerning than that.<br\/>I have put forward a proposal in regard to the project in Mayo which I have checked with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Bord na M&oacute;na, as a public company, has to follow certain rules on tendering which, on the face of it, seem to preclude it from prioritising local workers for the construction phase of its business.  However, it is entitled to apply for a derogation from the Commission for Energy Regulation which would allow it to do so.  Many young families in my area are struggling.  The power station is closed.  For those with small farms, their only off-farm income is in construction.  These people are looking at outside workers being brought in by Bord na M&oacute;na to build roads and so on.  Where is the local employment gain in that?<br\/>Bord na M&oacute;na is effectively a pioneer in terms of influencing public attitudes to these types of projects and persuading people to accept new types of infrastructure.  The company must get it right instead of focusing on divvying up so-called packages.  However, it is not even going with what the county council has suggested.  There has to be a great deal more dialogue in respect of this project.  Fair play to the local people who are willing to go with this, because they will be at a disadvantage in certain respects.  There must be a trade-off of for them in terms of community gain and not just buttons.  We need a serious debate on this.<br\/>A suggestion I have made - one of the witnesses referred to something along the same lines - is that people immediately impacted by infrastructure should get reduced cost electricity or something to that effect.  Communities must be offered a stake in the generating capacity.  An issue of concern in this regard is the transparency, or lack thereof, regarding the disclosure of generating capacity.  I understand Bord na M&oacute;na carries out measurements on site before it proceeds in order to ensure a project is bankable.  To what extent are those data being disclosed?  There is mistrust among communities that people are not being upfront with them.  We hear all this talk about commercially sensitive information, but Bord na M&oacute;na is a State company and, as such, has an even greater responsibility in this regard.  In the first instance, however, the onus is on the Government to provide a statutory framework which incorporates the community gain element.  As it stands, it is all very <i>ad hoc<\/i>and not at all transparent in terms of how moneys are being administered.  I know of private companies which are offering more than Bord na M&oacute;na is offering in my neck of the woods.  If that type of debate and engagement can be accommodated, perhaps there will be greater positivity about energy projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800026#Z00300","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1392746700,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I remind Deputy Mulherin that other speakers are waiting to put their questions to the delegates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800026#Z00400","speaker":"1087"},{"type":"speech","time":1392746700,"counter":328,"content":"<p>Has Bord na M&oacute;na taken any action to seek derogations in respect of the public procurement process for the development of wind farms to ensure work for local people, at least in the construction phase?  I urge both energy companies to take that into account.  Local employment and local gain must be at the heart of all this.  Given the scale of work they are talking about and if we are to buy into these large packages, we need to get down to the nuts and bolts of it, as Mr. Reilly described, in terms of how this will be done.  The delegates from Element Power will be bankrolling the projects they have discussed.  Are they talking to local manufacturing companies?  Is it all tied up with IDA Ireland and how far have those discussions progressed?  We cannot make false promises to people.  The reality is there are limited opportunities in direct employment from wind farms.<\/p><p>  I conclude with a technical question.  Reference was made to the use of AC power lines within wind farms.  In regard to export potential, I understand it is a DC line that will take the current to the interconnector.  If we have AC technology within the wind farms and a DC line to the interconnector, does it mean we are looking at convertor stations?

They might be aware of the Bill that is down for First Stage on the D&aacute;il Order Paper.  It was originally tabled by Deputy Willie Penrose and, in addition, some colleagues and I, in an attempt to have the proposal debated in a speedier fashion, have also put it forward.<\/p>  <p>It would create a situation in which the set-back distances would increase by ten times, up to 1.8 km.  It would also place the public on a more equal footing in the context of fighting against any proposals relating to this.  I imagine those from the two companies are aware that this is out there, particularly as they have invested everything - including all the money they can get their hands on - into what they are doing.  What capacity would there be if the set-back distances were of the levels suggested in the legislation to which I refer?<\/p><p> The amount of money that would accrue to the area was mentioned.  Has an analysis been carried out in respect of the damage that would be done to existing and future tourism potential if a 1,000 turbines were placed on the landscape?  It must be remembered that people often visit Ireland in order to escape from industrialised landscapes.<\/p><p> The core difficulty in respect of this matter, yet again, seems to relate to the fact that a decide-act-defend, DAD, attitude has been taken in the context of the development of the process.  Earlier, Mr. Cowhig appeared to make an attempt to make us feel a little bit better about this.  I must admit I do not feel any better when I consider the process he stated his company uses.  He stated that the first thing the company does is to identify a suitable area, and then it meets the landowners.  There could be some big landowners involved but there could also be many individuals living in the chosen area who do not own land there.  Did Element Power ever consider holding public meetings and indicating to people what it plans to do?  Ireland was mentioned on so many occasions earlier, I gave up counting.  What is Ireland?  The answer is that Ireland is its people.  Without the people, Ireland does not exist; it is merely a rock in the Atlantic.  If it is Ireland that is important and if the people are Ireland - I would love someone to prove me wrong on this one - why do our guests wait until the process to which I refer is halfway to completion before they decide to inform citizens of what is happening?  If they really cared about Ireland, they would care about its people and include them in the process.<\/p><p> Numerous reassurances have been offered but Ms Doolan blew everything apart when she indicated how she had found out about what was taking place.  She discovered what was happening when it was potentially too late and when those operating the process had their minds made up and there was no turning back.  Would there not be a greater community gain if the process was actually led by the community?  I was extremely concerned by what our guests from Bord na M&oacute;na had to say.  I noted Mr. D'Arcy's frustration regarding the fact that different counties have different plans.  He suggested that perhaps there should be more of an alignment of local plans with regional and national plans.  All I can say is, \"Well, sorry.\"  I am not a europhile but I like the idea of subsidiarity.  Subsidiarity involves a bottom-up approach.  It does not involve someone who is damn close to the top bemoaning the fact that the people at the bottom are not co-ordinated in the way he wants them to be.  That is what Mr. D'Arcy suggested earlier.  This is where the problem lies.  That problem arises in the context of pylons, turbines, turf-cutting and everything else in this country.  What tends to happen is that something is rammed down our throats and then those doing the ramming return and pour some olive oil down after it in order to make it feel a little better.<\/p><p> What is being suggested and what our guests from Bord na M&oacute;na are doing is not going to work with the way they are going about it.  The worst aspect of their earlier presentation was the lecture it included with regard to what constitutes global warming and the dangers relating thereto.  This was from an organisation that raped and destroyed our bogs.  I cut a small amount of turf each year and I and others like me have been blamed for the damage that has been done.  I know what global warming is and I understand and have my opinions on it.  If Bord na M&oacute;na wants people to follow it, I suggest that it should not lecture them and say that they have developed certain opinions on the basis that they are uneducated or do not really understand what global warming involves.  This is where our guests are going to fail, because people understand.  The problem is that our guests do not understand because they are not listening to people.  Citizens have never had greater access to real information.  They can now read up on any matter they desire.  If one wants something to work, one does not tell people that if they understood the position they would agree to what is envisaged.  That will not work.<\/p><p> The position on targets has changed.  We no longer have our own targets and there is now an overall target.  When the interconnector is built, who will get the credit for it?  Will Britain get the credit or will Ireland do so?  Is it the case that it does not matter because we are all co-operating?  It is similar to what happened in the context of the banking crisis, when we co-operated with Europe and ended up being obliged to pay 42% of the bill.  That is the sort of co-operation in which we engage with Europe.  I do not know whether the following old wives' tale is true but I am of the view that it is going to come true.  It has often been suggested that the dream of the Germans during the Second World War was to invade Ireland and plant cabbages all over the place.  That suggestion sounded ridiculous and perhaps that was the case.  It seems now, however, that in the context of co-operation, we are going to be the only ones who will be obliged to deal with the fallout from the interconnector and with all that those in Europe can pile on top of us.  The decisions are being made in the same way all desperate decisions are made - just as a poor prostitute might make the decision to ply her trade outside her home to feed her kids.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800026#Z00900","speaker":"1084","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392747300,"counter":334,"content":"<p>Deputy, please-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800027#AA00200","speaker":"1087"},{"type":"speech","time":1392747300,"counter":335,"content":"<p>It is not necessarily the best decision in the world.

The decision is being made because we are desperate.  One should not make decisions when one is desperate.  One should sit back and think about what one is doing.  This meeting will be the beginning and end of the consultation process for Element Power and Bord na M&oacute;na.  They will have everything on their side in the future and they will ram home their advantage.  Sadly, however, the public will not put up with that.  If the companies do not work with the people on this matter, then what is envisaged will never come to pass.  I will not be involved, but if turbines are erected, people will use chainsaws and angle grinders to bring them down.  That is a fact.  One does not tell Irish people what to do with their own land or how to live their lives.

We sought an extension to that planning permission under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 but we are waiting for the grid element to be built.  While some element of the project can go ahead with the upgrading of existing lines, to develop the full 350 MW of capacity will require the Grid West project to go ahead.  It is still something we want to do.  We began to build roads up there this year and employment was provided as part of the road construction element but, as we discussed previously, the critical issue for us is that we appoint contractors to do that work for us.  We do not manage it within Bord na M&oacute;na, and our ability to be prescriptive through the procurement phase in regard to what we ask people to do under European employment law is quite limited.  We have taken on board some of the points the Deputy raised recently and we are examining that.  She can rest assured that where we legally can move in that direction, it is something we will endeavour to do, but it is not something on which I can give a commitment because we are bound, in essence, by employment law and how prescriptive we can be in terms of procurement laws.<br\/>On the community benefit aspect, I agree completely with the Deputy.  She mentioned<i><\/i>that there was an <i>ad hoc <\/i>approach to it.

We are constantly talking about billions and billions of euro going around.  There is obviously a wonderful financial model and the citizen is to get a few bob and a few jobs here and there.  Fundamentally, the Aarhus Convention providing for access to information and public participation is not about consultation.  The decision cannot be made until members of public have engaged and the process has been brought through.  When we go through our environmental impact assessment and our public participation procedures, we weigh up and evaluate what are the benefits and what aspects are not beneficial.  The decision is based on a reasonable proportionate measure.  Just because something has negative environment impacts does not mean it will not be approved, but we cannot have disproportionate negative impacts for very small benefits.  It is part of the renewables directive that measures for the licensing and operation of renewable generation have to be proportionate and transparent.  We have a huge failing in that area.<\/p><p>  As regards the money to be given to the community, that divides communities.  There are people who do not want to have these developments around them for very good reason.  When we come around to the question of community gain and statutory community gain in particular, we have to be very careful and question whether it is a bribe.  That is being examined legally in the United Kingdom.  One cannot go around and give people money because there are other people who have every right to participate in the decision who are going to have financial issues with it or whatever.  One must be very careful.<\/p><p> The other side of the issue, speaking from my perspective as an engineer with 25 years' experience of major projects ranging in value from &euro;50 million to &euro;500 million, is that projects have to be delivered on time, on budget and safely round the globe.  If I do not deliver on those criteria I am out of a job - or prosecuted, in various places such as Ukraine where I have worked.  One of the issues with the engineering profession is a tendency to deep conservatism.  We assess things.  When a dream salesman comes in we know it is a dream salesman.  Our energy policy in Ireland is dysfunctional and it is all over the place.  Whatever sort of dream comes along, everybody jumps on board.  At the same time, 50% of the money, if not more, that is being paid in electricity bills comes from industry or commercial entities.  They cannot carry this charge and be competitive - they are going to walk out.<\/p><p>  As regards the Bill, an assessment has been done of what land is available.  If we had followed the strategic environmental assessment process and adhered to it, which we did not do and which is now subject to legal proceedings at the UN and elsewhere, we would know what the proper distance is to protect the human population.  Therefore, we could have planned - taking account of the scale of our landscape that needs to be protected, special areas of habitat, etc. - what exactly we could build.  Yet we have a plan to provide for capacity of 7,145 MW.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800028#BB02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Swords"},{"type":"speech","time":1392747900,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Swords for his contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800028#BB02200","speaker":"1087"},{"type":"speech","time":1392747900,"counter":364,"content":"<p>My question is one to which there is a yes-or-no answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800028#BB02300","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speech","time":1392747900,"counter":365,"content":"<p>Two other speakers want to ask questions and they have been very patient.

There was nothing about what happened inside Dublin Castle.  It is necessary to put the entire picture on the table.  I live in Dublin which means I do not live in either the midlands or in Mayo.  The full picture must be given to people.  We should have a presentation on when and if the lights go off and the factual situation on permanent capacity at the moment.  We do not want to go back to the dark days.  As Deputy Flanagan said, it has nothing to do with bailing out the country.  It is about ensuring stability of supply from a renewable source that reduces CO2.  The issue is how we go about that.<\/p><p>  New designs for wind turbines come on-stream all the time.  One design has an apron hood that reduces the height of the turbine while increasing capacity by 30%.  I have not seen any company come up with such an approach even though it would involve a reduction in the minimum required distance from houses based on the height of the turbine.<\/p><p>  I also wish to inquire about access to the grid for the wind that is produced.  On 17 December 2013 a total of 50% of energy consumption was generated by wind energy.  That sounds great but it does not happen every day because wind is variable and it decreases.  A question mark has been raised in Germany about the variability of wind.  It is not noticed in a country where there are very few wind turbines and very little production capacity but the situation changes when the use of wind turbines increases dramatically.  In 2000 in Germany, the number of wind turbines was six and in 2010 there was an increase to 23.  One must take into account the wear and tear on conventional fossil fuel power stations when they have to ramp up to increase production and then wind down.  When every factor is included, could someone indicate the cost of the reduction in fossil fuel production or the cost of decommissioning the power stations?  Witnesses will be aware of the spinning reserve that each fossil fuel power station must keep on reserve.  On 17 December there was a 50% reduction in the power required from fossil fuel power stations.  I have heard it said that power stations keep 90% in reserve, just in case.  When one takes into account the need to have that much electricity in reserve, having other electricity being used and with no storage capacity, is it the case that when one goes around one meets oneself coming back?  I have not heard the issue addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800029#CC00600","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1392748500,"counter":373,"content":"<p>If that happened to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800029#CC00700","speaker":"1087"},{"type":"speech","time":1392748500,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I am coming around.  I am a proponent of wind energy and renewable energy.  I am also a proponent of ensuring we have all the facts on the table for every type of energy production.  Reference was made to cost; 2 cent for fossil fuels compared with 22 cent for hydro energy and wave energy.  One must balance environment protection against the cost and examine all of the aspects.  We need an additional presentation on the ramping up and scaling down of production and the spinning reserve in order to have all the facts.  We must also focus on when the lights will go off.  It is not about paying back our debt, it is about climate change, CO2 and other issues.  We want to get that right.  Hydro is the most positive element but as has been said, we have only the Shannon, we do not have the Nile.  Wind is the next best option and nuclear energy is the third best.  People should not shake their heads.  I am calling it as it is, based on published studies and taking pollution into account.  Biomass comes after that.  All technologies are being considered.<\/p><p>  We have an abundance of wind in Ireland.  We export beef, fish and other products without anyone decrying that.  When we start to export wind, there is a big singsong about it.  Could one of the witnesses remind me how much wind energy was worth to this country in the past five years?  I have forgotten the amount but it was of the order of billions.  The worth was given in production terms.  One has to ask whether it is worth that much when one takes into account the reserve and the cost of production.  There are swings and roundabouts.  I thank the witnesses for attending today&rsquo;s meeting.  The committee has a lot of questions to ask of other people as well as today&rsquo;s witnesses.

Pressure is what one puts in the tyre of a car.  I understand that.  I do not respond to pressure.  First, I would be disappointed if renewables such as wind, hydro, tidal and wave, geothermal and biomass could not be used to significantly reduce our dependence on dwindling and increasingly expensive fossil fuels.  I like to see the reality of situations as well.<\/p><p>  My first point relates to the companies themselves.  There was speculation that many of the people involved were close to Government, that they were sitting on boards and advising the companies.  I refer to former politicians, former advisers to Government and former civil servants and the relationship between the political and governance system and the energy companies.  Could the witnesses tell me whether they have people on their boards or as advisers or consultants who were politicians?<\/p><p>  On the export of energy to Britain, what was the nature of discussions or negotiations with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and-or their equivalents in Britain?<\/p><p>  The third theme relates to leasing or purchasing land options.  The witnesses explained how they identify the areas where they hope to put pylons.  Have the negotiations with landowners involved goodwill payments?  How much has it cost the companies to date?  Are the agreements subject to planning permission being granted?  Could those who signed the leases or options renegotiate or back out of the agreements?<\/p>  <p>Can they otherwise dispose of the leases or options, having signed an agreement with the witnesses' companies?  What is the immediate payment required to get the commitment of the landowners?  I would not pay for a site unless I had a very good nudge and wink that I would get planning permission for it.  Nobody will offer to sell me a site when it might take up to seven years for planning permission to be decided on it.  I do not understand that process.<\/p><p> There is a fourth item on which I wish to speak.  I am concerned that Ireland does not have a strategy on energy, let alone on wind energy.  I believe that companies that have a well-thought-out strategy can run rings around Government.  When I first said that to the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, he took issue with me, but two weeks ago in response to a question he said he would produce a Green Paper on energy.  A Green Paper is the vision; policy and legislation follows.  Therefore, the companies are a very long way ahead of Government on this issue.  That frightens me.  What is the point in introducing policy and legislation if the horse has already bolted?  I do not understand what is happening in that regard.<\/p><p> Also, there is an emerging view, and it is probably part of the same theme, on the part of some economists that wind energy will not yield the economic benefits that are being claimed by the industry, Governments and the European Union.  I see the risk in Government dealing with companies that are capable of running rings around it because of a strategy, but I see another risk also.  Energy companies, similar to bankers and the developers in the recent past, are rushing into an unsustainable Ponzi scheme, because if Europe decided the REFIT tariffs were to be reduced or eliminated, would the companies get involved in this area?  If there was no subsidy for the development of wind energy, would we be having this discussion here?  As a nation we should be getting our strategy, policy and legislation in place first and then making the decisions on it.<\/p><p> My final point is more an observation than a question.  Mr. Swords stated that if pollution occured with fracking we should shut down the operation immediately, but if not, it should be allowed to run.  He mentioned also that it appears to be operating fairly successfully in the United States.  The US Environmental Protection Agency will say it is going well, but it recommended it in the first place.  The companies will also say it is going very well, but there is increasing concern in the United States that three times as many rigs have to be drilled to extract the anticipated amount of gas.  People living in the areas beside those rigs say it has destroyed their way of living.  <\/p><p> I will extend an offer to the witnesses to come with me to see the area of north Leitrim and Fermanagh where fracking is proposed.  Even though they are engineers they will tell me that to destroy that countryside would be worth 16 to 20 years of gas.  I extend that invitation to the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800029#CC01200","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392749100,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800030#DD00200","speaker":"1087"},{"type":"speech","time":1392749100,"counter":381,"content":"<p>For the record, it is not a Government Deputy who has the Bill before the D&aacute;il.

I totally agree with her.  We have seen that even today in this very good discussion, and I acknowledge many of the contributions from the different sides.  There is a need for an evidence-based approach to this, where we get the facts and put them down to the best of our ability, notwithstanding that many of these are interpretations.  The facts are there, but how those facts are interpreted is what comes into opinion forming.<br\/>With regard to designs for wind turbines, in general there has been a good deal of development in turbine design, both for small turbines suited to more domestic environments and for the larger turbines proposed.  All of the companies will continually look at turbine technology design in terms of scale, efficiency, noise and overall impact.<br\/>On the conventional power plants, if we take the island of Ireland without any interconnectivity, 100% backup will be required for wind energy.  The same would apply for 100 islands the size of Ireland.  Each of the islands will need its own renewable energy capacity and its own backup.  It is when these 100 islands start interconnecting that the efficiencies are achieved, particularly if we look at it on a European basis, which is what is driving much of policy here.  There is a European view on this in terms of bringing in nuclear power from those areas that have nuclear energy and that are very good at producing it, such as France and Britain; bringing in renewable energy from those areas in Europe that are particularly good at wind energy, such as Ireland and Scotland; bringing in bioenergy from those areas that have scale and capability; and bringing in solar energy from those areas in southern Europe and north Africa to allow them to contribute.  That is the concept of the overarching super-grid.  It is not only on production, because another important point that has not been mentioned is usage and getting smart grids and smart devices <i>in situ<\/i>that are much more responsive to the fluctuations occurring on the grid.  That must be taken into account as well.<br\/>Deputy Colreavy mentioned the Green Paper on energy.  I totally accept that.

We have a single pipeline going up to the south west of Scotland and it is undesirable that we have that.  We have a fully functional gas terminal at Corrib and were we obliged to lay the pipeline in a hurry, we could drop it along the beach in about four to six weeks.  It is only a distance of 9 km and laying rates of pipelines on ground often can exceed 1 km per day.  We have a flexible connection of approximately that length, which must be connected at the wellhead.  This has not been done to prevent it from corroding.  They are waiting until the entire project, which is ten years out of date, is completed.  In reality, we could switch over to the Corrib field and keep everything going.  We have alternatives and there is no rush.  Even were that pipeline to western Europe through Scotland to go bang, we still would have other alternatives.<\/p><p>  The other issue when it comes to wind is that many things can be done.  Man went to the moon and back in 1969 and 1970.  However, it is a question of economics and sense, as no one has been back there since.  The question is whether it is sensible, not because it looks good or appears nice.  When it comes to wind, in simple terms one must consider what it is, namely, kinetic energy and that is half the mass multiplied by the velocity squared.  As for the mass, there are 30 km of air above me but that does not weigh very much and is very poor.  The velocity squared pertains to the velocity of the wind, which only has a velocity of 4 m\/s to 6 m\/s, which is only 14 km\/h to 15 km\/h on average in the midlands.  Consequently, the amount of energy one gets is very low, highly distributed and very erratic.  Moreover, there is no way this will change and therefore one must build more and bigger wind turbines, as one must catch more air.  If one wants more energy, one must catch more air and therefore one needs a bigger project.<\/p><p>  Another aspect concerns the power that comes from a wind turbine.  While it actually is turning and appears as though it is turning, the power is fluctuating all the time because it is related to the velocity cubed.  If the velocity is halved, the power falls by one over two cubed, which is eight.  In other words, if the wind speed halves, one gets 12% of the power even though it actually is turning around.  This leads to the fact that someone must balance all this and our power stations are operating like cars stuck in traffic, that is, inefficiently.  In fact, we are only getting approximately half of the savings claimed and this was known before this programme was started because EirGrid drew up the report on it.  Even though a figure was reached of having 50% of our electricity being generated by wind, the fuel saving achieved was less than half that.  Moreover, at that point the grid was being destabilised and tripped and we were dumping wind because the grid was being destabilised.  We must go back and assess all these things.  We must work out the benefit and there is no point in creating huge grids all over the countryside, connecting this, that and the other at a massive cost that does not work out on the basis of cost benefits but which merely really annoys people because of the visual and other intrusions on their society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014021800031#EE01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Swords"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1392749700,"counter":399,"content":"<p>As for Deputy Colreavy's point on policy and legislation, there is a framework both in the United Kingdom towards which we are working in the United Kingdom and in Ireland.  From an Irish point of view, the Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012-2020, published by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in 2012, has the export of wind power as a strategic goal.  In the United Kingdom, the authorities are in the process of introducing a new energy Bill and as part of that, they have introduced a mechanism to support importation projects from their point of view.  Consequently, there is a policy context.  The Deputy is correct that it is being developed as we move along.  In an Irish context, the planning guidelines and the strategic environmental assessment is being done.  We only have a memorandum of understanding between Ireland and United Kingdom at present and await the completion of a full intergovernmental agreement.  The Deputy is correct that waiting for all these things to happen would be a nice way to do it and had we the luxury of so doing, that is what we would do as investors.  It would be much easier for us to sit back and not to be investing the millions of euro we are investing.  However, this is not an opportunity that will stay there for ever and a day.

On 24 January last, this investor petitioned the High Court to appoint a liquidator to take possession of the assets of the company.  The High Court appointed provisional liquidators on 24 January to effect the full cessation of the business of the hospital.  This resulted in the loss of 382 jobs and the closure of 130 beds.  Adjacent hospitals, including St. James's Hospital, Tallaght hospital and St. Vincent's University Hospital, all had high numbers of patients admitted to their emergency departments at the time the hospital closed.  In fact, today there are 419 patients admitted in hospitals without a bed.  The National Maternity Hospital, the Coombe hospital and the Rotunda Hospital, the three Dublin public maternity hospitals, have consistently reported that they are operating at 30% above their capacity.  In recent months, Mount Carmel Hospital had been treating a large number of patients from public waiting lists.  In addition, the HSE had contracted 25 beds to alleviate overcrowding in acute hospitals.<\/p><p>  To give the committee some factual information, a number of investors made a bid recently to buy the hospital as a going concern.  One bidder had concluded a due diligence exercise and had take-over funding in place.  Linked to this, St. James's Hospital had agreed to manage and operate Mount Carmel Hospital on behalf of this investor.  The interest of St. James's Hospital is important for a number of reasons.  First, it would allow the hospital to transfer patients and services to Mount Carmel Hospital and thereby create capacity for the planned new children's hospital on its site in Dublin 8.  Also, St. James's Hospital planned to reduce its waiting list numbers with the extra bed and theatre capacity opened up by the usage of Mount Carmel Hospital's facilities.  Following NAMA's rejection of this bid, these opportunities have been lost.<\/p><p>  With regard to occupancy, throughout 2013 bed occupancy increased at Mount Carmel Hospital from a low of 20% in March to near full capacity at the end of the year, prior to the hospital being liquidated.  The higher occupancy was mainly as a result of the HSE contracting 25 beds to relieve the chronic overcrowding that has plagued acute hospitals in the region.  These hospitals are repeatedly in the news for having a chronic over-crowding problem.  In particular, Tallaght hospital, Beaumont Hospital and Connolly Hospital immediately benefited from the access to these 25 additional beds.  St. James's Hospital and the Mater hospital also stood to benefit within weeks.  The 25 beds were contracted by the HSE because the public health service is unable to cope with current demands for health care.  This additional capacity has now been lost.<\/p><p>  As regards waiting lists, 2,300 public patients were prioritised to be taken off waiting lists and have their operation promptly carried out at Mount Carmel Hospital.  A total of 1,100 public patients, including children, had their operation carried out, with a further 1,200 public patients having scheduled appointments for operations.  Many of these individuals had been waiting three years for an appointment.  Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Letterkenny Hospital, Naas Hospital, Sligo Hospital, Tallaght hospital and St. James's Hospital all benefited from this waiting list initiative.  The 1,200 people have now been returned to public waiting lists with little, if any, prospect of having their procedure completed.  The 1,100 patients now return to an over-crowded public hospital system for their follow-up care and outpatient appointment.  This additional capacity is now also lost.<\/p><p>  Recent statistics show that there are 60,000 people waiting on public waiting lists for operations.  The members have been furnished with figures which are submitted by the HSE to the health sector trade unions' at the bi-monthly national joint council meetings.  The latest figures confirm that nursing whole-time equivalents, WTE, employed in the public services have reduced by more than 5,000 since March 2009.  This reduction records a loss of almost 1,000 posts since December 2012 alone.  I point this out in the context of a number of nurses and midwives now going into the jobs market and finding it almost impossible to rebuild their careers elsewhere.  The reductions were effected by the moratorium on recruitment during a period of continued increased demand for our public health services.  The members of the committee have the waiting list figures for each of the hospitals.<\/p><p>  I will now outline the immediate cost to the Exchequer.  The Social Insurance Fund will meet the cost of all the redundancies.  At a conservative estimate, this will cost the public finances between &euro;6 million and &euro;8 million.  In addition, with 328 workers applying for jobseeker's allowance, at a conservative estimate it will cost the Exchequer approximately &euro;4 million per year.  It should be borne in mind that an additional 64 staff are currently at the Labour Relations Commission in talks with the employer regarding redundancy, so we expect there will be a further hit to the public finances in respect of jobseeker's allowance.  The loss of VAT and PAYE receipts to the public finances is conservatively estimated to be &euro;7 million per year.<\/p><p>  It has been widely reported that the aforementioned bid failed due to it being approximately &euro;2 million below what NAMA was prepared to accept.  It would appear that 382 jobs have been sacrificed for a balance of &euro;2 million, while the public finances suffer by &euro;17 million immediately, and a potential ongoing cost of &euro;11 million per year thereafter.  A considerable number of public patients will have their operations delayed.  Our public health care system will come under additional pressure as a result.<\/p><p>  Mount Carmel Hospital made a loss of approximately &euro;1 million in 2013 on a turnover of &euro;28 million to &euro;30 million.  Staff accepted a number of cost saving measures in 2012 and 2013 as a result of the pain and hardship of the Haddington Road agreement being extended to those employees.  The effect of that will not flush through the system until 2014.<\/p> <p>This would probably have resulted in the hospital breaking even or showing a profit.<\/p><p> We have a number of recommendations we would like the committee to consider.  There should be an examination of why the public finances have been allowed to suffer a significant hit when this could have been avoided by modest funding of Mount Carmel Hospital.  The hospital site should be re-opened immediately as a health care facility to relieve the chronic overcrowding in our public hospitals.  Preferential transfer arrangements should be put in place for staff at Mount Carmel Hospital to ensure their service is reckonable in the public superannuation scheme.  Staff who secure a job in the public system should not be subject to the altered career-averaging superannuation provisions.<\/p><p> There seems to be a perception and misconception at large that Mount Carmel Hospital was a maternity hospital.  Maternity services formed a very small part of the overall services.  Of the 130 beds at the facility, only 25 were provided for maternity services.  A significant part of the work included general surgery, orthopaedic work, ear, nose and throat work, and paediatric surgery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip McAnenly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392734400,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McAnenly for his presentation.  I am delighted the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has come before the committee.  We will also have a discussion with the Minister and the Department of Health.  We requested that NAMA come before the committee but it declined.  It has furnished us with some documentation which does not throw much light on what we would like to find out about the offers put on the table and how much it would have cost to secure Mount Carmel Hospital as a going concern and private entity or to have it taken over by the State and placed in the public hospital system.<\/p><p>  I do not know what we can do about Mount Carmel Hospital.  We all know where it is.  It is closed and being wound down.  Documents have been transferred in recent days and it is ceasing to exist as a hospital as we speak.  It is still important that we find out how much it would have cost to maintain the hospital if due diligence were done by the Department of Health and HSE on whether it would have been an asset for the State in the provision of health care.<\/p><p>  I visited Mount Carmel Hospital a number of weeks ago and one could sense the staff were very deflated.  They were shattered.  Caesarean sections were taking place when I was there.  It was a very vibrant and alive hospital.  What I found amazing when examining the figures was the number of public patients being treated there under the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  These patients will now go back on the waiting list and the National Treatment Purchase Fund is shopping around, examining other private health providers such as the Beacon Hospital and the Mater Private Hospital to see whether they can fill the void.  This is why I cannot hold out much hope for the hospital itself.  We felt we should try to find out exactly why it closed and whether it was a simple case of liquidation because it was no longer viable or if other avenues were available.<\/p><p>  I wish to convey my sympathies to the staff.  It has been a part of the community of south Dublin and part of the broader health system for many years.  I represent a Cork constituency and people came from throughout the country for specific treatment in Mount Carmel Hospital, referred through the National Treatment Purchase Fund or private health insurance.<\/p><p>  It does not make much difference now, but how it was handled by NAMA, the courts and the liquidator and how they informed the staff was very disappointing to say the very least.  We should put on record that sending out a press release or informing the media before staff and management is distasteful.  It happens all too often in this country that the last people to be told are the staff.  A press release is sent out from a PR organisation to inform people their livelihoods have been taken away and it is not good enough.  This was badly handled.<\/p><p>  Mr. McAnenly stated Mount Carmel Hospital was not just a maternity hospital and this was also brought to my attention when I was there.  A large volume of other procedural traffic also went through it.  When one considers this, what must now happen will put huge pressure on the public hospital system in the greater Dublin area, and other private hospitals will have to be contracted to take up the void.  We have not thought this through.  If it came down to &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million, based on analysis done on the cost of social welfare and other Departments, it would raise very serious questions on what effort the Department of Health or HSE made to see whether it could be rescued as a going concern and brought into State ownership so it could continue to provide a service.<\/p><p>  The development of the national children's hospital at the St. James's Hospital site is a key issue.  I am not an expert on planning, architectural design or engineering but the development of a massive infrastructural development at such a tight site will cause huge dislocation to St. James's Hospital.  It will have a major impact on the workings of St. James's Hospital for a number of years while it is being constructed.  Mount Carmel Hospital could have taken the overflow or surplus during this construction.  Even at this late stage, this needs to be explored.  If we cannot reverse what has happened, it should still be seen as a medical facility to complement the public health system in the greater Dublin area.<\/p><p>  I do not know what we can do for the staff of Mount Carmel Hospital at this late stage.  They have our sympathy.  I thoroughly believe it is appropriate to bring the witnesses and other stakeholders before the committee to hear what they have to say about why the facility was allowed to close.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800004#D00200","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1392734400,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I join the Chairman in welcoming Mr. McAnenly and Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha and I thank them very much for attending and representing the INMO.  We will have an opportunity to engage with the Minister directly after this meeting.  What the witnesses have shared with us will be very helpful in preparing for it.  I join Deputy Kelleher in expressing disappointment that NAMA did not feel it appropriate to come before the committee.  It is most regrettable.  NAMA certainly has questions to answer and we will have to explore them in another way.<\/p><p>  The lamentable end result of all of this is we will lose a health care facility.  I am not a champion by any means - far from it - of private health care provider entities but nevertheless one must recognise in the situation we are in this was a health facility with 130 beds, 382 staff, expensive medical equipment and extensive premises which are now to all intents and purposes closed down.  It is most unwise.<\/p><p>  I thank the INMO for ably representing its membership in the nursing and midwifery staff.  The staff themselves only learned of what was intended through the media.  They have been laid off without proper notice.  A number of them have decades of service in Mount Carmel Hospital and other facilities.<\/p><p>  I noted the remarks Mr. McAnenly made in his presentation on NAMA.  I ask him to elaborate on the role of NAMA in all of this.  To my mind, it has looked at this as an asset securing loan acquirement in cold balance sheet terms with no consideration whatsoever of what the facility was about.  I wonder where stood its social responsibility, which it most certainly has or is supposed to have, I understand, as part of its terms and responsibilities.<\/p> <p> In the closing remarks of his opening submission, Mr. McAnenly indicated that Mount Carmel was not solely a maternity hospital.  Nothing makes that point more strongly than the fact that only 25 of the 130 beds were designated for maternity work.  The witnesses should provide an outline of the range of other activities that were catered to at Mount Carmel.  I note Mr. McAnenly mentioned that approximately 2,300 patients were actually facilitated from the public domain within the facility at Mount Carmel.  The patients' procedures and needs were addressed there having been acquired through the HSE's activities and engagement with Mount Carmel on an annual basis.  What proportion of patients at Mount Carmel were public patients referred from the public health system?  Do the witnesses have such a figure to hand or can they indicate what it might be as a proportion of Mount Carmel's past throughput?<\/p><p> My last question pertains to the important issue of the current prospects for the staff.  Members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children are aware that not all 382 employees are members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, as they represent a range of service providers, as well as ancillary and support staff.  How many of the 382 are nursing staff who are members of the INMO?  What are the prospects for this significant number of highly trained and in many cases long-serving health care providers?  I already have told the Minister that in the event of Mount Carmel being a shut and done deal, such people, with their experience and expertise, should be re-engaged within a health system that really needs their services.  There is evidence aplenty, not merely anecdotal, of the shortage of nursing staff in maternity midwifery.  Tragic situations were recently exposed in respect of which nursing and midwifery staff have been crying out since 2006 for additional staff at the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  While displacement will be part of the experience of these nursing staff, surely within the HSE service overall there must be facilitation to absorb them because the need is there and no one desires for them to be obliged to look to employment opportunities overseas.  I will leave it at that and thank the Chairman for the opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800004#D00300","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392735000,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I also extend a welcome to the witnesses.

I was born in Mount Carmel myself and had my tonsils out there.  Consequently, I have had some experience of the facilities.  However, as stated by my colleagues, the manner in which this decision was communicated is a subject of concern and I certainly have taken note of the INMO's recommendations.  Mr. McAnenly raised some really valid issues and in addition to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's questions about the staffing, what arrangements are in place?  Are arrangements in place for transferring or picking up on expertise?  As I have heard different communications, it would be really useful for the joint committee to have clarity in this regard.  Another question that has not been raised previously pertains to the hospital's current infrastructure and facilities.  At what level are the facilities?  Did the hospital need a major overhaul or are these facilities fully operational?  I seek to understand what is the infrastructure that has been left there.  I again refer to the manner in which the news was communicated to the local area, the staff and to everyone concerned.  I cannot imagine what the week in question was like for those who were pregnant and had been booked in to attend Mount Carmel.

I thank the witnesses for their attendance and, like my colleagues, acknowledge it is a difficult time for staff who made a huge commitment there in the provision of health care for many years.  It is not easy for anyone who is dedicated and committed to his or her job to suddenly find one's employment changes overnight without any warning.  I have examined the affidavit filed in the High Court and the financial position does not appear to have been great for some time.  Were staff aware of the difficulties that existed or were they kept completely in the dark?  The aforementioned affidavit indicates there appear to have been losses from 2007 onwards.  The figures being given here in the affidavit, which I presume was filed, indicate annual losses since 2007 that vary between somewhat more than &euro;1 million and &euro;1.5 million.  Three different figures were given in the end, which add up to approximately &euro;43 million in liabilities.  Were the staff aware of the difficulties?  Was there any warning of such difficulties or was this all kept in the dark without any prior warning?  If that was the position, it was very unfair.  One problem that exists at present for everyone in private health care is there now is a lot of competition in that sector.  Another issue is the number of people with private health insurance is decreasing.  However, from a staff point of view, was there any pre-warning with regard to the financial difficulties that existed?  As for re-organisation since 2007, was there consultation about creating efficiencies in order that the maximum number of jobs could be maintained throughout that period over the past six or seven years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800005#E00300","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1392735000,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I now call Deputy Mathews.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800005#E00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1392735000,"counter":419,"content":"<p>Would the witnesses like to address some of those questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800005#E00500","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1392735000,"counter":420,"content":"<p>No, the Deputy should go ahead.

I met Mr. Philip McAnenly almost immediately following the announcement of the closure and he kindly briefed me fully on pretty well all the information that has been presented here.  I remembered it point by point.  The question that Senator Colm Burke raised is easily answered because it was public knowledge that Mount Carmel Hospital, which was controlled by Gerard Conlon, paid a huge price to the sisters for the hospital.  Interest charges alone on that sum of money would have hung a huge albatross around its neck.  In fact, the operating loss of slightly more than &euro;1 million in the past year, given the subdued levels of occupation, almost constitute an achievement when one considers what the interest charges would have been.  If one takes a rate of 4% on the guts of &euro;60 million, which we believe was the initial figure when the loans were advanced, that amounts to &euro;2.4 million alone in interest charges.  While interest did fall with the reducing European Central Bank rates and so on, it does not take rocket science to know that the over-mortgaged or over-loaned position of the bank was the problem, not the operational matters.<\/p><p>  I wish to double-check with the witnesses a statement by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, that the demand for maternity services, relatively speaking, has peaked and is falling as the birthrate falls.  While this is known to all, there had been an orderly transition to other types of medicine.  In fact, my own dear father died in Mount Carmel in March 2010 after two years of highly caring nursing.<\/p> <p>All my children were born there.<\/p><p> Mr. Jimmy Sheehan, who is perhaps the leading expert on hospital operational management across any type of hospital, was involved at the establishment of the hospital in 1949 to 1950.  I spoke to him only 15 days ago before he went to America and from where he has just returned, having visited the best children's hospitals in the United States with a view to making a contribution on a reconsideration of the siting of the national children's hospital.  We have to stand back at this point from the nitty-gritty of decisions and look at the overview.  I agree that on the face of it, 382 staff going on to jobseeker's allowances will be a cost of in the order of &euro;7 million a year to the Exchequer.  There is a once-off cost of approximately &euro;9 million for the call on the State fund and a further shortfall in the minds of NAMA as to the acceptability or otherwise of the offer which I know was fully funded and I know had been discussed with the previously mentioned Mr. Jimmy Sheehan.  He understands the operational aspects, having been a founder member of Blackrock Clinic, the Hermitage Clinic - in which he is no longer involved - as well as the Galway Clinic and other hospitals.  It is a great shame and even at this stage we should have clear light on what were the key areas of decision-making.  What was the offer?  Why was &euro;2 million considered to be a shortfall that would trigger a loss of &euro;17 million in the first year of closure?  Why was the whole transition to different types of medical procedures and medical nursing in the hospital stopped in its tracks?  In my view, there is a big question mark and it is not satisfactory.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800005#E01100","speaker":"1183","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392735600,"counter":427,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy Mathews.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800006#F00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1392735600,"counter":428,"content":"<p>Deputy Billy Kelleher raised a Topical Issue matter in the D&aacute;il-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800006#F00300","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1392735600,"counter":429,"content":"<p>The time is against us, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800006#F00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1392735600,"counter":430,"content":"<p>What is the time pressure here, Chairman?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800006#F00500","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1392735600,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Speaking times are decided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800006#F00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1392735600,"counter":432,"content":"<p>What is the pressure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800006#F00700","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1392735600,"counter":433,"content":"<p>We have another meeting with the Minister and we need to turn the committee time around.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800006#F00800","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1392735600,"counter":434,"content":"<p>Maybe we can discover the questions that need to be put to the Minister on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800006#F00900","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1392735600,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to please conclude; he has spoken for five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800006#F01000","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1392735600,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I feel I have been bundled into a corner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800006#F01100","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1392735600,"counter":437,"content":"<p>The Deputy has spoken for five minutes, which is the same length of time as the party spokespersons of the main political parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800006#F01200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1392735600,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I am revisiting some of the key elements of information and asking whether there were other bits of information that should now be examined and questioned.

The second bid is more serious; Mr. Mulchrone and Mr. Barry had an interest in bringing together a number of new services to the hospital and a number of new consultants were going to bring work to the hospital.

Of that &euro;14 million, some &euro;10 million was going to be paid for creditors, including the Revenue Commissioners who were happy with the payments being made to them.  The remaining &euro;4 million was to be paid to NAMA.  I understand that before Christmas NAMA was prepared to accept closer to that figure but subsequently, in the two to three months later, it decided to reject the bid of &euro;4 million.  It would appear that &euro;2 million was the sum required to continue the hospital funding and that was based on 2013 figures when the occupancy level of the hospital fell to 20%.  In the weeks prior to the liquidation of the hospital, the occupancy was almost at full.

There are very compelling and persuasive reasons as to why the hospital should have been saved along with the 482 jobs that have been lost.  Only the catering jobs remain and these are currently in the conciliation services of the Labour Relations Commission.<\/p><p>  There is a national public interest issue at stake.  This is not about patients in one part of Dublin.  I refer to the waiting lists in Letterkenny, Naas and Sligo hospitals as well as in larger Dublin hospitals which are struggling with well-documented capacity problems.  These hospitals all obtained immediate relief when the HSE purchased 25 beds in Mount Carmel to relieve the overcrowding.  Patients who no longer required acute hospital care and attention could be moved to Mount Carmel for the next phase of their care.  The other concern of a public interest is the impact this is likely to have on the development of the already delayed national children's hospital.  St. James's Hospital is on the record as stating that it needs the capacity at Mount Carmel Hospital to create the new site because adult beds would be lost in the creation of the new children's hospital.  The decanting of adult beds to Mount Carmel would solve the problem for St. James's.  <\/p><p>  I ask what level of joined-up thinking took place across a number of Departments and publicly funded bodies such as NAMA, which should have had an interest in ensuring that almost 400 jobs were saved and that adults who cannot afford the private health system would be able to access immediate care and have their operations and procedures carried out promptly.  <\/p><p>  The HSE prioritised the most sick children and adults from its waiting lists to be treated in Mount Carmel Hospital.  A total of 1,100 patients had their procedures completed and they would require further outpatient care but they must return to an overcrowded, overburdened public health system that cannot cope with them.  The only reason they were treated in Mount Carmel Hospital was because the public health system could not look after them.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the input of the HSE and the Department of Health.  The level of co-ordination between HSE and the Department and the board of St. James's Hospital is worthy of further examination.  I am not sure if there was liaison between the board of St. James's Hospital and the Minister's office but I believe there should have been with regard to the potential risk to a number of patients on public waiting lists.  A number of elderly, confused patients were immediately transferred into the 25 contracted beds.  They were transitioned from Beaumont and Tallaght hospitals into Mount Carmel Hospital, with a consequent aggravation of their confused state.<\/p> <p>They were then transitioned out of the hospital.  That all took place within two to three weeks.  The trauma families suffered as a result of that did not seem to be considered in the decision to liquidate the hospital.  <\/p><p> The price value of the asset, on which the Deputy also touched, is very important.  We believe NAMA should have an interest other than simply considering the price value of the asset.  The issue here was much broader than that.  Without going over ground that has already been covered, the issues are the same as those on which we have already touched.  <\/p><p> The type of work that was being carried out at Mount Carmel dispels the myth that it was a private maternity hospital.  A full range of general surgery was being carried out there, including orthopaedic surgery, ear, nose and throat work, general surgery and paediatric work.  As per the figures in my submission, 2,300 patients were booked off the HSE public list and 1,100 patients had already had their procedures done.  That was for part of the year; in a 12-month period those numbers would possibly have been significantly higher.  As the HSE may have taken a greater interest in this hospital, the numbers would have significantly increased as well, which would have done a great service to the public patients in the public health service.  <\/p><p> Of the 328 staff, 205 are nurses and midwives, and a small number of the 205 are midwives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800006#F02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip McAnenly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392736200,"counter":450,"content":"<p>How many of those staff are there?

It is interesting to note that in the history of health care provided at Mount Carmel Hospital there was never one incident of MRSA, which has plagued our health services elsewhere.  Since 24 January, I have spent up to 14 hours per day on-site at the hospital trying to support staff and going through the redundancy procedures, etc.  It is vexing to see the excellent facilities that are there.  As nurses, both I and my colleague have worked in public health care facilities over the years that were not a patch on what we have seen in Mount Carmel.  It is a fantastic facility.  The buildings are pristine, with many single rooms and two-bed rooms, all en suite and all available today for use by the public, yet they have been closed.<br \/>Senator Burke asked if staff were made aware of the financial situation at the hospital.  Each of the unions involved, including our union, would have worked very closely with both the previous management of the hospital and the interim management since NAMA acquired the assets to effect cost savings to try to ensure the future of the hospital.  We would have introduced all the cost-saving measures civil and public servants endured under the Haddington Road agreement.  Staff would have worked the additional hours for no added pay.  Staff would have lost premium earnings, as did staff in the civil and public service.  All those cost-saving measures were introduced in an effort to secure the future of the hospital.<br \/>In addition, we engaged with management in effecting a round of redundancies at the hospital last year but we were moving in a direction that led us to believe, and we were being informed by the interim managers, that we were moving closer and closer to a break-even point with every passing day.  We were looking forward to 2014 when the full values of those cost savings would be measured in the annual budget and where we would have been operating a hospital that would have had close to 100% occupancy.  We have no doubt based on the accounts and the figures that were presented to us regularly and at the monthly - and sometimes more frequently than that - meetings with management that the hospital would have moved into profitability in 2014.  <b><\/b><br \/>Deputy Mathews mentioned that the Minster has repeatedly stated that the birth rate has peaked.

While it was reported in the media that a number of caveats were attached to the Mulchrone-Barry bid, the media did not carry any reports on the Centric Health bid, which was, I understand, made by two consultants.  It was reported that the Mulchrone-Barry bid failed, <i>inter alia<\/i>, because it included too many caveats.  It should not be unusual to find caveats attached to bids where a hospital is in the process of an orderly wind-down.  This was not the liquidation of a factory, block of apartments, hotel or restaurant.  The hospital was fully occupied on 24 January when the owner petitioned the High Court to liquidate the asset.  I imagine that if any investors were buying a hospital which was almost fully occupied and fully operational, it would be normal to expect some caveats attached to any bids for the facility.<br \/>We have not had any discussions with the National Asset Management Agency.  NAMA did not engage with us about the welfare or future of the employees or the timeframes under which it was funding the liquidation.  <br \/>To respond to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question, it is not too late to rescue the hospital.  The liquidator was appointed on 24 January and two thirds of the staff were made redundant on 31 January.  The majority of the third remaining were made redundant on 7 February.  Between 15 and 20 staff are decontaminating areas of the hospital where they are still employed.  Few of these staff have been successful in securing an interview with a prospective employer, not to mention getting a job offer. <br \/>When one pays attention to the public media, it is clear that work could be transferred to the 130 beds.  This would provide significant comfort to the public health service in terms of people who are ready to move from an acute hospital setting to a step-down type setting that would be more appropriate to their needs, including health care needs.

It created some uncertainty for patients and prospective patients, and the HSE stepped in quickly to ensure a seamless transfer to other maternity services where required.  Understandably, it has been difficult for staff to come to terms with job losses, particularly those who have spent the best part of their careers working at the hospital.  I acknowledge that and, on a personal level, I am disappointed that a suitable buyer could not be found for the hospital.  However, let me be clear that a State purchase of the hospital as a going concern was never a viable option.<\/p><p>  Following an approach from NAMA, my Department undertook a high level examination in order to assess the feasibility of HSE purchase of the hospital.  It immediately became clear that the purchase of Mount Carmel, as a standalone low-volume hospital, would be contrary to Government policy on maternity services.  Current Government policy on maternity services is based on the premise that for optimal clinical outcomes, maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services or tri-located with adult and paediatric services.  The benefits of co-location and tri-location are clear and accepted internationally.  Co-location allows the mother access to a full range of medical and support services should the need arise, such as cardiac and vascular surgery, intensive care facilities, haematology services and psychiatric services.  Tri-location ensures immediate access on-site to paediatric services when foetal or neonatal surgery or other interventions are required.  The availability of these services helps ensure the delivery of an optimum safe service for mothers and their babies.<\/p><p>  I assure the committee that Government policy on maternity services is evidence based.  The model of stand-alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally and is no longer recognised as international best practice for future service development.  Where other countries have reconfigured, the move has been to co-location and tri-location.  In Ireland too, we are moving in that direction.  Last May, I announced the Government's intention to relocate the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, to the St. Vincent's University Hospital campus at Elm Park.  We also propose to provide a new maternity hospital on the St. James's campus, alongside the new children's hospital, and thus we will have a tri-located maternity, adult and pediatric facility.  In the context of our move to the provision of bi-located and tri-located facilities, the acquisition of Mount Carmel as a stand-alone maternity hospital would represent a retrograde step.<\/p><p>  I should also put on record my reservations regarding the low volume of births in the hospital.  Best practice, and the development of excellence in patient care and safety, is predicated on a high volume of patient throughput.  On the international front, there has been a clear move to close smaller maternity units and consolidate services into larger hospitals.  As a doctor and as Minister for Health, my primary concern must be the provision of safe high-quality care to patients.  Patient safety issues are issues on which we will not compromise.  I assure the committee that the provision of maternity services in a small stand-alone maternity hospital or in a maternity unit within a non-acute setting does not constitute best practice or represent safest practice, and clearly does not provide the level of safety and quality that our patients need and deserve.<\/p><p>  In considering the option to purchase Mount Carmel as a going concern, my officials examined the potential impact of the closure of the hospital on maternity service capacity in the greater Dublin area.  The reality is that there has been a significant reduction in birth rates in Dublin, and in the rest of the country, in recent years.  It is also relevant that the Central Statistics Office, CSO, projects that birth rates will continue to fall, at least until the early 2020s.<\/p><p>  The latest draft information available from the HSE indicates that there were 25,877 births in the three Dublin publicly funded hospitals in 2013.  Since the peak in Dublin in 2010, the number of births in Dublin public hospitals has reduced by over 1,900 births.  In Mount Carmel in 2012, the most recent full year for which figures are available, there were 1,323 births, some of which were from outside the Dublin area.  Thus, we can be confident that our maternity services have the capacity to deal with the additional demands on their services arising from the closure of Mount Carmel.  This is borne out by the fact that within hours of the announcement regarding the liquidation of Mount Carmel, the three Dublin maternity hospitals made it clear that they had the capacity to treat maternity patients who had planned to give birth in Mount Carmel and invited mothers to be to contact them to arrange their transfers.<\/p> <p>As Minister, I have responsibility to the taxpayer to ensure public money is used prudently.  In view of the evidence of falling birth rates and the consequent falling demand for maternity services, allied to the need to provide maternity services where possible in co-located or tri-located hospitals, I am firmly of the view that the purchase of Mount Carmel as a going concern cannot be justified.  Any available funding would be more appropriately used to resource our current maternity services to enable them to continue to provide safe, high-quality services rather than acquire a facility whose operation would be contrary to Government policy.  There may, of course, be other potential uses for the hospital - for example, as a step-down facility or a short-term transitional facility for older people &ndash; and these options may be worth exploring.  However, if we want to acquire the hospital for other such purposes, it would not make sense to purchase it as a going concern because, by so doing, we would expose the HSE to all contingent liabilities.<\/p><p> My Department, in conjunction with the HSE, is currently developing a national maternity strategy.  This will provide the strategic direction for the optimal development of our maternity services to ensure that women have access to safe, high-quality maternity care in a setting most appropriate to their needs.  Developing the strategy will provide us with the opportunity to take stock of current services and identify how we can improve the quality and safety of care provided to pregnant women and their babies.  The strategy will ensure that, in the future, our services will be fit for purpose and in accordance with best available national and international evidence.<\/p><p> It would be unwise in advance of considerations regarding the future models of maternity service provision to make any decisions on maternity service capacity in any part of the country.  I am aware that the HSE is continuing to work with the Mount Carmel Hospital group to ensure a seamless transfer of patients to alternative hospitals.  We would endeavour to support staff in their efforts to find alternative employment.  In that regard, I am pleased to note that some of the staff have already been offered employment and other hospitals.<\/p><p> There has been much commentary on the closure of Mount Carmel Hospital.  It holds a special place in the hearts of many people, particularly those who have had their babies there.  They are understandably sad that the hospital is closed.  However, in considering the option to purchase the hospital, I had to make an evidence-based decision.  The position is that the acquisition of Mount Carmel as a stand-alone, low-volume maternity hospital would not be in line with current policy on safe and high-quality maternity services.  In view of falling birth rates, there is no evidence of a need to acquire additional service capacity.  Buying the hospital as a going concern would, therefore, have unnecessarily exposed the HSE and the State to very obvious and significant financial risks.  I am satisfied that we have taken the right decision and that we have done so for the right reasons.  However, I must express again my concern for those who have worked in the hospital over the years and who provided such great service.  We will do all we can to ensure that we find a place for them in our health services elsewhere.  I am assured by Mr. Carter that, in respect of the former patients, including those who were in the hospital until recently, we have managed a seamless transfer in almost all instances.  That work continues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800009#J00200","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392738000,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response on this issue.  A point that sticks out in his statement is that the hospital was seemingly assessed solely on the basis of its being viewed as a maternity hospital.  There seems to be no further expansion of thinking in terms of capacity.  We understand that best international practice in terms of maternity services points to tri-located or co-located services, at the very least.  However, was there any due diligence procedure or assessment of the broader issue of the elective surgical procedures the hospital was providing?  Quite a large number of public patients were contracted to the hospital through the NTPF and the special delivery unit in recent times.  From March 2013 until the closure earlier this year, there was almost full occupancy.  Therefore, there was quite a large throughput of non-maternity procedures.  Nowhere in the Minister's statement did he refer to examining services beyond maternity services.  One should bear in mind that only 25 beds in the hospital were being used for maternity purposes.  The rest were used for elective surgery cases in respect of specialties and disciplines right across the spectrum.  When the high-level examination to assess the feasibility of the HSE purchasing the hospital was carried out, did the high-level group engage in any due diligence exercise on the broader issues?  Was the group just sent in to assess the maternity services alone?  We will have to have some clarity on that.<\/p><p>  I do not expect the Minister to wave magic wands in this particular area.  Every Minister is obligated to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent wisely and efficiently.  I will receive the usual reminders from the Minister on taxpayers' money being spent wisely, or otherwise, but one should consider this in the context of the fact that the Government is ramping up the purchase of elective surgery from the private providers.  In recent days and weeks, we have seen a large increase in the purchase of orthopaedic services.  There is certainly an issue of capacity in the public hospital system.<\/p><p>  If one carries out any analysis of specialties in all elective areas in the public hospital system, leaving aside the emergency and maternity services, one realises there is a capacity issue.  Consequently, we are purchasing from private providers continually.  Am I missing something?  Day in, day out, we are referring people to private hospitals for orthopaedic and many other services.  Why is it the case if there is not a capacity issue in the public hospital system?  One must bear in mind that commitments were made about new hospitals in the north east and all that flows from that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800010#K00200","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1392738000,"counter":497,"content":"<p>Not by me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800010#K00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1392738000,"counter":498,"content":"<p>People close to the Minister, therefore.

We are talking about a 130-bed hospital.  It had a very good track record, not only in the early maternity area.  Even accepting that it is not Government policy or best international practice to have stand-alone small maternity units, the issue of elective surgery must be considered.  Such surgery was being provided continually.  One should also bear in mind that the vast majority of the elective surgical procedures concerned public patients contracted through the NTPF or the special delivery unit.  When the Minister addressed us today, he did not make reference to that other than by making reference to the issue of maternity services.  Could we have clarity on that?<\/p><p>  Although the Government states there is joined-up thinking and that silos have been removed, and while there are buzzwords floating around, any quick analysis of the actual cost to the State in terms of job losses and the consequent impact on the social welfare budget and the subsequent loss of revenue, combined with an analysis with regard to NAMA, debt write-down, interest rates, and purchase of the facility as a going concern demonstrates we are down, demonstrates it is no longer a question of tens of millions of euro but of a few million euro here or there.<\/p> <p>Did the Department look at the offers that were put on the table, including the Barry proposal and the Centric proposal?  Did the Department have any discussions with NAMA about how this service could be maintained for a period?  Unless NAMA can tell us otherwise - even though it has decided not to come to the committee - it seems to be accepted that the projections were that it would reach profitability towards the end of this year.  Perhaps we can get some clarity on that. <\/p><p> The key issue is whether this high-level group's examination to assess the feasibility of a HSE purchase of the hospital was just based on maternity issues alone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800010#K00800","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392738600,"counter":504,"content":"<p>As the Minister well knows I have no particular fondness or brief for private health care.  I have made that patently clear to the Minister over the years.  However, I have to recognise that in the context of the current configuration of the hospital network, Mount Carmel was playing an important and useful role.  The loss of its facilities is therefore a loss to the structure of delivering hospital and acute services.<\/p><p>  In his contribution the Minister spoke of Mount Carmel as if it was wholly and solely a maternity facility.  He only spoke of it in that context and at no time did he allude to the range of other services that it has provided.  I understand that they include: orthopaedics; ear, nose and throat; paediatrics; and a range of surgical procedures that were carried out at that hospital.  Only a proportion of the 130 beds in the facility were designated for maternity purposes.  <\/p><p>  As regards the role of NAMA in all of this, my understanding was that it had a social responsibility but it does not appear to have employed it in this particular instance.  I am told that St. James's Hospital had plans for Mount Carmel and envisaged the transfer of patients and services from St. James's, thus increasing capacity at the latter hospital, while the site designated on that campus was being developed for the new national children's hospital.  Are there consequences arising from the NAMA decision concerning Mount Carmel and the development of the children's hospital?<\/p><p>  The Minister also said he envisaged a new maternity hospital on the same St. James's campus alongside the new children's hospital.  I have not had the opportunity to visit the site and can only accept what the Minister has told me.  Other voices that are familiar with it would even question that it has the capacity to take a new national children's hospital, let alone a maternity hospital in tandem at the same location.  Perhaps the Minister could elaborate on that. <\/p><p>  I am also anxious to know about the HSE's engagement with NAMA.  This is very important.  I am told that the HSE had discussions with NAMA without briefing St. James's, even though the HSE and the Minister would know that St. James's had a specific interest in the Mount Carmel facility.  In the course of those discussions the HSE representatives sought to present themselves as speaking on behalf of St. James's.  Will the Minister revisit all of this with NAMA, the HSE and St. James's so that we can establish the full truth and the full facts concerning the various engagements that took place, including St. James's with NAMA and the HSE with NAMA?  Why was there not the same overlap in terms of the HSE and St. James's?  There appears to be a significant deficit there in terms of engagement.  That is coming directly from sources within these entities, particularly St. James's.<\/p><p>  Will the Minister comment on the view that has been repeated time after time that the Mount Carmel facility was expected to return to profit this year?  All the indicators suggest that is the case, so could that not have prompted a different response to the one that materialised? <\/p><p>  At our meeting immediately prior to the Minister's attendances, the INMO's representatives made a number of recommendations and would like us to press the Minister on them.  One of the recommendations is to re-explore with NAMA why it did not take on board the health care implications of the decision to move as they did against Mount Carmel, rather than solely the financial considerations.  The Minister has not ruled out the reopening of the site as a health care facility, while indicating other roles it might have.  Will he please elaborate on that?  Can the Minister have discussions with St. James's to see if it can conclude its plans to operate the site, as it had developed them?  I am told that it had intended to do so.<\/p><p>  Of Mount Carmel's 382 staff, some 205 were nurses.  The Minister said he was pleased to note that some of the staff have already been offered employment in other hospitals.  My understanding was nursing and midwifery were not among the exempted grades.  Will the Minister indicate what numbers and what hospital sites we are talking about?  With the ongoing employment embargo how is it possible?  If Mount Carmel is not going to resume providing services as heretofore, can we ensure that the displaced nursing staff and other staff will be facilitated within the network of hospital sites?  <\/p><p>  Will the Minister take on board preferential treatment arrangements for staff at Mount Carmel to ensure, as the INMO wishes, that their service is reckonable in the public superannuation scheme?  I would be grateful for the Minister's replies to those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800011#L00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1392738600,"counter":505,"content":"<p>In his presentation, the Minister mentioned the hospital being used as a step-down facility.  Have we advanced that research at this stage?  A recent report indicated that people with dementia who are returning home had an average stay in hospital of 22 days, whereas those who were getting nursing home places had an average stay in hospital of 59 days.  In view of that, there is an urgent need to examine step-down facilities.  Have we made an advance on this issue concerning Mount Carmel?  The figure of 59 days is more than eight weeks in hospital, so there is a huge cost factor to the State.  A stay in hospital costs roughly a minimum of &euro;6,000 per week.  In that context, perhaps Mount Carmel could be used as a step-down facility for the greater Dublin area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800011#L00300","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1392739200,"counter":506,"content":"<p>On Deputy Kelleher&rsquo;s points, I referred in my speech to other considerations.  We have discussed the maternity end of this because Mount Carmel was the only private maternity hospital, whereas there are many other private hospitals dealing with the general medical care.  It is important we deal in facts.  In 2004, there were 16 private hospitals in the Republic of Ireland.  Today, there are 21.  There is plenty of capacity.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund and the SDU, special delivery unit, used Mount Carmel to ensure outpatients did not wait untimely lengths for treatment and there were plans to use it again.  There is no shortage, however, of capacity in the private sector to take up the slack.  Apart from that, Mount Carmel provided medical paediatric and surgical services in a range of areas including orthopaedics, ophthalmology, gynaecology, endoscopy and ear, nose and throat.  As I said, there are plenty of other providers to cover that capacity.<\/p><p>  During 2013, the HSE secured additional treatment capacity in Mount Carmel, as well as in other public and private hospitals.  However, the number of treatments outsourced to these facilities represents less than 1% of the total number of annual scheduled outpatient appointments and less than 0.5% of the total number of inpatient and day-case appointments undertaken nationally.  Obviously, there is no shortage of capacity and there is no need for any concern in that regard.  The HSE will continue to avail of the support and services offered by other public and private facilities where capacity is required and available.  It is considered that other hospitals will be in a position to take the proportionate cases previously outsourced to Mount Carmel.<\/p><p>  We will explore the use of the site as a step-down or short-term transitional facility for older persons.  It will take some time to do that, however.  The HSE is already examining it but at this stage it is not clear whether Mount Carmel can offer what is needed.  To establish this would require a full assessment including appropriateness of accommodation, availability of staffing, ability to provide the required services to be determined, as well as outcomes, costs and timescales to commence the delivery of services.  It is certainly part of our desired armamentarium that we want to have such facilities in highly populated areas where people can continue their recovery having had their acute medical condition addressed, rather than sitting in a hospital bed at great expense, as Senator Burke pointed out.  It is important they would get the type of service they need because historically they did not.  Once their medical treatment was over, that was it.  They did not get the physiotherapy, occupational therapy or speech and language therapy they needed that could have resulted in many of them living an independent life at home.  Sadly, if the opportunity passes, then they are destined for long-term care which all members will agree is not acceptable.  As we all know, no matter how nice a place is, there is no place like home.<\/p><p>  Discussions with NAMA were raised.  The Department and the HSE would have had discussions with NAMA.  However, it is a business decision by NAMA as to what it does with this facility.  The hospital was losing money on a weekly basis.  Contrary to what several members claimed that it was on target to make a profit at the end of this year, my understanding is that it was on target to lose over &euro;1 million.  This could not be sustained.<\/p><p>  I do not believe the VHI should be determining the market.  If a private hospital comes on-stream that has the appropriately qualified staff and facilities, there is no reason it should not be insured to treat insured patients.  However, if it goes out of business, it has to be a matter for it.  The VHI cannot be expected to support it, nor the Government.  As I pointed out already, we had only 16 private hospitals in 2004 while today we have 21 plus Mount Carmel.  It would not be fair to say that private medicine is disappearing off the face of the health landscape.<\/p><p>  It was claimed that concerns have been expressed about the national paediatric hospital which we are not discussing today.  However, I want to set down a marker in this regard.  The Government has made its decision and it is not resiling from it.  Those voices of concern want it built elsewhere.  I am happy that the Government has made the right decision and that St. James&rsquo;s is the right place for the hospital.  It has more than enough space to accommodate the hospital planned, as well as the maternity hospital.  Neither is there any planning danger with the expansion of this site and the additional grounds bought at another location.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to the recruitment embargo affecting midwifery services.  We always said the embargo would be operated in a flexible fashion to get the right skills mix.  Last year, we recruited over 700 nurses to the health service.  Those with particular expertise in theatre, ICU and midwifery are much sought after.  I believe the nurses in Mount Carmel with these skills will be quickly taken in by other hospitals.  We also have 200 more general practitioners in the GMS than we had four years ago, as well as 200 more consultants.  The health service is trying to get its skills mix right and focus on the right people delivering the right care in the right place at the right time to the right sort of patient.  In other words, this is about treating the patient at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as near to home as possible.<\/p><p>  We do have a problem in urban areas with delayed discharges and patients not being able to get the precise treatment they need to recuperate properly while other acutely ill patients are unable to access a bed because it is occupied inappropriately.  This is to the detriment of the patient who is delayed.  This is what we are addressing through the frail elderly programme put in place by the clinical probes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014021800012#M00100","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1392739200,"counter":507,"content":"<p>Has the Department done an analysis of what is required for step-down and transitional facilities in the greater Dublin area?

With HIQA&rsquo;s further assessment of step-down facilities and community nursing homes, there could be pressure on beds in the greater Dublin area in a year or two.

The HSE is looking into that.  I do not like alluding to it as a step-down facility.  What is envisaged if we were to purchase it is a facility that would have some transitional long-stay services but would focus more on rehabilitation and on getting people back home.  If older people who are frail and become ill are in bed for even 48 or 72 hours, they can stiffen up and lose a lot of function and it takes quite a bit of effort to get them mobilised again.  It can be done and in a large number of cases, people can go home and continue to live independent lives, albeit with certain supports.<\/p><p>  The Deputy used the word \"assume\" and, of course, I am reminded of my son who when he was 14 explained what \"assume\" can do to one.

The HSE has the right to negotiate in these situations - not individual hospitals.  We could end up with a situation where St. James's, St. Vincent's and Tallaght have their eye on it.  I know that St. James's might have had an interest in it and still does but it does not have funding to run it the way it was as a going concern.  Things remain on the table from the point of view of this facility being used again as a health facility.  No one hospital will have a say over how that is done or used.  The HSE as a national entity and the Department of Health will determine the policy in respect of how to best serve the people of the greater Dublin area in respect of a facility of this nature - not one single hospital.
