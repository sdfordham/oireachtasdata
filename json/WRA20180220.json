They can go through fallow periods while, for example, they are building up their work and trying to establish themselves. A pilot initiative targeted at self-employed visual artists and writers was launched in June 2017.  These professions can qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment when they are unemployed in the normal way.    The pilot is intended to assist those who apply to the Department for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  A key feature of the initiative is that it acknowledges their status as self-employed artists or writers and gives them a 12 month window to focus on building up their work before they become subject to activation. <\/p>  <p>  This initiative was a collaboration between my Department and what is now the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, with the support and advice of the Arts Council.  We also consulted with the artists and writers professional bodies.  Naturally there are safeguards in place to ensure that claimants are professional visual artists and writers.  Applicants must satisfy all of the usual qualifying conditions for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.<\/p>  <p>  At the beginning of February 2018, there were 32 people in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance availing of the pilot initiative.  The total numbers who have applied to date are not available.  There are a number of reasons why any applicant might not qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, such as not satisfying the means test.  <\/p>  <p>  This also does not mean that there are only 32 professional visual artists or writers in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  It simply means that there are 32 recipients of the payment who are availing of the pilot arrangements and therefore not party to the activation process for 12 months.  The general population of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients is not classified as to their occupation or profession so it is not possible to say how many writers or visual artists are in receipt of the payment.   <\/p>  <p>  The arrangements will be reviewed after 12 months and this review will take place later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[8439\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the legislative proposals she plans to introduce to address abuses of workers' rights in relation to bogus self employment, especially in the construction industry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[8446\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her views on a report (details supplied) published by her Department in January 2018; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1432","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[8447\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to introduce legislation on foot of a report (details supplied) recently published by her Department.","asker":"1432","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 53 and 57 together.<\/p>  <p>  Bogus self-employment arises where an employer wrongly treats a worker as an independent contractor in order to avoid tax and social insurance contributions.  There are robust arrangements in place for dealing with complaints of bogus self-employment.  Social welfare inspectors inspect a wide range of businesses, as part of their on-going compliance operations.  Inspections are also undertaken jointly with other agencies including the Revenue Commissioners and Workplace Relations Commission.  Where evidence of non-compliance is detected, this will be pursued. <\/p>  <p>  Officials also investigate specific cases referred to my Department&rsquo;s Scope section.  This section determines employment status and the correct class of pay-related social insurance (PRSI).  Where misclassification of workers as self-employed is detected, the correct status and class is determined and social insurance arrears are collected as required. Under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, there are specific offences in relation to employment contributions.  On conviction, fines and or imprisonment can ultimately be imposed.<\/p>  <p>  Any worker who has concerns about their employment and PRSI status should contact my Department and the matter will be investigated.  This can only happen with the cooperation of the worker.<\/p>  <p>  The classification of a worker for PRSI purposes can be complicated by the use of intermediary employment structures referred to by the Deputy.  Revenue estimates that there are some 15,000 people employed using such structures.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has concerns that such mechanisms may be used to reduce the amount of PRSI and tax being paid, with a subsequent loss to the exchequer and the Social Insurance Fund.  A report on the issue prepared by officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners and informed by a public consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, was published at the end of January.<\/p>  <p>  The report finds that the available data does not indicate that self-employment is accounting for any significant increased share of the labour force, and accordingly the perception of the level of disguised employment may be overstated. While the report indicates that intermediary arrangements can be abused to the detriment of workers and can distort the transparent and efficient operation of the labour market, it also notes that contract for service arrangements can provide flexibility, in many instances, for both businesses and workers, where they are freely chosen by both parties.<\/p>  <p>  The report also contains an analysis of issues raised in the public consultation specifically pertaining to the construction sector.  It looks at the administration of tax and social insurance in the sector, including 'relevant contracts tax' (RCT) and compliance activities. The report finds no evidence that the system facilitates the mis-characterisation of workers as self-employed as there are safeguards for workers who may have been incorrectly classified.  For example, Revenue informs the sub-contractor after receiving the relevant contract from the principal contractor and will investigate if the sub-contractor is of the view that they are incorrectly classified. They can also engage with the Scope insurability section in my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The recommendations of the Report are being examined in the context of the overall development and sustainability of social insurance and the supports available for both the self-employed and vulnerable workers.   This Report and the recent Actuarial Review of Social Insurance provide a timely and evidence-led opportunity to undertake a full review of our social insurance system and to consult with stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":16,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 43 and 44 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Insurance Payments","counter":17,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[8430\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will report on investigations into errors in changes to PRSI stamp payments for persons (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":19,"content":"<p>The people referred to by the Deputy were public servants who were employed in a permanent and pensionable capacity and who were determined to be paying the wrong class of PRSI.  In the first case, the person concerned was made permanent and formally admitted to the superannuation scheme by her employer on 1 September 2006.  In 2013, following a request by the employer for an insurability decision, Scope Section determined that the correct class of contribution effective from 1 September 2006 was PRSI Class D.  Prior to that, the employee was correctly insured at PSRI Class A.   In the second case, the person concerned became permanent and pensionable from 1 July 2006, the date from which the employer should have applied PRSI Class D.

It analysed the significance of different systems of welfare regimes and their effectiveness in protecting vulnerable groups in eleven EU countries, including Ireland, over a 10 year period.  That ten year period was from 2004 to 2014, and so it covered the end of the boom period, the recession and the start of the recovery.  The report showed that, across the eleven countries, lone parents and their families and working-age adults with a disability and their families are more at risk of material deprivation and income poverty than other groups.  Given the sustained economic recovery since 2014, and with unemployment down from 11.3% in 2014 to 6.2% at present, I expect that the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions data for 2017 will continue the recent trend of reductions in poverty for all sectors of society.  But it remains the case that lone parent households and those of working people with a disability continue to experience deprivation and consistent poverty rates which are higher than those of the general population and we cannot contemplate any reduction in our commitment to support those most in need.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, as well as providing income supports to people with disabilities, offers a range of employment support programmes, including the wage subsidy scheme and the EmployAbility service as well as the partial capacity benefit scheme. The Intreo service is also available to provide employment support services for people with disabilities who wish to engage with the service on a voluntary basis.  This year expenditure on these programmes will amount to some &euro;50 million.  Last September, the Ability programme, supported by the European Social Fund was launched. This is a new pre-activation programme which recognises the critical importance of engaging with young people with disabilities at a time when their disability threatens to keep them out of the workforce.<\/p>  <p>  It is accepted that for lone parents, the best way to tackle poverty is through employment. The recently published Indecon report echoed this view and found that the changes to the one-parent family payment scheme made over the last number of years increased employment and reduced welfare dependency.  It also found that the changes increased the probability of employment and higher employment income for lone parents.  The report concluded that assisting lone parents to enhance skills also needs to be seen as a key objective as low paid employment will not, on its own, ensure a reduction in the risk of poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The Budget 2018 measures - increases in the income disregard, the primary rate and the increase for qualified child rate &ndash; come into effect next month. The effect of these measures will see a lone parent on the one-parent family payment or jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, who is working 15 hours a week on the National Minimum Wage, being better off by nearly &euro;1,000 per year.<\/p>  <p>  I should mention finally that my Department is currently developing the new National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  Like its predecessor, it will have a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach that will aim to improve outcomes for the vulnerable and marginalised in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":24,"content":"<p>Question No. 49 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"JobsPlus Scheme","counter":25,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA01950"},{"type":"question","counter":26,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[8413\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA02000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to enhance the JobsPlus scheme to target older unemployed and long-term unemployed persons; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1273","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":27,"content":"<p>The JobsPlus scheme, since its introduction in 2013, has provided a direct monthly financial incentive to employers who recruit employees who are long term on the live register and those transitioning into employment.  My Department pays the incentive to employers monthly in arrears over a two-year period.  It provides employers with two levels of payment, &euro;7,500 and &euro;10,000, depending on the length of time the recruited employee has been unemployed.  The Scheme has proved to be effective in meeting its initial objectives.  I was keen, however, to ensure that the JobsPlus scheme would have a particular focus on addressing the position of older unemployed people and the very long-term unemployed.  In this regard, I was struck by the findings of a recent review of JobsPlus, conducted by my Department, which showed that workers over 50 years of age were under-represented on the scheme. Consequently, as part of budget 2018, I announced key new measures which came into effect on the 1st January 2018 and which provide a new focus for the scheme.    Firstly, jobseekers aged over 50 years will qualify for the higher &euro;10,000 incentive rate after 12 months on the live register, down from 24 months.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly, for jobseekers aged less than 50 years, the qualifying period for receipt of the higher incentive rate of &euro;10,000 has been increased from 24 months on the live register to 36 months.

This standard verifies identity to a substantial level of assurance and is the most robust identity verification in Ireland today.<\/p><p>The requirement for this level of identity verification is provided for at Section 247C of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended) in respect of customers of my Department. <\/p><p>My Department needs to verify the identity of customers to a substantial level of assurance to ensure that they are who they claim to be, to ensure that they are not being impersonated, to ensure that they are not claiming services or payment in another identity, to minimise the need for them to prove their identity over and over again, and to provide them with access to an increasing range of online public services.<\/p><p>For the most part, the SAFE2 registration process is very easy and straightforward and simply verifies the identity information the public service already has for a person.

The service was launched in 2015 on a &lsquo;rolling basis&rsquo; with referral numbers gradually increasing over time.  There are two phases to the service.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, a personal advisor (PA) provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to the two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months.    My Department has published an (updated) cohort based report on the performance of the service, in January 2018.  This report detailed employment outcomes on a quarterly cohort basis, i.e. customers referred in Quarter 3 and 4 in 2015 and those referred in Quarter 1 and 2 in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Of the 39,603 jobseekers referred to the service during this period, 58% were over three years unemployed and a further 17% were over two years unemployed.  These groups face significant barriers when seeking to enter or return to employment in the open labour market.<\/p>  <p>  The total employment outcome across all four cohorts at the time of publishing was 25%: 18% of Jobseekers who engaged with the service during this period obtained full-time employment, in addition a further 4% of clients entered part-time employment and a further 3% became self-employed.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note, that the latter two cohorts (Q1 and Q2 2016), represent 80% of the 39,603 jobseekers referred between July 2015 and June 2016, and the employment outcomes are expected to improve over time as more  jobseekers from these cohorts complete their full engagement period with the service.<\/p>  <p>  Given the extended time a customer may engage with the programme and the increase in referral numbers over the reported timeframe the results are very positive.  These initial reports are subject to review and are based on a relatively small sample size.

This is a review required by legislation. It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure. In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071. As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.<\/p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.<\/p>  <p>  These costs assume that the cost of extending invalidity pension to the self-employed builds up steeply for the first 10 years after introduction after which time the scheme is almost at maturity or a steady state.  <\/p>  <p>  For the shorter term schemes, illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefits, it is estimated that they will reach maturity after 2 years.  Projected expenditure on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit assumes the same incidence rate as prevail in the employed (PRSI Class A) population. <\/p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.<\/p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular state pension contributory.  <\/p>  <p>  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.<\/p>  <p>  The findings of the Review will play an important role in informing the overall debate on policy developments in relation to the SIF in the years ahead including the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.  The Actuarial Review provides government with a timely and evidence-led opportunity to undertake a full review of our social insurance system and to consult with stakeholders.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Reform","counter":57,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA04250"},{"type":"question","counter":58,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[8307\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA04300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to ensure that those that are the first to receive a pension under the total contributions approach will not be significantly financially disadvantaged and suddenly faced with a lower pension than they otherwise would have received under the yearly average approach; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[8416\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA04400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the process that is being undertaken regarding the recent changes announced to the contributory pension system; when reviews will commence; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[8403\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA04500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to reform the pension system which is perceived to discriminate against persons, mainly women, that took time out of the workforce prior to 1994 to care for children or elderly relatives; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":61,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 75 and 86 together.<\/p>  <p>  A policy to introduce the Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pensions calculation was adopted by the then Government in the National Pensions Framework in 2010, as was the decision to base the entitlements of all new pensioners on this approach from 2020.  <\/p>  <p>On the 23rd January, the Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated under a total contributions approach which will include up to 20 years of a new HomeCaring credit. <\/p>  <p>  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome.  In particular it will benefit people whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a full-time caring role.  Crucially, unlike the proposed Homemaking Credits which was proposed in 2010 as part of the National Pensions Framework, the HomeCaring Credit will apply to periods both before and after 1994, as for most people reaching pension age between 2012 and 2019, such periods, where they had them, occurred before 1994, and provisions restricted to periods after then are of little or no benefit to them.<\/p>  <p>  This approach will make it easier for many post-2012 pensioners affected by the 2012 rate band changes who are currently assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  A person who reached pension age after 1st September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new HomeCaring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Up to 10 years of other credits, for example, awarded when on Jobseekers or Illness Benefit, may also be used, subject to the total credits not exceeding 20 years.  <\/p>  <p>  So, for example, a person might receive a maximum pension based on 20 years paid PRSI contributions, 5 years jobseeker credits, and 15 years HomeCaring Credits (before or after 1994), over a 50 year period and qualify for a maximum rate pension, despite additional gaps of up to 10 years.  Those with fewer contributions will have a pro-rata entitlement.  For example, someone with 18 years PRSI contributions and 18 years homecaring may qualify for a 90% contributory pension.<\/p>  <p>  Legislation has to be drafted and enacted to enable implementation of these arrangements and IT solutions in line with this legislation must be developed.  Accordingly, it is planned that the reviews will commence at the start of Q4 of this year, with the first payments being made in Q1 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Under the arrangements, post 2012 pensioners will not see their pension reduced by this change.  If their rate is improved by the TCA calculation option they will benefit, but if their TCA calculation entitlement is lower, they will remain on their existing rate.  Everyone on reduced rates will also continue to have access to the State pension (non-contributory), which provides a pension of up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate and includes generous income disregards.<\/p>  <p>  As was understood by the then Government in 2010 when adopting the National Pensions Framework,  there are those who are less likely to benefit from the TCA model, notably people with lower numbers of paid social insurance contributions, who have no significant homemaking\/caring periods.  <\/p>  <p>  The final model of TCA for those reaching pension age from 2020 will be decided upon following a public consultation later this year, and I do not wish to pre-empt that process, nor the Government decision and legislation which will follow it.  However, I can state my determination that adequate provision for home-carers will be an important factor in the final design.  I can also say that I will ensure that there will continue to be a strong State pension (non-contributory), which ensures those with very limited PRSI contributions and\/or home-caring periods can be guaranteed a decent standard of living in old age, regardless of their contributions to the Social Insurance Fund. <\/p>  <p>  If everyone received the same rate under both systems, there would be no point in such a reform, and if the result of introducing TCA was to make the State pension system more expensive, it would undermine the long-term sustainability of the pension system, which would endanger the future pensions of the existing workers who fund the system now.  This will be the system in place for the decades to come, and it will not be possible to simply provide everyone with a maximum rate pension, regardless of the contributions they have made inside and outside the home, and regardless of their means.  Choices will have to be made, and the planned consultation will give an opportunity for people to express their views for consideration in making the final policy decisions.  The final TCA model will seek to provide the most equitable outcomes, and ensure the current success of the State pension system in providing older people with a decent standard of living continues.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"JobPath Implementation","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA04650"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[8304\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA04700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if instructions have been forwarded to Seetec and Turas Nua to cease terminating persons benefits with immediate effect if they decline to sign a private contract with a private company whilst they are still engaging with JobPath.","asker":"1306","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware Seetec and Turas Nua are two companies contracted to provide the JobPath service on behalf of my Department.

Failure to agree a PPP, which is an integral element of the person's commitment to engage with the activation service, may be taken into consideration by a Deciding Officer of my Department when considering a penalty rate of payment.  <\/p>  <p>  As failure to agree a PPP is one of a number of factors that may be taken into consideration by a Deciding Officer, my Department does not currently record failure to agree a PPP solely and separately as a reason for non-engagement.  It is important to state that only Departmental officials can make decisions regarding a person&rsquo;s welfare entitlements including those jobseekers with the JobPath service.  JobPath companies do not apply or recommend the application of a penalty rate of payment. <\/p>  <p>  The process for sanctioning clients who do not engage with the JobPath activation process is exactly the same as the process for clients who fail to engage with the Department&rsquo;s other activation services provided by Intreo Centres, Local Employment Services and Job Clubs.  Failure to engage without good cause may result in the jobseeker&rsquo;s payment being reduced or temporarily suspended.  All such decisions are based on the available evidence and the circumstances of each case.  Reduced rates are only applied where a job seeker fails to engage as requested following at least two warnings.  The legislation underpinning the application of reduced rates of payment is provided for in the Social Welfare Act 2010. <\/p>  <p>  Jobseekers can request a Deciding Officer to review the decision or appeal the Deciding Officer&rsquo;s decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).  <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Insurance Fund Review","counter":68,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA05050"},{"type":"question","counter":69,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[8309\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA05100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to reform the social insurance system to a system based on the contributory principle as outlined in a document (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":70,"content":"<p>Ireland has a unified system of social security whereby all contributions paid by workers (and their employers, where applicable) are paid into a single fund, the Social Insurance Fund (SIF),which is applied to pay benefits to which those workers have established entitlement.  The Irish social welfares system recognises different categories or &ldquo;Classes&rdquo; of workers.  The rate of contribution paid by these categories differs.  They can therefore access different levels of social insurance benefits.  For example, Class A employees, generally private sector employees and post 6 April 1995 public servants, pay a combined employer and employee PRSI rate of up to 14.85% and qualify for all social insurance benefits.  In contrast, Class B public sector employees pay a much lower combined PRSI rate of up to 2.91%.  Consequently, they qualify for a restricted range of social insurance benefits.  They do not qualify for the State pension (contributory), relying instead on their occupational pensions. This government is committed to improving the PRSI scheme for employees and the self-employed.  Entitlement to treatment benefit was extended to the self-employed in March 2017 and the treatment benefit scheme was improved for all qualified contributors in October 2017 with the optical scheme now covering the provision of glasses, either free or subsidised if an upgraded design is chosen, or provide a contribution towards contact lenses.<\/p>  <p>  Repairs to glasses are also covered under the scheme.  The dental scheme now includes a contribution to cleanings, either an annual scale and polish or more extensive periodontal treatment if clinically required.  Even more significantly, self-employed contributors are now eligible for the invalidity pension from December 2017.  For the first time, this gives the self-employed access to the safety-net of State income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability without having to go through a means test.  This is a real advance in the level of cover available to the self-employed.<\/p>  <p>  On 23 January, the Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated by a new &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) which will include up to 20 years of a new Home Caring credit. Unlike the current Homemakers scheme, this credit will apply to periods both before and after 1994. This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role. It will make it easier for such pensioners to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory). The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines a final pension outcome, and it also acknowledges, for the first time, the contribution made by home-carers in the period before 1994.<\/p>  <p>  An inter-departmental working group has been established to examine and report on options for the amalgamation of USC and PRSI.  It will have regard to the structures and rates of personal tax and social insurance in other countries and the macroeconomic and demographic contexts in Ireland and its work should be completed by the end of June 2018. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA05250"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[8442\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA05300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of the implementation of the making work pay recommendations.","asker":"1262","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[8443\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000058#WRA05400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of the implementation of the making work pay recommendations.","asker":"1262","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":74,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 77 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Make Work Pay (MWP) report was published on 6th April 2017, following the deliberations of an interdepartmental group established under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities.

Through the operation of the income support system managed by my Department and the health service managed by the Health Service Executive (HSE), the Government recognises the need for flexible and effective support for persons who encounter mental health difficulties.  Both an effective income support system and health services are key to addressing these difficulties but the research has also demonstrated that work can be an important factor in recovery, in particular for people with mental health issues. The Make Work Pay report for People with Disabilities, published last year, identified the need for flexibility in both the income support and the health (medical card) systems.  This is particularly the case where a person with a disability takes up a job but that job does not work out.  Anxiety in such circumstances can be particularly pronounced amongst those with mental health issues, given the episodic nature of such conditions.<\/p><p>One of the recommendations of the Make Work Pay report was to put in place and promote a system for fast-track reinstatement of income support payments to people with disabilities who have returned to work, and have subsequently had to leave their job within one year.  <\/p><p>As a first step in implementing this recommendation a fast-track return to disability allowance protocol has now been put in place.  In addition to this initiative, people who are participating on the partial capacity benefit scheme may return to illness benefit or invalidity pension if they find that they cannot continue to work.<\/p><p>My Department also provides a wide range of work related supports for people with disabilities, including people with mental health difficulties, which they or their employers, where appropriate, can access while in receipt of income support payments.  These include the Wage Subsidy Scheme, the EmployAbility service and employment support grants for people with disabilities. <\/p><p>Most recently, the Department participated as a partner organisation in the Integrating Employment and Mental Health Service project, which ran between 2015 and 2017.  The aim of this project was to demonstrate how existing employment services (specifically the EmployAbility service) could practice the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model of supported employment for clients with severe and enduring mental health issues.  An evaluation report, <i>Steps into Work,<\/i>was published on the 8<sup>th<\/sup>February last and found that through improved integration between mental health services and employment support services, improvements can be achieved in the employment outcomes of people with mental health difficulties. <\/p><p>My Department is now collaborating with the Department of Health and the HSE to extend the availability of IPS to all Mental Health Services in each Community Healthcare Organisation.

I indicated that I would consider these matters in the context of possible Committee Stage amendments.However, I would like to make a number of points.  There will be an administrative burden on employers in implementing the banded hours provision so therefore it is desirable that an &lsquo;easy&rsquo; divisor is used.  I am open to  discussing a reference period of 13 months or less and in this respect I note that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in their report on the Banded Hour Contracts Bill 2016 recommended a reference period of 12 months. In relation to the width of the bands, I am open to discussing the option of narrower bands at Committee Stage once the bands allow a reasonable degree of flexibility.  This can benefit both employers and employees.  A greater number of bands but with more narrow ranges of hours will be more difficult to operate.  <\/p><p>We know that banded hours arrangements are operating successfully in the retail sector but we must acknowledge that what is appropriate to individual employments in the retail sector might not work as well in other sectors.  This legislation will apply to all employers in all sectors of the economy and not just the retail sector.  Therefore, we must be careful to introduce banded hours provisions that work more generally across the economy, rather than imposing on all, a particular banded hours model that is adapted to the retail sector. <\/p><p>Regarding a definition of casual work, the <i>Organisation of Working Time Act<\/i>was enacted in 1997.  Section 18 of that Act refers to &lsquo;work of a casual nature&rsquo; but does not define it.  This has not led to a regulatory problem of employers incorrectly categorising employees as &lsquo;casual&rsquo; in the 20 years since enactment.

In advance of this, on the 23rd January, the Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated by a new &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) which will include up to 20 years of a new HomeCaring credit.  This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome.  Under this new arrangement, a person who reached pension age after 1st September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new HomeCaring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Up to 10 years of other credits, for example when unemployed or ill, may also be used, subject to the total number of credits not exceeding 20 years.  So, for example, a person might receive a maximum pension based on 20 years paid PRSI contributions, 5 years jobseeker credits, and 15 years HomeCaring Credits, over a 50 year period.<\/p>  <p>  As with the Yearly Average approach and the pre-existing homemakers disregard scheme, these measures only determine the rate of payment for those with an entitlement to a State pension (contributory).  They do not remove the requirement to be entitled to such a pension in the first place.  Entitlement to a State pension is based on a number of criteria, including that a minimum of 520 qualifying contributions are paid.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to remove the requirement to have 520 contributions paid to qualify for the State Pension (contributory).  It is reasonable to require people who seek a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years paid contributions into the Social Insurance Fund which finances it, over 50 years of working age life.  While it was lower in the past when PRSI coverage was less widespread, legislation was introduced in 1997 to increase this threshold to 520 weeks, or 10 years of contributions.  A fifteen year period was allowed pass between that legislation being enacted and the threshold being raised to this level, which would have been sufficient for most people to achieve the required contributions.<\/p>  <p>  For those who do not qualify for the State Pension (contributory) (SPC), there are other state pension payments available.  Notably, they may qualify for the State Pension (non-contributory) which is a means-tested payment (based on their share of household means) with a maximum payment of 95% of the SPC.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult (based on their own means), amounting up to 90% of a full rate SPC pension.  Consequently, if a person doesn&rsquo;t receive a State pension after pension age, they have both significant means and have made little or no contribution to the Social Insurance Fund.  Introducing a new pension entitlement for such people would reduce the resources available for other pensioners, most of whom have less means than they do, and have contributed significantly more to the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p>  <p>  The final model of TCA which will be in place for all new pensioners from 2020 will be decided upon following a public consultation later this year, and I do not wish to pre-empt this process, nor the Government decision and legislation which will follow it.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000059#WRB01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":95,"content":"<p>Question No. 74 answered with Question No. 58.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":96,"content":"<p>Question No. 75 answered with Question No. 63.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment and Youth Activation Charter","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000059#WRB01625"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[8404\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000059#WRB01650","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to introduce employment activation measures targeted at young persons that are long-term unemployed or that face barriers to employment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1300","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>Irish youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.2% in 2012 to 13.7% in January 2018.

This reform plan will detail measures to reform both our State and supplementary pension systems. Perhaps the two most fundamental reform measures contained within this plan will relate to the introduction of the &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; for the State pension contributory from 2020 and the development of a new automatic enrolment retirement savings system for employees without supplementary pensions coverage.    It is proposed that the &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; (TCA) will replace the current &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system from 2020.  This will make the level of pension more directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life, with significant pension credits granted to people who have taken time out of the workplace to perform caring duties.  <\/p>  <p>  The TCA will eliminate the anomalies inherent in the current averaging system whereby a person can qualify for a full pension based on a small number of years payments (currently as little as 10 years contributions) provided they have no gaps in their record, whereas a person with more than 10 years contributions but with a significant gap in their record might be paid a reduced rate.<\/p>  <p>  Automatic enrolment would see a transition from the current and purely voluntary supplementary pension system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.  It is planned that this reform, where the saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out, will include employer and State financial incentives to encourage long term saving and asset accumulation amongst those who may otherwise suffer a reduction in living standards at retirement.  It will increase the wellbeing, financial security, and independence of future retirees. <\/p>  <p>  It is intended that following publication of the reform plan, two separate public consultation processes will be launched on the &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; and automatic enrolment.  The purpose of both of these consultations will be to inform the design of both systems.  The details and timeframe of them will be confirmed subsequent to the publication of the reform plan, although I can say it is my intention to begin them by Q2 of this year. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000060#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Labour Court","counter":143,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000060#WRC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":144,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[8425\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000060#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if her attention has been drawn to difficulties being faced in the horse racing and breeding industries due to a recent Labour Court ruling affecting the classification of persons in the industry and the need for flexibility to take account of the unique nature of these industries in rural Ireland; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":552,"qnumall":"[8459\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000060#WRC01100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if discussions are expected to reclassify stable staff as agricultural workers further to a recent determination (details supplied) issued by the Labour Court into the classification of stable staff working in horse racing.","asker":"1259","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":146,"qnumday":553,"qnumall":"[8460\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000060#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the efforts she is making to protect stable staff involved in horse racing under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":147,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93, 552 and 553 together. <\/p>  <p>  The Labour Court determination in question involves a case where the Court, in exercising its independent and quasi-judicial functions, found against an employer in the horse racing industry in relation to breaches of the working time legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 (the 1997 Act) sets out statutory rights for employees in relation to working time including work breaks and rest periods, maximum working time, night work and holidays.  The 1997 Act transposed the EU Working Time Directive &ndash; Directive 2003\/88\/EC.  The purpose of the Directive is to establish minimum health and safety requirements for the organisation of working time for employees. <\/p>  <p>  While the Directive sets down limits on the time that workers can work without rests, it does allow some flexibility in relation to the application of some of its provisions.  In this regard, it provides for derogations and exemptions under certain circumstances from some of its provisions.  These derogations, which are provided for under the 1997 Act, are conditional on workers being granted &lsquo;equivalent compensatory rest&rsquo;.  So, while employers may operate a more flexible system of working, employees must not lose out on rest periods.  In all of this, I am very conscious that the purpose of the Working Time Directive is to protect the health and safety of employees.  I understand that the Labour Court, in its determination of this particular case, found that the derogations available in the legislation did not apply to the employees in question.  The Court is independent in the performance of its statutory functions in this regard.  As Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, I have no role in relation to the adjudicatory functions of the Labour Court. <\/p>  <p>  Representations have been made to me from the horse racing and breeding industry and from my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine about the concerns that exist in the industry arising from the Labour Court ruling.  In light of the representations made to me, I have written to the Attorney General seeking his advice on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the employer involved has appealed the Labour Court determination to the Circuit Court and the case is returnable for a date in April 2018.

The most recent data shows that unemployment has fallen from a peak of 15% in 2012 to 6.7% by Q.3 2017.  Within the South East region, which includes Wexford, unemployment has fallen from a peak of 19.0% in Quarter 2, 2012 to 8.1% in Quarter 2, 2017 with numbers in employment increasing by 29,000 to 214,900 over the same period. While data from the Labour Force Survey is not available at the county level, trends in the Live Register can give an indication of underlying trends in local unemployment.<\/p><p>Overall, the Live Register in Wexford has fallen by almost 42% in the 5 years to December 2017, close to the reduction of 44% nationally.  In the year to December 2017, the Live Register in Wexford has fallen by 1,707 people, or almost 14%, again closely in line with national trends.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle unemployment since 2012 is twofold:<\/p><p>-  Firstly, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs.  This policy now includes a specific regional Action Plan for the South East Region that has seen over 8,000 jobs created in the region in the last two years.<\/p><p>-  Secondly, through Pathways to Work, my Department ensures that as many new jobs and vacancies as possible are filled by people taken from the Live Register.  Under this policy, employment services and activation supports are heavily concentrated on the areas of highest unemployment, including those in Wexford.<\/p><p>Currently, there are 11 Activation Case Officers in the Intreo service in Wexford.  This is an increase of one in comparison to January 2017, when there were 10. Prior to the roll-out of Intreo, there were 8 Activation Case Officers in Wexford, including former FAS personnel and DSP Jobs Facilitators. <\/p><p>The Case Officer capacity is supplemented by referrals to Turas Nua under the Job Path programme and to Wexford Local Development which operates the Local Employment Service (LES) on behalf of the Department.  Wexford Local Development is contracted to provide intensive supports to 960 customers and employs 8 mediators to support LES operations. <\/p><p>A total of 9,114 customer engagements were scheduled by Activation Case Officers in 2017 in addition to their work with employers.  Local records indicate that approximately 5,300 referrals to Turas Nua took place over the course of the year.<\/p><p>Later this year I will be introducing a new work experience programme targeted specifically at young jobseekers who are long-term unemployed or who face significant barriers to gaining employment &ndash; people who even during the Celtic Tiger years would have found it difficult to get a foothold on the career ladder.  The new Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) will provide young jobseekers with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement.  Host organisations will be encouraged to hire participants who performed well, and will qualify for a financial subsidy under <i>JobsPlus Youth.<\/i>YESS will complement other opportunities developed by the Department of Education and Skills, such as the new Career Traineeships and Apprenticeships, and will broaden the choice available to young people.  Operational details are currently being finalised and I hope to launch the scheme in Quarter 2, 2018.<\/p><p>To date, the policies being pursued under the Action Plan for Jobs and under Pathways to Work have been effective in reducing unemployment, both nationally and in Wexford and I am confident that they will continue to do so. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000060#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":151,"content":"<p>Question No. 95 answered with Question No. 82.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Paternity Leave Data","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000060#WRC01650"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[8400\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000060#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the uptake of paid paternity leave since it was announced; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1315","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":154,"content":"<p>Paternity benefit was introduced from 1<sup>st<\/sup>September 2016 and provides a payment in respect of two weeks paternity leave to be taken within 26 weeks of the birth of the baby.

It is essential that each company operates to modern and evolving standards of corporate governance, including compliance with necessary financial and audit requirements.

A PSC is issued once a person successfully completes a SAFE2 identity verification, i.e., has their identity verified to a substantial level of assurance.<\/p>  <p>  Section 263 of the Social Welfare Consolidation, Act (as amended) provides that:<\/p>  <p>  (a)  the following information is inscribed on the Public Services Card (PSC): forename, surname, Personal Public Service (PPS) Number, photograph, signature, card issue number and expiry date; and <\/p>  <p>  (b)  the following information is encoded on the chip of the PSC: forename, surname, date of birth, place of birth, sex, nationality, former surnames (if any), mother&rsquo;s former surnames (if any), photograph, signature, issue number of the PSC, and expiry date of the PSC. <\/p>  <p>  The above data (apart from the issue number and expiry date of the PSC) is part of the Public Service Identity (PSI) dataset as set out in section 262 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended).  Section 262 also sets out how the sharing and use of the PSI data is restricted to public service bodies specified in law or their agents.  Designation as a specified body requires primary legislation and as such can only be done by an Act of the Oireachtas.  I am not aware of any plans to specify any additional bodies. <\/p>  <p>  Section 262 also provides that PSI data can only be used by a specified body for authenticating the identity of an individual with whom it has a transaction and in performing its public functions insofar as those functions relate to the person concerned.  In addition, where a specified body collects any element of PSI data from a person, that information shall also be collected for the purpose of maintaining the person&rsquo;s public service identity.  Additional cover is provided by the Data Protection Acts as amended, Subsection 1 c iii of Section 2A, where personal data may be processed providing &ldquo;the processing is necessary for the performance of a function of the Government or a Minister of the Government&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The PSI data set is stored in enterprise class databases maintained in the Department&rsquo;s secure data centres.  The Department is committed to ensuring that customers&rsquo; personal data is securely held and used only for business purposes.  Access to the dataset is restricted to those members of staff who have a business need to reference the data and all accesses to the data are logged.  All members of staff must, on an annual basis, sign undertakings that they have read, and will act in accordance with, data protection policies and guidelines.  Failure to comply with these simple rules could leave them exposed to potentially serious allegations.  Where such allegations are substantiated, staff could face disciplinary action (including possible dismissal) and potential legal action including possible claim for compensation for distress\/damage caused to the customer.  The Department ensures oversight in relation to data protection by keeping records of data accesses which are then subject to audit.  Twenty eight security audits have been undertaken within the last five years, twenty two of these are completed, and six are in progress.  Three Penetration tests, two Privacy Impact Assessments, and a Risk Assessment of the IS environment were also carried out during this timeframe.   The PSI data set is also stored by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the Single Customer View.  This system brings identity data together from a number of public bodies.  The Single Customer View database is stored in a secure government data centre.  Access to the data is tightly controlled and restricted to the government network.  All data access is logged and regularly audited.  The Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Aras Mhic Diarmada, Store Street, Dublin 1 is the Data Controller for the PSI dataset held by the Department including the Single Customer View.  As required under Section 16 of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 these details are listed on the Register maintained by the Data Protection Commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  Separately each specified body that collects or holds PSI data elements is the data controller in respect of their holding of the data on their own systems or databases.<\/p>  <p>  The PSC is produced in Ireland by an Irish-registered company called BCS.  It was a condition of the award of contract that all data and related services provision and operation be provided on-site in Ireland and subject to the jurisdiction of the Irish courts.  Once PSCs are personalised (i.e., the data is put on the card), the data used to personalise them is not retained by BCS but is destroyed as an automatic part of the personalisation process in accordance with advice provided by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  In addition the systems used in the card production have been subjected to audit by external experts.<\/p>  <p>  The PSC itself has multiple protection mechanisms, all of the highest current international standards, to prevent and detect tampering with the physical card and its contents.  As well as some hidden security features, there are visual measures such as the overall graphical design, branding, microprinting, the use of optical variable ink and a kinegram.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, a PSC and a card reader communicate with each other by cryptographic means.  Only card readers specifically programmed to accept PSCs can undertake this functionality. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000060#WRC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Redundancy Payments","counter":168,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000060#WRC02750"},{"type":"question","counter":169,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[8433\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000060#WRC02800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to raise the ceiling on annual reckonable earnings to be taken into account in the calculation of statutory redundancy lump sum payments in view of the fact that there has been no increase since 1 January 2005.","asker":"1259","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":170,"content":"<p>It is the employer&rsquo;s responsibility to pay statutory redundancy and other wage related entitlements to all eligible employees.

This would require detailed consideration of the capability requirements underpinning such an increase and consideration of associated personnel issues, including organisational structures as well as equipment, infrastructure and other additional requirements and associated costs.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000060#WRC04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Recruitment","counter":189,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000060#WRC04150"},{"type":"question","counter":190,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[8266\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000060#WRC04200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the funding allocated to recruitment in the Defence Forces over each of the past five years; the annual number of recruits over the period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1305","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":191,"content":"<p>The military authorities have advised that their recruitment funding allocation amounted to approximately &euro;95,000 each year\u00a0over the past 5 years.\u00a0 This forms part of the broader recruitment and Public Relations (PR) efforts.\u00a0 PR for the Defence Forces, by its nature, whilst geared towards communicating the roles of the\u00a0Defence Forces and activities undertaken, also highlights the attractiveness of the\u00a0Permanent Defence Force as a career and opportunities for service in the Reserve Defence Force.<\/p><p>The military authorities have also provided the following information on the number of General Service inductions to the Permanent Defence Force (not including\u00a0Cadets or Apprentices)\u00a0from 2013 to 2017:<\/p><p>General Service Inductions<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Recruitment Allocation ONLY<\/th><th>Recruitment &amp;amp; PR expenditure <\/th><th>General Service Inductions<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>&euro;95,000.00<\/td><td>&euro;457,809.83<\/td><td>615<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>&euro;95,000.00<\/td><td>&euro;175,330.00<\/td><td>590<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>&euro;95,000.00<\/td><td>&euro;134,350.84<\/td><td>307<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>&euro;95,000.00<\/td><td>&euro;74,586.64<\/td><td>444<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>&euro;95,000.00<\/td><td>&euro;77,348.32<\/td><td>394<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Please note that the expenditure figure for each year includes recruitment costs as well as associated PR costs.<\/p><p>I can confirm that further recruitment will take place in 2018 and plans for this are currently under discussion between civil and military management.<\/p><p>I remain committed to maximising the recruitment of required personnel to ensure the Defence Forces retain the capacity to operate effectively across all roles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000060#WRC04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Remuneration","counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000060#WRC04350"},{"type":"question","counter":193,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[8267\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000060#WRC04400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the estimated cost of reversing the 2012 decision to reduce the wage of new recruits in the Defence Forces by 10%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1305","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":194,"content":"<p>There are various factors which would impact on calculating the estimated costings in the manner sought by the Deputy.

Service improvements, such as the introduction of the Online Passport Application Service that launched last year, will continue to make a major contribution to the effective management of these exceptionally high volumes.<\/p>  <p>  In all cases, applicants should not book travel until in possession of a valid passport and should allow plenty of time for a passport to issue in case any problems with the application arise in the course of processing.

It is therefore critical to the performance and reputation of the organisation that its staff operate to the highest standards. Sexual exploitation and abuse by UN staff, whose fundamental objective is to protect and care for innocent civilians, is absolutely unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  When attending the opening of the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly last September, I participated in the high-level meeting on the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse convened by the UN Secretary General, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres. I welcome Secretary General Guterres&rsquo; appointment of Jane Connors as the UN&rsquo;s first Victims&rsquo; Rights Advocate for victims of sexual exploitation and abuse. Ireland fully supports the placing of the rights and dignity of victims of sexual exploitation and abuse at the forefront of the UN&rsquo;s prevention and response efforts in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Secretary General Guterres has also revised UN policies on investigations and disciplinary processes, and strengthened protections for those who report harassment. The UN Secretary General has also launched a gender parity strategy which will address gender and power imbalances that lie at the root of harassment.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Guterres has also made clear that sexual exploitation and abuse is a problem of the entire United Nations and is not restricted to peacekeeping.  He has acknowledged that the majority of the cases of sexual exploitation and abuse are committed by the civilian organisations of the United Nations, and not in peacekeeping operations.<\/p>  <p>  In this respect Mr. Guterres has requested the UN&rsquo;s Agencies, Funds and Programmes, which carry out vital work in the field, to adopt new measures and strengthen existing ones to better prevent, detect, report and take action against personnel, who commit what he rightly describes as inexcusable and abhorrent acts. I recall that the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations provides that privileges and immunities are granted to officials and experts in the interests of the United Nations and not for the personal benefit of the individuals themselves. These privileges and immunities are rightly accorded to allow UN staff members to carry out their work in often difficult circumstances. The Secretary-General has &ldquo;the right and the duty to waive the immunity of any official [or expert] in any case where, in his opinion, the immunity would impede the course of justice and can be waived without prejudice to the interests of the United Nations. In the case of the Secretary-General, the Security Council shall have the right to waive immunity.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  Any case of exploitation or abuse, any case where the trust placed in the UN by all of us is broken, is one case too many. The UN can only meet its responsibilities as a force of good for our shared world if its staff and actions are beyond reproach. The UN must therefore have the systems and policies in place which provide transparency and accountability, and Ireland will continue to support the Secretary General as he implements such policies.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000061#WRD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Documents","counter":236,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000061#WRD02200"},{"type":"question","counter":237,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[8538\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000061#WRD02300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his Department is specifically preparing a paper or papers examining the impact of a hard, soft and WTO or cliff edge scenario Brexit on Ireland; if so, the date work on the papers commenced; the status of these papers; the expected publication date; his plans to make them available to the public; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1436","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":238,"content":"<p>As T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade with special responsibility for Brexit, I have responsibility for coordinating the whole-of-Government response to Brexit, which is being advanced through the cross-Departmental coordination structures chaired by my Department which bring together the results of the detailed work which is being undertaken by individual Departments.<\/p><p>Intensive work on a no-deal or worst-case outcome was initiated in the late autumn.

Crucially, there is a guarantee that a hard border, including any physical infrastructure and associated checks and controls, will be avoided, and there are commitments as to how this will be achieved.  Avoiding a hard border is described as an &ldquo;overarching requirement.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  In the event that it is not possible to resolve the border issue as part of a wider EU-UK future relationship agreement, which has always been and remains the Government&rsquo;s preference, or through specific solutions proposed by the British Government, there will be a firm back stop in the UK&rsquo;s commitment that it will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Customs Union and Single Market which support North South cooperation, the all-island economy and protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts. Moreover, such an arrangement must be compatible with the UK&rsquo;s guarantee of avoiding a hard border.<\/p>  <p>  These very strong political commitments and guarantees must now be reflected in the Withdrawal Agreement, which will be legally binding and must be agreed before the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU on 29 March 2019.  Detailed and intensive engagement between Irish officials and the Taskforce is now under way as the Taskforce prepares a first draft of the Withdrawal Agreement, which on approval by the Council (Article 50) will be the basis of negotiations with the UK.  <\/p>  <p>  This engagement includes work on elaborating the mechanisms to ensure implementation and oversight of the arrangements, as referred to in paragraph 51 of the Joint Progress Report.  Such mechanisms will need to be effective and workable.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, the additional negotiating Guidelines adopted by the European Council (Article 50) on 15 December make clear that negotiations in phase two can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken in the first phase of the negotiations are respected in full and translated into legal terms as quickly as possible through the elaboration of the formal Withdrawal Agreement, including with regard to the Irish-specific issues.<\/p>  <p>  I and my officials continue to set forward Ireland&rsquo;s position on these issues at EU level through the General Affairs Council (Art. 50) and the relevant preparatory bodies as well as through bilateral contacts with Michel Barnier and the EU Taskforce and EU27 counterparts.

Credit Servicing Firms are typically firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities. <\/p><p>Under the 2015 Act, if the firm who bought loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm, then the loans must be serviced by a &lsquo;<b>credit servicing firm&rsquo;<\/b>. Loans can be sold by regulated entities to entities that are not regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (the Central Bank).  <\/p><p>Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;. This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various Statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank.  <s><\/s><\/p><p>The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) is a key part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection framework.  It is a statutory Code first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013.  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms with each borrower by reference to that borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner by reference to that&rsquo;s borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances.<\/p><p>Regulated entities, including credit servicing firms servicing loans on behalf of unregulated loan owners, are all required to comply with the CCMA.  The overriding objective of the CCMA is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of consumers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears, and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  It sets out the MARP, a four-step process that regulated entities must follow:  <\/p><p>Step 1: Communicate with borrower;<\/p><p>Step 2: Gather financial information;<\/p><p>Step 3: Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and<\/p><p>Step 4: Propose a resolution<\/p><p>Each regulated entity must consider the borrower&rsquo;s situation in the context of the solutions they provide, which may differ from firm to firm.  The CCMA includes requirements that arrangements be sustainable and based on a full assessment of the individual circumstances of the borrower and that repossession be used only as a last resort.  The CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered.  A regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where the firm has made every reasonable effort under the CCMA to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower or his\/her nominated representative, and the specific timeframes set out in the CCMA have been adhered to or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000061#WRD03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Data","counter":250,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000061#WRD03800"},{"type":"question","counter":251,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[8065\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000061#WRD03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if an audit of the number of residential properties now in the ownership of a bank (details supplied) will be carried out by his Department; the plans the bank has to place those properties on the market to help ease the housing shortage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":252,"content":"<p>AIB had 690 Residential Properties held as Mortgagee In Possession at year end 2017.

Investment in tier 3 AHBs has a differentiated concentration limit dependent on the asset size of the credit union. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that it\u00a0views that these new regulations are effective and proportionate for credit unions and that\u00a0there is a need for credit unions to fully understand the risks associated with all investments, ensure that they are in line with the risk appetite of the credit union and comply with all legislative and regulatory requirements.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated that it will undertake and publish analysis of credit union sector investments, two years post commencement of the amending regulations to assess and analyse the actual impact which the changes to the investment framework have had.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000062#WRE03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Land Transfers","counter":290,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000062#WRE03200"},{"type":"question","counter":291,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[8162\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000062#WRE03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if changes to the age limits for family transfers are being considered to mitigate higher stamp duty costs (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":292,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that based on the information supplied the transfer of the farm may be eligible for a stamp duty relief known as &lsquo;consanguinity&rsquo; relief.  This relief applies a reduced rate of stamp duty of 1% to transfers of farmland between certain blood relatives provided certain conditions are met.  Since the enactment of the Finance Act 2017 on 25 December 2017, there is no age limit for consanguinity relief.

A further condition is that the person farming the land must devote at least 50% of his or her normal working time to farming or be the holder of one of the agricultural qualifications set out in Schedule 2, 2A or 2B to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act (SDCA) 1999.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Another stamp duty relief known as &lsquo;young trained farmer&rsquo; relief allows for full relief from stamp duty but imposes an age condition on the transferee.

<\/p>  <p>  - a sustained increase in public\u00a0investment to meet\u00a0infrastructural needs; <\/p>  <p>  - the establishment of four new Funds to target urban and rural renewal, climate action and &lsquo;disruptive technologies&rsquo;; and <\/p>  <p>  - the establishment of a new National Regeneration and Development Agency to help to drive growth and renewal in towns and cities across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Further details on all these aspects of the NDP can be found in the Plan itself. <\/p>  <p>  The NDP\u00a0includes many new projects which were not contained in the previous 2015 Capital Plan,\u00a0for example the M20 Cork to Limerick road, the New Hospital for Cork, BusConnects Programmes for Cork, Dublin and\u00a0Galway and a major investment programme across the cultural institutions. <\/p>  <p>  It is also very important to note that the NDP provides a coherent\u00a0long-term funding framework for the delivery of the projects and programmes\u00a0named in the Plan, including those previously identified in other sectoral strategies and policies but, in respect of which, funding for their delivery was not\u00a0previously identified.\u00a0 In the Public Investment Management Assessment carried out by the IMF, on my request, for Ireland last July, the IMF highlighted the existence of plans which were not\u00a0joined up on a cross-sectoral basis or with the resources to implement as a weakness in Ireland's\u00a0public management investment system.\u00a0 In the\u00a0NDP, therefore, Government\u00a0have made a commitment of specific resources to deliver identified investment priorities explicitly knitted into the NPF objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000063#WRF04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":358,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000064#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":359,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[8670\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000064#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of vacant habitable dwelling units and vacant derelict residential dwelling units in the ownership or part ownership of, or under the control of, both his Department and agencies under his remit;

The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of the changes\u00a0I negotiated together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the current starting salary of a new teacher\u00a0is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511, at a cost of over &euro;200 million across the public service.<\/p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010.  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million.

This letter includes a Grant Repayment Option Form which requests details of the preferred repayment option. <\/p>  <p>  If an individual applicant considers that she\/he has been unjustly refused a student grant,\u00a0or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one,\u00a0she\/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI.

These areas were all stable in terms of population growth, so no new school places were required.  However sufficient demand for more choice emerged in 28 areas, including in Tramore, New Ross, Trim, Tuam and Castlebar. <\/p>  <p>  In the majority of the 28 areas surveyed where sufficient demand emerged, the level of parental demand for a wider choice indicated a size of a four classroom school being required to accommodate such a level of demand.<\/p>  <p>  Under the patronage divesting process, a school could be opened where a school building became, or was due to become available as a result of an amalgamation\/closure of an existing school.  In some areas, in responding to demand for diversity where existing patrons were unable make school properties available, the Department also included an examination of properties held in public ownership.<\/p>  <p>  In order to facilitate the opening of these schools, their initial establishment, as with most new schools, has been in temporary start-up accommodation, pending a permanent school building being made available.  All schools, irrespective of their location, have to operate within their available accommodation and manage annual pupil intake accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  The initial establishment of these schools as four-classroom schools and the need to be cognisant of managing the available accommodation has been reflected in my Department&rsquo;s engagement with the patron body of the schools, Educate Together.  Indeed, a case has been submitted by Educate Together to my Department to further expand Tramore ETNS, New Ross ETNS, Trim ETNS, Tuam ETNS and Castlebar ETNS and this is currently under consideration.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently carrying out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to identify areas of demographic growth and determine where additional school accommodation is needed in order to plan for school provision nationwide and this work is almost complete.  In this context, the outcome of the nationwide demographic exercises will input into consideration of the case submitted by Educate Together. <\/p>  <p>  I have announced a new Patronage Reconfiguration process, which will accelerate the delivery of multi-denominational and non-denominational schools, to reach 400 live schools by 2030.  Unlike the previous process, this plan will focus on live transfers, so that a school which transfers under this process would not be reliant on temporary accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000065#WRH02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000065#WRH02100"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[8351\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000065#WRH02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to meet formally with his UK counterpart in the context of the impact of Brexit on education; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":426,"content":"<p>Consultation has been fundamental to my Department&rsquo;s preparations for Brexit.

This work is also informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement.  Separately, a new preparedness unit in the Commission is considering EU-level responses. <\/p>  <p>  All this work provides a baseline scenario for the policies and sectors impacted, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations.  In this regard, it is welcome that the direction of travel is now firmly towards achieving a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition period.\u00a0 Agreement on a &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; transition will provide certainty to individuals and businesses while also aiming to avoid any cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and a future relationship agreement coming into force.  The period will provide time for businesses and citizenship to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU based on the outcome of the negotiations on the framework for the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.  In this respect, the expectation is that the European Council will adopt additional Guidelines at its meeting on 22-23 March 2018 on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  These guidelines &ndash; as well as further clarity on the UK position, which has been sought by the European Council &ndash; will provide a clearer picture of the direction of travel in the negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s contingency planning framework is firmly grounded in the extensive work and outreach that has already been undertaken by individual Departments and agencies, as well as by stakeholder organisations, academics and others.\u00a0 My own Department contributed fully to the preparation of the education components of that framework. <\/p>  <p>  Our work has been facilitated by the International Unit of my Department which, under the leadership of an Assistant Secretary General, has been given overall responsibility for co-ordinating our response to Brexit.  In discharging its Brexit-related functions, the International Unit participates in the Inter-Departmental Senior Officials Group which oversees the coordination of the Government&rsquo;s response to the outcome of the UK referendum, and supports the Cabinet Committee on the European Union including Brexit.\u00a0 This is further underpinned by the Unit's active engagement with other Departments in Brexit Workgroups on Brexit Coordination; the Economy and Sectoral Issues; the Common Travel Area; and the Island of Ireland Working Group. <\/p>  <p>  The International Unit also chairs the Education and Research Subgroup under the Economy and Sectoral Issues strand of co-ordination.  The Subgroup includes relevant areas within the Department and relevant Agencies of the Department and other Departments\/Agencies.  Meetings of the Education and Research Subgroup of the Economy and Trade Group took place on 28th October 2016, 15th February; 24th May and 9th October 2017 and most recently focused on stakeholder consultations input and research collaboration.  A further meeting is planned for early 2018.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been working closely with a number of organisations, and in particular with the Higher Education Authority, in Brexit planning for the higher education sector.\u00a0 The HEA has published a Brexit issues paper and has held meetings with the HEIs to discuss ongoing planning and issues with them as the process develops.\u00a0 We will continue to engage in this important aspect of planning and research work, and during 2018 will maintain our extensive engagement with stakeholders across the sector, which has been fundamental to my Department&rsquo;s preparations for Brexit since late 2016.<\/p>  <p>  While Brexit presents numerous challenges, it is likely to bring opportunities too.

This &euro;1.5m is again available in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Action Plan for Education 2018 we will enhance our strategy to attract world-leading researchers to Ireland in the context of Brexit.  In partnership with enterprise\/employers, and in line with Innovation 2020 targets, we will increase the enrolment of postgraduate researchers and grow the number of programmes to support postdoctoral researchers.  In this way, we will grow a vibrant research community and address economic demands. <\/p>  <p>  The above themes\u00a0will be explored in\u00a0a paper currently being drafted between officials in my Department\u00a0and the Higher Education Authority who are leading on the paper. \u00a0The purpose of the paper is to outline the importance of Brexit for the Irish higher education research system.\u00a0 It will identify significant issues arising and will propose strategic actions with regard to talent, research and relationships to maximise competitive advantage for Ireland in this area post-Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  A further joint stakeholder dialogue on research and innovation with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation\u00a0is being planned for\u00a0the end of April 2018 in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  This follows on from the recent publication by the Royal Irish Academy of reports on All-Island aspects of Research that make recommendations to take forward initiatives to support all-island research collaborations and networking.<\/p>  <p>  We will continue to seek opportunities in existing and high potential markets to increase the numbers of international students and partnerships for our higher education sector as we implement the International Education Strategy.\u00a0 We will also seek to maximise the opportunities from North-South cooperation and our continuing key relationship with the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000067#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":496,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000067#WRK00800"},{"type":"question","counter":497,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[8730\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000067#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":" if provision will be made for an ASD unit and three additional classrooms further to his visit to a school (details supplied); if DEIS 2 status will be awarded.","asker":"1250","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":498,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the school referred to by the Deputy submitted an application to my Department for capital funding to construct an ASD Unit and additional resource teaching rooms. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the school does not have the approval of the National Council for Special Education to establish an ASD Unit as\u00a0there is sufficient provision for such special needs accommodation in the area currently.

If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511, at a cost of over &euro;200 million across the public service.<\/p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010. It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million.

Enhanced fencing and bike gates are examples of engineering measures taken to restrict access to parks.  <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to promote cross-agency engagement in relation to this important public safety issue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000067#WRK03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":526,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000067#WRK03800"},{"type":"question","counter":527,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[8167\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000067#WRK03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; stationed at Clondalkin, Lucan, Ronanstown, Ballyfermot and Rathcoole in January 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":528,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[8168\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000067#WRK04000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of community garda&iacute; stationed at Clondalkin, Lucan, Ronanstown, Ballyfermot and Rathcoole in January 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":529,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 227 and 228 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware the Garda Stations of Ballyfermot, Clondalkin, Lucan, Rathcoole and Ronanstown form part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West Division.  I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the DMR West Division on 31 December 2017, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 672 of which 64 are designated as Community Garda&iacute;.  There are also 26 Garda Reserves and 52 Garda civilian staff attached to the DMR West Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of whom 137 have been assigned to the DMR West Division.  19,18,14 and 9 of this cohort have been assigned to Clondalkin, Ronanstown, Ballyfermot and Lucan Garda Stations respectively.  I am informed that Rathcoole Garda Station is not a training station therefore new probationer Garda&iacute; are not allocated to it.  However, it is important to note that the allocation of probationer Garda&iacute; to a Divisional training station facilitates the reassignment of Garda&iacute; to other stations within the Division, if required, by the Divisional Officer.<\/p><p>I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College.  Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the DMR West Division.<\/p><p>In relation to the number of &quot;Community Garda&iacute; &quot; it is important to recognise that community policing is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.  The official categorisation as a &quot;Community Garda&iacute;&quot; simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities including through the giving of talks to schools, community groups and others.  It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.<\/p><p>I am assured by the Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Overall the Model advocates a partnership based, pro-active, community-orientated style of policing.  It is focused on crime prevention, problem-solving and law enforcement, with a view to building trust and enhancing the quality of life of the entire community. Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies. <\/p><p>As part of the Community Policing Model An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work in partnership with local communities, to prevent and deter crime through initiatives such as Neighbourhood Watch, Community Alert, Text Alert and the Garda Schools Programme as well as through more formal structures such as Joint Policing Committees.<\/p><p>The Community Policing Model also places a strong emphasis on Crime Prevention and within each Garda Division, where there are specialist Crime Prevention Officers (CPOs), who are trained to encourage, promote and advise on crime prevention within communities.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Engagement Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network. <\/p><p>I have previously stated that I welcome the strong emphasis that the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District.  In terms of progress on this important initiative, I am informed that a draft Community Policing Framework which outlines the manner in which Community Policing Teams will be established has been completed and is subject to internal review before being approved by the Garda Executive for implementation.<\/p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information I have set out in tabular form the total number of Garda&iacute; and the number of Garda&iacute; categorised as Community Garda&iacute; attached to Ballyfermot, Clondalkin, Lucan, Rathcoole and Ronanstown Garda stations as of 31 December in each of the years 2014 -2017 the latest date for which figures are readily available.<table><tr><th>Ballyfermot Garda Station<\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Community Garda&iacute;<\/td><td>Garda&iacute;<\/td><td>Total<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>76<\/td><td>85<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>79<\/td><td>86<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>81<\/td><td>85<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>76<\/td><td>83<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Clondalkin  Garda Station <\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Community Garda&iacute;<\/td><td>Garda&iacute;<\/td><td>Total<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>82<\/td><td>89<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>79<\/td><td>87<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>87<\/td><td>94<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>90<\/td><td>97<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Lucan  Garda Station <\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Community Garda&iacute;<\/td><td>Garda&iacute;<\/td><td>Total<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>68<\/td><td>74<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>67<\/td><td>73<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>68<\/td><td>74<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>64<\/td><td>70<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Rathcoole Garda Station<\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Community Garda&iacute;<\/td><td>Garda&iacute;<\/td><td>Total<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>23<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>21<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>19<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Ronanstown  Garda Station<\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Community Garda&iacute;<\/td><td>Garda&iacute;<\/td><td>Total<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>85<\/td><td>91<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>84<\/td><td>94<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>84<\/td><td>91<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>78<\/td><td>87<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000067#WRK04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":531,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[8195\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000067#WRK04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of vacant positions within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the Dublin metropolitan region; when it is expected these vacancies will be filled; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":532,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>I am advised that local Garda management  are making every effort to deal with problems arising in the Ballymun area and that a number of measures have been put in place, including additional high-visibility patrols, support from the public order unit and operations by the local drug unit and these will continue into the future.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of Ballymun Garda Station on 31 December 2017, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 113 of which 8 are designated as Community Garda. There are also 7 Garda Reserves and 8 Garda civilian staff attached to the Ballymun Garda Station. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  <\/p><p>In addition, at the request of the Commissioner in 2016, the Government moved decisively to strengthen Garda resources to deal with gang-related crime in the Dublin area.  Funding was approved for the establishment of a dedicated Armed Support Unit (ASU) for the DMR in order to enhance armed support capability in Dublin and to free up the resources of the Emergency Response Unit.  Following a selection and training process, the ASU for the DMR became fully operational in December 2016 and is providing armed cover in the DMR on a 24 hour basis. Members of the ASU are highly trained and equipped with a variety of non-lethal and lethal weapons and perform high visibility armed checkpoints and patrols throughout the DMR Divisions including the DMR North. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 29 have been assigned to Ballymun Garda Station. I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division. <\/p><p>In relation to the number of &quot;Community Garda&iacute; &quot; it is important to recognise that community policing is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official categorisation as a &ldquo;Community Garda&quot; simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities including through the giving of talks to schools, community groups and others. It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.<\/p><p>I am assured by the Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs. Overall the Model advocates a partnership based, pro-active, community-orientated style of policing. It is focused on crime prevention, problem-solving and law enforcement, with a view to building trust and enhancing the quality of life of the entire community. Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies. <\/p><p>As part of the Community Policing Model An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work in partnership with local communities, to prevent and deter crime through initiatives such as Neighbourhood Watch, Community Alert, Text Alert and the Garda Schools Programme as well as through more formal structures such as Joint Policing Committees.<\/p><p>The Community Policing Model also places a strong emphasis on Crime Prevention and within each Garda Division, where there are specialist Crime Prevention Officers (CPOs), who are trained to encourage, promote and advise on crime prevention within communities. <\/p><p>In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Engagement Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network. <\/p><p>I have previously stated that I welcome the strong emphasis that the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District.  In terms of progress on this important initiative, I am informed that a draft Community Policing Framework which outlines the manner in which Community Policing Teams will be established has been completed and is subject to internal review before being approved by the Garda Executive for implementation.<\/p><p>For the Deputy's information, I have provided in tabular form, in the following document, the total strength and Community Garda&iacute; strength of Ballymun Garda Station as of 31 December 2008 to 31 December 2017 the latest date for which figures are readily available, as provided by the Commissioner.<table><tr><th>Ballymun Garda Station<\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Community Garda&iacute;<\/td><td>Garda&iacute;<\/td><td>Total<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>102<\/td><td>112<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>120<\/td><td>130<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>113<\/td><td>128<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>98<\/td><td>113<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>106<\/td><td>118<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>108<\/td><td>118<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>106<\/td><td>114<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>118<\/td><td>124<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>111<\/td><td>117<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>105<\/td><td>113<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000068#WRL02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commissions of Investigation","counter":556,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000068#WRL02100"},{"type":"question","counter":557,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[8319\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000068#WRL02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when he plans to begin the process of a commission of investigation to examine the handling of the investigation of a person details supplied).","asker":"1287","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":558,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[8747\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000068#WRL02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the establishment a commission of inquiry into the allegations against a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":559,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238 and 253 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to establishing the facts in this case and accordingly decided in May 2017 to establish a Commission of Investigation.\u00a0 The advice of the then Attorney General was that there would be severe delays if the Commission were to be established at that time while legal matters were outstanding, including ongoing investigations into further offences, and a concern that evidence, adduced at a Commission or required to be disclosed to potential witnesses\u00a0under the Commissions of Investigation Act\u00a02004 may impact upon future prosecutions.

The plan which is underway through the vehicle of the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 includes a commitment to achieving a medium term target of 20% civilians by 2021, in effect a doubling of civilian staff to 4,000 over the term of the programme. This is to be achieved through twin policies of \"civilian by default\" and redeployment. \"Civilian by default\" refers to the filling of new posts other than operational policing posts and non-operational policing posts that become vacant by civilian staff unless policing expertise is required.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the redeployment policy this is informed by Garda Inspectorate's \"Changing Policing in Ireland\" report which estimated that approximately 1,500 Garda&iacute; may be suitable for re-deployment. The Government&rsquo;s plan aims to return as many of these Garda&iacute; as possible to front-line duties over the next five years. <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently working on the development of a redeployment plan in respect of the 1,500 target and has identified a target of approximately 160 for redeployment in the first part of 2018. However, in relation to redeploying Garda&iacute;, I would emphasise that this is not something that can be done overnight. It is important that this is done fairly and that it takes account of individual circumstances including the length of time that a Garda has been away from the front-line and the reasons behind it. Some Garda&iacute; may, for example, be on light duties following an injury in the course of their work while others may have been assigned to administrative duties early in their policing careers and may need refresher training to support their transition to front-line duties. Garda management is working to develop a model that will take account of these issues. <\/p>  <p>  It is important that these issues are bottomed out at this stage as this will, I believe, facilitate more Garda&iacute; being deployed to frontline policing duties in the medium to longer term. It will be a major change for the organisation and it is important that it is well-managed so that members and civilian staff embrace it rather than resist it. This will assist in ensuring the development of a culture of sworn members and civilians working together seamlessly each making a valuable contribution to the delivery of effective policing services. <\/p>  <p>  I will be meeting the Garda Commissioner in the coming days with regard to progress on the reform plan and I will be stressing the importance of, and the need to accelerate, civilianisation including redeployment during 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Civilianisation including redeployment will not happen overnight but as I have made clear, the implementation of the ambitious reform programme, including civilianisation, must continue and, indeed, must move at a greater pace, to ensure the best possible policing services to the people of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000068#WRL03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Law Cases","counter":569,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000068#WRL03400"},{"type":"question","counter":570,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[8427\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000068#WRL03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when a case (details supplied) will be heard; and the protocol and timeframe for hearing ceases in which family disputes and welfare issues are raised.","asker":"1231","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":571,"content":"<p>As the Deputy\u00a0will be aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that Sundrive Road and Terenure Garda Stations are located in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) South Division. I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the DMR South Division on 31 December 2017 was 532. There are also 20 Garda Reserves and 36 Garda civilian staff attached to the DMR South Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the Armed Support Units, National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 118 have been assigned to the DMR South Division with 16 and 14 assigned to Sundrive Road and Terenure Garda Stations respectively. I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.<\/p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.<\/p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the DMR South Division.<\/p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information I have set out in tabular form the strength by rank of Terenure and Sundrive Road Garda stations as provided by the Commissioner, in each of the years 2007-2017.<table><tr><th>TERENURE GARDA STATION STRENGTH 2007-2017<\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>SUPT<\/td><td>INSP<\/td><td>SGT<\/td><td>GDA<\/td><td>TOTAL<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>68<\/td><td>77<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>62<\/td><td>79<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>70<\/td><td>86<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>74<\/td><td>91<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>78<\/td><td>96<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>79<\/td><td>98<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>78<\/td><td>99<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>82<\/td><td>105<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>86<\/td><td>106<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>85<\/td><td>108<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>76<\/td><td>101<\/td><\/tr><\/table><table><tr><th>SUNDRIVE ROAD STRENGTH 2007-2017<\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>SGT<\/td><td>GDA<\/td><td>Total<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>59<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>62<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>57<\/td><td>64<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>62<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>57<\/td><td>66<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>57<\/td><td>67<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>60<\/td><td>71<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>66<\/td><td>77<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>70<\/td><td>79<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>70<\/td><td>81<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>67<\/td><td>78<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000069#WRM00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Judgments","counter":589,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000069#WRM00700"},{"type":"question","counter":590,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[8610\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000069#WRM00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of cases of compensation for personal injury that have been struck out of court in the past five years due to the case being deemed fraudulent; the number of these cases subsequently referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation; the number of persons convicted of insurance fraud in each of the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":591,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions, which include the provision of information on the courts system.<\/p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that\u00a0statistics are not compiled in such a way as to provide the information requested by the Deputy.

It could have responded narrowly to this judgment by setting a temporal limit. Instead it decided to opt-in to the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive bringing Ireland into line with our EU partners and place the entire system on a legislative basis, which will be subject to EU oversight. This is a significant and important reform, not only in addressing the issue of labour market access but also extending to children&rsquo;s rights, rights for unaccompanied minors, vulnerable people, new appeals processes, healthcare and education provision.<\/p>  <p>  During the course of the debate in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice &amp;amp; Equality, and in both the Seanad and the D&aacute;il, I outlined the proposal and rationale for opting into the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive under the terms of Protocol 21, annexed to the EU Treaties.  I also outlined the compliance process involved with the EU Commission which they require, and which will take four months to complete.<\/p>  <p>  Because of this timeframe, it was necessary to address the situation that will exist from the 9th February until the opt-in process is completed.  During this interim period, those seeking international protection will have access to the labour market through the existing employment permit regime in the same manner as other Third County nationals. In addition to accessing the employment permits regime, the Government decided to offer early certainty to those seeking self-employment from February 9th and prior to any confirmation of our opt-in. In this regard, I used my executive power to provide an additional access for qualified applicants to engage in self-employment on terms that can be mirrored in a permanent scheme once the process of compliance with the Directive is completed with the EU Commission.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the interim arrangements, which removed the temporal limit of access to the workplace, is in keeping with the decision of the Supreme Court. My colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation has responsibility for the employment permits regime including the criteria, terms and applicable fees. I understand that generally, any fees accompanying such access are usually paid by the employer.<\/p>  <p>  I would stress that the interim scheme is designed to be of very short duration until the opt-in process is completed. Once this happens, access to the labour market will be underpinned by EU law. I expect that this permanent scheme will provide for a broader access to the labour market for qualified applicants &ndash; the details of which will be worked out and announced in the coming months taking all factors into account.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that this progressive approach by Government, which for the first time will see many elements of our protection process subject to EU law and verification by the EU Commission, will be a further major effective and reforming step as we seek to improve the standards of our reception conditions for those seeking international protection in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000069#WRM01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Registration","counter":595,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000069#WRM01300"},{"type":"question","counter":596,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[8639\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000069#WRM01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he has received representations to facilitate infrastructure projects such as aviation fuel pipelines by changing property ownership legislation relating to cases in which some property owners have their lands registered to the centre of the road; his plans to amend existing legislation in this context; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":597,"content":"<p>I note that the question raised by the Deputy relates to policy issues\u00a0regarding property registration and as such responsibility for this matter\u00a0does not fall under\u00a0the\u00a0aegis of my Department.

Also in 2017, the WRC issued 122 compliance notices requiring rectification of breaches detected under certain employment rights.  This included, where appropriate, the payment of any unpaid or underpaid annual leave\/public holiday entitlements. In that context, I am satisfied that the current enforcement regime of employment rights legislation being pursued by the WRC is working well.<\/p>  <p>  As the deputy will be aware, the WRC was established on 1 October 2015 under the Workplace Relations Act 2015. Inspectors of the WRC carry out inspections of employer records with a view to determining compliance with employment rights legislation. These inspections arise: <\/p>  <p>  -  in response to complaints received of alleged non-compliance with relevant employment rights legislation; <\/p>  <p>  -  as part of compliance campaigns which focus on compliance in specific sectors or specific pieces of legislation, or <\/p>  <p>  -  as routine inspections, which act as a control measure.<\/p>  <p>  In the first instance the WRC makes every effort, through the conduct of information and awareness campaigns, to secure voluntary compliance with employment law. Where this constructive and proactive approach does not work and employers either refuse or fail to rectify the breaches identified and\/or pay money due to their employees, the WRC will progress these cases through the prosecution route.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issues raised, the deputy will be aware that the WRC is an independent, statutory body. Therefore, it conducts its functions independently, having regard to applicable law, as to how best to achieve effective compliance with employment rights legislation. This includes such remedial activities as the restitution of unpaid wages by non-compliant employers. Where an employer does not make good the wages owed the WRC initiates criminal proceedings in the District Court.<\/p>  <p>  As regards workers&rsquo; annual leave and public holiday entitlements, under Section 28 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015, WRC inspectors are empowered to issue a Compliance Notice to employers found in breach of annual leave\/public holiday entitlements.

Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and EEA, an employment permit may be sought by an employer to hire a non-EEA national. As the State approaches full employment, labour as well as skills needs are beginning to manifest and as a consequence, consideration of the State's approach to the accessibility of the employment permit regime for lower skilled workers in certain sectors and occupations is appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  Economic migration alone is not a sustainable long-term solution to skills and labour shortages and indeed can, in some circumstances, help to perpetuate those shortages in the economy.  The development of particular skills in the resident labour force can depend upon a judicious deployment of economic migration as a supplementary rather than a primary source of those skills, and adjustments must be made with this in mind.<\/p>  <p>  While there is some anecdotal evidence of a tightening labour market in some sectors, the fact remains that there are 238,000 on the live register, and with a potential pool of 18 million unemployed in the EU 28. Thus my Department needs to be prudent in considering whether to open up the labour market to unskilled non-EEA workers on wage levels at or just above the national minimum wage. <\/p>  <p>  In this context, I have asked my officials to undertake a review of the economic migration policies which underpin the current employment permits system, to ensure it is fully supportive of Ireland&rsquo;s emerging labour market needs, be they skills or labour shortages in certain sectors.<\/p>  <p>  An Inter-Departmental Group has been established to inform the review and it is made up of relevant State Departments, including Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform; Justice and Equality; Housing Planning and Local Government; Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Health; Transport, Tourism and Sport; Education and Skills; Employment Affairs and Social Protection. . <\/p>  <p>  The review process will also include a public consultation, with feedback sought from relevant stakeholders and interest groups.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service. However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner. The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. <\/p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively. This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010. The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. <\/p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN.<\/p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017. This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.<\/p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster. No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.<\/p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer automatically receive this item under the community drugs schemes. In August 2017, the HSE advised GPs and pharmacies of the changes and of treatment alternatives. <\/p><p>It is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community drug schemes. The patient's GP should apply to the Medicines Management Programme through the online system, and the MMP will review the application and inform the GP of its decision. <\/p><p>I am advised that the MMP has received over 4,500 applications from GPs, of which some 10% have been approved.  For many of the conditions applied for, prescribing of the patch was inappropriate, for example for conditions such as deep venous thrombosis, angina, gout and endometriosis.<\/p><p>Where a GP&rsquo;s application is rejected, it may be appealed.  The HSE advises that over 50% have been accepted on clinical grounds.<\/p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service. However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. <\/p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. <\/p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN. <\/p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce annual expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.<\/p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.<\/p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer automatically receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  In August 2017, the HSE advised GPs and pharmacies of the changes and of treatment alternatives. <\/p><p>It is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community drug schemes.  The patient's GP should apply to the Medicines Management Programme through the online system, and the MMP will review the application and inform the GP of its decision. <\/p><p>I am advised that the MMP has received over 4,500 applications from GPs, of which some 10% have been approved.  For many of the conditions applied for, prescribing of the patch was inappropriate, for example, for conditions such as deep venous thrombosis, angina, gout and endometriosis.<\/p><p>Where a GP&rsquo;s application is rejected, it may be appealed.  Of appeals to date, the HSE advises that over 50% have been accepted on clinical grounds.<\/p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.

These guidelines were devised by experts in transgender healthcare, along with members of the International Transgender, Transsexual and LGBT community. <\/p>  <p>  A proposed model of care for transgender children, adolescents and adults was submitted by the HSE Quality Improvement Division to the HSE Divisions of Primary Care, Mental Health and Acute Hospital programme. The model was developed in consultation with key treating clinicians, planners, policy makers, advocates and service users. <\/p>  <p>  The guidelines recommend a comprehensive multidisciplinary psychosocial assessment prior to commencement of hormone therapy by endocrinology services. The assessment focuses on more than just assessment for the possible diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria. The guidelines highlight several criteria which must be met prior to referral for hormonal intervention. It is important that co-morbid conditions are identified and addressed, and that people access the supports that they need to manage co-morbid difficulties, which can impact on response to medical transition (including hormone treatment). <\/p>  <p>  International best practice involves an assessment by a multi-disciplinary team and shared decision making in the best interests of the individual. Both WPATH and the Endocrine Society Guidelines 2017 specify the assessment must be carried out by a mental health professional (s) with experience in transgender healthcare and possess specific skills. Endocrinologists and General Practitioners (GPs) do not possess these skills, and require access to the multidisciplinary team as described. GPs would only see a small number of gender variant individuals during their lifetime in clinical practice, and would not be in a position to build up the requisite skillset outlined in WPATH and Endocrine Society Guidelines or have the time resource to conduct a comprehensive evaluation. <\/p>  <p>  Informed consent is essential, whereby benefits and risks of hormone treatment and surgery are discussed with individuals seeking these interventions. Although regret rates are low, it can happen and can also lead to high levels of psychological distress. Healthcare providers work with people to try to prevent negative outcomes. The emerging evidence on good outcomes following medical and\/or surgical transitioning is based on use of multi-disciplinary psychosocial assessment, fulfilment of criteria for hormones and on-going psychological support throughout the process. It is important that psychological support is available to individuals before, during and after transitioning. <\/p>  <p>  Prescription of hormone blockers and cross-sex hormones for transgender people is relatively new. Significant side effects can occur with cross sex hormones including irreversible physical changes and infertility. There is a lack of long-term research on outcomes. For these reasons the decision to prescribe should only be made by specialists (i.e. Endocrinologists) in consultation with other professionals involved in the assessment process. Shared decision-making is in accordance with best practice internationally.  Prescriptions can then be supported by local GPs with specialist guidance. <\/p>  <p>  The Best Practice approach as outlined above is endorsed in the Service Development Model as developed by the Quality Improvement Division of the HSE in 2017, in collaboration with TENI. This model is providing the framework for the development of National Gender Clinics and MDTs for children and adults, funded by the Acute Hospitals and Mental Health Divisions of the HSE.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement - was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017.  <\/p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.  <\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles.  <\/p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN.  <\/p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. <\/p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.  <\/p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer automatically receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  In August 2017, the HSE advised GPs and pharmacies of the changes and of treatment alternatives.  <\/p><p>It is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community drug schemes.  The patient's GP should apply to the Medicines Management Programme through the online system, and the MMP will review the application and inform the GP of its decision.  <\/p><p>I am advised that the MMP has received over 4,700 applications from GPs, of which some 14% have been approved.  For many of the conditions applied for, prescribing of the patch was inappropriate, for example for conditions such as deep venous thrombosis, angina, gout and endometriosis.  <\/p><p>Where a GP&rsquo;s application is rejected, it may be appealed.  The HSE advises that over 60% have been accepted on clinical grounds.  <\/p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at <i><\/i>.  <\/p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.  However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000076#WRS03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":928,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000076#WRS03200"},{"type":"question","counter":929,"qnumday":372,"qnumall":"[8522\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000076#WRS03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the level of funding provided in 2017 and the level of expenditure by the end of December 2017 in relation to the provision of a service (details supplied); the level of funding provided in 2018 for this service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The OPAP recommended that a code of practice for food and beverages promotion, marketing and sponsorship be developed, implemented and evaluated in conjunction with the food indsutry, HSE, Dept of Children and Youth Affairs, safefood, Food Safety Authority of Ireland and advertiser organisations. The OPAP premised this recommendation by providing that 'already there are many examples of the food industry making positive contirubtions to the prevention of obesity and it is essential to capitalise and expand on such initiatives'.<\/p><p>The group that developed the Codes involved representatives from the food industry, advertising sector, statutory agencies, and various Government Departments. It was chaired by the former CEO of the statutory Food Safety Authoirty of Ireland.<\/p><p>The Codes of Practice are one of the suite of actions set out in the OPAP in the knowledge that no single sector or agency, or no single action, is able to solve this issue on their own. Everyone and every sector has a role to play in those solutions.<\/p><p>Section 10 of the Codes of Practice provides for a governance framework for these codes. It stipulates that monitoring for compliance and effectiveness encompasses:<\/p><p>1. Compliance of the food industry with the rules in the Codes governing the various media and<\/p><p>2. the efficacy of the Codes of Practice with respect to achieving their objectives of ensuring that:<\/p><p>- So-called High Fat Sugar and Salt (HFSS) foods are marketed in a responsible way<\/p><p>- children are not exposed to inappropriate marketing, advertising or sponsorship associated with these kinds of food and drink products<\/p><p>- healthier food choices are actively promoted.<\/p><p>Section 10 of the Codes on governance also provides that:<\/p><p>'The monitoring body will be free to decide on its operational methods. However the body will have access to and review relevant data from all companies and partner organisations.'<\/p><p>It elaborates further on what monitoring for compliance and effectiveness shall involve. It provides that monitoring will include:<\/p><p>a. 'Independent research\/monitoring across all of the areas governed by these Codes to assess adherence, and<\/p><p>b. Investigating and dealing with complaints.'<\/p><p>Furthermore, the Codes provide that:<\/p><p>'The monitoring body shall commission research that will inform it of the effectiveness of these Codes in achieving their stated aims and objectives.'<\/p><p>The food industry and relevant sectors have agreed to the implementation of these Codes. The Codes were only launched last week and so it is too early to be specific about the other queries raised by the Deputy pending the establishment of the monitoring body and the development of guidelines for the implementation of the Codes during 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000078#WRU01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Respite Care Services","counter":1000,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000078#WRU01600"},{"type":"question","counter":1001,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[8632\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000078#WRU01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding persons who avail of respite care and long-term care in a hospital (details supplied) and who reside far from the hospital and whose family doctor is expected to visit them during respite care and long-term care; and if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many persons have been advised prior to being admitted to hospital that if they cannot guarantee their general practitioners will attend to them if required during their stay they could lose their booking for respite care.","asker":"1278","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1002,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000078#WRU01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":1003,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000078#WRU01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1004,"qnumday":399,"qnumall":"[8633\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000078#WRU02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position of a person (details supplied) on the waiting list for two rehabilitation units; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1005,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

In 2017 Ireland imported approximately 3.47 million tonnes of animal feed materials. In addition, approximately 2.1 million tonnes of home-grown cereals is used in the production of animal feed , bringing the total usage of feed materials to about 5.6 million tonnes annually. With our grass based livestock production system, with limited tillage area, Ireland is especially dependent on feed imports relative to other EU Member States. <\/p>  <p>  Almost\u00a01.7 million tonnes of soya and maize genetically modified (GM) products were imported into Ireland for inclusion in animal feeds in 2017, constituting approximately 50% of total feed imports. The main commodities imported are maize and maize by-products, soyabean meal and soya hulls and rapeseed meal. Up to 90% of the soyabean and maize products are imported from Argentina, Brazil and the USA. Significant quantities of non-GM maize and oilseed rape meal are  imported from continental Europe, including the Ukraine.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Due to our high proportion of livestock production compared to tillage area, Ireland is especially dependent on feed imports relative to other EU Member States. Approximately two thirds of the feed materials marketed here are imported, compared to 37% in the UK, 27% in France, and 26% in Germany. The pig, poultry and dairy sectors are particularly dependent on imports of GM soybean and GM maize by-products as they are essential ingredients in the formulation of these feed rations. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The EU is only 35% self-sufficient in high-protein supplement supplies for animal feed. Soybean is the most favoured vegetable protein because of its nutritional efficacy and competitive cost. A significant quantity of soybean and maize from North and South America is essential therefore to satisfy the protein requirements in animal nutrition within the EU. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland supports increased domestic production of protein crops. The national coupled protein support payment is evidence of that. \u00a0Production of these crops in Ireland has been traditionally low. However, since the introduction of the coupled protein payment in 2015, the area of protein crops, mainly beans, has increased from an average of 4,000 ha to over 13,000 ha. The production of pulse crops such as peas and beans also contribute several environmental benefits by fixing nitrogen and adding to diversity in crop rotations.<\/p>  <p>  Supporting the tillage sector through encouraging the production of protein crops is an important strategic objective of this Department. It is also important however, given our dependence on imported protein for animal nutrition, that access to imports of competitively priced protein from existing sources is maintained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000080#WRW00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Grants","counter":1077,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000080#WRW00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1078,"qnumday":425,"qnumall":"[8224\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000080#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason payment to a person (details supplied) was stopped after 15 years; and if a forestry payment can continue for 20 years.","asker":"1271","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1079,"content":"<p>The person named inherited a grant-aided plantation from a relative in 2006.

The necessary regulatory steps have been put in place to give effect to this measure. <\/p><p>It\u00a0is worth noting that this measure is not &lsquo;new&rsquo; for about half of kerbside household waste customers, who are already on an incentivised usage pricing plan, i.e., a plan which contains a per lift or weight related fee. <\/p><p>As announced in mid-2017, mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging is not being introduced. Allowing for a range of charging options, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste, provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. Consequently, a pure kilogramme charge for waste collection may not be selected by some households. Instead, some households may use a &lsquo;per lift&rsquo; type charge or a &lsquo;weight allowance&rsquo; collection service. \u00a0<\/p><p>An annual support of &euro;75 per person will be introduced as soon as possible this year and made available for persons with lifelong or long-term medical incontinence.

I have asked that the eCars team contact the Deputy directly in relation to the charge points highlighted.<\/p>  <p>  A map showing all public charge points in Ireland, including the status and availability of the charge points, is available on the ESB&rsquo;s website at www.esb.ie\/ecars. There is also the &lsquo;ecar connect&rsquo; app enables users to locate charge points in Ireland, locate the nearest charge point and to help them to plan their route using the installed infrastructure around the country.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2014, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities approved an application from ESB Networks to recover the costs of a pilot project to a maximum of &euro;25 million from use of system charges to cover the rollout of this infrastructure. Following a public consultation process, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities published its independent regulatory decision in relation to the ownership of this infrastructure in October 2017. A key outcome of the decision is that the charging network should not form part of the regulated asset base and therefore expansions of the network should not be funded from network charges. This is in keeping with the proposals set out by the European Commission in the Clean Energy for All Europeans package which was published in 2016. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities also envisages the future sale of the infrastructure by ESB Networks. However, the continued ownership of the charging network by ESB Networks for a transitional period of up to ten years is provided for. This ensures no short to medium term impact on the electric vehicle charging infrastructure and allows the ESB to continue to provide electric vehicle charging across Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The decision also set out the need for the electric vehicle charging infrastructure to operate on a commercial basis. In the absence of State-led support, this is unlikely to happen in the near term.\u00a0 Funding has been allocated in my Department's budget this year to support the provision of public charging, with a particular focus on increasing the number of rapid chargers on key national routes.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Low Emissions Vehicle Taskforce, which is co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is considering a range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate the deployment of electric vehicles.

In accordance with section 59(1) of the Waste Management Act, 1996, each local authority is responsible generally for the supervision and the enforcement of the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the holding, recovery and disposal of waste within its functional area.  Local authorities have specific powers under sections 55 and 56 of the Act to require measures to be taken, or to take measures directly, to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused or likely to be caused by the holding, recovery or disposal of waste, and to mitigate or remedy the effects on the environment of any such activity.<\/p>  <p>  Any incidents of illegal waste activity should be reported to the local authority, who have significant powers available to them to deal with the waste.\u00a0 However, placing a duty on the authorities to remove all waste from private land could encourage illegal dumping rather than tackle the problem.

The 2017 Anti-Dumping Initiative saw funding of &euro;1.26 million provided by my Department which supported 229 projects.  These included clean-ups of private lands where it was apparent to the local authority that the landowners were not complicit in waste being dumped there. \u00a0This year, I am increasing the allocation to &euro;2 million to build on the momentum that has now been created and to provide for an increased focus on identifying and prosecuting illegal dumpers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000083#WRZ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Policy","counter":1222,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000083#WRZ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1223,"qnumday":478,"qnumall":"[8618\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000083#WRZ01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if his Department is considering carrying out an overall assessment of the environmental impacts of importing LNG gas; if so, the details of the consultation process; and the mechanisms that members of the public can utilise to appeal such a process.","asker":"1294","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1224,"content":"<p>Natural Gas is an important transition fuel on the pathway to decarbonisation and has the potential to play an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the power generation, industrial and commercial, residential and transport sectors by replacing more\u00a0CO2-intensive fossil fuels.\u00a0 Dispatchable power generation is also an important back-up for intermittent renewable generation, for example, as a back-up for wind power generation, when the wind is not blowing.

Under the Waste Management (Shipments of Waste) Regulations 2007, Dublin City Council was designated as the National Competent Authority for all waste exports and imports and the National Transfrontier Waste Shipment Office (NTFSO) was established under the auspices of Dublin City Council.  The primary aim of the Regulations is to prevent the illegal shipment of waste abroad, and to assist businesses engaged in legitimate waste export activities.<\/p>  <p>  The NTFSO imposes charges on its customers with the aim of fully recouping costs incurred in the performance of its duties as competent authority for the purposes of the Waste Shipments Regulations.  In March 2008, the then Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government made a payment of &euro;500,000 to Dublin City Council as a contribution towards the fit-out costs of the NTFSO, which had been established in July 2007.  The NTFSO also received payments from the Department in 2009 of &euro;560,000 and 2010 of &euro;600,000 to assist with refund payments in cases where notified shipments were cancelled or where the volumes of waste shipped were less than the notified amount due to the downturn in the economy.  The European Waste Shipments Regulation allows competent authorities to apply charges to waste notifiers in respect of the administrative costs of implementing the notification and supervision procedures and the NTFSO is now recouping its costs in full with no subvention from my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Since April 2012, the NTFSO has implemented a fee in respect of minor infringements of the Waste Shipments Regulations, such as incomplete documentation as an enforcement tool.  This was introduced following consultation with the Irish Waste Management Association. \u00a0The NTFSO&rsquo;s Monitoring &amp;amp; Repatriation Fee Policy details specific incidents when these fees should be applied.  A monitoring fee of &euro;350 is applied in respect of the cost of investigating cases where a breach of the regulations occurred but no prosecution was taken.  It should be noted that the NTFSO reserves the right to take legal action if it is warranted in certain circumstances, such as for repeated breaches of the Regulations or in relation to non-compliance with directions issued, and since 2009, the NTFSO has taken 31 successful prosecutions under the Waste Shipment Regulations with &euro;59,000 in fines being imposed together with &euro;92,791 in costs being awarded. <\/p>  <p>  As the competent authority for Ireland, Dublin City Council is responsible for implementing an enforcement regime and applying penalties for non-compliance with the Waste Shipments Regulations.  An enforcement team has been put in place for this purpose and to carry out joint inspections with various national and international organisations.  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive is responsible for staffing and organisation arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister, I am precluded under Section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996 from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance, in specific cases, by a local authority of their statutory functions under the Act.  Notwithstanding, my Department is satisfied as to the efficiency\u00a0of the TFS office operations and given past incidents concerning unauthorised movements of waste across the border, it is entirely appropriate that a robust system of checks and proportionate enforcement is deployed as deemed necessary by the TFS office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000083#WRZ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Television Licences Data","counter":1235,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000083#WRZ03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1236,"qnumday":485,"qnumall":"[8697\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000083#WRZ03500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of television licence inspectors employed by An Post in 2017 and 2018.","asker":"1327","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1237,"content":"<p>The information requested is an operational matter for the Board and management of An Post and not one in which I, as Minister, have a statutory function.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000083#WRZ03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1239,"qnumday":486,"qnumall":"[8698\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000083#WRZ03800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of prosecutions and convictions for the non-payment of a television licence in each of the years 2012 to 2017.","asker":"1327","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1240,"content":"<p>Under the Broadcasting Act, 2009, An Post is\u00a0the designated agent,\u00a0acting on behalf of the Minister, for the collection of the Television Licence fee.

With the Green Line now extended to Broombridge, and providing interchange with the Red Line and greater connectivity to rail services, those numbers are likely to grow substantially again in 2018.\u00a0 While it is welcomed that so many new customers are using the extended Green Line, it has meant that, at certain times of the day,\u00a0some trams are operating at capacity.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Luas Cross City project included the purchase of seven additional new trams which, at\u00a055 metre length,\u00a0have a higher passenger capacity than existing trams, carrying up to 379 passengers per tram and\u00a0increasing overall capacity on the Green Line.  The first of these additional trams very recently came\u00a0into service.\u00a0 Two more\u00a0are currently in Ireland undergoing final testing and commissioning.\u00a0 One of these is expected to go into passenger service by the end of\u00a0this week with the second to go into service about a week or so later, at the start of March.  The remaining four trams - following the necessary\u00a0final testing and commissioning -\u00a0will be put into service progressively over the coming weeks during March, April and May.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Green Line Capacity Enhancement project was recently approved by Government.  The purpose of the project is to further increase capacity\u00a0at peak hours on the Luas Green Line\u00a0and to cater for future demands along the line. \u00a0The project is proposed in the National Transport Authority's (NTA) Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035.  It includes\u00a0the lengthening of the 26 existing Green line trams from 43 metres to 55 metres and the purchase of a further 8 new 55 metre-long trams which will greatly increase the passenger capacity of the fleet now and to meet future passenger demand.  The capacity increases at peak periods provided by the project will assist in reducing crowding on the Green Line and enhance accessibility for mobility and sensory impaired users during these periods.\u00a0 A necessary complementary investment project, known as\u00a0the Green Line Infrastructure Upgrade -\u00a0an investment project to lengthen the platforms at the existing Green Line stations -\u00a0was\u00a0completed towards the end of last year and enables the use of the new, longer trams.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  With regard to planning and managing the impact of Luas on other traffic, the Deputy may recall that Dublin City Council and the NTA jointly published the Dublin City Centre Transport Study in 2015 which sets out the various measures proposed for Dublin's city centre to ensure the efficient functioning of transport within the city centre and that also took into account the introduction of the\u00a0Luas Cross City Project. <\/p>  <p>  A number of changes have been made throughout the city centre over the last six months to accommodate the operation of the new Luas Cross City line.\u00a0 The most significant changes were the introduction of the additional bus lanes along the North and South Quays last August.\u00a0 In addition,\u00a0there has been a host of other junction and traffic signal changes implemented in advance of the Luas Cross City becoming operational.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore it was recognised that the College Green area would be unable to cater for the same number of vehicles as it had previously, following the introduction of the Luas trams.  Addressing this, a separate proposal for a civic plaza at College Green was developed by the City Council, and this proposal\u00a0also provides for revised traffic arrangements through this area.  The College Green civic plaza proposal is currently with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for determination and,\u00a0if approved, would remove a lot of the conflicting traffic movements that currently exist in College Green. <\/p>  <p>  In advance of\u00a0a rescheduled Oral Hearing, the NTA, in collaboration with Dublin Bus and Dublin City Council, have proceeded to reduce bus vehicle volumes passing through the area, which would allow the junctions and signals to function more effectively.  The combined effect of these changes has been to reduce the volume of buses passing through the College Green and College Street area, by about 20% in order to reduce the delay issues arising in this area.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that these parties continue to keep the situation under review.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000084#WRAA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Tolls","counter":1272,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000084#WRAA02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1273,"qnumday":497,"qnumall":"[8483\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000084#WRAA02700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the plans TII has to add additional tolling points on the M50; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1274,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy in relation to roads.\u00a0 The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects on national roads\u00a0are a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 in conjunction with the relevant local authority.\u00a0For regional and local roads it is a matter for each respective local authority.<\/p>  <p>  More specifically, the statutory powers to levy tolls on national roads as well as regional and local roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors are vested in\u00a0TII (for national roads) and each local authority (for regional and local roads) under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Roads Act 2007).\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Noting the above, I am referring the question to TII for direct reply within 10 working days.\u00a0 Please inform my private office if you do not receive the information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000084#WRAA02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Light Rail Projects Status","counter":1275,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000084#WRAA02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1276,"qnumday":498,"qnumall":"[8523\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000084#WRAA03000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the expenditure on metro north since 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1277,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the\u00a0National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory\u00a0responsibility for the planning and development of public transport infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) including the development of a metro scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the NTA that the expenditure on Metro North from 2005 up to the end of January 2018 is approximately &euro;170 million.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, following consideration of the Fingal\/North Dublin Transport Study and the recommendations of the National Transport Authority (NTA) arising from this study, the Government decided in 2015 that an optimised metro rail link as set out in the study\u00a0is the long term public transport solution on the Airport\/Swords corridor.

This reform plan will detail measures to reform both our State and supplementary pension systems.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the two most fundamental reform measures contained within this plan will relate to the introduction of the &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; for the State pension contributory from 2020 and the development of a new automatic enrolment retirement savings system for employees without supplementary pensions coverage.<\/p>  <p>  It is proposed that the &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; (TCA) will replace the current &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system from 2020.  This will make the level of pension more directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life, with significant pension credits granted to people who have taken time out of the workplace to perform caring duties.  The TCA will eliminate the anomalies inherent in the current averaging system whereby a person can qualify for a full pension based on a small number of years of payments (currently as little as 10 years' contributions) provided they have no gaps in their record, whereas a person with more than 10 years contributions but with a significant gap in their record might be paid a reduced rate.<\/p>  <p>  Automatic enrolment would see a transition from the current and purely voluntary supplementary pension system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.  It is planned that this reform, where the saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt out, will include employer and State financial incentives to encourage long term saving and asset accumulation amongst those who may otherwise suffer a reduction in living standards at retirement.  It will increase the wellbeing, financial security, and independence of future retirees.<\/p>  <p>  It is intended that following publication of the reform plan, two separate public consultation processes will be launched on the &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; and automatic enrolment.  The purpose of both of these consultations will be to inform the design of both systems.  The details and timeframe of them will be confirmed subsequent to the publication of the reform plan although I can say it is my intention to begin them by Q2 of this year.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the second part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, the wind-up options in section 48 of the Pensions Act 1990, as amended, are contingent on the requirement that the scheme&rsquo;s policies or contracts are approved by the Revenue Commissioners under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended.  The Pensions Act sets out the circumstances in which retirement benefit schemes are approved by the Revenue Commissioners for tax purposes.  In other words, transfers from the scheme being wound up must be made into schemes or products approved by the Revenue Commissioners and which, therefore, comply with Revenue rules.  Section 772 of the Taxes Consolidation Act allows for flexible options on retirement, i.e., the Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) option.  The purchase of an ARF is not available to members of defined benefit schemes, subject to certain exceptions.  Legislation and policy on taxes and access to ARFs are a matter for the Department of Finance.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000087#WRDD04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"One-Parent Family Payment Appeals","counter":1440,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000088#WREE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1441,"qnumday":556,"qnumall":"[8498\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000088#WREE00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of an application for a one-parent family payment by a person (details supplied); and when a decision will issue.","asker":"1305","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1442,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an oral hearing of the appeal of the person concerned took place on 3<sup>rd<\/sup>January 2018.

Long-term unemployed jobseekers under-25 are also referred to JobPath, a contracted, payment-by-results employment services that provides additional resources and supports to those long-term unemployed.<\/p><p>The strategy document<i>Pathways to Work 2016 to 2020<\/i>includes some additional actions in relation to addressing youth unemployment:<\/p><p>1) increase the relative share of workplace-based interventions (Gateway, T&Uacute;S, Positive to Work etc.) for youth unemployed;<\/p><p>2) ensure the frequency of engagement with all young unemployed people is a minimum of one case officer meeting per month;<\/p><p>3) restructure the First Steps programme for young unemployed people to improve take-up by offering a higher level of support to jobseekers and employers<\/p><p>4) implement the Defence Forces Skills for Life employment support programme.  <\/p><p>Each of these actions is either ongoing or has been completed.<\/p><p>Later this year I will be introducing a new work experience programme targeted specifically at young jobseekers who are long-term unemployed or who face significant barriers to gaining employment.  The new Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) will provide them with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement.  Operational details are currently being finalised and I hope to launch the Scheme during Quarter 2 this year.<\/p><p>Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall with a rate of 13.7% (34,300 persons) in January 2018 estimated by CSO, as compared to 14.6% (42,100 persons) in January 2017 and a peak rate of almost 32% in 2012.  (The actual number of young people unemployed is estimated to have peaked at 97,800 persons in late 2010.) <\/p><p>Eurostat figures indicate that the number of young people in full-time employment has grown from 84,000 in mid-2012 to 138,000 in mid-2017. <\/p><p>I am satisfied that the current policy approach, together with an improving labour market, will continue to address youth unemployment and support further improvements in the labour market situation for young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000088#WREE04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Payments Waiting Times","counter":1486,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000088#WREE04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1487,"qnumday":572,"qnumall":"[8808\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000088#WREE04800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the extent to which backlogs have been addressed in respect of various headings and payments operated by her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1488,"content":"<p>The prompt processing of applications remains a priority for my Department.  Each scheme area is continuously monitored and reviewed to ensure customers are responded to as quickly as possible, and their applications are processed as expeditiously as possible.  <\/p><p>All applications are registered promptly. In some schemes, this is done through the scanning of claim documents onto the system while, in other schemes, this involves an officer inputting data.  The time taken to carry out means tests and\/or medical assessments where these are required is not measured separately, while a determination on habitual residence, where required, is an integral part of the decision-making process.<\/p><p>Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision-making process.  Delays can also arise where information is required from social security organisations in other jurisdictions and where additional information has been requested from the applicant but remains outstanding.  <\/p><p>This means that processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria. For example, in January 2018, it took on average 1 week to award a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payment, which is based on social insurance contributions, while it took 2 weeks to award a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment, which is means-tested.<\/p><p>In the same month, it took on average:<\/p><p>- 10 weeks to award an application for carer&rsquo;s benefit, which is based on a medical assessment of care requirements, an assessment of the level of care being provided and social insurance contributions; while<\/p><p>- an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance took 18 weeks to award, which has similar medical and care provision conditionality but it is also means-tested.<\/p><p>As part of the Department&rsquo;s programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.

Social Welfare legislation provides that an Appeals Officer may determine an appeal without an oral hearing where s\/he is of the opinion that it can be determined fairly on the basis of the documentary evidence provided.

supports now and in the future; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1508,"content":"<p>Self-employed workers who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year, are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.  This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.<\/p>  <p>  This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the PRSI Class A rate of 4%.  In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings.  These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.   <\/p>  <p>  The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published in October 2017.  The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.<\/p>  <p>  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure. In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers were to be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the actuarial review&rsquo;s findings.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.<\/p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for PRSI Class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  <\/p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the Class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.<\/p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension contributory.  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.<\/p>  <p>  The findings of the Review will play an important role in informing the overall debate on policy developments in relation to the SIF in the years ahead, including the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000089#WRFF02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":1509,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000089#WRFF02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1510,"qnumday":580,"qnumall":"[8816\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000089#WRFF02200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the extent to which her department can assist those in danger of becoming homeless with particular reference to situations whereby a primary payment is terminated and rent support likewise as a consequence resulting in hardship, anxiety and despair; if in such cases rent support will not be terminated until all has been decided; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1511,"content":"<p>Rent supplement plays a vital role in housing families and individuals, with the scheme supporting some 33,400 recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;180 million for in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Continued entitlement to rent supplement is not linked to entitlement to other social welfare schemes, however the rent supplement claim may be reviewed following a decision to suspend or disallow a primary social welfare payment as there may be a change to the claimant&rsquo;s circumstances that could affect eligibility.

It is added at the water treatment plant and for larger networks may require boosting at key locations including reservoirs and pumping stations to ensure the correct levels of chlorine are maintained throughout the entire network. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that Irish Water is currently undertaking a national programme of works to improve the quality of drinking water and increase water quality compliance levels across the country.  As part of this programme over &euro;40 million is to be invested in the upgrade and standardisation of disinfection systems currently installed in over 830 public drinking water treatment plants. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Irish Water that the Disinfection Programme is being carried out in two phases.  Phase 1 involves the assessment of the condition and performance of the existing disinfection systems at water treatment plants across the country.  This will determine the works required to ensure that the treatment plant disinfection process meets the specified requirements.  Phase 2\u00a0then involves carrying out any necessary upgrade works.

To date, Irish Water has assessed over 450 sites and commenced upgrades to over 130 water treatment plants.<\/p>  <p>  Chlorine levels in drinking water\u00a0are monitored primarily via a rigorous sampling programme which tests the levels of chlorine in the water at various points from the treatment plant to the customer&rsquo;s tap.  Any changes to chlorine levels are fully investigated and any necessary actions agreed.  This monitoring programme is supplemented by alarms which can alert to issues often associated with the point at which chlorine is added.  To ensure a fully robust system all points of chlorine addition will be considered over time including the boosting points along a network.  Irish Water has begun this process,\u00a0which will take some time to complete given the vast amount of assets to be audited and adjusted when reservoirs, pumping stations and boosting points within a\u00a0network are included. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000089#WRFF04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Insurance","counter":1540,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000090#WRGG00400"},{"type":"question","counter":1541,"qnumday":591,"qnumall":"[8121\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000090#WRGG00500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if mortgage protection insurance is a mandatory requirement of the new first-time buyers council mortgage; if so, the reason therefor; and the nature of the policies required.","asker":"1215","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1542,"content":"<p>The local authority mortgage protection insurance (MPI) scheme is overseen by the Mortgage Protection Committee which is a sub-committee of the County and City Management Association (CCMA) and is representative of the CCMA, local authorities, the Housing Finance Agency and my Department.

It is a matter for local authorities, as lenders, to satisfy themselves\u00a0that\u00a0an applicant(s) has the borrowing and repayment capacity to\u00a0cover all the costs involved in a house purchase . The amount to be loaned to an applicant is determined in accordance with the rules governing the loan and the associated statutory credit policy.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The local authority mortgage protection insurance (MPI) scheme is overseen by the Mortgage Protection Committee which is a sub-committee of the County and City Management Association (CCMA) and is representative of the CCMA, local authorities, the Housing Finance Agency and my Department.  The local authority MPI scheme has applied to all house purchase loans approved by local authorities after 1 July 1986. <\/p>  <p>  The Consumer Credit Act 1995 applied conditions on lenders which applied to local authorities as well as commercial lenders.  Under section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 the lender is legally required to ensure that a prospective borrower has mortgage protection insurance in place before drawing down a mortgage.\u00a0 Where a lender offers a particular policy sub-section 2(d) of section 126 of the Act provides that the borrower can source an alternative policy to suit their needs.\u00a0 However, sub-section 2(d) does not apply to local authorities. <\/p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the local authority scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme.  Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers.  The group policy is a commercial insurance product which is procured in accordance with EU procurement rules.\u00a0 A local authority housing loan applicant who is not eligible for the local authority MPI scheme must source a suitable comparable individual MPI policy from the market. <\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to compare standard mortgage protection insurance (MPI) products commercially available with the local authority MPI product, as the benefits\u00a0differ significantly.  For example,\u00a0the local authority MPI scheme covers disability as well as death and the disability cover is for the full period of the disability, and not just 12 months as is the case in the majority of MPI policies available. <\/p>  <p>  Standard MPI products are individually priced based on a member's age, amongst other factors, whereas the local authority MPI scheme is a group arrangement offering a single group rate per &euro;1,000 sum assured to all participants in the scheme.\u00a0 As a result, it would not be valid to attribute the difference in cost between this scheme and standard MPI to any one issue as this is not comparing like with like.  Aside from the difference between an individual and a group rate, the following factors have the main influence on determining the price of the local authority MPI scheme:<\/p>  <p>  - standard mortality and morbidity factors based on population actuarial statistics;<\/p>  <p>  - the local authority borrowers&rsquo; risk profile;<\/p>  <p>  - the terms and conditions of the local authority MPI scheme and, in particular, the fact that all local authority housing loan borrowers are accepted without medical evidence; <\/p>  <p>  - the claims experience of the local authority MPI scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In determining the rate for the local authority MPI scheme, consideration was given to all of the above factors, and the procurement process undertaken\u00a0reflected that.  It is important to also point out that there are a number of additional features of the local authority MPI scheme as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - in the event of a claim, the insurance covers the amount of the mortgage repayable\u00a0on death which is similar to standard MPI; <\/p>  <p>  - the member&rsquo;s mortgage repayments are covered if there is a claim as a result of disability and not death; this additional feature is not included in standard MPI products;<\/p>  <p>  - an extra cover of &euro;3,000 is also provided in the event of a member&rsquo;s death, which is not included in standard MPI products; <\/p>  <p>  - the local authority MPI scheme covers members to age 75 for death,\u00a0while ordinary MPI is usually based on a ceasing age of 65 unless an older age is agreed and priced. <\/p>  <p>  The Mortgage Protection Committee which oversees the scheme endeavours to achieve a balance between the most economic rate to be charged for the scheme and the benefits provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000090#WRGG04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Waiting Lists","counter":1579,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000091#WRHH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1580,"qnumday":605,"qnumall":"[8276\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000091#WRHH00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a decision to remove a family from the housing list due to temporarily exceeding the income thresholds is open to appeal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1581,"content":"<p>Local authorities are by law (Section 63(1) of the Local Government Act 2001) independent in the performance of their functions.\u00a0 The assessment of applicants and the provision of social housing support is entirely a matter for the local authority concerned in accordance with its allocation scheme.

There is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure that deer populations occupying the same land resources are managed at sustainable levels, and in a responsible and ethical manner.  Ultimately, however, where deer species are increasing in range and numbers, depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats (especially woodland), culls need to be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.  The Deputy will be aware my Department&rsquo;s regional NPWS staff have conducted several such culls in recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000091#WRHH04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hare Coursing Regulation","counter":1627,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000092#WRJJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1628,"qnumday":621,"qnumall":"[8231\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000092#WRJJ00300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the fact that a club (details supplied) held a meeting in adverse weather conditions on 11 February 2018 putting the welfare of the dogs and hares at risk; and if her Department will review licensing conditions to take into consideration adverse weather conditions that compromise the safety and welfare of the animals that are exploited for the purposes of hare coursing events.","asker":"1259","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":1629,"content":"<p>It is my understanding that the Deputy is referring to the National Coursing Meeting held on 10th, 11th and 12th February last.\u00a0\u00a0This coursing meeting was monitored by officials from the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS)\u00a0of my Department on each of the three days of the meeting.\u00a0 In addition, officials of my Department monitored the trials for this meeting.\u00a0 The officials have reported that they did not find any issues of concern relating to the conditions of the licences granted to the ICC.\u00a0 This monitoring report will be published on the NPWS website in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000092#WRJJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wildlife Conservation","counter":1630,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000092#WRJJ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1631,"qnumday":622,"qnumall":"[8232\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022000092#WRJJ00600","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"her views on the increased reports of a shortage of hares; and the actions her Department will take to honour EU directive 92\/43\/EEC which directs that the State maintain a hare population at a favourable conservation level.","asker":"1259","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":1632,"content":"<p>EU Directive 92\/43\/EEC (the Habitats Directive) requires Ireland to make a detailed report every six years on the conservation status of all listed species, including the hare.\u00a0Ireland&rsquo;s most recent\u00a0report in 2013 included a comprehensive assessment of the range, population status, habitat and threats for the Irish hare.
