We were unable to get to his vote on the issue of whether we should have offshore exploration.  We made that point consistently in our contributions on Committee and Report Stages.  In effect, it is amending the amendment Deputy Boyd Barrett is putting to widen what he is seeking to achieve, namely, an end to offshore exploration for shale, oil or gas to exclude it to other petroleum licences.  That is something we debated at length on Committee and Report Stages and on that basis the amendment is not a surprise.  It is different from the debate we have had.  I did not expect us to be here this morning.  We had hoped the debate would have concluded last Wednesday night but given that Deputy Boyd Barrett in my mind gladly extended this debate to this morning, I wanted to be able to press that point because it is an important issue for our party in terms of the type of offshore exploration he or others might want to see happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100003#A01100","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1496221200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>For clarification, I want to stress that I have no difficulty with that.

There has been considerable debate and lobbying and so on, about this over the last week and concerns have been expressed that raising this issue would in some way frustrate the passing of the Bill.  I wish to restate that we want this Bill to pass.  We think it is a historic development that a ban would be imposed and we commend Deputy McLoughlin for getting it to this point.  I do not believe there is or should be any doubt that this Bill will pass this morning.  However, we see no reason why the arguments that apply to onshore fracking would not apply offshore.  The toxic, polluting nature of the chemicals involved in fracking, which we have now accepted potentially pollute our water and impact on human health and would be damaging to the onshore environment, all apply to offshore.  We have experience of this in California, in the Gulf, and elsewhere where marine life is being destroyed, where billions of litres of toxic chemicals that cause cancer is being poured into the waters off the United States causing unquantifiable damage to marine ecosystems and potentially to human health, and there are seismic dangers.<\/p>  <p>  Another point made to me recently - it is too late for this debate but I will submit an amendment - is that we should be making a case for this to our counterparts in the North through the North-South Ministerial bodies.  This was included in my original Bill on this matter, that it would be policy to call for and campaign for a ban on fracking North of the Border, because if there is fracking in Fermanagh, it will impact on the South.  <\/p>  <p>  I will press the Amendment.  The ban should extend to the offshore.

We saw our amendments criticised by the Government, the Greens, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, all under pressure to get the Bill through the House in one hour and 20 minutes.  As I said last week, I do not believe that the Government has any genuine interest in tackling climate change and the record of terrible planning and the prevalence of one-off housing has more to do with this Bill being passed than any genuine concern about the advance of climate change.  NIMBYism has not gone away.<\/p>  <p>  Last week the Minister of State said that it was inappropriate to introduce statutory prohibitions that are not underpinned by scientific rationale and place Ireland at an unfair competitive disadvantage by creating the uncertainty of limiting the operators' capability to assess reservoirs in the Irish offshore.  This was the Government's main argument put forward against our amendments, so let us examine this statement for a moment.  The fracking Bill put forward by the Government introduces a statutory prohibition of onshore fracking.  According to the Minister of State's logic, banning fracking must be underpinned by scientific rationale.  In terms of the scientific rationale of banning fracking offshore, which our amendment aims to do, the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, and others in the Chamber seem to be under the illusion that fracking is not carried out offshore.  This was discussed on Committee Stage and when Deputy Eamon Ryan asked if fracking offshore existed, the Minister of State said that the only use of fracking in the petroleum sector was when they hit a stubborn section of the core and they frack it to shatter the rock in order to ease the continuation of the drilling.<\/p>  <p>  However, there is more to it than that.  Leaving aside the fact that in order to battle against climate change disaster, banning any practice relating to the extraction of fossil fuels should be a priority, this statement by the Minister of State is not entirely true.  In 2015, documents obtained by al-Jazeera America revealed that the world's largest oil firms are now fracking in some of the Gulf's deepest waters.  The fracking that the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, is talking about is dubbed \"frac packing\" and has been used offshore for decades and employs high pressurised water, gravel, and chemicals to clear sand from the opening of the well and facilitate the flow of fossil fuels.  Federal officials have now acknowledged, in written statements to al-Jazeera, that a more expansive type of fracking involving higher fluid volumes and extending longer distances from the well bore are being used in the Gulf of Mexico.  Environmental observers in California obtained a list of chemicals used at 12 offshore fracking sites off its coast.  Almost all the substances cause damage to organs in the human body, and there are claims that fracking offshore can increase the risk of an oil spill as well as air and water pollution.  It might not affect the people in County Leitrim but it will affect the people on the Galway coast if we damage the waters with something like that out in the Atlantic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100004#B02400","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1496221500,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I rise to support Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendment.  Deputy Wallace is right.  There were complications in my mind last week as to how we would work that because there were complications with other exploration areas, in terms of oil and coal and other seams, which was difficult.  I asked how it would work.  That, to an extent, explains one of the reasons why we put down this amendment, the purpose of which is to provide for all offshore exploration, which is a way of overcoming those technical difficulties between what might be fracking and what might be petroleum exploration.  As Deputy Wallace says, the two are often combined.  The way we have addressed that is by putting forward the amendment here.<\/p>  <p>  We need to stop extracting fossil fuels out of the ground.  We need to do that for local environmental reasons, in regard to polluting the water course and a range of other effects, but we also need to protect our atmosphere.  On that basis, we have to keep four-fifths of the known fossil fuels underground.  We do not go offshore.  We have plenty of our own resources onshore in renewable power that we can turn to.  On that basis, we support the amendment.<\/p>  <p>  We also support the call to intervene with the North-South Ministerial council.  For all our talk about offshore, the bigger immediate risk is that a Northern Ireland administration will continue fracking there.

On that basis, and in order to not delay the legislation, I am prepared to withdraw amendment No. 4.  There are legal issues, definitions and other matters that need to be teased out, all of which would take time.  We should move on to that work once we get this legislation through and we can then make further amendments to the petroleum Acts in order to do that.  We will certainly move on to that once this legislation passed.  However, the immediate task is to try to secure a position whereby fracking within the Twenty-six Counties is banned completely.  I want to be clear that we want to ensure fracking for shale gas is not allowed offshore and that we need to move on to that issue once we get this legislation through.

We need to move away from fossil fuels everywhere - that is the world target and what we need to do.  However, I also think we have to be sensible.  That is not to say the Deputy proposing this amendment or the other Deputies proposing amendments in regard to offshore are not sensible but that we need to look at what we can achieve.  What we can achieve is a Bill which will deal with the issue at hand, which is the danger of hydraulic fracturing happening onshore in the State.  Hydraulic fracturing is not happening offshore yet, but there is the potential for that and we need to deal with it.  We have been advised that if we try to deal with the offshore issue here, that could be used.  We all know that in certain sections of the Civil Service in this State, there are people who have a particular agenda.  They will use that notion of going offshore as a means of bringing it down a path where it will need further research, and this, that and other, and it will have to be referred for legal expertise and everything else - delay, delay, delay - and the whole lot will fall.

We can then work together on the offshore aspect, which also needs to be dealt with quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100005#C00400","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1496222100,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I know it would not be intentional, Deputy Kenny, but you should not refer to officials in that manner.

Deputy McLoughlin, to be fair to him, brought the Bill forward it and has done a lot of work on it, supported by Deputy Scanlon, myself, Deputy Martin Kenny and others.  However, the real reason we are here is because those people brought it to our attention and have fought very hard to get this done.

The original Title to Deputy McLoughlin's Bill was the Prohibition of the Exploration and Extraction of Onshore Petroleum Bill 2016.  That was the subject of comprehensive debate and analysis at the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which held hearings, debated the issues, brought in experts and produced a report, the recommendations of which were included in the amendments the Government brought to the Bill.  The new Title of the Bill, which was agreed on Committee Stage, is the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Prohibition of Onshore Hydraulic Fracturing) Bill 2016.  Therefore, the entire debate has been on onshore.<\/p>  <p>  I fully respect the views of Members who suggest we should look at banning offshore fracking or offshore oil exploration, and I am not suggesting there is not a time or a place for that debate.  However, I think it should be done in the context of a separate Bill and a separate committee analysis, bringing in experts on all sides to give their views.  That is the approach I would suggest and it is why I am advising that we will not support the amendments that have been put down.  With respect to Deputy McLoughlin, the Bill related to onshore and we should maintain the integrity of the Bill as was put down by Deputy McLoughlin, and confine it to onshore.  Let us have another debate on another day.  I know Deputy Boyd Barrett has his own Bill in regard to offshore and others can bring in Bills in regard to offshore oil exploration.  We can have a bigger debate without trying to ban offshore oil exploration following a few back-and-forth exchanges in the House and without proper debate and analysis on Committee Stage.

In 2016, I introduced a Bill to ban hydraulic fracturing.  It was specific about the process.  It stated, \"...all other practices to extract hydrocarbon from coal seams, shale rock and tight sands in Ireland.\"  Then a Bill came from Deputy McLoughlin, on which I commend him.  He is representing his constituency.  However, that Bill reflects pressure from Fine Gael for a diluted fracking ban that does not extend to the offshore.  We have had nearly a year and a half to debate the offshore and plenty of opportunity to do this, but Fine Gael and, I suspect, Fianna F&aacute;il made a political decision that they did not want a ban to extend to the offshore because their friends in the oil and gas industry would not like it.  That is the reason.  The Government has been forced into this ban by popular opposition in Leitrim and elsewhere, but it does not want the ban to go too far.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to stress that Fracking Free Clare has been in touch with me to say that we should press our amendments.  It is worried about the definition of \"fracking\" in this Bill because it believes the definition does not cover other fracking-type processes that would have been covered by my Bill.<\/p>  <p>  That is the political game that is going on and we make no apologies for saying that the ban should apply offshore, where the onshore issues of climate change, polluting capacity, the toxic nature of these chemicals and the potential for seismic damage also apply.

As a humble backbench Deputy from the Silgo-Leitrim constituency, I believe the Bill's passage through the D&aacute;il will be a major moment for politics.  I say this because, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be acutely aware, Private Members' Bills rarely, if ever, make it past the Second Reading of the legislative process in D&aacute;il or Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  To have reached Final Stage with a Private Members' Bill that will ensure the environment and communities in the west and north west will be protected from the harmful and damaging effects of hydraulic fracking is a special moment for me and the people I was elected to represent.  The sheer speed with which the Bill progressed this year shows that, notwithstanding the negativity in the media that surrounds the concept, new politics can work well if all sides engage proactively and work together.<\/p>  <p>  Since I introduced the Bill on First Stage on 8 June 2016, it has progressed at a rapid pace through to the Report and Final Stages in the D&aacute;il.  The goal now is to identify and debate whether the Bill constitutes good law.  As its sponsor, I can safely say it could not be clearer that this is necessary legislation.  The Bill has been heavily scrutinised and continually improved by the Oireachtas in the past 12 months.  The vast amount of research against fracking and in support of the need for this prohibition is clear and unequivocal.  It includes more than 500 academic studies on geographical areas in the United States and Europe; the Sustainable Water Network Ireland research report which found that fracking poses a substantial risk to Irish rivers and lakes; and the findings of the Environmental Protection Agency's report into hydraulic fracking in Ireland.  The Concerned Health Professionals of Ireland group has also supported the Bill, noting that the \"scientific evidence overwhelmingly shows that permitting fracking in Ireland and Northern Ireland would pose significant threats to the air, water and the health and safety of individuals and communities here.\"<\/p>  <p>  I thank all members of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment who compiled the pre-legislative scrutiny report launched last April.  The report, which firmly supported the need for, and scope of, my Bill, provided yet another indication that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as a whole is committed to acting to prohibit the process of fracking from ever being allowed to occur in this country.<\/p>  <p>  Hydraulic fracturing is an extraction and exploration process that has been scientifically proven to be bad for the environment.  It would damage our fresh groundwater, affect our agricultural output, damage our tourism industry and, most important, have a detrimental effect on public health.  If it was ever permitted to take place in the Republic of Ireland, counties such as SIigo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Clare could experience damaging effects similar to those experienced by cities and towns in the United States, many of which have decided to implement bans similar to that proposed in the Bill.  On that basis, unconventional hydraulic fracking must be considered a serious public health and environmental concern for tens of thousands of people in the Republic of Ireland.  This is the key reason the Bill is necessary and its importance of its passage has been recognised by the majority of parties in the House.<\/p>  <p>  Before we decide if the Bill will pass, I note that it was drafted, amended and improved in the past 11 months thanks to the kind help and assistance of the Government and a number of local and national non-governmental organisations and groups.  In particular, I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, the former Minister in the Department, Deputy Joe McHugh, Ms Kate Ruddock of Friends of the Earth, Mr. Eddie Mitchell and the entire active committee of Love Leitrim who are present in the Gallery - well done to them - Ms Aideen McLoughlin, Mr. Liam Breslin and all the members of the Good Energies Alliance, my political staff, including my personal assistant, and all the other people who have supported me with the Bill thus far.<\/p>  <p>  It has been my intention since introducing the Bill to have clear and appropriate legislation enacted to protect both the local quality of life in rural Ireland and our country's reputation abroad in industries such as agriculture.  I am pleased to support the Bill, as amended by the select committee, because it is, in its current form, fully in line with the intent of my proposal.<\/p>  <p>  A number of amendments were proposed on Committee Stage to extend the ban on fracking offshore.  However, it is my understanding that this offshore activity does not raise the concerns that arise regarding onshore fracking.  Legislation should be considered and proportionate.  As Deputies have not had the benefit of pre-legislative scrutiny or debate about offshore activities, the proposed extension of the prohibition offshore is not appropriate in this Bill, particularly when it appears there are, as yet, no scientific findings to support such an approach.<\/p>  <p>  When others ridiculed me and my party and questioned my efforts and intentions, I kept my head down.  I have delivered this Bill, with the assistance of my colleagues, on behalf of the affected people and communities I was fortunate to be elected to represent.  There can be no substitute for hard work and it is only through hard work that the Bill got this far.  I now eagerly await its passage through the Seanad and the final signature of the President.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100010#H00600","speaker":"1343"},{"type":"speech","time":1496225700,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy McLoughlin for getting this Bill through the D&aacute;il.  I also commend the Minister, Deputy Naughten, the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, and their officials for assisting in its passage.<\/p>  <p>  One of the biggest environmental defects in the State is the problems we have had over recent decades in the loss of pristine water quality.  We need to reconnect with our land and nature.  We need to start by getting our water back to pristine condition.  We have a huge opportunity and advantage in the availability of water, but we need to look after it.  That is what we are doing with this Bill.  It is hugely significant at a local level and for the whole country.  It is also significant internationally.  There is an international environmental campaign against fracking and the use of fossil fuels.  Today is a victory for them.  At a time when President Trump is considering turning his country into a rogue state - an illegal state in my opinion - with respect to the crimes against the future of humanity of this planet, it is important that we as a country stand up for action on climate change and that is what we are doing here today.<\/p>  <p>  More than anything else, this is a victory for community groups in Leitrim.  We have a responsibility to work with them to show there is another way of developing counties in Ireland.  These may be the counties that are not the centre of economic development, as is happening in Dublin.  We need to develop an alternative economy and lift rural Ireland.  We need to bring people back there rather than having them return to move to Dublin.  That is what we start here today; the rejuvenation and reinvigorating of counties such as Leitrim and Roscommon, not using fossil fuels but by using our wit and other bountiful resources we have.  We start by looking after our water.  We start by looking after our air.  That is what we are voting for in passing the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100011#J00100","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1496225700,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy McLoughlin for getting the Bill to this point.  I have no doubt it will pass, hopefully unopposed, through the Final Stage.  It is very much to his credit that we have got to this point.  The Deputy and others will accept that the biggest victory here is the victory of people power in Leitrim and across the State.  Communities and environmental campaigners took up the fight and made it impossible for the political parties in the House to ignore the arguments made by campaigners and the justice of their cause in insisting that onshore fracking is banned.  It would pollute the water, endanger human health and contribute to further climate change.  It would impact on tourism and our pristine landscape.  There is simply no justification for it and it was people power that forced the political system to acknowledge that fact.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth commenting on how far we have come in that regard.  I remember when we discussed this issue at the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The Environmental Protection Agency was doing a report that, frankly, many of us felt was an absolute stitch-up.  The two major consultants looking into the viability of fracking were both deeply linked with the oil and gas industry and the pro-fracking lobby.  Incredibly, they did not even look into the health implications of fracking.  That was where we were at.  It is because of people power, pressure, persistence and determination by the environmental movement and by the communities who campaigned on this issue that we have got to this point.  There is no doubt that it is a great victory.  It is historic and it sets a precedent.  We should be delighted that this is the case.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I must disagree with Deputy McLoughlin's points about the offshore fracking.  There is no question that all of the arguments that apply to the dangers of onshore fracking apply equally to offshore fracking.  That evidence is now piling in from the experience of offshore fracking in the United States of America.  A 2014 report Troubled Waters says that, \"At least 10 fracking chemicals routinely used offshore in California could kill or harm a broad variety of marine species, including sea otters [and] fish...\".  Leatherback sea turtles and elephant seals in California and so on are being affected because of the chemicals being used in their key habitats.  The chemicals used have also been shown to cause cancer and to impact negatively on human health.  All of these factors apply just as much to offshore fracking.  I am deeply worried because I believe that some of the biggest reserves are likely to be found offshore and the door is still open to that.  The door needs to be closed.  There is the pressing and urgent need also to deal with runaway climate change and the threat this poses to humanity and to the entirety of the globe.  I disagree with Deputy McLoughlin on that point and I believe we should have gone further.<\/p>  <p>  That being said, it is a victory for people power.  I do not know what I would say about the new politics that Deputy McLoughlin referred to, but it shows that the reduction in the dominance of the two or three major parties in the State has opened the door for change.  It shows that parties from across the political spectrum can co-operate on the things they agree on and get results when, critically, working in conjunction with people from outside the House and allowing the voice of civil society really to influence our work.  This to me is new politics.  It is about listening to the voices outside and being messengers to the D&aacute;il around the demands, campaigns, issues and the wisdom of those who are outside the Parliament and letting that impact on the work we do and the laws we pass.  In that sense, it is a great victory, but there is a lot more to be done.  We need to press on to ban offshore fracking and to other issues related to climate change and environmental destruction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100011#J00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1496225700,"counter":87,"content":"<p>It is my understanding that Members are anxious to ensure the Bill is completed today and sent to the Seanad.

It is a testament to the approach of new politics that when Deputy McLoughlin's Bill was published Fianna F&aacute;il was also working on a Bill and we chose to stop in order to follow the lead the Deputy set.  Correct me if I am wrong but I believe that the Sinn F&eacute;in party was also working on this issue.  I know they can talk for themselves, but I assume they chose to hold back and to work in a collective way.  To me, that is probably the most progressive sign in terms of the rules and procedures that are here in the decision that was taken.  This was an issue of importance and interest to everybody.  While I have absolutely great regard for Deputy Boyd Barrett, sometimes I get the impression that if the main political parties venture in to an area that he is particularly interested in, we are somehow excoriated because we have not had the same connection, as he sees it, to civil society.  I may be mis-characterising his views in this regard but to suggest that the major political parties have not been connected with civil society or with citizens over the years would be an unfair characterisation.  We listen to the people and we try to represent them and that is how we manage to get people elected.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise that in the more fractured environment of society generally - pardon the pun - of course we must work collaboratively and collectively.<\/p><p>That is the approach our Front Bench took in the progression of our Bill.  If there is a Bill with which we can work to the same effect, it does not matter that Deputy Tony McLoughlin's Bill was brought forward first.  It is not about that.  While great credit is due to the Deputy for the work he has done in spearheading and driving the Bill, it should not be about the party badge on the back of it.  We are all here to collectively serve those who put us here.  It is clear to the vast majority of Deputies that onshore hydraulic fracturing on a small island would have the capacity to have an absolutely detrimental impact, not just on the landscape but also on tourism potential and people's ability to enjoy the amenities of the region in which they live.  Of course, there is also the issue of groundwater.<\/p> <p> My own county of Clare was identified as containing an area that could potentially have some reserves of shale gas or oil.  A decision was taken by the members of Clare County Council way back when it was not fashionable to talk about fracking and people did not have as much interest in it.  The council was predominantly made up of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael members; I cannot remember which party held a majority at the time, but the councillors were very quick to cotton on to the problem.  While Leitrim County Council and others followed afterwards, Clare County Council was one of the first to pass a motion to state it wanted a ban and did not want to proceed with activities that might lead to any further investigation or exploration.  It was at the forefront.  Its councillors did that and it has worked really well.  I know that there are councillors from County Leitrim in the Visitors Gallery because of the particular focus of Deputy Tony McLoughlin's Bill on counties Sligo and Leitrim.  However, councillors in County Clare were talking about this issue a long time ago and understood the impact.  People live in dispersed rural communities which presents its own issues in terms of groundwater and sewerage, matters which are for another day, but it was very clear that this practice was not fit for use in this country.  I will not say it was permissible or acceptable in other countries, but it was happening in regions with vast tracts of land where no humans lived.<\/p> <p> I had my concerns during the darker days of the recession that somebody in an office high above the city of Dublin would ask why we should ban fracking when there were reserves in the ground that could potentially assist us in our time of need.  I was deeply concerned that such thinking might emerge, but, thankfully, it did not.  We are as a result in a position to be able to support a ban today.  The Bill ensures that, regardless of what opportunities or potential might emerge at a later stage, nobody will be minded to see them as being of some benefit.<\/p> <p> On the wider environmental issues, we have to get real about moving away from carbon and its extraction.  There is vast potential in offshore wind energy projects.  I appeal to the Department and the Minister of State to look at the support needed, particularly in the refit programme being proposed.  It should be supporting offshore wind energy projects to the same degree as solar energy and other exploratory projects.  , To the best of my recollection, under the last refit programme there was support for tidal and wave energy projects, a sector that has really not been developed as far as is necessary.  There is potential to support research and development opportunities in offshore wind energy generation.  That issue needs to be addressed by the Department.<\/p> <p> Passing the Bill cannot be the end of the interest of this House in protecting the environment.  We have to get real in looking at other energy sources.  The State has to move well beyond just banning things.  It has to become proactive in supporting the use of alternative energy sources in order that we can ultimately move beyond being dependent on gas and oil.  We have to move towards the use of electric vehicles.  Norway, a country that has built up a great fund of sovereign wealth from the extraction of oil and gas, is looking at phasing out by 2025 vehicles dependent on carbon.  Even oil producing countries see an end to their use on the horizon.  We need to take similar action.  We should be far more aggressive in supporting the use of electric vehicles.  We have to find cheaper ways to produce energy and it cannot be from oil or gas.  We have to look to making use of the wind coming from the Atlantic Ocean.<\/p> <p> I compliment Deputy Tony McLoughlin on his efforts and congratulate his staff who have put a hell of a lot of work into the Bill.  Oftentimes they are the unsung heroes, but it is right to recognise all concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100011#J00400","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496226300,"counter":90,"content":"<p>There are still a number of Deputies indicating that they want to contribute.

We have debated the reasons for it.<\/p><p>The point I want to address concerns the deniers of the effects offshore fracking may have.  I refer to an article published on <i>truth-out.org<\/i>which states that in late 2016, on the release of US federal records, it was discovered that &quot;[f]rom 2010 to October 2014, the Obama administration approved more than 1,500 permit applications for offshore drilling plans that included fracking at hundreds of wells across the Gulf of Mexico ... An unknown number of permit applications have yet to be released, so the scope of offshore fracking in the Gulf is likely larger.&quot;  In 2014 alone the industry was allowed to dump a staggering 76 billion gallons of waste fluid into the sea.<\/p><p>Let us get real.  Offshore fracking is going to be hugely problematic.  We did not just throw in the amendment.  It was in the interests of protecting the health and safety of those living in coastal communities and wildlife in the oceans and in response to the urgent need to do something to tackle the advancement of climate change.  Onshore fracking is a new practice and, according to the reporting, developing as a viable extraction method, the waste from which is routinely dumped straight into waters.  It is unconscionable that the Government has approved any exploration licence in Irish waters in the past year.  I hope to God, for the sake of people all over the planet and along the coast of Ireland, that those involved will not find anything.<\/p><p>Whatever happens to the Bill from here on, a ban on fracking may be challenged under the terms of the CETA, the vast majority of which will most likely be applied provisionally from 1 July.  We have been assured by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Marhy Mitchell O'Connor, that there will be a vote on the CETA in the D&aacute;il before it is fully ratified.  Either way, even with provisional application, fracking comes under the terms of the agreement.  The Minister has stated that in the course of the negotiations on the CETA substantive engagement took place sector by sector to identify Ireland's interests, but that is simply not the case.  The CETA povides for a negative list system, whereby a country must explicitly name legislation and regulations to be excluded from the terms of the trade deal.  The negative list has been used extensively by other EU countries.  Germany, for example, submitted a 25-page list of individual pieces of legislation.  Ireland only listed eight areas to be excluded, namely, flour milling, mining, the legal profession, veterinary services, maritime transport, executive employment services, privately funded social services and intercity bus services.  This is a list of the professions and groups that thought to lobby the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p><p>There has been no effort to safeguard the environment or the health of the public.  Having our fracking ban attacked through the investor-court system by multinational oil and gas corporations is on the cards if CETA is ratified along with everything not on that pathetic list of eight exclusions.  Even if CETA is not ratified, under provisional application a refusal to grant a fracking licence can qualify as a technical barrier to trade and end up being taken to the regulatory co-operation council.  Pressure can be put on us to change our regulation in this area.<\/p> <p> It is difficult to figure out if the Government could not give a damn about the environment or whether it is in the pockets of big business.  The people who care about the environment and do not want fracking in Ireland should lobby their Deputies to ensure we do not ratify CETA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100012#K00300","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496226900,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I welcome the passage of the Bill through Report Stage.

The former Deputy, Michael Colreavy, and Deputy Martin Kenny also supported this.  I recognise the work of people at local level.  When campaigning on an issue like this, it can often seem like fighting a lost cause.  People stuck at it and did the research to come up with the facts and figures in order to point out the disastrous consequences of fracking in the United States - the waste ground left behind and the damage to water etc.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in had a similar Bill ready to go.

If left in position, I will raise the issue at the North-South Ministerial Council meetings when the Executive is up and running again in the North.<\/p> <p> There appear to be some concerns that the progression of technology in the future might in some way allow circumvention of the spirit and letter of this Bill.  I wish to make it clear that hydraulic fracking will always require the pumping of high volumes of fluids into rock and that this activity is clearly prohibited by the Bill.  I also emphasise that hydraulic fracking cannot be undertaken without the grant of a petroleum licence, and as this Bill makes it unlawful for any person to search for, get, raise, take, carry away or work petroleum by means of hydraulic fracking, no such licence could be granted.<\/p> <p> Deputy Wallace raised a concern that the activities of the petroleum affairs division of my Department are inconsistent with the promotion of climate change.  I wish to clarify in this regard that the energy White Paper aligns energy policy, climate action policy and exploration policy leading the transition to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  It is important to note, however, that there will remain a significant role for natural gas, for example, as a transition fuel.  If Ireland manages to benefit from the level of offshore exploration in the Atlantic margin, in terms of another hydrocarbon find, then that could have a substantial positive impact on the Irish economy such as reduced spending on imports, increased Exchequer resources for services and investment, and more opportunities for employment and local businesses.<\/p> <p> While I acknowledge there are concerns around the impact of surveying, exploring and potentially drilling in an area of large natural habitat - issues raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett - I believe the Department's approach to understanding and managing biodiversity impacts has been hugely beneficial.  There is collaboration with the National Parks and Wildlife Service in the ObSERVE programme, a pioneering piece of work to acquire new baseline data with the aim of filling existing data gaps relating to protected marine species and sites in key offshore basins.<\/p> <p> As indicated on the Second Reading of this Bill, it is my view that considerations surrounding the use of new technologies should be scientifically examined and peer-reviewed, as was done on Committee Stage in terms of the onshore prohibition of fracking.  The EPA-led research programme did precisely that.  The findings of this research programme together with Deputy Tony McLoughlin's Bill were scrutinised by the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  There is no scientific research of this type, of which I am aware, relating to the offshore, or indeed any grounds for concern in that regard.  The advancement of this legislation is a real testament to cross-party co-operation.  I again compliment Deputy Tony McLoughlin and thank Members for the support of the House in passing this Bill.

The general objective of the Bill is to amend certain sections of the Heritage Act 1995 arising from the report of the critical review of the Heritage Council concluded in June 2012 and approved by the Government in 2013.  The Bill also amends the Canals Act 1986 in order to provide enabling provisions in primary legislation to allow the making of by-laws for the regulation of boating on the canals.  This is being done on the basis of legal advice received with a view to ensuring that such by-laws will be legally robust.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also makes provision for the regulation of cutting or burning of vegetation and provides for clarification of the powers of authorised officers under the Wildlife Acts.  The Bill, which was passed by the Seanad last month, has three main Parts, the first is concerned with amending the Canals Act 1986, the second, the Wildlife Acts, and the third, the Heritage Act 1995.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments to the Canals Act are primarily enabling provisions to allow Waterways Ireland to make by-laws to regulate boating on the canals and to manage the use of the canals.  They are designed to enhance the ability of Waterways Ireland to manage these waterways for the benefit of all users.  As Members are no doubt aware, Waterways Ireland was established in 1999 under the British-Irish Agreement Act.  It is a North-South body charged with the management, maintenance, development and restoration of Ireland's inland waterways, principally for recreation purposes.  In total, Waterways Ireland manages some 1,000 km of waterways in both Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the Shannon navigation, the Erne system, the Lower Bann, the Royal and Grand canals, the Barrow navigation and the Shannon-Erne waterway.<\/p>  <p>  Our waterways make a vital contribution to tourism, attracting visitors from around Ireland and abroad.  There are more than 14,000 registered boat owners on the seven waterways managed by Waterways Ireland with more than 500 boats on the Royal Canal, Grand Canal and Barrow navigation.  The proposed changes will allow Waterways Ireland to manage the Royal Canal, the Grand Canal and the Barrow navigation proactively for the benefit of all users.<\/p>  <p>  Section 4 will replace section 5 of the Canals Act 1986.  It sets out the general duties and responsibility of Waterways Ireland to manage the canals as a public amenity for navigation, fishing and other recreational purposes.  Section 5 will replace sections 7 and 7A of the Canals Acts 1986 and 2005.  The section retains and restates existing provisions as well as creating new provisions for the making of by-laws to regulate the use of boats on the canals and canal property.  Matters on which canal by-laws can be made include: the conditions under which boats may be used on the canals; the issue of permits or licences; the type or class of boat, including its dimensions, which may be used on the canals; berths, moorings and the placing of buoys; the regulation and care of animals; and fees, tolls and charges in respect of boats.<\/p>  <p>  The section defines the scope and limits of Waterways Ireland's regulation-making powers.  The Bill sets out the process that Waterways Ireland must follow when making by-laws, including a public consultation period of 90 days.  Any person who objects to the draft by-laws can submit objections during the consultation period.  Every by-law made will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for a period of 21 sitting days before passing into law and a resolution passed by either House within the 21 sitting days can annul such by-law without prejudice.  Provisions on fixed-payment notices are largely unchanged and are being restated in the Bill.  The maximum fixed-charge amount for a contravention of the canal by-laws will be &euro;150.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides for the appointment and powers of authorised officers for the regulation and management of the canals and canal property.  A search warrant, issued by a judge of the District Court, will be needed where an authorised officer wishes to enter onto the part of a boat that is a private dwelling.  This provision is a safeguard to residential house boat dwellers.  An offence under the Canals Act may be prosecuted summarily by Waterways Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  There are new provisions in this Bill which relate to burning and hedge cutting.  Section 40 of the Wildlife Act prohibits the cutting, grubbing, burning or destruction of vegetation, with certain strict exemptions, from 1 March to 31 August.  Vegetation such as hedgerows and scrub are important as a wildlife habitat and needs to be managed in the interests of road safety, farming and biodiversity.  In that regard, I decided that there should be a review of the current legislative provisions to ensure that they remain both effective and balanced.  Stakeholders had been seeking an opportunity to input their views on the operation of section 40 and I announced a consultation process in November 2014 which provided that opportunity.  I received almost 200 submissions from various representative and Government bodies, elected representatives and members of the public.  The pilot measures in section 7 will allow for a more managed approach to the vegetation management issues which regularly arise.  Managed hedge cutting will be allowed, under strict criteria and subject to regulations which I will make, during August on roadsides only to ensure issues such as overgrown hedges impacting on road users can be tackled.<\/p><p>Heavy cutting, such as the use of flails, will not be allowed.  Controlled burning may be allowed by me, as Minister, in certain areas around the country to be specified by regulation during the month of March should it be necessary, such as, for example, due to adverse weather conditions.  It is worth noting that in Northern Ireland burning is permitted in upland areas until 15 April.  These two measures are designed to introduce a limited amount of flexibility to help with land management and to allow landowners to trim back overgrown hedges which are impacting on road safety.  This is of particular concern to rural dwellers.  <\/p> <p> I want to assure Deputies that this Bill is not about widespread cutting and burning.  Instead, it will ensure that a fair and balanced system is in place while, of course, ensuring the protection of biodiversity.  It is important to underline to the House that there is a sunset clause of two years on this provision.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas must approve separate resolutions to extend the provisions beyond the two-year pilot phase and the extension cannot exceed three years at any one time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100014#M00500","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1496228100,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Leaders' Questions","time":1496228100,"counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100015#N00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1496228100,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Our sympathies go to all of those who have suffered as a result of the horrific terrorist attack in Kabul.  Up to 80 people were murdered in an unwarranted attack.<\/p>  <p>  I want to raise with the Taoiseach the overall crisis facing the country, in terms of the need for capital investment.  I do so in the context of the IPO for the sale of a portion of AIB.  There is no question that our level of investment in capital infrastructure is not where it should be, given the growth in population.  We are still at 2000 or 2002 levels of investment, at approximately 2%.  There are major needs in housing, health, education, public transport, road infrastructure and broadband.  The essential future productive capacity of our economy and quality of life depends on a much greater level of capital investment then we have planned or are providing.<\/p>  <p>  Many people are missing the point on the sale of AIB.  It is not the key issue in terms of capital investment and the problems around it.  In our view, the Government has received advice to sell now.  The advice was to the effect that the timing may now be optimal in terms of the return to the taxpayer, which is certainly a consideration the Government has to take on board.  It is one of the reasons we have not opposed the sale of shares.  It is an important judgment call, but that is what it is in terms of a window that opens up.<\/p>  <p>  The broader issue is flexibility in how we use money and the EU and Irish rules on capital investment.  It is our view that the proceeds of the AIB sale should be allowable for expenditure on capital projects.  Equally, we know we already have substantial funds locked up in the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  There are billions of euro in cash, bonds and equities that fall victim to the same rules as do the proceeds from the sale of AIB in terms of the capacity of the Government to use that money for road projects and various other direct infrastructural projects.<\/p>  <p>  To a certain extent, the debate is a focused exclusively on AIB but the issue is much broader.  Does the Taoiseach accept that we need dramatically more flexibility than we are getting in terms of European Union and Irish imposed rules?  It is the Government which has put a 10% limit on public private partnerships.  It is an arbitrary rule imposed by the Department of Finance.  The Government's former economic adviser, Andrew McDowell, said there is no current basis for that rule.  We could have more public private partnerships.  The head of the NTMA has also made the point that, given the very low interest rates, the Government's capacity to lock in low interest rate levels over a longer time period for public private partnerships is possible.<\/p>  <p>  What efforts has the Government made in terms of the getting the European Commission to change the rules, in particular given Brexit, which is a critical issue?  We need more capital investment.  Can the Taoiseach outline whether the Government has made representations to Brussels?  Is the Government prepared to change its rules on public-private partnerships?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100015#N00300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1496228100,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Deputy Martin is asking what action the Government took on the basis of the circumstances in which we found ourselves in 2011.  Some &euro;20 billion had been invested by the taxpayer.  Jobs were haemorrhaging by the tens of thousands, interest rates on money borrowed by the country were 15% and unemployment was rising.  We set out to improve that position, and that is what has happened in terms of the interest rates on the promissory note and the leverage we have at a European level.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, &euro;20 billion of taxpayers' money was put into what was supposed to be the greatest deal of all, that is, a &euro;64 billion debt burden on our people.  We recovered &euro;6.6 billion through capital repayments, interest, income and fees.  The State still owns 99.9% of the ordinary share capital and a further &euro;0.2 billion has been paid to the State through the bank levy.  The primary objective of the State was to recover all of the investment from AIB.  The Minister for Finance believes that is a realistic objective over a period of time.<\/p>  <p>  I said to Deputy Martin yesterday that the sale of the bank shares would not result in any beneficial impact on the general Government balance as it would not be counted as revenue.  Therefore, there is no increased capacity to spend.  The proceeds from any IPO would be used to pay down debt, and the Minister has made that perfectly clear.  We are now in the process of being in a much stronger position than we were, with almost full employment, and the deficit is to be eliminated next year.  There are serious challenges in terms of the level of personal debt that applies.  <\/p>  <p>  The negotiations are now beginning, with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, on an extension of the Lansdowne Road agreement and a review of the capital programme.  Significant amounts of money still remain unallocated.  The Government has made decisions on the unprecedented levels of money available for dealing with the housing crisis.  <\/p>  <p>  As I have pointed out, the Government has made decisions to work with the European Investment Bank on further, long-term, low interest funds for major pieces of infrastructure.  The challenges ahead are ones the Government is already looking at, not in the way Governments of the past looked at the development of a spatial strategy.  People on this side wrote down 53 towns to be developed, but nothing ever happened. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland as a country will increase its population by 1 million people over the next number of years and we will need 500,000 houses.  We have to consider how those people will be transported.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment is delivering elements of the programme for broadband and a national contract is to be issued for that next year.  There is a contract in place with Eir for the provision of fibre broadband to homes in many places.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has been very clear that now is the optimum time to dispose of a portion of AIB, leaving the State with a very significant holding.  Obviously, advice was received on a constant basis but the opportunity did not present itself in the way it does now.  It is not a case of not examining the infrastructure requirements we have.  They are very big priorities for Government.  In this particular case, as has been pointed out, it is a transaction that does not result in any increased spending money and will, therefore, be used to write down debt, as the Minister has confirmed on many occasions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100015#N00400","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1496228100,"counter":110,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has been very consistent.  He did not answer the question I asked him at all.  In my view, the late Brian Lenihan made the correct decision in respect of AIB.  &euro;6.2 billion has already come back into the Exchequer, as the Taoiseach said, and we now have a sale of over 25%.  Over time, there will be further sales.<\/p>  <p>  Did the Taoiseach or Minister for Finance have any negotiations with Brussels on the rules that govern capital expenditure?  Access to money is not actually the problem, therefore the additional &euro;2 billion or &euro;3 billion over and above what is already in the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is not the core issue that others who have criticised the IPO have said it is.  We have not opposed the sale, on the basis of the advice the Government received.  Ultimately, the sale of AIB is the right way to proceed.<\/p>  <p>  The key issue people in the country are concerned about is the overly restrictive nature of the rules on accessing capital funding.  Across the board, in housing, health, education and transport, that is the core point I am putting to the Taoiseach.<\/p><p>Our finance spokesman, Deputy Michael McGrath, has written to President Juncker and the various leaders in Europe to say there must be a review of the capital rules across Europe.  Money can be obtained very cheaply right now either from the European Investment Bank or, indeed, commercially, in addition to which we have our own rules on public private partnership which we believe are unduly restrictive.  Has the Government put a case to Brussels to say there is a need for latitude and flexibility in terms of capital expenditure, in particular in light of Brexit?  In order to respond to Brexit, we will need to enhance our public infrastructure and broadband infrastructure so that rural Ireland, in particular, has the wherewithal to develop jobs and the economy across the regions.  Without that capital investment, we will be hamstrung in our capacity to respond to the challenges of Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100015#N00500","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496228700,"counter":112,"content":"<p>The Minister for Finance has repeatedly identified the particular demographics of this country having regard to the these rules.

I know Deputy Martin supports the proportionate sale of AIB here.  Obviously, the question of demographics has been raised by us repeatedly and we have identified the kind of country we would like to see and the infrastructure it will require over the next ten, 15 and 20 years.  There is a need for increased capital expenditure, but one has to have the engine of an economy to drive that.

AIB has now returned to profitability for the first time since it was taken into public ownership.  Anyone with a lick of common sense would hold on to this asset as a steady source of income for the time ahead and as part of the necessary process to get a return for the people's &euro;20 billion investment.  We could not afford that.  The social cost is the lack of investment in housing, health services, other vital public services and the crippling burden that has been forced on working people, the homeless, emigrants, people in rural Ireland and citizens with disabilities.  Fine Gael is now going to sell off AIB as part of its privatisation agenda which will not benefit the people of the State.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes this is wrong.  It is based on Fine Gael's narrow ideological view.  Under the supply and confidence agreement, it will have the support of the Fianna F&aacute;il leader.  Why would he not support the Government?  Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party supported the EU fiscal rules which they now protest so much about.  Those who will benefit from this sell off are the insiders, fat cats, the elites and, of course, the vultures as the bank sells distressed loans.  Those who will lose are ordinary citizens.  They will lose a valuable strategic banking asset.  With this sell off, democratic accountability and influence over the bank will end.  It will probably be bought by a private bank and workers will have justifiable reason to be concerned about their terms and conditions.  Those who run small businesses and mortgage holders who find themselves dealing with a totally unaccountable private bank will get into more and more difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  This is probably the Taoiseach's last Leaders' Questions.  Like many other things, that is not quite clear yet.  On a personal level, I wish the Taoiseach and his wife, Fionnuala, and his clann all the best.  I wish him good luck and good health.  As he looks back over the last six years, he can take comfort from his consistency, at least on this issue.  He has been very consistent.  He is finishing where he started.  During the height of the Celtic tiger, Sinn F&eacute;in argued for the surplus to be invested in essential public services, including public health services and housing.  That was dismissed by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Green Party.

I am also conscious there has been a rebirth lately, with the prevailing narrative being that history will be kind to him.  However, when the dust settles, his legacy will be stained by the manner in which he handled the departure of the previous Garda Commissioner, a stain which has obviously cast a shadow over his willingness or ability to deal with the present one.  I put it to him, genuinely, that it is not too late to change tack.  It is not too late to act in the interests of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/p>  <p>  Last week under freedom of information legislation I received information from the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  It shows very clearly that officers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were well aware in 2014 that every breath test machine had a running total of the number of breath tests each time it was calibrated and that each machine was returned to a station with a form outlining the numbers.  The Garda actually had the information all along which the Garda Commissioner told us that it had only received in March this year and responded to promptly and loads of garda&iacute; knew about it.  The whistleblower Nick Keogh also received information last week under freedom of information legislation, which showed that in September 2016 written reports were being sought for the Commissioner on his treatment and the bullying and harassment to which he was being subject.  The Commissioner denied this at the justice committee.<\/p>  <p>  At the Committee of Public Accounts this morning we are getting an insight into the open warfare between the civilian heads and the Garda hierarchy.  This is unsustainable.  The auditor for the Garda is being deliberately obstructed in his work and that is without even mentioning the missing phone.  One does not need to be a rocket scientist to know that to lose one phone is careless but to lose two smacks of perverting the course of justice.  That is what it is, particularly when we know that the owner of the phone was the very person charged by the Minister with ensuring the retention of data and new procedures would be put in place after the old Commissioner had lost his phone.  Come on - it has gone too far at this stage.  No matter what way we look at it, it is a sackable offence.<\/p>  <p>  It is very clear that the tactic being used by the Commissioner in the O'Higgins investigation to impugn the motivation of Sergeant Maurice McCabe and undermine his testimony will be replicated in the Charleton inquiry, with this time Dave Taylor being scapegoated.  The work of the commission is being deliberately and consciously undermined, as we have known this for some through the existence of the tribunal liaison group inside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to filter the information given to Mr. Justice Charleton.  The continuance of this group is a threat to the effective operation of the Charleton inquiry.  What will the Taoiseach do about it?  Does he think it is acceptable that a commission set up by this House is having its work undermined?  I do not think it is fair for him to leave the decision to remove the Commissioner to either Simon or Leo.  A sign of a good leader is someone who says he or s he can change his or her mind.  It is not too late for the Taoiseach to ask the Commissioner to stand down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100017#P01100","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1496229300,"counter":153,"content":"<p>We have had a lot of discussions about this issue already.  The Government made the decision, which the Houses accepted, that the Charleton inquiry should be set up.  As I pointed out to Deputy Mick Barry yesterday, the appointment of Mr. Justice Charleton was exceptionally appropriate, having dealt with the Morris tribunal for over a decade in County Donegal.  I prefer to let him and his commission do their work.  I do not know whether the allegation about the particular phone being missing is true or not, but the justice has set out the timescale and the hearings that are to take place.  There will be public hearings of the commission in July on this very issue.  The Committee of Public Accounts is meeting this morning and I have heard some of the comments made about the discrepancies in some of the contributions being made.  Be that as it may, the House has set up a commission of investigation, a tribunal, to deal with this matter and no better person than Mr. Justice Charleton is dealing with it.  The Deputy's question about the previous Commissioner was the subject of a full-scale commission of investigation which made its judgment and ruling.  Obviously, the current Commissioner is one of the people whom I named yesterday as having legal representation at the Charleton inquiry.  The hearingswill take place in public in July, which is not too far distant.  I expect Mr. Justice Charleton to find out the veracity of the allegations, the facts and the truth.

Let us park the phone issue for now.  Let us look at the existence of the tribunal liaison group, a clearing house of hand-picked loyalists who have been employed or seconded inside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to filter the information being given to Mr. Justice Charleton.  The Taoiseach has not commented on this.  Does he have a problem with the fact that civilians are being employed in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with this outside the protocol which requires the Policing Authority to be informed.  Why were they picked?  What is going on?  The Taoiseach cannot dodge the issue as it will actually stain his legacy and I feel bad for him because of it.  It might make one of the two lads seem like a hero when in a couple of weeks' time the decision will be made by one of them.

At the same time the Taoiseach had become leader of a demoralised Fine Gael Party, which had suffered severe losses and lost many big names in that general election.  I am aware of the amount of energy and commitment he put into rebuilding the Fine Gael Party at that time, travelling the length and breadth of the country.  The Taoiseach is a man of huge energy.  I have seen that especially since he took on the role of Taoiseach.  There were times when I wondered what kept him going at such a pace.  However, as we all know, good things come to an end.

Whatever the decision of the Fine Gael electorate is, I hope that whoever is elected leader of the party will continue in government and will always make decisions in the interests of our people.

The sword of Damocles should not be held over boxing officials with the threat that if they do not come to heel their grants will be pulled, with key performance targets being mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100018#Q02300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1496229900,"counter":179,"content":"<p>The Deputy is over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100018#Q02400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1496229900,"counter":180,"content":"<p>In the name of God, our only successes in recent Olympics along with rowing have been our boxers.

The sports capital system has supported boxing clubs during the terms of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments over the years.  The number of young boys and girls involved in boxing as a discipline, science and sport continues to increase.  On Monday, I was in the north inner city and visited Ballybough Boxing Club.  It has brand new facilities and really good coaches and it is doing a wonderful job.  I am a big supporter of Bernard Dunne.  He is a wonderful example to young people.  He rose to become world champion in his weight division.  I hope the personalities involved in the matter raised by the Deputy can work this out.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, Irish boxers have been very successful in many Olympic Games.  Ireland is recognised by other countries as being outstanding in this regard and one of the top countries in the world.  I hope, therefore, that the powers that be, or the personalities within the IABA, along with the Minister of State dealing with this, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, and the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, can come to an understanding that is in the interest of thousands of young people and in order that there will be a body that works in everybody's interest.  After all, the Deputy's Government and a succession of Governments have put money into the facilities in Dublin and around the country.  Through these, young people learn discipline, character formation and the science of boxing, if that is what they love.  It is a sport in which they can rise to be world champions in their respective weight divisions.  The Deputy's message is one that I fully understand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100019#R00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1496230500,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I wish the Taoiseach the very best in retirement.  We may not agree with him most of the time but we certainly, on a personal level, wish him the very best.<\/p>  <p>  I have a question on promised legislation.  Yesterday, the Supreme Court ruled that the ban on asylum seekers working is unconstitutional.  It has suspended its order for six months to allow the Government and Oireachtas time to right this grave injustice.  This constitutional crisis arises in the first instance because of section 9(4) of the Refugee Act 1996, which prohibited a person seeking asylum from entering employment before the final determination of his or her application.  This Act was replaced by the International Protection Act 2015.  It also prohibits asylum seekers from seeking or entering employment, or being employed or otherwise engaged in any gainful work or occupation.  The direct provision system is a bad system that should have been scrapped a long time ago.  It keeps thousands of people trapped in a process that is not dehumanising and degrading.  It is also a costly system, on which Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments have spent over &euro;0.5 billion since 2009.  An tUachtar&aacute;n, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, has said the refusal to allow asylum seekers the right to work is heartbreaking and immoral.  He is correct in saying that.  Will the Taoiseach agree to discuss urgently with the Opposition parties emergency legislation that can be expedited in its passage through the Oireachtas?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100019#R00300","speaker":"1340"},{"type":"speech","time":1496230500,"counter":184,"content":"<p>This is an important judgment by the Supreme Court.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Minister of State with direct responsibility in this area, Deputy David Stanton, have done a lot of work on this.  Within the past month, before this judgment, they asked their officials to begin work to identify the options for and the barriers to asylum seekers gaining access to the labour market in particular circumstances.  This judgment, therefore, gives this work increased priority.  As the judgment has only just become available, as the Deputy is aware, the Department of Justice and Equality officials, together with the Office of the Attorney General, will examine it in the immediate future.  It is important to note that the International Protection Act, which introduces the single application procedure for protection applicants, was brought through the Oireachtas by the T&aacute;naiste and commenced on 30 December 2016.  That is important legislation.  The new Act is specifically designed to address the delays in decision-making on asylum claims.  Since the beginning of the year, applications have already been decided with applicants having been recognised as refugees who can access the labour market now.  Overall, 92% of the 173 recommendations in the McMahon report are now implemented or partially implemented, or are in progress.  That is a significant increase on the figure of 80% in the first audit of progress, which was published last June.  One hundred and twenty-one of the recommendations are now implemented, with a further 38 partially implemented or in progress.  It includes the key recommendation of the working group, that is, the one on the introduction of the single application procedure within our international protection process.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have any difficulty at all in saying to the Deputy that the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, in particular, will be happy to engage with Opposition Members to discuss the outcome of the ruling of the Supreme Court.

The board of the ADAPT drugs team has voted to close down its project.  There used to be three community drug projects: Hartstown-Huntstown, Blakestown-Mountview and Corduff-Mulhuddart.

I have only shared this Chamber with him for a short period of time but it has certainly been a positive experience on my part.  I wish to raise maternity services at Mayo University Hospital.  I am sure the Taoiseach is very much briefed and aware of the situation there.  Staff, unions and management have been to the Workplace Relations Commission as a result of the strike action a number of months ago.  They are all in agreement that there is a staff shortage.  According to a lady who gave birth just two months ago, when she entered the hospital on 25 March to have her baby, there was one main midwife and just about two qualified two midwives on duty.  She said that as she was having her baby, two other women were having their babies as well.  She said that she had just given birth when the midwife had to go running to two other rooms and then another.  She said that she felt so sorry for this midwife and that it was lucky that there were no complications with her delivery because if there had been, there was nobody else there to help her.  The issue has been ongoing for many months and the situation is not improving.  The issue apparently concerns the fact that there are only temporary contracts on offer, which is not enough to entice people to take up those positions.

I genuinely wish him well.  Unlike others, I have not had the opportunity of working with him - some might say despite the Taoiseach's best efforts.  I refer to chapter two of A Programme for a Partnership Government which relates to housing supply and the homelessness issue.  This is underpinned by the Rebuilding Ireland programme.  When that programme was published, I said that if it was implemented in full, it had the potential to have a significant positive impact.  From time to time, we ask questions - I want to be specific about this - and get replies.  The problem with the replies is that many of them do not hit the nail on the head.  In answer to questions about the ongoing problem - the rate of homelessness is as it was when the report was published - the Taoiseach has often said that it is a supply side issue.  The Government has a responsibility to deliver on supply side by adding new properties.  For example, the programme committed to delivering 200 rapid-build units in quarter four of 2016 and 800 such units in 2017.  A total of 22 have been delivered to date and 151 are scheduled.  This is 173 units out of a potential number of 1,000.  In terms of the delivery of new units, this is falling behind.  As one of his final acts, the Taoiseach needs not just to highlight it but, along with the Minister, to put down very specific timelines for the new builds so that we can put pressure politically and administratively because we are not moving at the rate which would have been anticipated ten or 11 months ago when that programme was published.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100021#T00500","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1496231700,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I will ask the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, who has the detail of this, to respond to the Deputy's query.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100021#T00600","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1496231700,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Not in detail, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100021#T00700","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1496231700,"counter":227,"content":"<p>To be helpful to the House, tomorrow or possibly later on this evening, we will publish the updated quarterly report on the delivery of the Rebuilding Ireland plan.

In my opinion, there is no necessity or justification to introduce what is an effective ban on having a substitute on the committee.  That kind of decision is normally reserved for the likes of the banking inquiry or the Committee of Public Accounts, where findings can be made against individuals or institutions with potential legal ramifications.  That is why the idea of not having any substitute and that a member must be there at all times was introduced.<\/p> <p> If this is introduced, it will discriminate against smaller parties which only have one nominee, which means five or six different groups.  It means that should anything happen to that one nominee, there cannot be any substitute at all, for example in the case of a single parent or someone having any family emergency or illness.  This arose for me, for example.  I do not go into personal issues in the D&aacute;il, but I was on the Committee on Housing and Homelessness last year and my husband was seriously ill, which led to him requiring a kidney transplant.  I had to get a substitute to go to a very few sessions, because I wanted to be on that committee.  What if something like this arises again?<\/p> <p> Members should consider that there are democratic issues here where small parties and groups which only have one nominee will not have the right to be replaced should that arise.  There is also the question of new politics.  It is now a reality, whether people in the big parties like it or not.  It is a reality that groups are sharing speaking time and so on.  It has been accepted by the D&aacute;il reform committee that this would be the case.  If two groups are sharing time, so what?  As long as they give a commitment that they will listen, that they will co-operate and there is a method and structure there, is there an issue?<\/p> <p> It also hits at pro-repeal and pro-choice smaller groups, which are the only ones that agree with the Citizens Assembly proposals, which is ironic, since the purpose here is to discuss the work of the assembly.  There are a number of women in particular - gender does not seem to be a consideration on this committee although it should be - who have played a role in the pro-repeal and pro-choice movement who want to give each other a chance to have an input into it.  What was being proposed was discussed in the Seanad, where the Civil Engagement group has an issue with this as well.  It had a meeting yesterday and proposed that one should be allowed to have a single named substitute, although one cannot have three or four different people going in, which has happened at previous committees.  I believe that is fair, and I therefore ask people not to change the rule, but to implement something like that as a code of practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100021#T01700","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496232300,"counter":238,"content":"<p>A Cheann Comhairle-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100022#U00200","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1496232300,"counter":239,"content":"<p>We are not getting into a debate on this.

There are other well-known cases of serial sex offenders and repeat offences in this country, where the offenders have made no effort to change their ways.<\/p><p>The effects of rape and other serious sexual offences on the communities and the victims are well-documented.  Serious sexual crimes do not only impose emotional and physical trauma upon the victims.<\/p><p>Such offences attack the unity and stability of society as a whole.  They clear away the protection that society offers to all its citizens.  If we allow serial sex offenders continue unchecked by going on and committing similar and more serious crime without imposing a longer sentence for the subsequent offence, then society as a whole is devalued.<\/p> <p> Numerous studies have shown that repeat sex offenders are arrested at a far higher rate than one-time offenders from the general population.  Therefore, society must be protected from repeat offenders whose behaviour has a direct impact on public safety and the well-being of society as a whole.  Figures also show that only a small number of sex offenders released from Irish jails undertook treatment programmes.  Garda&iacute; are also monitoring at any one time some 100 sex offenders who remain a threat to society.<\/p> <p> Repeat offending by sex offenders is an affront to any democratic society that seeks to protect its citizens.  It reflects the offender's determination not to abide by society's laws and regulations and the failure of the criminal justice system to deal with the offender.  We must show our support to these victims who have suffered at the hands of serial sex offenders in a meaningful way.<\/p> <p> I commend this Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100022#U02700","speaker":"1363","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496232900,"counter":265,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100023#V00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1496232900,"counter":266,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100023#V00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1496232900,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1496232900,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100023#V00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1496232900,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100023#V00600","speaker":"1363"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1496232900,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions","time":1496232900,"counter":271,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100023#V00725"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategy Statements","time":1496232900,"counter":272,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100023#V00750"},{"type":"question","time":1496232900,"counter":273,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[24360\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100023#V00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the details of the core activity of support for Independent Ministers in Government outlined in his Department's statement of strategy.

Many of these Ministers and Deputies are claiming success in various projects in their constituencies arising out of the negotiations establishing the Government last year and the public need more information in this regard.

The Government exists by the gift of Fianna F&aacute;il and the involvement of some Independent Deputies in the Cabinet.  The deal with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has already been referred to.  In recent weeks, we have also seen how the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has been able to step outside of his ministerial brief and pressurise the Government into adopting new procedures for the appointment of judges.  On other occasions, the support of individual Deputies has been dependent on the Government meeting their demands for specific investments in their own constituencies.  Last autumn, the Minister of State at the Department of  Education and Skill, Deputy John Halligan, threatened to resign if services were not increased in his local hospital.  All of this is reminiscent of times past when Fianna F&aacute;il was in a Government supported by Independents and Fine Gael was criticising such arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's Department has responsibility for managing the Ministers of the Independent Alliance.  Given that the D&aacute;il will vote on a new Taoiseach shortly and that a transition will take place in the make-up of the Cabinet, has the Taoiseach been involved in any conversations with his soon-to-be former Cabinet and ministerial colleagues about their support for the next Taoiseach?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100023#V01400","speaker":"1340"},{"type":"speech","time":1496232900,"counter":282,"content":"<p>In respect of the issue that the Deputy raises, it is important when an election is over that the judgment given by the people is then considered carefully to see is it possible to put a government together.  It took some time to put this one together last year.

Deputy Nolan will appreciate that the Constitution is clear in that the Government makes the appointments and the Cabinet must have choices when making those appointments.<\/p><p>Part of the discussions with the Independent Alliance was about the nature of that structure.  As the Deputies are aware, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, has been around for quite a number of years.  That board assesses the credentials, legal experience and the kinds of cases that candidates may have heard to determine their suitability for appointment to the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court, Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court.  What was approved yesterday by Government was the Judicial Appointments Bill which will now proceed through the Houses and hopefully become law this year.  The other Bill in respect of the conduct and the oversight of conduct by members of the Judiciary is the Judicial Council Bill.  <\/p> <p> This does not represent a Minister stepping outside his brief.  In this case, the Minister, Deputy Ross, working with his group of Deputies, said that this was an issue that they considered to be very important.  It became a focus of discussion between the parties in terms of including it in the programme for Government.  That is why it is there in the published document.  In the case of Waterford, this was not an issue that came out of the blue suddenly.  There was a very particular letter issued by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, which had been considered very carefully by the medical personnel in Waterford.

I am more concerned about the reports in last week's <i>Sunday Business Post <\/i>that after a year of lecturing us all on the probity and unacceptability of political interference or political selection of judges, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport said that not only did he hand pick them, he went through each application with a fine-tooth comb.  Is that proper?  Does the Taoiseach think it is proper that before judges are appointed, an individual member of the Cabinet would do that?  I can only imagine the high dudgeon if any member of the Fine Gael Party or a member of any party in a previous Government made that assertion when the current Minister was sitting in the back row of the Opposition benches.  He would have gone into high indignation at the notion that such political, improper interference in judicial appointments was occurring and yet he used a &quot;fine-tooth comb&quot; on each individual application and if they met his personal assessment, they were deemed appropriate.  Apparently that is not political interference because the Minister, Deputy Ross, is, as I said yesterday, like Donald Trump - he is not a politician.  He is to be seen in some different light.

The current arrangement is a little unusual in that one such Independent, Deputy Lowry, keeps telling his constituents that he has an arrangement with the Government and that he is getting preferential treatment but the Government keeps denying this.  The questions posed to the Taoiseach address a more novel innovation, namely, special support measures for Independent Deputies who are Ministers.  Every one of them has political staff of their own so it is unclear as to why extra staff would need to be paid for from the public purse.  The liaison unit to which the Taoiseach referred has three staff members.  At Cabinet level none of the three Independent Ministers is part of the same electoral or even D&aacute;il grouping so it cannot be argued that this is similar to any past arrangement for smaller parties.  Is it not true that the extra staff have been put in place specifically for the Minister, Deputy Ross, and his group?

This leads me to wonder who is actually in charge.  I do not doubt that the Taoiseach will have the seen the reports that a senior, although not very well informed, CDU spokesperson has said he cannot see how a hard Border can be avoided.  His argument is that the achievement of a soft Border will not be conceivable unless the four freedoms are recognised.  As the Taoiseach knows, the UK Government has already ruled out membership of the Single Market and the customs union.  It has not made a commitment to the free movement of people.  It is apparent that the four freedoms will not even be discussed, let alone delivered.<\/p>  <p>  There is an avalanche of evidence that we need to step up our work on the specifics of what exactly we are looking for and how it might work in practice.  We have to be prepared for the negotiations with the UK and the EU and for the major staffing implications of Brexit.  An audit of the staffing implications of the negotiations and the ongoing management of our relationship with the UK was promised some time ago.  Where is this audit?  Deputy Donnelly has done some very good work in this regard recently.  Yesterday, he highlighted that Enterprise Ireland has filled just 12 of the 39 additional posts it was sanctioned.  Ten additional posts were sanctioned for IDA Ireland, but just one of those positions has been filled.  Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority both received sanction for two extra posts, but none of those positions has been filled.  There is no sense of people looking forward to the negotiations and, beyond the negotiations, to the future strategic direction of this country.  There needs to be an assessment of where we need to deploy our strengths, our staff and our supports.<\/p>  <p>  I suggest there are inherent dangers in the approach that has been taken so far.  It is somewhat similar to the approach that was taken before last year's referendum in the UK, when there seemed to be a hope that everything will be all right on the night.  I believe people in Irish officialdom did not anticipate that the Brexit referendum would have a negative result and that people would vote to leave.  I think most of them believed that everything would work out and the \"Remain\" side would win.  I think there was a lack of preparation in advance of the Brexit vote and in the early days following the referendum.  I acknowledge that there has been a great deal of activity since then.  It seems from the Taoiseach's reply that we have yet to get our act together from a structural or staffing perspective in terms of our diplomatic postings, market diversification, Enterprise Ireland and foreign direct investment.  The Taoiseach might indicate the status of the audit he promised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100025#X00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1496234100,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I will bring in Deputies Nolan and Howlin to ask supplementary questions on foot of Questions Nos. 5 and 6.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100025#X00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1496234100,"counter":309,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach will become a backbencher in the coming weeks.

His comments could equally apply to the stance of the Irish Government.  Dr. Pfeiffer has raised doubts about the guarantee given by EU leaders last month that following Brexit, the North could rejoin the EU as part of a united Ireland.  Has the Taoiseach read this report?  Dr. Pfeiffer's comments draw attention again to the Taoiseach's insistence that the North must leave the EU as part of the Brexit negotiations.  This is a deeply flawed strategy.  The British are locked in a course of action that threatens the Good Friday Agreement.  All of this could be prevented if the North were to be designated as having special status within the EU.  This suggestion has been rejected by the Taoiseach even though he constantly tells us how special the North is and how he hopes Mrs. May will agree some mitigating measures in the Brexit negotiations.  This is gambling with the future of citizens in the North and along the Border corridor in the North and the South.<\/p><p>While I wish the Taoiseach well personally for the future, I believe his approach to Brexit has been gravely mistaken.  It is lacking in vision.  The British Government has recruited hundreds of additional staff to cope with the Brexit negotiations.  The EU has also allocated significant staffing and other resources to the negotiations.  Is the Taoiseach concerned that the Government has failed to recruit the relatively small number of additional staff that it said would be required by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland?

I commend the Taoiseach on the work he has done on Brexit.  We all have views on what could have been done differently.  I believe we will miss the extraordinary level of experience and, more importantly, real personal contact at the highest levels of government across the EU that the Taoiseach has brought to this State's negotiating capacity and its influence.  The Taoiseach might have a view on that.  Does he see any role for himself when he stands down as Taoiseach?  Maybe that will be a matter for his successor.  Having worked for several years with most of those who will be the key decision-makers as the negotiations unfold, the Taoiseach has a capacity to know their thinking.  What role does he see for himself in that regard?  I presume he will make himself available in the interests of the State to hold onto those contacts.  Perhaps this will be as an ambassador who brokers deals and talks to people to make sure the Irish point of view is heard, if not as a Minister with Brexit responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  Like others, I have been listening in great detail to some of the rhetoric and all of the discussion during the current UK election campaign.

This is in the absence of any knowledge of what the endgame - the desirable conclusion - should be.  The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, has been repeating the mantra that no deal is better than a bad deal.  Bluntly, no deal would be a catastrophe for this country and for her country.

I take the Deputy's comments in the spirit that he made them.<\/p>  <p>  The presentation of our priorities, as we see them, without having all of the information in so far as what the British Government's thinking is on this, have been reflected in the Commission, Parliament and Council.  However, as the Deputy pointed out, in terms of having as close as possible a working relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, which is what we have now as a member of the European Union, that will be changed by virtue of the fact that the Single Market will be gone and the trading status will be changed.  Therefore, when we go around that loop and come back to where we started we will be in a different position.  Even if no tariffs will apply in terms of trade, we will still have two different jurisdictions and the complications that would involve are obvious.  An Open Skies arrangement will have to be drawn up between the European Union and the United Kingdom, otherwise, aircraft will not be able cannot take off from here and land in London and go on to collect other passengers.  That is an issue that needs to be dealt with and it is being worked upon now.  We cannot wait for divorce to be concluded to do that.  <\/p>  <p>  The three issues identified by Michael Barnier here and agreed by Europe are the border, modalities and liabilities in terms of what the bill might be and the question of citizen's rights and reciprocal rights.  All these matters, as was rightly said, were never put to the people in a way that they would have had a real discussion about understanding them.  That is why our common travel area, which has been in place for 90 years covering  travel, residence and the right to work and to draw social benefits, is a bilateral arrangement between Ireland and the UK and it is different with respect to rights of the Polish people or Lithuanians or Latvians who live in Great Britain.  The European position is that if we want to have a parallel discussion begun, where we get into the meat of trade, we will have to make substantial progress in respect of the first three issues.

The unique circumstances of Ireland have been recognised as part of the negotiations from the outset. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s priority here has been to ensure that the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, including the Good Friday Agreement which already exists, is recognised and protected within the context of the Article 50 negotiations leading to a withdrawal agreement.  The Good Friday Agreement is an internationally recognised treaty, legally binding and registered with the UN.  This is a key distinguishing factor regarding what is a unique political and constitutional framework on the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As the Government has consistently said, the only way for us to influence this process and protect our national interests, including with regard to Northern Ireland and the common travel area, is to win the understanding and support of EU partners for Ireland&rsquo;s unique concerns.  From the outset, these concerns have been recognised as part of the negotiation guidelines, and we have achieved this understanding through the extensive programme of outreach and engagement undertaken with our EU partners.<\/p>  <p>  There will be a separate agreement on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU, which is likely to cover a broad range of policy areas, including trade, and which is likely to take longer to conclude than the EU-UK exit agreement.

An EU-UK exit agreement will be approved by a majority in the European Council, therefore no one member state will be in a position to block or veto a deal.  Even if it were possible to veto a deal, it would not mean that the UK would not leave because under Article 50, it would simply mean that the UK would depart without appropriate arrangements in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100026#Y01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1496234700,"counter":330,"content":"<p>This may or may not be my last interaction in the Chamber directly with the Deputy as Taoiseach and in case it is I want to acknowledge the work he has done over the last few years.

The Government's line to date has been that everybody has a veto and, therefore, Spain's veto is just a restatement of what it has, Ireland has a veto and every member state has a veto.  However, on 16 May the European Court of Justice made a ruling on the new free trade agreement with Singapore and it states that the European Commission has competence.  In other words, no member state can exercise a veto on a wide range of areas, including market access, investment protection, intellectual property protection, competition, sustainable development, transport, road transport, rail transport, waterways transport, public procurement, non-direct investment, institutional provisions, notification, verification, mediation and so forth.<\/p><p>The European Court of Justice ruling only found two specific areas where member states have competence.  None of us knows but it is possible that the separation agreement could be bundled into areas where the European Commission has competence; they are wide-ranging and directly affect our relationship with the United Kingdom and jobs in Ireland.  If they are bundled, it is possible we would have no veto.  If that were done, Spain would still have a veto as it has a veto on the agreement in totality as it pertains to Gibraltar.<\/p> <p> Given the exposure we have and that words are just words - we had words in July 2012 on bondholder burden sharing but nothing happened - why did the Government not at least seek a veto?

As the Deputy is aware from sitting very close to where Mr. Barnier spoke, this is one of the three priorities that needs to be dealt with.  The first priority is the question of modalities and liabilities and the charge on the United Kingdom for leaving the European Union.  This refers to a range of issues where contracts are in place or moneys are paid out of the European budget.  There will be a difficulty in that if there is a &euro;12 billion hole in the budget on a yearly basis, who is going to pay the extra or what programmes will be cut.  Mr. Barnier stated that no country currently contributing to the European Union budget wants to pay any more and all of those in receipt of capital, grants and so on from the European Union do not want to receive any less.  There will be a real problem if that is the scale of what is involved.<\/p><p>The Deputy asked if the matter was discussed and it was.  Mr. Barnier is a negotiator for Ireland and the Border is one of the first priorities.  One of the second priorities relates to the rights of citizens and reciprocal rights for people from the UK living in the EU and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  The Deputy mentioned the Good Friday Agreement and when people voted on that in the beginning, they did so with the expectation of being able to continue as European citizens with European rights.  Every person in Northern Ireland is entitled to Irish citizenship and, therefore, European citizenship.  We want to see that retained and the common travel area between here and the UK is a matter for bilateral discussion.  It is not a case of not referring to this as it is very much the focus of our attention.  We want this dealt with very early on, and Mr. Barnier made this point himself publicly on many occasions.  The Border issue should not become a bargaining point in respect of Ireland at some later time during more detailed discussions on trade etc.  That is why it is one of the three priorities.<\/p><p>Deputy Howlin set out the position about the majority, equating to 72% of member states and 65% of the population.  He is correct in that it would be a hollow victory.  We do not want to have the case of negotiations coming to a finality at the European Council and finding ourselves stranded.  That is why we have people on the negotiating task force who are in very close contact with our committee of permanent representatives to the EU, COREPER, and sherpa people in Brussels, so we know what is going on at all times in respect of the negotiating stances.  I take the point of Deputies Howlin and Donnelly that it is very important for us in building those relationships to have our position cleared very early on.  In fairness, most of the other European countries may not have as much interest as we do in Brexit because we are so close to Britain and for so many other reasons but they will become very interested if the hole in the budget will have an impact on programmes and structures in their countries.  They might not have associated that with Brexit but if scheme X or Y is cut back or abolished altogether, people could become very interested politically.<\/p><p>I agree with the sentiments that we need to do the work now and this will absorb so much political time from so many leaders over the next number of years.

The calculations used are well grounded and underpinned by a recognised methodology.  They are a performance management metric used to monitor the progress of control, compliance and anti-fraud work in my Department.  The overall metric consists of overpayments and savings that arise from internally initiated reviews and investigation activity.<\/p>  <p>  The total value of control and anti-fraud savings recorded by my Department in 2016 was &euro;506 million.  This figure represents the outcome of nearly 950,000 reviews and investigations undertaken by my officials across the board of schemes and programmes.  Such savings will only be recorded in cases where a social welfare claim is reduced in value or terminated following a review or investigation initiated by the Department.  The basis of the savings calculated is scheme-specific.  The nature of the scheme is taken into account, in particular whether it is short-term - for example, jobseeker's benefit or supplementary welfare allowance - or more long-term such as the State pension.  This takes into account the length of time a person who has a claim reduced or terminated is expected to remain off a particular scheme or at the reduced rate of payment.  The multipliers used in these calculations are based on observed behaviour and historical data for claims.  If there is a reduction in the value of the payment or if the payment is terminated, the sum overpaid is calculated and put to the claimant and, if accepted, recovery actions commence soon after.  As for future payments, only the difference between the current value and the previous value is counted.  This difference or the full value if the payment is terminated, together with the expected number of weeks a person remains off a payment, is used as the basis for the calculation of the savings achieved for the future.  As I have outlined, he number of weeks varies between long and short-term schemes.  If a person disagrees with our decision, he or she can seek an appeal to the social welfare appeals office.  Only the final outcome is considered.<\/p>  <p>  The methodology has been developed by my Department with support from the Central Statistics Office and is based on similar methodologies used in a number of countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia.  It is kept under review to reflect the changes in claim patterns.  The Department will examine the methodology in the context of renewing the compliance and anti-fraud strategy 2014 to 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100028#AA01800","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1496235900,"counter":353,"content":"<p>In a previous written reply the Minister told me that the breakdown was between overpayments and pure fraud necessitating a prosecution and that the figure attributable to pure fraud was &euro;41 million out of the sum of &euro;506 million.  I have some concerns about the nature of the anti-fraud campaign and the follow-up which we will discuss tomorrow at the social welfare committee, particularly the publicising of lists.  I do not know how this will prevent future potential social welfare fraudsters.  A comparison has been made between the proposed list and the Revenue list, but there is a fundamental difference between the two.  Most Revenue defaulters do not go through the courts; there is a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners.  If the list is not published, people will never know that the settlement took place.  In the case of social welfare fraudsters, people are invariably prosecuted and their cases go through the courts.  The courts are public and, as the Minister will be aware, cases are always widely publicised at national level and receive much publicity at local level.  There are many other criminal activities such as murder, fraud unrelated to social welfare payments, armed robbery, etc.  When these cases take place, they are all publicised, but if subsequent publicisation would deter people from committing such crimes in the future, perhaps it is a system we might use across the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100028#AA01900","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1496235900,"counter":354,"content":"<p>As the Deputy knows, we will have a chance to discuss this issue tomorrow at the committee.

To clarify some numbers that I know are in the public domain - I have seen them carried in some of the newspapers and online - the figures given by my Department for suspected identity fraud were not correct.  I see some coverage in the newspapers today suggesting there has been only one case of suspected identity fraud this year.  That is not the case.  In fact, there have been 11 such cases.

Therefore, there is much ongoing activity.  As I said, I will return to the matter with the Minister's officials tomorrow when we debate this section.  The idea is to publish the list within three months after the end of the quarter in which the offence is successfully prosecuted and the offender convicted.

However, in doing so, the board is obliged to ensure that it and its service delivery partners comply with standards as set out in the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and meet Comptroller and Auditor General requirements.  This is the context in which the board has made its decision to restructure the governance arrangements of local CIS and MABS companies.  I accept the bona fides of the board in its decision.  <\/p>  <p>  The CIB undertook a series of regional consultations with stakeholders this month to discuss key aspects of implementing the new model.  These were attended by 127 representatives of local company boards and 223 representatives of management, staff and volunteers of local services.  Each session was chaired by an independent facilitator.  Attendees had an opportunity to raise their concerns about service delivery under the new model.  The board will host further sessions over the summer on key areas such as the role of volunteers, the delivery of consistent high quality services countrywide and the preservation of the fundamentally valuable local community focus and support ethos within the new regional model.<\/p><p>The board has also established an implementation group with cross-sectoral representation to assist in the governance reorganisation and committed to carrying out a full cost-benefit analysis of the 16-company model.  I am satisfied that the board is making efforts to allay the concerns of staff, boards and volunteers and genuinely seeking to preserve the strong community ethos of services and embed these important values as it transitions to its new governance model. <\/p> <p> I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100029#BB01900","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496237100,"counter":383,"content":"<p>The Minister will find that the commitments given by the Citizens Information Board, certainly in relation to the staff, only apply for the lifetime of the implementation process.

To the best of my knowledge, we have received a response from the board, but we have not had one from the Department.  I hope I am not breaking any rule in putting the following to the Minister.  All parties represented on the committee, including the Minister's, have unanimously recommended that this process be stopped in its tracks.

The Minister mentioned the consultation process, but what the people being consulted wanted to be consulted about was whether the reorganisation was a good idea.  What they were actually consulted about was how the reorganisation would take place.  In other words, they were told the decision had been taken and that it did not matter what they said.  They were to be consulted about marginal and minor matters of implementation.  That is the only consultation which has taken place.

The view among staff and managers is, however, more mixed.  Some of them can see the benefit in reporting to a regionalised board rather than having a local board for every individual office.

Turas Nua is headquartered in Roscrea, County Tipperary, where it employs 39 people.  The aim of the service is to assist jobseekers in finding sustainable full-time employment.  This is in contrast to the community employment schemes which provide part-time employment and training opportunities in local communities as a stepping stone back to employment for people on a range of social welfare payments, including the long-term unemployed, those who are parenting alone or who are in receipt of other social welfare payments.  The Deputy will appreciate that the welcome reduction in the unemployment rate is a factor in recruitment to all programmes.  However, the data available to my Department show that the number of people who have participated in the various schemes since the introduction of JobPath in 2015 has been relatively stable.<\/p>  <p>  I recently announced changes to the terms and conditions for participation in community employment schemes.  The main purpose of the changes is to broaden the availability of the programme to a greater number of people on the live register and standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate in the programme.  Among the changes I plan to introduce next month will be a reduction in the general qualifying age for those on the live register from 25 years to 21.  This will give more young people the opportunity to participate in community employment schemes.  In addition, I have agreed to review the current participation limits for older people and a decision will be made in this regard in the summer.  As part of the implementation of the new measures, my Department is consulting with key stakeholders across the country.  If any scheme is experiencing particular difficulties, it should contact the local Intreo office for assistance.<\/p>  <p>  An analysis of employment outcomes for JobPath participants shows that they have a higher chance of securing and remaining in a job than others with a similar duration of unemployment.  The complete details are available on the Department's website.  Given that only a small number of people have completed their full engagement with JobPath, these results can only be treated as indicative at this stage.  Nevertheless, they are very encouraging.  My Department will be publishing similar performance reports for each successive quarter as jobseekers complete their 12-month engagement period, with the next results to be published in the coming weeks.  In addition, my Department will have an econometric review of the JobPath service which will commence later this year when participant numbers will have reached a level to support a robust review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100030#CC01900","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1496237100,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I hope the Minister's engagement with schemes like mine and those of other Deputies will continue.

I have said the following to the Minister on a number of times, as have others.  I have been chairman of a scheme since 1998 which should have 17 participants.  We are now short five and cannot find them, despite having approached the Intreo office and everybody else.  They are all being sucked into Turas Nua which is aggressive in recruiting people because it is paid according to the number of participants in a scheme.

I want to work out the detail of what the Minister will do, recognising, as I see it, that the current system is deeply unfair particularly for parents in the home.  We support every couple in whatever parenting they do.  There is an almost &euro;4,500 difference in take-home pay between a dual income couple with an income of &euro;50,000 between the two of them and a single-income family because our individualised tax system discriminates against single-family payments.  It is the same with the new system the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has introduced.  I very much welcome it, but it introduces a further &euro;2,000 disadvantage to anyone who may decide to raise children at home.  A total of 75% of Irish children are raised by parents choosing that option but everything we do says not to do it.

It is important that we subsidise child care.  The cost of child care is a major barrier to work for many people, men and women, but particularly lone parents.  The measures coming into place from September will make a big difference and will change quite considerably the household calculations people must make.  It is only a start but it is a very important start and I am very much behind what the Government is doing in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  I agree it is important.  It is good social policy and probably good economic policy also to facilitate the choice of parents.  Some parents do choose to try to get by on one income, and often make significant sacrifices to do so, because it is their decision they would like to have a parent in the home, or a parent who is largely in the home.  This is why I put in my paper recognition we need to take account of this.  In my view, the best way to do this is by continuing to increase the homemaker's tax credit.  There was an increase in the homemaker's tax credit in the budget just gone by, but I anticipate it could be increased progressively and substantially, as resources allow, to cover exactly with the Deputy is speaking about.<\/p>  <p>  I note the enthusiasm of my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for bringing the Green Party into Government, and perhaps this is one of the areas where Deputy Ryan and I agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100031#DD00900","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1496237700,"counter":418,"content":"<p>That depends on how far the Minister goes.  There was an increase in the homemaker's tax credit in the previous budget but it was buttons.  Fundamentally, the message from the Government has been it will support people who care for other people's children and it will pay for it, but if people care for their own children it does not care and those people do not matter.  This needs to change at scale.  This cannot just be a marginal few bob here, a few bob in the next budget and a few bob promised in five or ten years' time.  The reason I was interested in the line in the Minister's paper, where he stated we must value caring work, is I believe it is a quintessential central economic issue that we must change our ways.  The Minister is right that it is a better economy.  Elizabeth Warren has described what happens to economies which are tied into supporting only one type of option.  They end up with consequences in property prices and the dual income trap about which she has written.  It is bad economics as well as being fundamentally wrong.<\/p>  <p>  I would very much like to see the homemaker's tax credit increased, but there would be people left out, such as lone parents, people below the tax income and single-parent families.  It does not address all of the inequities that exist.  To go into the detail of it, and I will not negotiate here but I want to give an idea to those parents who have an acute interest in it, what scale of change would the Minister make to the tax credit?

We have child benefit in Ireland, which is at the higher end of child benefit payments throughout the world.  It is universal and does not make any distinction between parents who decide to parent at home or those who decide to or have to work outside the home.  It is not always a decision to have two incomes.  Some people have to do so because of the cost of living.  When we were negotiating, alongside the former Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, the free GP care for children aged under six, I was very conscious of the impact it would have on household budgets.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of increasing the homemaker's tax credit is &euro;7 million for every &euro;100 in the credit.  I did not specify an amount in the paper I produced because, as I stated in the paper, everything is contingent on the public finances and the ability to pay.  I acknowledge that a &euro;100 increase in the homemaker's tax credit is quite small.  It is very modest.  What I have in mind is something much greater than this.  What the Deputy is touching on, and what I need to do a lot more work on, and certainly the next Minister for Finance might be able to do some work on it, is whether the homemaker's tax credit could be made refundable.  This would entirely deal with the issue the Deputy mentioned.

I would support a move towards a system of refundable tax credits and pressure being put on the Department of Finance in that regard.  I have been in that position previously and it was not easy to get it over the line.  We should consider it.  There are other measures the Minister might also include in the mix for inclusion in the budget.  Many parents were caught out by the reductions that were applied to the one-parent family payment and the restriction to children aged seven years.  If one's child was over seven years of age, one did not apply for any of the credit.  Many single parents who were not able to gain any income, let alone dual income, were particularly disadvantaged.  It is a target group.  When considering addressing acute poverty, that is another measure we should examine.<\/p>  <p>  Last but not least, I heard the Minister mention recently that he was considering increases in parental leave, maternity leave and other leave arrangements.  Ireland is often mentioned with other Scandinavian countries such as Finland, Denmark and Norway which have a much better system of such leave arrangements.  These arrangements must also be in the mix in order that people who wish to work would be given the capability to take longer breaks.

If we can afford it, through a far more modern social insurance system, the payment should be pay related.  It used to be a pay related benefit.  Obviously, it must be balanced against the impact on labour costs.  That must also be taken into account.  However, some of the best employers in the country such as some of the multinationals offer the best parental leave arrangements.  Facebook, for example, offers four months paid paternal leave, which is extraordinary.  I am not sure if SMEs could afford to do it, but it shows that an increasing number of employers are understanding finding and keeping good staff can be linked with the benefits and terms and conditions they provide.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke to many of my counterpart Ministers in the Nordic countries, as well as in Estonia and the Baltic states.

They are interested only in shifting people on to Seetec and so on, regardless of whether they are suitable.  When they get their claws in, it is like an alligator getting one between its teeth.

One is required to have a high standard of education to operate computers and associated software, thereby contradicting the whole ethos.<\/p>  <p>  Participants coming off T&uacute;s schemes are immediately eligible to commence on community employment schemes involving child care but with environmental schemes the participant must go back on payments for two weeks before becoming eligible for a community employment scheme longer than one year.  Can the approach to all community employment schemes be harmonised?  There is not enough awareness of community employment among the unemployed on the live register.  How can this be rectified?  Can there be a public awareness programme introduced on a pilot basis by the Department of Social Protection?  The period of participation on child care schemes is three years.  Environmental scheme participants are initially allocated just one year.  Why can it not be the same?  Why can it not be three years for everything?  Let us have a level playing park.  If some schemes are for one year and others are for three, one will of course go on the three-year one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100033#FF00700","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1496238900,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I am not really sure what Deputy Brady was referring to when he spoke about jobseekers not being suitable for employment.

FIS is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low-paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take up employment.  There are currently almost 57,000 families with more than 126,000 children in receipt of FIS.  The estimated spend on FIS this year is approximately &euro;422 million.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a steady growth both in the number of families supported by FIS over recent years and associated expenditure, with numbers in receipt of FIS rising from around 32,000 families with more than 73,000 children in 2012 to almost 57,000 families and over 125,000 children by the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Expenditure on FIS has more than doubled from &euro;224 million in 2012 to an estimate of &euro;422 million for this year.  <\/p>  <p>  A number of factors have led to the increase, including a substantial increase in the numbers of people in employment, as well as increases in the FIS thresholds in 2016, which made more people eligible for FIS.  <\/p>  <p>  For example, the number of people in employment has increased over the past four years from 1.86 million people in 2013 to more than 2 million now.

Many people who were entitled to FIS may not have known that they were in the past.<\/p>  <p>  Another reason is the transition of people from the one-parent family payment to FIS.  Over this period, more than 10,700 lone parents transitioned onto FIS and of these approximately one third were new FIS recipients.<\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned before, budget 2016 increased the income limit thresholds by &euro;5 for families with one child and by &euro;10 for families with two or more children.

The information campaign and the fact that the lone parent reforms mean fewer people are on one-parent family payment and more people are on FIS.  Therefore, there are four reasons.  One of them is the increase in employment.  It is arguable as to whether an increase in low-paid jobs is a cause.  I know that the Deputy believes that, but if one looks at the numbers and statistics, it is questionable.  For example, we know from the 2015 CSO survey on income and living conditions that incomes rose by about 5% that year.

The Government has decided to implement some of these while others will require further reflection and a consultation process with disability groups, which my Department has commenced.<\/p>  <p>  I announced a number of immediate changes at the launch of the report in April including a measure to ensure that people with a long-term disability payment who move off the payment to get a job will retain their free travel pass for a period of five years.  This is an improvement on the three-year period recommended in the report.  This change has now been implemented.  I also accepted the report's recommendation to dispense with the requirement that work be of a \"rehabilitative nature\" for the disability allowance, DA, earnings disregard.  Legislation to give effect to this change is included in the forthcoming Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The income disregard and means test for carers is one of the least onerous within the social protection system.

Community employment schemes are different.  They provide part-time work experience and training opportunities in local communities as a stepping stone back to employment for people on a range of social welfare payments, including those on long-term unemployment payments <\/p>  <p>  Jobseekers who are already participating with the JobPath service will not be referred to community employment schemes as they can only participate with one activation scheme or service at a time.  This allows the scheme and service providers sufficient time to work with the participants in order to develop their skills and competencies to pursue suitable job opportunities which may result in sustainable employment and also to ensure the best use is made of the available places on all activation supports.<\/p>  <p>  However, customers who on the date of their referral to JobPath have a written offer with a start date within four weeks for community employment or T&uacute;s will be allowed to take up the placement.  Additionally, in a small number of exceptional cases, which are assessed on a case-by-case basis, my Department may facilitate a customer to move from one activation support to another but it is not something we encourage.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, the Government approved the implementation of a number of changes to the terms and conditions of participation on community employment.  The main purpose of these changes is to broaden the availability of community employment to a greater number of people on the live register and to standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate on the programme.<\/p>  <p>  Those jobseekers who have completed their 52-week engagement with JobPath without finding suitable and sustainable employment are being referred back to their Intreo centres for an assessment by one of my Department's case officers.  They may then apply for other activation supports such as community employment thus ensuring ongoing availability to all schemes.

The homemaker's credit scheme introduced in 1994 does not address this issue for women who worked in the home before 1994.  I wonder if the Minister's Department has costings on extending it to take care of that group of people who are affected by this from before 1994.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100036#JJ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1496240700,"counter":491,"content":"<p>Entitlement levels to the contributory State pension are calculated by means of a yearly average calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life.  Payment rates are banded to reflect a person&rsquo;s contribution history.  Volunteer development workers who work abroad in developing countries are exempt from paying social insurance contributions while abroad.  They may, however, be awarded credited contributions - or credits - for the duration of their absence, up to an aggregate of 5 years.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for the contributory State pension easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in 1994, allows gaps of up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated people to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  The scheme does not involve the award of credits.  Pensioners who qualify for one of these schemes still need to fulfil the eligibility requirements of the contributory State pension, notably they must have paid at least 520 weekly contributions.  That is roughly ten years working out of a potential 50.<\/p>  <p>  Any proposals to extend the scope of the homemaker's scheme or the volunteer development worker scheme would have very significant cost implications, and would have to be considered in the context of future budgets.  When someone does not qualify for a full-rate contributory pension, that person may qualify for an alternative payment, such as an increase for a qualified adult, where his or her spouse has a contributory pension or a means-tested non-contributory State pension.  My Department is currently working on the development of a total contributions approach to replace the current yearly averaging system for the calculation of the contributory State pension.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this is being considered very carefully in developing this reform.  To answer the Deputy's question, the estimate that we have if we were to leave the scheme as it is and backdate or allow time before 1994 to be reckoned is that the cost would be &euro;290 million every year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100036#JJ01800","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1496240700,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response and am mindful that any changes made to pension entitlement have a knock-on impact and an ever-increasing budget would be needed to address that without having to make cuts in other areas.  The homemaker's credit scheme in 1994 was to make qualification easier for those who took time out for caring.  It allows for up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 or those incapacitated, and for that time to be disregarded for pension purposes.  In effect, it has reduced the number of years a person's contribution is divided by.  It does not actually confer any extra credits.  The 20 years spent caring have to be after 1994, so somebody who is 66 in this year, 2017, and is retiring would have been 43 back in 1994, and much of that person's caring would have been done already.  That cohort of people is affected, many of which are my constituents.  Many are female.  If one looks at the State pension, two thirds of recipients of the contributory payment are male, at 64%, compared to one third being female, at 36%.  Yet those in receipt of full payment are 79% male and 21% female, showing that the impact is very much on women who took that time out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100036#JJ01900","speaker":"1237"},{"type":"speech","time":1496240700,"counter":493,"content":"<p>The scheme was introduced in 1994 by the then Minister, former Deputy Michael Woods, and was a very progressive measure at the time.

Using &euro;290 million from the social protection budget in any given year would be very difficult.  A consequent decision would have to be made, for example, not to increase pensions at all for a year in order to allow for reform of that scale.  I am not sure how well that would be received, if at all.  The distributional effect would tend to benefit better-off retired couples rather than the least well-off retired couples, if it were to be done.

If somebody did not work before that person took care of his or her family and then went to work afterwards, in his or her 40s, and did 20 years, it seems unfair that that person is entitled to a bigger pension than somebody who started working at 17 or 18, maybe had a family in his or her 20s, and then went back to work afterwards.  That is an anomaly.  Similarly, with the volunteer development worker scheme that was introduced on 6 April 1983, I have an example of a constituent who took time out before 1983 to volunteer abroad for a couple of years.  That person feels penalised now and is on a lesser pension than if that person had stayed at home.

Clearly, this is a very important judgment and its full implications are being examined carefully.  The court recognises the complexities of this issue in that it acknowledges the Executive function in not only controlling who should enter the State but also in regulating the activities of non-citizens while in the State.  It has also had to consider the distinctions in rights between citizens and non-citizens in the context of Article 40.1 of the Constitution.<\/p><p>  The right of asylum seekers to work is an issue I have raised previously and in recent weeks both the T&aacute;naiste and I asked our officials to begin work to identify the options for and barriers to asylum seekers in accessing the labour market in particular defined circumstances.  Yesterday&rsquo;s judgment gives this work increased emphasis and priority.  The judgment has concluded that an absolute ban on the right to work, as distinct from a time limit being set in legislation or by some other means, is contrary to rights under Article 40.1 of the Constitution.  The court recognises that this is a matter for the Executive and the Legislature to consider and, accordingly, has adjourned consideration of what order it should make for a period of six months.  Full consideration will be given to the judgment in the coming period and it is expected that the State will make submissions to the court on the format of the order it is to make at the appropriate time.<\/p><p>  The judgment raises obvious policy, legal and operational issues and my Department, working with the Office of the Attorney General and in consultation with other Departments, will be examining its impacts in the coming period.  Proposals will be brought to the Government as soon as that process concludes.  Contributions from Members of this House to this process will also be carefully considered.<\/p><p>  The judgment should not be looked at in isolation without recognising the considerable changes that have already been made to the system of international protection and the improvements that have been made and are continuing to be made to the direct provision system.  The new asylum legislation which commenced on 31 December last has been specifically designed to address the delays in decision making which resulted in increased time spent in direct provision accommodation.  Positive determinations have been made in 115 cases in the first three months of this year, the result of which is that the individuals in question are fully entitled to access the labour market.<\/p><p>Regarding the overall length of stay in direct provision accommodation, since the working group led by Mr. Justice McMahon examined the issue, there has been a radical improvement in the length of time persons spend in the direct provision system.  Figures show that 72% have been in direct provision accommodation for three years or less since the date of their application.  This compares to a figure of 36% for persons who had been there for three years or less when the data were compiled for the working group in 2015.  In other words, there has been a complete reversal in the profile of the length of stay since the working group examined the matter.  These improvements are as a result of concerted efforts to deal with the cases of applicants five or more years in the system.  <\/p><p>Overall, 92% of the McMahon report&rsquo;s 173 recommendations have been implemented, partially implemented or are in progress.  This is a significant increase on the figure of 80% reported in the first audit of progress published last June.  That means 121 of the recommendations made have been implemented, with a further 38 either partially implemented or in progress.  Two of the most recent recommendations to be implemented involve bringing the offices of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children into the system whereby they can now hear complaints from residents of direct provision centres.  <\/p><p>  The McMahon report also focused on improvements in living conditions in direct provision centres.  A programme of independent living is being rolled out across the centres to enable residents to have access to self-catering options.  A self-catering system is in operation in Mosney, with further kitchens installed and becoming available for use by residents in centres in Clonakilty, on the Kinsale Road, in Knocklisheen and St Patrick&rsquo;s in Monaghan.  In addition, a food hall was opened at Mosney in January this year which allows residents to acquire their own food through a points system.<\/p><p>  The question of the right to work is closely intertwined with the processing times for first instance decisions.  In many EU member states the right to work is not unfettered.  It often arises after a particular period of time, usually nine months to one year, and in many instances is limited to particular job categories.  In Sweden and Portugal, for example, the granting of a right to work coincides with the withdrawal of financial supports.  One of the principal aims of the International Protection Act is to process cases as quickly as possible in orrder that persons granted permission to stay will have an automatic right to work.  Providing for a legal or practical limitation on the time taken to process an application for asylum is one option mentioned in the judgment that may be permissible.  This will be a matter for further consideration.<\/p><p>The full implications of the judgment are being examined, including the wider implications for the operation of the common travel area and the upcoming Brexit negotiations.  However, what can be said at this point is that the Government, through its various measures to improve processing rates, is moving to the stage where first instance decisions on status will be made as quickly as possible, with persons granted status having an automatic right to work.  Clearly, the alignment of these important developments will form part of the detailed consideration and response to yesterday&rsquo;s Supreme Court judgment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100038#LL00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1496241900,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  It is good to know that he, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality and officials in the Department have started examining and working on the judgment.  It is also welcome that 92% of the 173 of the recommendations made the McMahon report have been implemented.  Will the Minister of State clarify when we can expect to see legislation to implement the Supreme Court's judgment?  Does the Department intend to legislate as per the recommendation made in the McMahon report which makes specific reference to providing access to the labour market for applicants who are awaiting a first instance decision for nine months or more and who have co-operated with the protection process?  The recommendation reflects the minimum standard across several EU member states.

What he has said is that those who are granted permission to stay have an automatic right to work.  What about those who are waiting for permission to stay?  Even if they have been here for only nine months, with every hungry belly there is a pair of hands and often a very good brain.  Many of the people concerned are highly educated and well trained and have a lot to contribute to society.  It appears that the Government is worried that an unfettered right to work for asylum seekers would have a huge impact on the Brexit negotiations, but I do not understand that argument.  Just because a person has the right to work does not mean that he or she has the right to leave the country when he or she is seeking asylum here.  All it says to me is that the Irish Government and the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, are scared stiff of asylum seekers and immigrants who are fleeing war, famine, persecution and dictatorships.  It tallies very nicely with Theresa May's policies and the fortress Europe policy.  That is what the Government is worried about.  It is concerned about the impact on Brexit if it allows asylum seekers to use their labour and brains to make a difference and seek a better life in this country.  That is both racist and wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100038#LL00400","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1496241900,"counter":519,"content":"<p>The provision of direct provision centres has been a shameful episode in the history of the nation.

I would like to share one minute of my time with Deputy Mary Butler because she has concerns about this important matter which I am raising on behalf of the families, residents and staff of the Camphill community in Ballytobin, County Kilkenny.  In recent days the independent regulator, HIQA, has issued a notice of determination to cancel the registration of the Ballytobin facility.  It followed a two-week stay during which those involved with the Camphill community in Ballytobin had a short opportunity to address issues related to safeguarding and governance.  The notice of determination came as a shock to many parents who were under the impression that the community was very close to HIQA registration in October 2016.  The parents and guardians of residents of the facility are concerned that their loved ones will face relocation if a resolution to this HIQA action cannot be found.  That would be very unfortunate.  Parents have told me about the great respect they have for the staff at the facility.  Staff have established fantastic relationships with residents, some of whom have been at Ballytobin for over 40 years.  Parents and residents are hopeful that if another service provider can be found and the issues flagged by HIQA can be identified and rectified, the community could be retained in its current form.  If the residents of the Camphill community in Ballytobin have to be relocated to an alternative location, they will face a tough adjustment.<\/p><p>I have taken many calls from parents and guardians who have huge praise for the unique and holistic approach taken at the Camphill facility in Ballytobin where heavy medication is a last resort.  One mother has told me she is extremely worried that as a result of this decision, her son will be heavily medicated for behavioural challenges and will not experience the fullness of life he currently enjoys as a resident of the Camphill community in Ballytobin.  I have also been contacted by a musician who regularly visits the community.  This is how he has described his time at Ballytobin:<\/p><blockquote>My experience of life in Ballytobin from an outside perspective has been of a community full of joy and happiness.  The relationship between the co-workers and residents seemed to me to be both professional and deeply caring.  I have never experienced such a close bond in any other care community anywhere.<\/blockquote><p>The parents, guardians, staff and residents are desperate for this unique community to be saved, but that will not happen unless the HSE takes temporary charge until an alternative service provider can be secured.  It would be a shame to close the facility owing to minor red tape infractions which could be easily identified and rectified.

We cannot fail the many residents of the Camphill community in Ballytobin, including one of my constituents, Caroline, who has called it home for the last 17 years.  In the light of the unique setting of this unique community, we would certainly like to protect this model to help the most vulnerable people in the country.  There are 19 adults at risk of losing what has essentially been their home for up to 43 years in some cases.  As I said, this community setting works.

The report was to have been made available in March or April this year, but we are now at the end of May and it is still not available.<\/p>  <p>  The anomalies in the current social welfare rules and regulations make it virtually impossible for seasonal part-time workers to access social welfare entitlements when the season ends.  The requirement for such workers to make a further 13 weeks of contributions within the final 78 days of their existing claim period of 234 days is particularly problematic.  It is just not possible.  Depending on the day on which existing claims expire, it does not allow for the seasonality of the sectors to which I have referred.  Some workers' claims are expiring when seasonal work is no longer available.  The current system, therefore, works against part-time and seasonal workers.  The requirement to have paid 117 contributions in a three-year period equates to 39 contributions per annum.  It is almost impossible to find 39 weeks of seasonal work.  The current position can only be described as a poverty trap.  The income threshold of &euro;12.70 a day, or &euro;63.50 a week, is unfair.  If a seasonal worker earns such an amount from his or her secondary income source, he or she will not be eligible to receive unemployment benefit.  It defies logic that a low annual subsidiary income of &euro;3,302 is sufficient to deny someone the right to obtain a social welfare payment.<\/p>  <p>  I want to put in context the income levels about which we are talking.  A seasonal part-time worker typically earns between &euro;5,500 and &euro;8,500 during his or her working season.  Many of these workers who are on very low incomes have no other skills other than those needed for the seasonal work in which they engage.  I remind the House that they play an important role in the tourism, fishing and farming sectors.  These zero-hour contract workers have very little job security.  Many of them have worked as seasonal part-time workers every year for many years.  I know people in my constituency who have engaged in seasonal work for over 20 years but who in the past two years have been unable to access social welfare contributions.  It makes no sense.  I know that Deputy Leo Varadkar is a caring Minister who wants to do something about this.  He said earlier today that he did not want to sign off on reports until he knew where he would be next week.  I suggest that because he has a handle on this issue, he sign off on the report and deal with it as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100039#MM01800","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1496243100,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I want to correct something I said earlier.  I mentioned that I would be at the joint committee tomorrow but I will not be.  That particular matter is being handled by officials but I will be in the House.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has not made any changes recently to the arrangements that apply to seasonal workers and part-time workers who need to access social welfare payments once their employment ceases.  My Department administers over 70 different schemes and services and has committed to ensuring that claims are processed as expeditiously as possible.  One of the main priorities for the Department is to build on achievements already made to integrate services into the Intreo service delivery model and streamline the applications process for all schemes.  If the Deputy has any particular concerns, perhaps he would let me have the details and I will follow up on them.<\/p>  <p>  In general, seasonal and part-time workers should apply for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance as soon as they become unemployed.  In order to qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance a person must satisfy certain conditions.  To qualify for  jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit the first condition is that the person must have at least 104 reckonable contributions, under classes A, H or P paid since they entered insurable employment.  Class S self-employed contributions are not reckonable for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  To satisfy the second condition, a person must have at least 39 reckonable contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year, GCY.  The GCY is the second last complete contribution year running from 1 January to 31 December before the year in which the claim is made.  For any person making a claim in 2017, the GCY would be 2015.  Of these, 13 contributions must be paid or the person must have at least 26 reckonable contributions paid in both the GCY and the year immediately preceding it - for 2017, this would be 2015 and 2014.  If a person does not have 13 paid contributions in the relevant GCY, they must have 13 contributions paid in either of the two tax years before the relevant GCY or the last complete tax year or the current tax year - for 2017, this would be 2016 and 2017.  Initially, when a person makes an application for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, three waiting days apply and payment is made from the fourth day of the claim.  If, however, a person makes a repeat claim for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit within 26 weeks of their previous claim, the repeat claim links to the earlier claim and no waiting days apply.  Admittedly, that is quite hard to follow.<\/p>  <p>  Jobseeker&rsquo;s assistance is a means tested payment and earnings are taken into account in determining means.  A person must satisfy certain conditions, including being available for and genuinely seeking work.  Casual part-time workers may qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance subject to satisfying the means test and other qualifying conditions.  A disregard of &euro;20 a day, up to a maximum of &euro;60, applies up to a maximum of three days and the balance is assessed at 60%.<\/p>  <p>  In determining the assessable income from insurable employment, the following deductions are allowed: superannuation, additional voluntary contributions, AVCs, PRSI, the pension levy and trade union subscriptions.  The person&rsquo;s net average assessable weekly earnings are assessed by reference to the previous 13 weeks or another period if this is more representative of the person's normal working pattern.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is not payable where the average means are equal to or in excess of the relevant family rate of payment.<\/p>  <p>  School educational sector workers, who are employed on a temporary basis and who have previously been in contact with the Department, are issued with a repeat jobseeker's application form and holiday form in advance of the school holiday periods.  This advance process facilitates an efficient service to these customers and allows for speedy processing of their claim when the period of unemployment actually arises.  However, it is important to note that educational sector workers are still required to sign on for each period of unemployment.<\/p>  <p>  The governing legislation states that a day shall not be treated as a day of unemployment, it shall be treated as a day of employment unless it is considered subsidiary employment.  To be considered subsidiary employment, the work being undertaken should be in addition to the usual full-time employment, and the remuneration received by the jobseeker must not exceed &euro;12.70 a day or the jobseeker must have a minimum of 117 PRSI contributions paid immediately preceding the date of the claim or in respect of the last three complete contribution years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100040#NN00100","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1496243100,"counter":544,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100040#NN00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1496243100,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I am almost finished.

That is not relevant to the question I asked.  The question I asked was about the commitment made by the Minister on 22 November to come back to this issue.  We withdrew an amendment to the legislation, in good faith, which we could have pushed but the Minister said at the time if it were to be included in the Act, the process would go on for much longer.  It could not have gone on much longer.  We did that in good faith.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is doing a disservice and the review will do a disservice unless it improves the lot of these seasonal and part-time workers.  This has been going on since 22 November.  I know the Minister met a lobby group in Donegal last week.  In fact, it was not the Minister but his colleague, Deputy McHugh who told them that Pat The Cope Gallagher's pronouncements on this was not helping the case.  I am not casting any aspirations on the Minister because I know that is not his form but that was suggested.  Now we are being told that as a result of that meeting a review has commenced.  The waters are muddied and there is a great deal of being economical with the truth.  I would like the Minister to clarify in his final response that the review did not start as result of his meeting Donegal and that it had started post 22 November.

I tabled this Topical Issue, following several meetings I have had with various fishing organisations and communities along the south and the west coast.  I imagine this problem affects every part of Ireland's coast and that people are having similar experiences.<\/p>  <p>  The argument being made is that the growing population of seals is responsible for a great deal of the damage that has been done to our fishing stocks.<\/p><p>One person I met had been fishing that morning with gillnet and got ten boxes of cod.  I have a picture showing how three of them were absolutely destroyed by seals, and I can give the Minister a copy afterwards.  That is practically a third of his catch for that day gone.  Fishermen have difficulties trying to make ends meet before facing up to that.  Others are drift netting and have the same experience.  I have also met people involved with angling.  I did not realise that, in particular, along the coastal areas and mouths of rivers, salmon breeding areas are being attacked by seals.  That is their argument and people want to see what can be done.<\/p> <p> I have been told a study has been carried out by the French Government and its findings have been accepted and supported by the European Union, EU, and it concerns the damage being done by seals to fish stocks.  There is a lobby within the group seeking some kind of cull system to deal with the matter.  The Minister might be able to enlighten the House about that.  The body with the appropriate remit - I assume it is the National Parks and Wildlife Service - should carry out a survey on this to determine what can be done.  In many parts of the country there is overpopulation of deer etc. and culling is put in place for various reasons.  There is a strong argument that there should be a cull of the seal population in order to protect fish stocks and ensure people can get their just rewards.<\/p> <p> It is not acceptable for somebody to haul the nets after 48 hours to find a third of the catch gone.  There is a responsibility on us to act.  It may not be politically palatable, and certain members of the public may find difficulty with this.  Some mechanism should be formulated on the back of evidence supplied to us and this House by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Will the Minister confirm that the French Government has carried out a survey whose findings have been accepted by the EU in this regard.

Seals are a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive and seals are also protected under the Wildlife Acts.  I am advised two species of seals, grey seals and harbour seals, are common in Irish waters.  In so far as the management of the seal population is concerned, I clarify for the Deputy that this is the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, and it is administered by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.<\/p><p>I am aware the inshore fisheries sector is concerned about the interaction between seals and commercial inshore stocks.  In January 2016, the National Parks and Wildlife Service accepted an invitation to discuss the seal population with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, and I understand this discussion was viewed as constructive by both sides.  I am also aware of the keen interest in seals by environmental non-governmental organisations such as the Irish Seal Sanctuary, which is active nationally and internationally in marine conservation spheres.  I understand from the Marine Institute that a seal and fisheries focus group was set up to bring together industry, science and non-governmental organisations.  Membership of the group has included scientists from the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the coastal and marine research centre of University College Cork, together with representatives from the Irish Seal Sanctuary and the Irish sea fishing industry.  I am advised the group meets on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis.<\/p><p>With regard to research priorities for issues concerning sea fisheries, the Irish Fisheries Science Research Partnership was set up on an official basis to enhance collaboration and mutual understanding on fisheries science priorities that are beneficial to the long-term future of the Irish fishing industry.  The partnership includes industry representatives such as those from the fishing industry producer organisations, the National Inshore Fisheries Forum and scientists from both the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  It meets on a regular basis throughout the year to discuss scientific work programmes and priorities, including those relating to interactions between seals and sea fisheries.  With regard to the interaction between seal populations and the conservation of fish stocks, I am advised that seals eat a wide variety of fish and invertebrates.  Their diet appears to vary considerably depending on location, time of year and the abundance of available prey.  I understand seals also consume salmon and other protected species that are under the responsibility for the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I say this to illustrate the complexity of seal-fisheries interactions and particularly dealing with protected species.<\/p><p>In December 2013, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, published a report entitled Seal Depredation and Bycatch in Set Net Fisheries in Irish Waters.  It found the predation impact of seals on landings of pollock, hake and monkfish had substantially increased since the 1990s and recommended mitigation measures such as smart fishing techniques, acoustic deterrents etc. be developed with stakeholder participation.  BIM currently has a study under way in conjunction with Centre for Marine and Renewable Energy in University College Cork on the use of deterrents in different types of sea fisheries.  A number of trials have taken place over the past year and further trials are planned this summer.<\/p><p>Seals are protected under the EU Habitats Directive and the Wildlife Acts but permits may be obtained under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to hunt seals where significant damage is being caused.  This redress is available, for example, to individual fishermen to control damage to fisheries by seals at particular locations.  Permits may be issued by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in response to specific applications, with each application considered on its merits.  I am advised that anybody with concerns about interactions with seals in particular locations should contact their local National Parks and Wildlife Service ranger in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100041#OO00200","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1496243700,"counter":557,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

The damage being done to sea stocks and breeding grounds around this country is often argued to be the result of overfishing and reckless landings etc.  What part of it could be down to the consumption of fish by the seal population?  I have fished and I know seals have huge consumption rates, although they are beautiful creatures.  On one occasion when I was fishing salmon, there were 34 salmon in my net, but by the time I got the net to the boat, there were 17 fish left.  One seal had taken them and that goes back quite a bit.  It was the norm at the time but the population was not nearly as big as it is now.

There was a BIM survey in 2015 that showed damage to catches caused by seals ranging from 59% of monkfish to 18% of pollock and 10% of hake catches over the course of 12 months of extensive onboard observations on inshore and offshore vessels.<\/p><p>That is approximately a third of catches, which is a very significant loss of effort by fishermen who, in the best of times, are never on the pig's back economically speaking.<\/p> <p> This is an issue.  The challenge for us in trying to deal with it is to bring together all the stakeholders, in particular the NGOs, which are particularly active in this area and which serve a very important function in the context of conservation.  Seals are a protected species.  There is provision under the Wildlife Acts, administered by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, for culling in certain circumstances.  Perhaps consideration could be given to the regional inshore fisheries fora, at which cases in locations around the countryside in respect of which there may be issues can be considered in the context of provisions under the law.  As I stated, the relevant legislation is section 42 of the Wildlife Acts.  However, I think it would be preferable to proceed on an agreed basis with all the relevant stakeholders.  There is provision for this.  Awareness of the legislation is important.  Perhaps the Deputy, through his good offices, could bring the legislation to the attention of the regional inshore fisheries fora and I am sure they could pursue the matter on a collaborative basis.

and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; ensure that sufficient funding is allocated in Budget 2018 to allow for these changes to become operational in 2018.<\/blockquote><p>The nursing home support scheme provides essential financial support for those who are medically in need of long-term care in nursing homes.  This allows for the balancing of the personal cost of nursing home care for individuals with the financial support of the State.  A key element of the scheme is the optional nursing home loan, which facilitates the deferral of payments to be collected from a person's estate after death.<\/p><p>However, there are certain anomalies which apply to farming communities and other self-employed small business operators.  There are four anomalies in particular.  The first is that the system leads to a significant impediment to the viability of a farm and poses particular problems for farming families.  Farms are often not disposed of when the owner dies but, rather, are traditionally passed down through a family line to a successor.  The principal anomaly is that there is no cap on the payment for nursing home care when applied to the value of a farm, especially when new owners are carrying on farming as their principal livelihood.<\/p><p>This has the greatest impact on lower income farms, where any further dilution of assets could render the farm non-viable for future generations.  The farm is a productive asset which is required to generate income and is not a measure of the ability to pay.  A cap of three years should apply to the 7.5% charge, as applies to principal residences for those who are not farmers.<\/p><p>The second anomaly is the definition of &quot;sudden illness and disability&quot;.  The third anomaly is that an asset has to be transferred for less than five years prior to the application to the scheme.  If this is not the case, the asset is part of the financial assessment of the scheme.  This should be reduced to one year.<\/p><p>There are also difficulties when a farmer has developed diminished mental capacity, as in the case of dementia, and is not in a position to authorise the transfer of the farm.  There is a commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to review the nursing support scheme and remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.  We, as the Rural Independent Group, are calling on the Government to honour this commitment.<\/p><p>We are calling for the immediate publication of the recommendations of the interdepartmental working group on the fair deal scheme.  We call on the Minister to introduce a progressive financial assessment system that will reflect the value of the asset and its income generating capacity, which will protect farm viability for future generations, while at the same time making a reasonable contribution towards nursing home care.<\/p><p>The principle of the nursing home support scheme is that participants are assessed on their medical need, income and assets.  Some 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% of the value of their principal private residence per year, ordinarily up to a maximum of three years, which is a maximum of 22.5% of the value of their principal residence, is assessed.  This is usually based on the value of their home, which is normally collected from their estate on their death.<\/p><p>The first &euro;36,000, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, of savings is not taken into account.  However, in the case of farmers or small enterprise owners this three year cap does not generally apply, except if illness is sudden and disabling.  The problem for farmers and small business owners is that the value of the enterprise is included in the asset value, even though this valuation may bear no relation to its earning capacity.<\/p><p>The future integrity of farms is essential to allow the next generation to continue to maintain the viability of farms or small businesses.  Farmers who continue to farm land do not see a farm as an asset.  Rather, it is something they are caretaking for the next generation.  The liability of nursing home care costs is calculated on the notional value of a farm.  This can jeopardise any chance of handing over a farm intact to the next generation.<\/p><p>The anomaly threatening the viability of a family farm is in urgent need of review, and has serious ramifications for the viability of small farms.  Obviously, it is crucial that fines are transferred prior to the need for nursing home care, and this should be part of the financial management of all farms.  These anomalies create an uncertain liability on farmers, small businesses and their families and the future viability of small farms and small businesses in terms of being sustainable into the future because much of the asset value could be consumed by the uncapped liability of the charge on nursing care.<\/p><p>If a farm or business has been transferred over five years prior to the need for nursing home care, then the asset value does not arise.  However, if the transport has not taken place or has been done inside the five year threshold, then the asset value of the farm is taken into account when assessing liability.  Farms are not usually disposed of after death but, rather, are passed down to the next generation.  In this context, the 7.5% charge on farm value applies for the duration of the resident's stay in a nursing home.  If this is prolonged, the value of the farm is substantially diminished when the resident dies.<\/p><p>Sudden illness or disability will trigger the three year cap on non-residential assets, but there is a considerable vagueness in the definition of this term.  For instance, the development of dementia over several years resulting in the need for nursing home care would preclude this capping of payments.  Thus, fairness, justice and equality of the assessment of farms and small businesses is obviously called into question.<\/p><p>These anomalies in the fair deal scheme make the transfer of farms and small businesses to the next generation very difficult, and could convert what is a marginal income for many farmers into one which is wholly unsustainable and uneconomic.  The continued viability of the farm will be undermined or lost in meeting the cost of long-term care.<\/p><p>The average farm income is &euro;26,000, with 70% of farmers earning less than this figure.  Consideration should be given to applying a cap on the nursing home charge, which is calculated on the non-residential productive asset, that is, a farm, which is passed on to the next generation.<\/p><p>We call on the Government to introduce a progressive financial assessment that reflects the value of the asset and its income generating capacity in order to protect the traditional Irish farm model for the next generation.  We call on the Government to publish the interdepartmental working group report on the fair deal scheme as soon as possible and within at least three months if it is not completed.  We call on the Government to reduce the charge on farms and small business assets to reduce the uncertainty for family enterprises.  We call on the Government to provide clarification on the term \"sudden illness or disability\" and to broaden it to reflect disability which is independent of acuteness.  It must reflect the needs of the patient rather than the acuteness of the illness.  Obviously, legislation will be required to amend the nursing homes support scheme.  This should be provided for immediately following the publication of the interdepartmental working group's report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100043#TT00200","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496245200,"counter":566,"content":"<p>At the outset, I thank the people working in Deputy Mattie McGrath's office for their work in helping us to prepare this important Private Member's motion.  We must recognise the importance of the nursing homes support scheme and understand the problems and difficulties we, as public representatives, have with it.  I highlight in particular our private nursing homes and the great work they do in our communities in taking care of those who need it.  We have problems and difficulties, however.  As Deputy Harty has rightly highlighted, a farm is not an asset as such.  The vast majority of people who own farms in Ireland today do not look on them as assets.  A farm is something they inherit and work to make what they can before transferring it on to the next generation.  It is not like a bundle of cash in a bank.  It is not like stocks or apartments and other property.  A farm is something unique and different.  That is why we have brought forward the motion.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State for her engagement with us as a group before we moved the motion.  At the same time, the amendment she proposes is, to put it bluntly, unacceptable to us.  We are sorry about that, but it is where we are.  I acknowledge the great work of Deputy Billy Kelleher, the spokesperson on health in opposition, and the support he has provided on a daily basis.  I am anxious that the Minister of State understands that a farm is not something which is like cash.  A person is only its guardian for the time being with the intention that it will be passed on.  That is why we are worried.  Family farms have made a vital contribution to the growth in employment in rural areas.  They form the backbone of the rural economy.  It is estimated that farm families spend &euro;8 billion per year in the Irish economy, most of which is spent locally to support local jobs and enterprise.  The Minister of State knows that herself.  The farm is the backbone of everything.  When there was very little in Ireland, we had farming.  Before tourism ever took off, we had farming.  Even though many other things have not survived, we will still have farming.  That is why we want the nursing homes support scheme to take into consideration the unique circumstances that apply when it comes to adjudicating what a farm is worth.  That must be reflected in the calculation of the percentages as to what exactly the nursing homes support will be.<\/p>  <p>  People who have a stroke in Ireland today face being abandoned by society and the State following their discharge from hospital.  While services are provided for those with other life threatening conditions, regardless of cost, stroke sufferers often have to pay for their long-term care with their houses and other assets.  The fair deal scheme has provided little or no assistance to keep stroke survivors living in their own homes while in nursing homes there is virtually no access to even basic therapeutic services unless residents can afford to pay extra themselves.<\/p>  <p>  Having said that, I recognise the great service our nursing homes provide in our communities.  It is only because of the diligence and work, in particular of the families who founded nursing homes.  Through their work, guts and courage, they borrowed money and built up their businesses.  They provide health care to the people in our communities.  If one looks at the actual sums, nursing homes which are charging &euro;800 or &euro;820 per week are, in fact, operating on a tight budget.  They employ people 24 hours a day.  Out-of-hours wages cost a lot more and they must meet holiday pay and every other cost, including the cost of their borrowings.  It is very difficult for them to actually run their businesses.  We owe a great debt of gratitude to them.<\/p>  <p>  There are simple things the State should do when it comes to our nursing homes.  The doctor in our parliamentary group knows a lot more about this than I do.  Nursing homes have to send patients to acute hospitals for assessment instead of having geriatricians to come to them.  That is a cost to the State which should be examined.  In looking at the overall cost of nursing home support, we should be examining issues like that.  If we can reduce costs on that side, we will have more to give on the other side of the nursing homes support scheme.  It is an issue that has been raised with me on many occasions by the proprietors of nursing homes who say it makes no sense that ambulances, taxis and private cars have to take their patients out of their nursing homes to acute hospitals for assessment when it would be so much easier to send one geriatrician to the nursing home to meet many patients at the same time on the same day.  Look at the cost of sending all those patients out.  The Minister of State has to look at issues like that on foot of the motion.  It is very important.<\/p>  <p>  Our motion aims to highlight the fact that while we appreciate the scheme that is in place, we want the Government to look at the problems and issues we have raised.  I would like to be constructive so while I appreciate the Minister of State's amendments, we cannot agree to them.  I know she respects that.  I ask her to look closely at the validity of the motion we have tabled and accept that we are doing this because we are dealing with the people on the ground and know the issues that arise.  We are hopeful that she will be able to accept our view, which she knows we put forward in the best interests of the person who is so important at the end of the day, namely, the person receiving the support.  I ask the Minister of State to acknowledge the fact that the family farm is a unique asset in that it is not an asset in the way that other people might adjudicate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100044#UU00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1496245200,"counter":567,"content":"<p>I take the opportunity to endorse and support the motion.  The fair deal nursing homes scheme provides great assistance and professional care for many older people and their families.  Unfortunately, the current form of the scheme is creating uncertainty and anxiety among many farm families and small business owners.  The vagueness created by the potentially uncapped liability on the assessment of farm assets and the treatment of income generating assets on the family farm has serious ramifications for many farmers.<\/p><p>Family farms form the backbone of our rural economy and perform a vital role in providing employment and the future development of rural Ireland.  There is genuine fear among young farmers who have inherited the family farm that should something happen to a parent within a five-year period, which means they would require nursing home care, the viability of the farm business may be undermined or lost while trying to meet the cost of that care.<\/p> <p> Under the current guidelines, any assets transferred from one generation to another, that is from father or mother to son or daughter, within a five-year period is still considered a chargeable asset should the father or mother require nursing home care.  The fact a successor to the family farm can be held liable for nursing home costs if the asset was transferred within the past five years is causing real difficulties for many people.  The potential effect of the fair deal scheme is not limited to young farmers.  The IFA conducted studies on the average suckler farmer of pension age and found the income from the farm as against the liability for nursing home care left a huge deficit that had to be dealt with by the young farmer.<\/p> <p> The Government should recognise this is a problem.  It should also recognise that in the programme for Government it has committed to dealing with the issue.  The potential financial burden is causing distress and anxiety to many farm families in County Tipperary.  I have first-hand examples of this in my constituency.  The rules and regulations at present are unfair and unjust.  The anomalies in the regulations are well known and accepted as fact.  After years of evaluation, assessment and agonising it is time for action to remedy the problems.  The motion before the House identifies the faults and recommends solutions.  We call on the Government to take immediate constructive positive steps to rectify the failings in the fair deal scheme and end the uncertainty and the financial exposure for many farm families in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100044#UU00300","speaker":"1240","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496245800,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>To delete all words after &quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot; and substitute the following:&quot;recognises that:<blockquote>&mdash; the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) provides financial support towards the cost of long-term residential care services in nursing homes. It is an important scheme, ensuring that long-term nursing home care is accessible to everyone assessed as needing it, regardless of their age;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; with a budget of &euro;940 million in 2017, the NHSS will support just over 23,600 people by the end of the year;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the time applicants spend on the placement list for funding has not exceeded four weeks since early 2015 and we must ensure that any changes to the NHSS do not impact on this;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; under the NHSS, an applicant contributes up to 80 per cent of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5 per cent of the value of any assets per annum. The State then pays the balance of the cost of care. Notably, the first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the NHSS has a number of important safeguards built into it. Among these safeguards is the provision that nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care. Furthermore, where an applicant&rsquo;s assets include land and property held in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. This is the optional loan element of the NHSS, the purpose of which is to ensure that a person does not have to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for long-term nursing home care. A nursing home resident can apply for this deferral at any stage; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; an applicant&rsquo;s principal private residence will only be included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the &lsquo;three year cap&rsquo;;<\/blockquote>further recognises that:<blockquote>&mdash; when the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that the scheme would be reviewed. The report of the review was published in July 2015. Arising out of that review, a number of recommendations called for more detailed consideration of key issues, including the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the NHSS;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; an interdepartmental\/agency working group has been established to oversee the implementation of many of the recommendations contained in the review of the NHSS;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; considerable policy work has been taking place in the Department of Health in relation to examining potential solutions to the issues raised. Proposals for changes to the NHSS are being developed, with the specific intention of addressing and alleviating the concerns of the farming community when it comes to the uncertainty that many farming and business families feel in relation to the annual contribution to the NHSS and the potential impact of this on the sustainability of the farm or business;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the NHSS is underpinned by primary legislation, and as such any changes made to the scheme will require amendment to this legislation. The issues currently being examined are legally complex, and all aspects of the NHSS need to be taken into consideration. The equitable treatment of people under the NHSS must be borne in mind and we must be cognisant of the constitutionality of any proposed changes in terms of equality of treatment;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; it is essential that any amendments made to the NHSS do not in any way negatively impact on its future financial sustainability. The NHSS is a vital piece of the wider healthcare system, and we must be cognisant of the fact that any negative impact on the scheme would have wider detrimental implications for the health service;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the important position and contribution of the farming community in Irish society is recognised and valued. The importance of maintaining the farm as a productive asset to be passed down within the family unit is acknowledged;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the important position and contribution of the business community, particularly small family-run businesses, in Irish society is recognised and valued. The importance of maintaining a business as a productive asset to be passed down within the family unit is also acknowledged;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the concerns that farming and business families have in relation to the NHSS, particularly regarding the uncertainty of future liabilities based on the farm or business value in cases of family members working the farm or business is acknowledged;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the NHSS already contains provisions in relation to the treatment of income generating assets such as farms; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; in particular, the three year cap applies to a person&rsquo;s farm or relevant business under certain circumstances as follows:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the person has suffered a sudden illness or disability which causes them to need long-term nursing home care;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the person or their partner was actively engaged in the daily management of the farm up until the time of the sudden illness or disability; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; a family successor certifies that he or she will continue the management of the farm; and<\/blockquote>calls on the Government to:<blockquote>&mdash; bring forward the proposed changes in relation to this issue in the context of Budget 2018;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; honour the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to remove discrimination against small businesses and family farms; and &mdash; publish the necessary primary legislation required to bring effect to these proposed changes to the NHSS without undue delay following the completion of the examination of this issue and decisions in the context of Budget 2018.&quot;<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>I thank the Deputies for the opportunity to speak about the fair deal scheme and the issue of family farms and small businesses and how they are treated under the existing legislation.  As outlined in A Programme for a Partnership Government, we are fully committed to introducing changes as soon as practicable to remove discrimination against small business and family farms under the fair deal nursing home scheme.  This is something my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is committed to delivering and I assure the House that work is well under way on this issue.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure our older population is looked after, supported and protected.  We are living longer than ever before, and, thankfully, the signs are that this trend will continue.  This is something to be celebrated and embraced, however, we must also be cognisant of the fact that our ageing population brings about challenges across a wide range of areas, not the least of which is long-term care.  We know that most of our older people want to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as they are able, and it is certainly Government policy to support this and something about which we feel strongly.  It is a fact, however, that there will always be a cohort of people who require access to quality long-term residential care.  We must ensure that this is provided, especially when people are at such a vulnerable stage in their lives.  Access to suitable long-term care must be available to people if they require it.  To ensure this, we must protect the successful operation of the fair deal scheme, and ensure that it continues to afford that access in a sustainable way.<\/p><p>The nursing homes support scheme, NHSS, or the fair deal scheme as it is commonly known, is a system of financial support for those assessed as needing long-term nursing home care.  Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State, through the Health Service Executive, pays the balance of the cost.  The scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  Anyone who is assessed as requiring long-term residential care can avail of the scheme, regardless of age, as long as the person's care needs can be appropriately met in a nursing home that participates in the scheme.<\/p><p>With a budget of &euro;940 million in 2017, the scheme will support just over 23,600 people by the end of this year.  In order to manage the available funds within budget throughout the year, a national placement list is operated by the HSE, whereby funding approvals issue to applicants in chronological order.  This ensures equity nationally.  The budget for the scheme and its successful operation will ensure that the time applicants spend on the placement list for funding should not exceed four weeks.  In fact, waiting times for funding have not exceeded four weeks since early 2015, and we must ensure that any future changes to the scheme do not undo this success.  This is in the interests of all our older people.  The fair deal scheme covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care, which are nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person, bed and board, basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of everyday living and laundry service.<\/p><p>A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much applicants can contribute to the cost of their care.  Applicants will contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% of the value of any assets per annum.  The State will then pay the balance of the cost of care.  A person&rsquo;s level of contribution is unaffected by their choice of nursing home, be it a public, private or voluntary nursing home.  It is important to note that an applicant's principal private residence will only be included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.  This is known as the three year cap.<\/p><p>The scheme ensures that nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care and contains a number of important safeguards.  Where an applicant's assets include land and property held in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from the estate.  This is the optional loan clement of the scheme, the purpose of which is to ensure that people do not have to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for long-term nursing home care.  A nursing home resident can apply for this deferral at any stage.<\/p><p>Other important safeguards are also included in the scheme.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.  An applicant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of his or her income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State non-contributory pension, whichever is greater.  This is in recognition of the fact that, although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing.  If an applicant has a spouse or partner remaining at home, he or she will be left with 50% of the couple's income or the maximum rate of the State non-contributory pension, whichever is greater.  If both members of a couple enter nursing home care, they each retain at least 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State non-contributory pension, whichever is greater.<\/p><p>Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account for the financial assessment, including health expenses, payments required by law, rent payments and borrowings in respect of a person's principal private residence.  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drug payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the nursing homes support scheme or residence in a nursing home.<\/p><p>I will now look in detail at the treatment of small businesses and family farms under the fair deal nursing home scheme.  On Second and Committee Stages of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill, concerns were raised about the treatment of farms, in particular the potential impact of the annual charge on the sustainability of family farms and businesses, and specifically in circumstances where care may be required for a long period of time.  It is Government policy to encourage orderly succession arrangements for farms, and this is also endorsed by farming organisations and, I am sure, most public representatives in the House.  Revenue has a number of schemes in place designed to protect the value of a transferred family farm, such as tax relief schemes relating to capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax, stamp duty, capital allowances, stock reliefs, income tax exemptions for land leasing and income tax exemptions for profits from woodland.<\/p><p>In most cases, early succession arrangements in families should ensure that farm assets are transferred well in advance of five years before nursing home care is required, meaning that a levy on the farm asset is, in fact, avoided entirely.  The rate of people planning succession in an early manner is still not as good as it should be, and again I take this opportunity to encourage everyone, particularly farmers, to commence, in a timely way, their succession planning.  Taking all of this into account, and in acknowledgment that unexpected health events can occur which prevent early succession arrangements, a farm or relevant business can also qualify for the three year cap.<\/p><p>This applies where the person has suffered a sudden illness or disability which causes him or her to need care services; the person or his or her partner was actively engaged in the daily management of the farm up until the time of his or her sudden illness or disability; and a family successor certifies that he or she will continue the management of the farm.  <\/p> <p> Concerns have been raised about the treatment of family farms and small businesses under the fair deal scheme.  As outlined in A Programme for a Partnership Government, we are fully committed to introducing changes as soon as practicable to remove discrimination against small businesses and family farms.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, is committed to delivering on this commitment.  I assure Members that work is well under way on the issue.<\/p> <p> When the nursing home support scheme commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed.  The report on the review was published in July 2015.  Arising from the review, a number of recommendations called for more detailed consideration of key issues, including the treatment of small family business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the scheme.  In advance of the review, submissions were sought from groups or bodies which wished to make a contribution.  The Irish Farmers Association and others made submissions in that context.  The submissions were taken into account when the report on the review was being prepared.  An interdepartmental agency working group, chaired by the Department of Health and including representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE and the Revenue Commissioners, has been established and is overseeing the implementation of many of the recommendations contained in the review.  The recommendations include improvements to the administration of the scheme; a review of how prices for private and voluntary nursing homes are set by the National Treatment Purchase Fund; a value for money and policy review of the cost differentials in public and private or voluntary  residential facilities.<\/p> <p> As I said, the treatment of family farms and small businesses is an important matter for consideration by the Department and work on the matter is nearing completion.  In fact, as outlined in our amendment, we will bring forward the proposed changes related to this issue in the context of budget 2018 and will honour the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to remove the discrimination against small businesses and family farms.  It is important to note that the nursing home support scheme is underpinned by primary legislation and changes made to the scheme will require an amendment to that legislation.  The issues being examined are legally complex and all aspects of the scheme must be taken into consideration.  Earlier I mentioned the equitable treatment of people under the scheme.  We must be cognisant of the constitutionality of proposed changes in terms of equality of treatment and ensure the proposals we bring forward will be legally robust.  We are committed to the review of the treatment of family farms.  The Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, and I appreciate the concerns of farm and business families about the scheme, particularly the uncertainty of future liabilities based on the farm value in the case of family members working the farm, an uncertainty brought about by not having a cap on these liabilities.  These considerations are being taken on board.  I again confirm that we will bring forward the proposed changes in the context of budget 2018 and that we will honour the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to remove the discrimination against small businesses and family farms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100045#VV00200","speaker":"1339","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496246400,"counter":571,"content":"<p>We welcome the opportunity to speak about this important issue.  I congratulate and thank the Rural Independent Group for tabling the motion which is timely, given that a review is ongoing in the Department and that there is a commitment in the programme for Government to address this anomaly which is causing hardship.  The Minister of State is well aware of it, as she outlined in her contribution.  In addition, in the amendment to the motion tabled by the Minister there is much that is compatible with the motion.  There are just a few areas of slight difference and nuance.<\/p><p>The way farm and small business assets are assessed under the nursing home support scheme is causing great disquiet.  When one talks about the transfer of assets, by and large, one is talking about the transfer of wealth.  However, in the context of small businesses and farms, one is talking about transferring a working entity or an entity to create income.  Assessing the asset based on its value for the purposes of the nursing home support scheme does a great disservice.  That is acknowledged in the review and the fact that the Minister of State is examining the issue.  We hope and expect the required legislation to be brought forward in the context of budget 2018.  Small businesses and family farms are things that tend to be inter-generational.  There is a transfer pattern in place.  Obviously, one would prefer to see an orderly lifetime transfer of family businesses, but that is not always possible for many reasons and also in the case of a sudden disability or illness, where there was no time for an orderly transfer during the time a person would have been <i>compus mentis<\/i>.  There is a need to address that issue.<\/p><p>The nursing home support scheme is under huge pressure for a number of reasons.  The demographics of the population are changing quite dramatically.  We are living longer, with life expectancy on the right trajectory.  However, that brings huge challenges for society and the State in how to fund health care and care for people who will require full-time nursing home support in the future.  It will be a significant challenge for the State.  It is something all of us must address and we must accept that we are not facing up to it as robustly as we should.  When one looks beyond the horizon and considers issues with dementia and other illnesses that will create huge challenges, we are not putting in place the building blocks and engaging in the planning required to ensure we will have a sustainable system of funding in place, whereby everybody who will require nursing home care will be able to access quality care in a timely manner.  That issue must be addressed.<\/p><p>The private sector plays a hugely important and integral role in the provision of nursing home care across the country.  Approximately 23,000 people are availing of it and it has a budget of &euro;960 million.  A substantial number of people are residing in private residential facilities.  We must accept that this is part and parcel of the system.  In doing so we must ensure those providers can survive and prosper.  Not only must they survive and prosper, there must also be a return for continual development.  Otherwise, the full cost will fall on the State which I do not believe has the capacity in the short to medium term to address the huge challenges that will confront it in the future owing to the changing demographics and other factors that are obvious when we look towards the horizon.  For that reason, it is important when carrying out reviews to examine the viability and sustainability of the private sector in the delivery of nursing home residences and beds.  In that context, an issue has arisen which the Minister might take on board in the discussion on nursing homes - the re-evaluation of commercial rates across the country.  That is happening and many smaller nursing homes are being put under pressure owing to the fact that commercial rates on nursing homes have been increased, but the nursing homes are tied into a National Treatment Purchase Fund contract for three years and have no capacity to absorb the unexpected hike in a top-line cost owing to the change in the rateable valuation.  The Minister of State is aware of the issue, but we must be conscious of the fact that one cannot expect people to provide the best quality care and care with the best outcomes, as well as meet all of the guidelines laid down by HIQA and the inspections that are rightly carried out, while at the same time being forced to pay an increased commercial rate that was not part of the original assessment when they were dealing with the National Treatment Purchase Fund in drafting contracts.  It is an issue the Minister of State should examine.<\/p><p>Another issue that has been raised is the centralisation of offices.  I am not sure if it is the case, but we have been led to believe there will be a more centralised nursing home support scheme office system put in place.  We are hearing conflicting views, but some counties are very concerned that they might be a long way from the assessment offices under the scheme.  Perhaps the Minister of State might elucidate on the matter. <\/p><p>The motion is clear, but the amendment is equally clear.  We must have the certainty the Minister of State emphasised.<\/p><p>The amendment calls on the Government to \"bring forward the proposed changes in relation to this issue in the context of Budget 2018\".  That has to be done.  It is part of the programme for Government.  We will certainly be insisting on that.  The amendment calls on the Government to \"honour the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to remove discrimination against small businesses and family farms\".  As said by the sponsors of the motion, it is very clear that there is discrimination.  Let us be very honest about this.  The assessment of a capital asset, a family farm, that is to be transferred intergenerationally, and in respect of which the only income derived is from farming or from the business conducted through it, is discriminatory.  It would be different if it were being sold as an investment.  The farms are intergenerationally transferred.  This is certainly causing great concern and needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p> The amendment calls on the Government to \"publish the necessary primary legislation required to bring effect to these proposed changes to the NHSS without undue delay following the completion of the examination of this issue and decisions in the context of Budget 2018\".  This is critical.  It has to be part of the budget arithmetic; otherwise we will be talking about this issue again next year, which would create grave concerns.  I call on the Minister of State to honour the commitments in the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100046#WW00200","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496247000,"counter":573,"content":"<p>Thankfully we are all living longer and most of us will live independently for the rest of our lives.  Fewer than 5% of all the elderly require care late on in life and all parties agree that every effort should be made to facilitate this.  The nursing homes support scheme, the fair deal scheme, was introduced in 2009 and provides financial support towards the cost of long-term nursing home care.  Under the scheme, people who need nursing home care have their income and assets assessed and they make a contribution towards the cost of their care based on assessment.  The average age of our population is growing year on year, and in 20 years' time it is estimated that there will be 1 million people aged over 65 living in Ireland.  As a society, we need to prepare for the implications of an ageing country, and that means resourcing services, supporting carers and investing in research.<\/p>  <p>  We have to bear in mind that long-term care is expensive and a new and emerging trend in Ireland's demographic profile is the substantial increase in the number of people over 85 years.  Fianna F&aacute;il recognises the concerns many families have in regard to the fair deal scheme and how it impacts on their farm.  We agree it is vital that the rules around residential care for older people do not undermine the family farm model.  The programme for Government recognises the discrimination under the scheme against farm families and small businesses and it pledged to make changes.  It is critical that this commitment be honoured.  The scheme must work for everyone, including the farm families, small and medium enterprises, the self-employed, the PAYE worker and the retired person.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Farmers' Association claims the nursing homes support scheme, with the potentially high liability on farm assets, is creating uncertainty and anxiety for many farm families and that the viability of the family farm will be undermined or lost while meeting the cost of long-term care.  Many farm families are opting not to avail of the scheme, putting themselves under severe financial stress to find money to cover the cost of care in the short term.  Family farms are passed down from generation to generation and no one wants to be of the generation responsible for making the farm non-viable for the next generation.  The pressure is immense and must be recognised.<\/p>  <p>  The uncertainty created for farm families by the potentially uncapped liability in the financial assessment of farm business assets, when the farm has not been transferred or when the asset has been transferred but for less than five years, is causing significant stress for older farmers and their families at an already difficult time.  Many farm families want to try to take care of a loved one at home for as long as possible, but they are concerned that if they do they will be exempted from qualifying for the three year cap on the farm asset.<\/p>  <p>  When families discover that a family member needs full-time care that involves moving the person into a nursing home, time factors are very important.  The valuations required, be it of the principal private residence or the family farm, slow up the whole process.  The fair deal currently takes six weeks for a decision once all the relevant paperwork is in place.  Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to the development of a national strategy for the long-term care of our older people.  This will include an analysis of current and future arrangements for the funding and financing of this care.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Rural Alliance for bringing this motion forward.  As this is nursing homes week, I acknowledge the role played by the private and voluntary sectors as the main providers of long-term care under the fair deal scheme.  They are also major employers in local communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100047#XX00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1496247000,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I welcome the discussion.  There are two issues.  When a family has to make a decision about putting an elderly relative or other family member who requires full-time care into a nursing home, it is a very considerable and fundamental one.  This has been debated many times since the fair deal scheme was introduced.  By and large, the scheme has worked extremely well.  The issue, however, is the calculation of the value of a family farm or business in the wrong manner.  This has been demonstrated time and again.  Owing to the draconian means of calculation, people with small businesses or family farms are making detrimental decisions for their loved ones in order that their business or job may survive.  Anybody depending on an asset such as a farm for a job regards entering the scheme as a retrograde step.<\/p>  <p>  By and large, the scheme has worked very well but we have encountered some issues concerning the preparation of the balancing statements associated with the estates of persons who did not gain the full amount under the fair deal scheme.  This needs to be examined.  We need to move away from calculations taking into account the value of farms and ensure there is a speedy resolution of any issues involved concerning the estate of someone who passes away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100047#XX00300","speaker":"1283"},{"type":"speech","time":1496247000,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I am very pleased this motion has been brought before the House.  A commitment has been given in the programme for Government.  When the Minister of State was speaking, she made a couple of points.  She talked about planned succession.  That is grand in a perfect world but, unfortunately, family farms and small businesses do not have the ability to generate the income to support two families.  This delays the transfer of assets.  In the vast majority of cases, the assets can be transferred only when parents reach an advanced age.  It is due to the ability of the assets to generate income.  In the world we live in today, marriage breakup is an issue.  The older generation fears that if they transfer their assets, they will be lost to the family.  This is a huge stumbling block in the transfer of assets.  Both of these factors slow down the transfer of farms and small businesses.  If we are to talk about a fair deal scheme, we must live in the real world and realise what happens in reality.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State said, the Revenue Commissioners have recognised that when farm assets or small businesses are being transferred, tax reliefs exist to ensure they remain viable after the transfer or succession.  When we have got the Revenue Commissioners to recognise that agricultural relief or business relief must be in place, it is incumbent on us that when implementing a scheme for nursing home support, we apply the same principle of fairness.<\/p>  <p>  The bottom line is that family farms and small businesses are a family's means of generating a living, or a livelihood.  The family farm or small business just does not have the ability to carry a huge, onerous burden after the death of one member of the family.  People are currently opting out of sending their elderly parents to a nursing home because of the way the scheme is designed.  This is denying people the best of care in many circumstances.  People try to mind elderly parents at home when, in fact, a nursing home might be where they should be.  We must recognise that, in modern society, assets are not transferred by parents early in life to the younger generation.  A business does not have the ability to carry the burden of a nursing home loan after the death of the individual.<\/p>  <p>  Another considerable worry is sudden illness and disability.  If a farmer is struck down by a stroke or another condition, he could be hospitalised or in a nursing home for a very long period.<\/p><p>I hope that the commitments that were given in the programme for Government will be honoured and that we can have a fair deal scheme that recognises the income that an asset can generate rather than its value.  We have a saying that a lot of small businesses and farmers will live life as paupers and die as millionaires.  That is the truth about family assets.  The assets are worth a lot of money, but they are there to generate an income for the next generation.  When the Government modifies this scheme, I hope that it will put it in such a way that family farms and small businesses can avail of it and not carry a huge burden on to the next generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100047#XX00400","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496247600,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I compliment and thank my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group for tabling this private Member's motion.  On a daily basis, I get representation on a regular basis or even a daily basis from constituents of mine about what I call discrimination against farming families within the fair deal scheme.  This must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  Currently, if somebody from a farming background survives ten years in a nursing home, under the fair deal scheme as it is at the moment, over 70% of the farm is gone on debt as the 7.5% contribution charge on assets is applied per annum with no cap.  There is double counting applied to the farming community as their income is being taken into account and, on top of that, the HSE is taking 7.5% of the value of their land for every year they reside in a home.<\/p>  <p>  Young farmers in such a situation are currently at risk of losing the family farm.  For example, if there is an elderly farmer in a nursing home, his son or daughter is working the farm, earning the income, supporting a young family and will one day inherit the farm.  However, if the father has not signed the farm over to his son or daughter at that point and passes away in the nursing home after ten years, his farm is gone, or three quarters gone, and has been taken out from under that son or daughter who has been working the farm in his place.<\/p>  <p>  I raised this matter with Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, the Director General of the HSE, and Ms Angela Noonan, senior official in the Department of Health with responsibility for older people, at a meeting of the Committee for Public Accounts on 9 March 2017.  They acknowledged the glaring discrimination and I was given a commitment that they would seriously consider applying the three-year cap on the 7.5% contribution for farm assets.  They made a commitment on that day that they would look at it and go back to the Ministers about it.  I followed this up with the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, who is present, via a parliamentary question on 29 March last.  Her written response displayed no urgency whatsoever in respect of ending this discrimination.  Of the 23,000 people being supported by the fair deal scheme, 648 have farm assets.  A total of 648 out of 23,000 is not a small number of families.  With an ageing population, that figure will increase significantly.  This issue was flagged in the review in 2015.  The 2016 programme for Government gives a commitment to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.  When will the Government&rsquo;s current review on the scheme be concluded?  I think the Minister of State said that it would be concluded for the budget coming.  Will a three-year cap be introduced for farm and business assets in respect of the 7.5% contribution charge?<\/p>  <p>  Just as Deputy Cahill said earlier, I am also from a farming background.  I inherited the farm from my farmer.  He inherited it from his farmer.  That goes back for generations, we do not even know how far.  I am going to pass it on to my son.  I would not like to see myself in a nursing home and that farm being taken from under my son, daughter or whoever inherits it because of bad management and bad legislation in this House.  I ask the Ministers of State to look at this sooner rather than later.  Even by the time of the budget in November, there will be people caught up in this system.  Farms, and particularly family farms, play a major role in the contribution to this country, both in terms of wealth and in terms of the exports that we send from this country.  They are a part of what we are and a part of our heritage.  I ask the Ministers of State to look at it as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100048#YY00200","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speech","time":1496247600,"counter":578,"content":"<p>T&aacute;im s&aacute;sta an deis a fh&aacute;il le labhairt ar an r&uacute;n t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  This motion focuses on the inadequacies of the fair deal scheme for farm families and family-owned businesses.  This is an issue I have been acutely aware of for some time now.  I have been lobbied and approached by families who quite rightly feel that it is unfair that they are being disproportionately penalised when accessing the nursing home support scheme, NHSS, because they had, more often than not, a small holding of farmland.  The IFA has also raised this vexed matter with me.<\/p>  <p>  At present, the cost of one&rsquo;s care depends on one's income and assets.  An individual contributes 80% of his or her assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% of the value of any assets per year towards the cost of care.  The 7.5% per annum contribution applies for the duration of an individual&rsquo;s stay in the nursing home, save where a three-year cap applies to the applicant&rsquo;s principal residence. <\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt but that this is unfair and it is those with small land holdings that are impacted the most.  There are approximately 140,000 family farms in Ireland with an average size of 32.7 ha per holding.  The Teagasc national farm survey shows that the average family farm income was &euro;26,300 in 2015 and that farm family income varies considerably, with 70% of farms earning an income of less than &euro;25,000.  The motion states that the current financial assessment is not progressive, is fundamentally unfair and has a disproportionate impact on low-income farm families, and I agree.  It is for that reason that we will be supporting this motion which calls for, among other things, the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to remove discrimination against small businesses and family farms to be honoured.<\/p>  <p>  The motion also recognises the importance of the nursing home support scheme, and I fully agree.  However, it is far from perfect.  There is one area that I wish to highlight.  Prior to the introduction of the fair deal scheme, older people in Border communities in need of residential care could take up unhindered residence in nursing home facilities north of the Border within their own communities.  The money followed the patient.  The subvention went with the older person.  With the advent of the fair deal, a partition descended once again in our midst, turning lifelong friends and neighbours away from each other in their final years and forcing those whose residence is located south of the Border to look to often more distant locations from their home for residential care in their own county or in neighbouring counties.  This is discriminatory and grossly unfair.  It also ignores the important role these facilities north of the Border have played and could play again in helping to meet the ever-growing demand of our ageing population.  This is an important issue for people in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, particularly for those from communities that do not just run along the Border strip but straddle it, just as they have straddled the inter-county lines over many generations. This issue needs to be addressed to facilitate a right of access to the nursing home of their choice for older people in need of long-term residential care whose home address is on this side of the Border but whose nearest -  I emphasise this - or preferred nursing home is situated north of the Border.  I could cite several examples of that and expect the Leas-Cheann Comhairle could do too.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to point to the fact that, notwithstanding the importance of the NHSS, more people than necessary are going into long-term residential care due to the lack of resources for home care packages.  A great positive of the fair deal scheme is that if one qualifies for a nursing home place, the State is legally obliged to ensure one gets a bed.  However, the same is not the case for those who require a home care package.  There is no legal obligation on the State to ensure one gets what one requires.  It all depends on the resources available.  This should not be the case.  The State should be legally obliged to ensure that, where safe, people should have the legal entitlement to a home care package.  Investment in this area needs to be increased dramatically.<\/p>  <p>  We need to urgently move to a rights-based system whereby vulnerable citizens can receive long-term care in their home and in the community when needed and thereby reduce the reliance on acute hospital beds and long-term nursing home care.<\/p>  <p>  Having made those points, I have no hesitation in acknowledging the mighty service being provided to our older citizens who are in need of long-term residential care by private and voluntary nursing homes across this State.  Quite frankly, we would be in desperate straits without them.  It is worth noting that there is a differential of &euro;490 between the average weekly fair deal payment and the average fee payable per resident per week in HSE care.  That differential is considerably more than half the average weekly fair deal payment.  These points should be noted by the Minister for Health.<\/p><p>With 23,590 people in residence and a staff number of 25,176, the private and voluntary nursing home sector is a significant part of the older person care regime.  It is also entitled to a fair deal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100048#YY00300","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496248200,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I commend the Rural Independent Group for bringing forward such an important Private Members' motion which my party fully supports as we understand the difficulties faced by too many small farm households across the island.  I have recently met representatives of the IFA about this issue and I am aware that thousands of families genuinely cannot afford to pay for nursing home care for their loved ones.  There are a number of farm families in my constituency of Offaly which includes part of north Tipperary who are at the end of their tether trying to pay the cost of nursing home care for their loved ones.  This causes them great anxiety and is a source of unnecessary hardship.  The future of small farms is under threat under the current regime as many have no other option but to sell their land to pay for nursing home care for their loved ones.  Small farmers are impacted on disproportionately by the current rules.  Uncertainty is created for farm families by the potentially uncapped liability in the financial assessment of non-residential assets.  The assessment applies where assets are not transferred prior to a person entering nursing home care or where he or she was transferred in the preceding five years.  The definition of the criteria relating to sudden illness provides for a three-year limit to be applied to non-residential assets.  These issues combined cause great hardship for farming families and must be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there is a commitment in the programme for Government to tackle the discrimination faced by farmers and small businesses in accessing nursing home care.

I commend the Deputies of the Rural Independent Group for bringing  it forward.  All of us, from all parts of the country, have been lobbied by many people who have found themselves in this situation.  One of the things that strikes me is the length of time that has passed.  It has been a year since the programme for Government was produced and it contained a commitment to do something about this issue.  We understand things take time, but for many of the people concerned who are in dire circumstances, time is not on their side.  That is the reality.  About a week ago I spoke to a man whose mother had to go into a nursing home.  There is no other option for them and the family farm is still in her name.  What are they to do?  It will cost an absolute fortune.  They are at their wits' end and do not know how they will manage because the mother has dementia.  She is very well physically and may live for many years, but she is unable to cope at home.<\/p>  <p>  The issue is proving to be very difficult for many.  It brings to mind a matter I raised in this House, on which I received support from many Deputies, namely, rural proofing legislation and measures brought before us.  This is an example.

While the Government's amendment states it will be dealt with in due course, for many of the people concerned, time is not on their side and they cannot wait.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government has also recognised the unfairness of the scheme.  It is an unfair scheme and we need to resolve the issue very quickly.  Another issue, dealt with by Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, concerns the unfairness surrounding home care packages.  In many parts of rural Ireland they cannot be obtained for persons who could stay at home if a small amount of money was put in place for them, but it is simply not available.  There is also a need to make an effort to ensure people will be able to obtain home care packages as a right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100049#ZZ00300","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1496248200,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion on behalf of the Labour Party.  I am glad that Deputy Sean Sherlock is here also because he has been very eloquent and outspoken on the issue, particularly as it affects his area of Mallow in the constituency of Cork East.  <\/p><p>The nursing homes support or fair deal scheme provides support for persons who need nursing home care and are unable to afford the full of cost of same.  The applicant's income and assets are assessed and he or she makes a contribution towards the cost of care, with the State and very often family members also making up the balance.  There are clear shortcomings associated with the scheme in that it does not provide for respite care or convalescence.  The motion deals with a plethora of issues pertaining to the scheme and acknowledges that participants contribute to the cost of their care, according to their income and assets, and that this contribution can be considerable where an individual contributes up to 80% of his or her assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% of the value of assets per year towards the cost of care.  <\/p><p>A key element of the motion refers to the difficulties faced by farmers and businesses where the assets of farmers and other self-employed persons are deemed to be productive assets and required to generate income.  They should not be considered as a measure of an additional ability to pay.  The Labour Party unequivocally supports the principle behind and the spirit of the motion.  We believe small farmers, in particular, should not be categorised in such a manner as to discriminate against them.  There is a significant adverse differential which could be construed as discriminatory in respect of contributions and the method of calculating same which are charged against holdings and-or farm and business assets under the nursing homes support scheme when compared to those levied against private residences.  They are clearly disproportionate by any construction.  The current system of assessment with a likely or potentially high liability on farm or business assets is causing great stress and anxiety for many farm families.  One could see the entire family farm consumed as an asset in meeting the cost of long-term care.  We are aware of the furore caused by the &quot;dementia tax&quot; across the water in the United Kingdom which has added frisson to that electoral contest.  There is no doubt that it would be viewed similarly in Ireland where there is an even worse scenario with the absolute diminution of the farm and-or business asset or land which could theoretically take place in the absence of a cap or limitation to restrict the State's ability to recoup the cost of nursing home care under the fair deal scheme, while the maximum figure that can be recouped against the value of an elderly person's private residence is 22.5%.  <\/p><p>The fair deal scheme, as it has operated for a number of years, involves a tripartite funding mechanism.  The resident and very often his or her family must contribute, as does the State.  In the interests of equity, a cap similar to that applied to the family residence should apply in the calculation of the amount that may be recouped again farm or business assets.  In the absence of a clear indication that all assets will be treated in an equitable and similar manner, the current system, if left intact, could see farmers having to borrow to secure their assets.  This could have consequential knock-on effects for farmers who are worried about and struggling to meet the cost of nursing home care.  It is time to implement the commitment given in the programme for Government and end once and for all the uncertainty and unfairness.  <\/p><p>Another issue the motion rightly highlights is the vagueness of the definition of sudden illness or disability.  It provides for a three-year limit to be applied to non-residential assets, particularly when some families try to facilitate their elderly parents or relatives by keeping them at home for a short period, notwithstanding the fact that they might be in a poor state of health.  This needs to be recognised in the definition of sudden illness or disability.  A person may have spent three, four or five weeks being cared for at home which will disqualify him or her under the definition.  As a barrister, I have read it very carefully and believe it must be clarified.  It would be a shame if a haphazard and <i>ad hoc<\/i>policy on the calculation or assessment of assets was to contribute to a slowing down or retardation of the process of lifetime transfers of farms which is already too slow.  This could slow down such transfers even further.  <\/p><p>It must be recognised that farmers' assets and those of the self-employed and other businesses are productive assets.  They are distinguished and required to generate income and should not be seen as a measure of an additional ability to pay.  I know that farm organisations have made a number of proposals.  In particular, the IFA has proposed that a reduced charge which would be facilitated by having a relief mechanism similar to agricultural relief and capital acquisitions tax be introduced to be pitched at a level of at least 75%.  This certainly would be a big help to farmers and allay their concerns.  Likewise, the period of time in which an asset needs to be transferred prior to entering a nursing home should be reduced from five years to three.  Like the other measures referred to, this would create a favourable environment and signal support for the family farm model which is the backbone and essential to the fabric of rural Ireland.  <\/p><p>I understand that in the review of the fair deal scheme it was recommended that up to 90% of the value of a farm or commercial asset be excluded when calculating the cost of nursing home care.  The real problem for many businesses, including farmers, is that they can be asset rich but cash poor.  Therefore, the scheme, as constructed, cannot be construed, in any shape or form, as being fair for farmers or other businesses.<\/p><p>On a wider level, I do not feel there is adequate flexibility in the current scheme.  When one goes into a nursing home, there is a fairly demanding application process which can cause consternation for families and be quite serious to have to address.  There is an issue whereby in some circumstances - Deputy Sherlock has spoken on this - there can be a lack of availability of nursing home spaces in close proximity to the family home.  That can cause issues of disruption and separation for families.<\/p> <p> It would be an ostrich that would not recognise that the funding of the fair deal scheme going forward represents a significant challenge with regard to its sustainability, when there are significant demographic changes afoot.  It is in that context that I suggest we have to consider a scheme or at least a similar option to permit the provision of home care to the applicant or the home of the person being cared for.  We are all aware that the elderly person who might be ill or infirm is far more content living in his or her own home environment among family and neighbours.  I found this when I was preparing the report on carers 15 years ago.  This will be a challenge, and let no-one underestimate the size of the task to devise such a scheme.  I have always advocated that we should facilitate people remaining within their own homes with disabled person grants and other things.  We want to remove the bureaucratic obstacles, impediments and hurdles, and we could do that at the stroke of a pen.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, will be successful in this objective.  She has the unqualified support of the Labour party to make this policy objective a reality.<\/p> <p> One other issue arises.  When people go into a nursing home, many hope they will return to where they were happiest - in their own home.  For some, that becomes a reality.  Many others do not return home, but the home remains vacant, idle and unused.  Some of these have been enumerated in the vacant home statistics.  People like to hold onto their homes, particularly in this context.  It might be useful for their families, who are trying to pay towards the cost of care, to encourage siblings or direct relatives to lease or let part of these houses, or the full house, to people who have nowhere to live.  As an incentive, allow &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 of any rental income to be earned tax-free.  Similarly, the &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 would not be assessable as part of the home owner's income and be caught as part of the 80% contribution of a person's total income to the cost of care.  It might incentivise the availability of such houses and avoid them being left there.  Sometimes they become derelict - let us be honest about that.<\/p> <p> We need to be imaginative and innovative about how we look after people who fall ill, get old and require nursing home care in the future.  If we do it right, we will only be providing for ourselves in the not too distant future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100049#ZZ00400","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496248800,"counter":584,"content":"<p>I welcome this debate about the fair deal scheme.  I agree with the merits of the motion in its entirety.  It is imperative that we plan for generational demographic changes which will happen over the next 13 years.  The population of over-75s is set to double.  One of the hardest decisions anybody could make in his or her life is to send a loved one to a nursing home.  That is a very traumatic and emotional time for the family and the person who is going into the nursing home.<\/p>  <p>  There is another narrative here that I would like to bring up about nursing homes generally and the privatisation of nursing homes.  At present, 76% of all nursing homes are privately run.  It is projected that in the next 20 years all long-term nursing homes will be completely privately run.  This was facilitated by two ghosts of the past in this House, namely former Deputy Mary Harney and former Deputy Charlie McCreevy.  Former Deputy Mary Harney was the instigator of the fair deal scheme in 2009, and I think its primary purpose was to ensure the privatisation of elderly care in Ireland.  We had a debate last night about waiting lists.  They are terrible.  I stipulated that the reason why so much privatisation is seen in this country goes back to an Act which the Minister for Finance at that time, Charlie McCreevy, introduced, giving serious tax breaks for developers of private hospitals and private nursing care centres.  We are living with that legacy today.  It is estimated that since 2001 and 2002, those developers have been subsidised by &euro;10 billion in the form of tax breaks in the subsequent years.<\/p>  <p>  All of this removes the duty of care from the State to the private developers.  It is quite big business.  For example, last year, the ten biggest companies that provide private health care in nursing homes got &euro;53 million from the HSE from the fair deal scheme.  We support the motion, but the narrative that I have is that this goes back to the privatisation of public health care.  It may be a fair deal, but it is not a cheap deal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100050#AAA00200","speaker":"1299"},{"type":"speech","time":1496248800,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I fully support the motion on the fair deal scheme.  It is important, particularly for small farmers and small businesspeople, the self-employed who are being hit with unfair assessments on their income and asset values, in particular when assessed for the nursing home support scheme.  The 7.5% cap per year on the asset value is unfair and creates a very serious distinction that has a cooling effect on families deciding whether to put their loved ones that might require care into a nursing home.  When that is combined with the lack of home care packages and the availability of home care packages across the country, it puts those families in a really difficult situation.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that there are farmers who are putting themselves at serious financial risk by trying to meet the cost rather than having the nursing home support scheme pick it up by putting their loved ones into it.  The obsession the Government has with assessing asset values, particularly for people who may have an asset that has substantial value but can derive very little income from it, is problematic.  It is not only in the nursing home support scheme, but also the social welfare system.  It is a serious problem.  If one takes, for example, a farm that could be valued at &euro;1 million, the income from it might only be &euro;24,000 a year.  That is the crux of the problem.  A far fairer system would be to assess the income derived from the asset rather than putting the value on the asset itself.  Of course, that has a budgetary implication for the Government and that is the reason why it has not considered this in the past.  It would be a far fairer system and one that could operate very easily and effectively.  Farmers and small businesspeople would be preparing accounts and making returns, so the income could be assessed and seen.  There may be a temptation to try to hide assets because they are going to have an impact on the ability to pay, whereas on incomes and returns to the Revenue, that situation would not arise and income could be assessed easily.<\/p>  <p>  We have the same situation in the social welfare system, where somebody may own a house that has perhaps belonged to his or her parents, and when that person goes to access social welfare payments, the asset value of that property is assessed and a means is attributed to it which bears no relation to the means that can be generated from the rental income, for example, of that house.  There could be somebody with a house with a value of &euro;80,000 given a means of &euro;200 a week from it, while in the rental market in that area, one might be lucky to get &euro;80 or &euro;90 a week for the rental of that property.  That is where this asset value assessment comes from.  It comes from the social welfare system and it has been knitted into the nursing home support scheme.  That is the crux of the problem.<\/p>  <p>  The motion calls for the interdepartmental working group report to be published.  It will be interesting to see when it is published how the Government is going to look at treatment of assets.  Unless there is a system where the income arising from the asset is assessed rather than the asset value itself, there will always be unfairness in the system and that is the crux of the problem.<\/p><p>I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak about the payments from the nursing home support scheme to nursing homes, particularly community nursing facilities, because the disparity between what they will pay, for example, in Donegal and in Dublin, is causing real problems, particularly for community-owned facilities.  I am thinking of &Aacute;ras Ghaoth Dobhair in west Donegal, a community-owned facility where the community was facilitated by the HSE in establishing the facility many years ago.  The community never envisaged that it would still be running the facility at this stage, almost 15 years on.  The amount of income that they can get from the nursing home support scheme is restrictive and leaves them constantly in a financially precarious situation where every couple of years there is a financial crisis and the sustainability of the facility is always put in question.  It is an important facility because there is no easily accessible public facility and there is no interest from the private sector in providing facilities in that area.  This is more marked in rural areas as well because there is no private business for nursing homes.  Everyone is dependent on the nursing home support scheme whereas in the larger urban areas there may be possible private business available for the nursing homes from which they can supplement their income.<\/p> <p> In debating nursing homes and the nursing home support scheme, I must mentioned there is also a need to rapidly roll out a construction programme for public facilities across the country because we are heading into a crisis.  With the demographic changes, the number of beds required will probably more than double in the next ten years and we need to see those community facilities built and developed as well.  Such facilities are integral, particularly in Donegal.  The community nursing homes and community hospitals are an integral part of the working of Letterkenny University Hospital where the system operates so that patients are moved quickly out from the university hospital to the community hospitals, freeing up beds and keeping the system working.  We must address that building programme as a matter of urgency as well.<\/p> <p> In the context of the motion, moving to a system where the income derived from the asset is assessed rather than the asset value is the only way we will have a fair system that people can avail of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100050#AAA00300","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496249400,"counter":587,"content":"<p>For the SD-GP, there is nobody present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100051#BBB00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1496249400,"counter":588,"content":"<p>Cheese and chalk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100051#BBB00300","speaker":"1313"},{"type":"speech","time":1496249400,"counter":589,"content":"<p>No interest in rural people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100051#BBB00400","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1496249400,"counter":590,"content":"<p>We will move on to Rural Independents.

I cannot imagine that those who first drew up the details of this scheme could have foreseen the level of distress it would cause to these two groups.  We are not talking here about someone with, for instance, a property portfolio for whom the sale of a property here or there will not adversely affect the stability of what remains, but one cannot have a big annual bill mounting up against the value of a farm or small family business without it eventually directly threatening the future of those assets, which are productive assets.<\/p>  <p>  A productive agricultural sector with thriving family farms plays a significant part in the economy of this country.  Currently, there are almost 140,000 farms in Ireland.  Agrifood is our most important indigenous sector, employing 8.6% of the working population.  Anything that threatens to fragment these farms is bad, not only for families and local communities but for the country as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  We had a senior HSE official some time ago claiming that some farm families were keeping elderly relatives in hospital to avoid them being placed in a nursing home and to avoid the fair deal scheme fees.  While some farm groups have denied this is going on, it illustrates how much of a problem the scheme is causing for families and the worry that it has brought about by any perceived threat to the family farm.  While it is an asset, it will not remain so if there is 7.5% of its value being surrendered every year while someone remains in nursing home care and the amounting bill may leave a family with no option but to sell it off.<\/p>  <p>  Equally, when it comes to small businesses, we need to avoid upsetting the often delicate balance that exists in this sector.  They all too often operate on marginal profits and anything that impacts on that fine balance of survival is not good for the country and its economy.  At present, in Ireland, small firms employing fewer than ten account for more than a quarter of all employees in the labour market.  That is how important they are.<\/p>  <p>  With this motion, we are asking not for special treatment, but fair treatment.  There is a willingness in Government to address this issue and bring more fairness to play.  The programme for a partnership Government published more than a year ago undertook to introduce changes as soon as practicable to remove a discrimination against small businesses and family farms under the fair deal nursing home scheme but goodwill is not good enough.  Farm families and those involved in small family businesses need to see good intentions turned into action.  The current Government has already accepted that there is discrimination and it is time for action now to end it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100051#BBB00600","speaker":"1313"},{"type":"speech","time":1496249400,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I am glad to speak here today to raise the unfairness in the fair deal scheme as it is currently being applied to family farms and small family businesses where the owners live in or above the small shop, post office, pub or other similar scenario.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  The farming community and these small businesses that I am talking about have been discriminated against on a daily basis, by this Government and by previous Governments.<\/p>  <p>  It is criminal what they are doing to the owners of small farms.  The ordinary individual is asked to pay 7.5% of his or her family home for three years, that is, 22.5%, but it is an endless amount, 7.5% every year while he is in the nursing home, for the man with a farm, shop or pub.  That is totally unfair to the young farmer coming up who is trying to carry on what generations did before him.  The fact that, currently, the total value of the farm or shop is assessed when calculating how much these families have to pay means that many families have had to sell or will have to sell the asset from which they generate their income.  In most cases family farms have been handed down from generation to generation.  Instead of calling it a fair deal, it is actually a lousy deal to take the farm or business off them by this means to pay for the nursing home.  The family farm makes a vital contribution to growth and employment in rural towns and villages, forming the backbone of the rural economy.  This scheme has a disproportionate and fundamentally unfair impact on low-income farm families and any further dilution of the farm assets could make the farm unviable.<\/p>  <p>  Farmers are different from most people in Ireland in that they are often asset rich and cash poor.  Their assets on paper are not an accurate reflection of their ability to pay.  It is also common that the family home is centrally located on the farm and if this or part of the farm has to be sold to pay for the nursing home, it would reduce the viability and could mean the whole farm would have to be sold.  Many farming families have this genuine worry.  As we all know, farmers, almost all working alone, have to work hard.  Many finish up in very bad shape and as a result, have to end their days in a nursing home.  We are asking that 90% of the family farm or business be exempt from calculating what these families have to pay towards the fair deal scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I am asking the Government as well to honour the commitment in the programme for a partnership Government to remove the discrimination against small businesses and family farms.  It should introduce a reduced charge on the farm business assets that would remove the uncertainty for farm families and the family employed which protects the future viability of the farm or business asset for future generation.  This would help to reduce the time an asset needs to be transferred prior to entering a nursing home from five to three years and provide immediate clarification on the definition of \"sudden illness or disability\".<\/p><p>I am very worried about what the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, said earlier with regard to protecting the successful operation of the fair deal scheme and ensuring that it continues to afford access to nursing home care in a sustainable way.  Surely that does not mean that farmers have to continue paying in the way they have been to date.  That is totally and absolutely unfair.  I am calling on all the rural Deputies in this House who are asking the farming community for votes, whether they are from Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or no party, to support this motion.  I am not so sure about what the Government is proposing and I am worried about the fact it is not supporting our motion today.  What we are proposing is fair play for the farming community and the small business owners who have been, and continue to be, discriminated against.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100051#BBB00700","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496250000,"counter":594,"content":"<p>Deputy Michael Collins is offering but I do not have his name on my list.

Although I thank the Minister of State and her Department for considering this motion and proposing amendments to it, I am disappointed by their reluctance to accept the motion as it stands.<\/p>  <p>  The so-called fair deal scheme is very unfair and is unworkable for the vast majority of the fishermen, shopkeepers, publicans and other self-employed people as well as the majority of farmers.  Farm families in my constituency and all over the country are being forced out of their livelihoods after generations of farming because of discrimination in how the fair deal scheme is applied.  This simply cannot be allowed to continue.  A constituent of mine from Skibbereen lives and works on a 30 acre farm.  His wife suffers from a severe brain disease and in time, she will require full-time nursing home care.  This man fears that he will have to sell his farm to meet the high costs of nursing home care.  This is very unfair.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to recognise the role played by the private and voluntary nursing home sector as the majority provider of long-term care under the fair deal scheme.  This sector is also a major employer in local communities.  There are at least seven such providers in my own constituency and they are being restrained by the current regulations under the fair deal scheme.  The provisions of this motion, if implemented, will enable them to improve their services.  Nursing Homes Ireland has also raised a number of other issues with regard to the fair deal scheme, such as the need for the Government to immediately publish the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, pricing review and to recognise in budget 2018 the significant and sustained cost pressures on the private and voluntary sector, including increased dependency and an aging demographic.<\/p>  <p>  The current programme for Government contains a commitment to \"introduce changes as soon as practicable to remove discrimination against small business and family farms under the Fair Deal Nursing Home Scheme\".

I would like to reassure Deputy Danny Healy-Rae that as someone who comes from a farming background and who spent the first 15 years of my life on a farm, I fully understand the importance of farming communities and the contribution they make to rural Ireland.  I also fully understand the contribution of small and medium enterprises.  With that in mind, I want to assure all Deputies that I am committed, along with my Government colleagues, to removing any discrimination that affects farming and small business families.  I understand there is some urgency about this issue and every Deputy who contributed to the debate referred to that fact but this time last year the Government was only one month old.  I was only one week in office and with all the will in the world, to have something ready for last year's Estimates was just not possible.  However, I am giving a commitment now that this issue will be flagged in the context of the Estimates for budget 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The original intention was to establish all of the legislative changes required to the scheme on foot of the recommendations of the review of the scheme which was published in 2015.  Obviously, this took into account far more than the issues that are being discussed here today.  The intention was to address and implement all the amendments collectively.  However, in recognition of the concerns that have been raised by the farming and small business communities, by my own constituents and by many of the Deputies here, I will prioritise and fast-track changes to the legislation to deal with the uncertainty that is being felt by farming and business families and to provide the certainty called for in line with the commitment made in the programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputies that I recognise the sentiment underpinning their motion and agree with many elements therein.  However, as I have already said, we have been undertaking considerable work over the past while to bring forward developments in this area.  The motion calls on the Government to implement very specific policy initiatives to deal with any inequalities within the fair deal scheme in respect of the treatment of family farms and small business assets.  I am sure Deputies will appreciate that considerable policy work has been taking place in the Department in terms of exploring and assessing the various approaches to dealing with all these issues.  These are complex matters and it is important we wait for the completion of the examination of the issues, which is at an advanced stage, to ensure that an appropriate, sustainable and robust solution is brought forward which has a sound legal basis.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputies that it is my intention to bring this matter to a resolution as soon as possible.  However, I cannot commit to the proposed timeframe in the motion because further work is required to bring forward legislative changes.  We must also be cognisant of the busy legislative agenda of the House.  That said, I have prioritised the issue and have directed that the work on the examination of the matter be finalised as quickly as possible with a view to moving forward with legislative proposals soon.  I must stress again that we will bring forward the proposed changes relating to the issue in the context of budget 2018.   We will honour the commitment made in the programme for Government to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.  I acknowledge that some people are under severe pressure.  I am aware that while people can plan ahead to some degree, they cannot plan for the unforeseen and we must take that into account.<\/p>  <p>  I must point out that the future financial sustainability of the nursing home support scheme is of vital importance in terms of ensuring that we can provide the care that our older people need, as well as to the overall continuum of our health service.  I want to add my voice in appreciation of those who work in our public and private nursing homes and those who provide care for our elderly on a daily basis.  The nursing home support scheme is a vital piece of the wider health care system and it must be allowed to continue to operate successfully.  We must continue our work on the overall review of the scheme.  I met representatives from nursing homes in County Meath today.  They were quick to remind me that this motion refers to small businesses and that there are other small business owners who are affected, namely, those who own and run nursing homes.  We must continue with our pricing and value for money review and ensure that it is completed as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I am absolutely committed to promoting care within the community for older people so they can continue to live in their own homes, with their own families, in their own communities, surrounded by the people they love for as long as they want and as long as is possible.  It is my firmly held view that long-term nursing home care should be the last resort after home support and other community based supports have been exhausted.  In this regard, my Department is currently engaged in a detailed process to determine what type of home care scheme is best for Ireland.  This process will consider the future design of both the funding and the regulation system for these crucial services.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Kelleher raised the issue of the regionalisation of the nursing homes offices.  Obviously, following the review that took place in 2015, a number of recommendations were made separate from those relating to legislative changes and the value for money review.  One recommendation was to reduce the number of offices from 17 to 15 in order to improve efficiency and responsiveness and to ensure that there was greater expertise available within the regions.  That is being progressed at the moment.<\/p><p>I assure the Deputy that there will be additional support within the acute hospitals and the community to ensure local knowledge is maintained.  I can speak to the Deputy about that later if he wishes.<\/p> <p> I would like to conclude by repeating that I intend to honour the commitment we have given in our amendment this evening.  My intention, and that of the Department, is to remove any discrimination against those involved in the farming and business communities.  We will ensure they receive a fair deal.  I intend to continue to make progress with the overall review of the nursing home support scheme in the context of budget 2018.  I thank the Deputies again for raising this matter.  I appreciate the specific proposals they have made.  I hope they understand that I cannot accept them while the current process is continuing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100052#CCC00800","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496250600,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for his forbearance in changing time slots, etc.  I am delighted to be able to bring this evening's important debate to a conclusion.

I acknowledge the genuine good faith of the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  The comments she has just made are very helpful.  The input of the Minister of State and the Department of Health throughout this process is much appreciated.

I thank my colleagues for remaining in the Chamber during this evening's debate.<\/p>  <p>  The motion we have proposed calls on the Government to \"honour the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to remove discrimination against small businesses and family farms\" under the fair deal nursing home scheme.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, might not have been present during last year's talks.  We were all there.  We fought very hard day by day with senior members of the Minister of State's party to end this discriminatory anomaly.  That is the essence of the way we are proposing the motion.  It is about fairness.  It is about removing the perception that people in rural Ireland are second-class citizens, and are soft touches in terms of generating additional revenue for the State.  This motion is about finding a just and sustainable approach for farming families and communities.  We should not forget that farm families generate almost &euro;8 billion euro for the Irish economy every year.  That is not to be sniffed at, especially in the context of Brexit and the way the economy is.  When farmers are going well, Ireland is going well.  When farmers have money, they spend it.  They do not hold on to it.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment proposed by the Government, like the Minister of State, is genuine.  However, it is simply not acceptable to the members of the Rural Independent Group.  We eagerly await the publication of the findings of the interdepartmental report.  I do not like interdepartmental reports.  I do not like these things, especially when the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform gets involved because this leads to delays and delays.  The needs of farming families are urgent and immediate.  The reform of, and introduction of equity into, the fair deal scheme has to happen.  It must form a significant part of the conclusions of the interdepartmental group.  Farmers and farming families are responsible people.  They are eager and willing to pay their fair share as they have always done.  However, they are not eager to continue accepting an economic state of affairs in which they are disproportionately penalised and their assets are drained of value.<\/p>  <p>  As many speakers have said this evening, the farm is not an asset, as such - it is a tool of the trade needed by farmers to do their daily work so they can put bread and butter on the table, educate their families and pay their taxes.  The family farm is not a business like any other; it is the backbone of rural Ireland and the rural economy.  We know that now more than ever with the demise of post offices and local GP practices and the lack of industry and investment.  Small family businesses, particularly small farming enterprises, are sustaining rural Ireland.  The current arrangement radically undermines the viability of this country's entire farming model.  By undermining the family farm, the fair deal scheme is introducing a deeply destabilising element into the wider economy that provides our schools, playing fields and other amenities.  Farmers always put their shoulders to the wheel, for example by providing sites free of charge or at a very nominal fee for schools and other facilities.  This is one of the fundamental reasons this motion, which deals explicitly with farming families, is deeply linked to everyone who participates or wished to participate in the fair deal scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I repeat that this motion is not about seeking preferential treatment for farmers and small businesses, but about the introduction of equity and fairness.  That is what I am about here in my work with my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group.  We are looking for equity and fairness rather than discrimination against rural people.  We must find a way to balance the family care needs of farmers with their duty and responsibility to nurture the land and maintain the family farm model.  It is vital for the land to be nurtured and the family farm model to be retained.  We cannot have one conglomerate buying up all the property, as is happening in my county.  Small family farms are needed to keep the schools open and to keep the GAA and other sports teams going.  If we are to keep the lights on in rural Ireland, there must be people living there.<\/p>  <p>  While we recognise the positive aspects of the nursing home support scheme, we have serious concerns about its adverse impact on farm families.  I refer particularly to the viability of farm businesses and other small family businesses for the next generation.  As the IFA, the ICMSA and the ICSA have indicated, the assets of farmers and self-employed people with family businesses are productive assets rather than a measure of additional ability to pay.  The Revenue Commissioners, which have been mentioned by Deputies during this debate, have accepted this long-standing precedent in their treatment of different aspects of taxation including inheritance tax.  I do not know how the fair deal scheme ended up being imposed on farmers in such a discriminatory manner.  As Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said, it is not a fair deal at all.  It is a pretty poor deal.<\/p>  <p>  The current financial assessment is not progressive.  The contribution to the cost of long-term care is the same for a farm worth &euro;500,000 as it is for a farm worth &euro;5 million.  We are not talking about those kinds of farms or businesses.  We are talking about ordinary small people.  The assessment is fundamentally unfair and has a disproportionate impact on low-income farm families, where any further dilution of the farm assets could make the farm non-viable for future generations.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, knows and understands this because she was reared on a farm.  It is getting harder and harder to keep farms viable.  They cannot sustain this penalty.  This is a worry for many farmers.  Their health is failing as a result.  They are suffering from stress and trauma.  Farming is now a very lonely occupation.  It is not like the days of the meitheal when there were many people to help.  It is often the case that there is no one on the farm other than a husband and wife.  The husband might be there on his own during the day.  The concerns and pressures for those involved comprise one of the reasons we need to address this scheme.<\/p>  <p>  When the president of the ICMSA, Mr. John Comer, commented on the data in the 2016 Teagasc national farm survey, he referred to the decrease of 9% in farm incomes, including a reduction of 17% in the dairy sector.  Those of us who live in rural communities have seen the knock-on effects of those reductions, including the lack of business being transacted and the lack of investment in communities.  As I have said, farmers spend their money when they have it.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Eugene Murphy, knows this because he comes from a rural background.  Mr. Comer went on to say that the collapse in milk prices in 2015 and 2016 affected those who had made investments in the hope of getting better milk prices.  The farmers in question got back on their feet to a certain extent, but some of them are staggering badly.  I ask the Minister of State to take note of this because it demonstrates clearly how hard it is for farm families to keep their farms and their homes together.  These important and wonderful institutions - farms and homes - have been the bastion of our society over the decades.  We do not want factory farms and big conglomerates.  They are no good to rural Ireland.  They are no good to anywhere.<\/p>  <p>  Mar focal scoir, we need reform now.  We need this to be done.  The Minister of State is talking about an interdepartmental review.  She has referred to research into which the IFA and others have fed.  Many farmers were not aware of that.  They are not aware of such matters because they are so busy.  They do not see all these advertisements.  The Department does not reach its tentacles into where they operate.  As I have said, farmers can be lonely and isolated.  They need common sense here.  I accept the Minister of State's bona fides when she says she wants to deal with this matter in the Estimates and in budget 2018.  It has to be in the budget for 2018.  Farmers have been discriminated against for long enough at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  I have to pay tribute to the management and staff in the nursing home industry.  I am talking about private people who borrowed money to make these investments.  It was a scandal for Deputies from the AAA-PBP to speak as they did.  I refer to the anti-everything group who say \"won't pay, can't pay\".  They pay for nothing.  They want everything off the State.  How dare they criticise the entrepreneurial skills of the entrepreneurs who have built nursing homes up and down the country to provide places for sick people?  What do they want us all to do?  I do not know what they want.  Do they want anarchy?  The Deputies from the Social Democrats and Green Party never even came in to speak in this debate.  That shows the interest they have in rural Ireland, the small business people of Ireland and the small farmers of Ireland, who are the backbone of our society.  I think it is shameful.  I hope the people will know they did not participate in this debate.  We are here and we make no apology for it.<\/p>  <p>  The Rural Independent Group is here to represent the people of rural and urban Ireland.  When I say \"rural\", I mean everything outside the Red Cow.  We are representing those people.  We listen to those people.  We are of that community.  We listen to it and we represent it.  We have a duty as Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la to represent rural people.  We are not all living in this mad city where one cannot get a house, sustain a living or get a school place.<\/p><p>We have the schools, the infrastructure and enthusiastic people who want to work, to diversify their farms and to keep their small businesses going to give employment to the people in the community.  We know the pressures on shopkeepers and post offices.  We want to keep them all in business.  If there is further discrimination against farmers and small businesses, we will close down rural Ireland.  The six or seven members of the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit group might hire an eight seater van during the summer holidays and go down the country.  We will show them what goes on in rural Ireland and the dedication of the people and the communities that make the place tick.  I refer to people working on farms, working with clubs and engaged in everything else that is good about Ireland.  Those Members should not be anti-everything.  They do not want anyone to invest in anything.  I do not know what kind of a country they want.  We would have a barren wasteland where they could fly around with their placards and zone in and zone out.  They are not zoned into rural Ireland.  They have no interest in it.  I do not come up here to bash the working class people of Dublin.  I represent them also.  We have to represent all creeds and none, and all types of people in whatever employment they are in or whatever lives they lead.  We have to represent our diaspora also, who will have no one to come home to if those Members get their way because we will have nothing.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister of State and her colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, in whatever role they are in next week after the big day-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100053#DDD00200","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496251200,"counter":604,"content":"<p>That is the second time the Deputy said that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100054#EEE00200","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1496251200,"counter":605,"content":"<p>-----and who I wish well-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100054#EEE00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1496251200,"counter":606,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100054#EEE00400","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1496251200,"counter":607,"content":"<p>-----to continue this work.

This is a short, technical Bill that will have a positive impact on certain companies doing business in Ireland.  It will extend the current expiry date of December 2020 to enable qualifying companies, incorporated in Ireland, to prepare and file financial statements using the US generally accepted accounting principles, GAAP, rather than international financial reporting standards, IFRS.  The extension provided for in this legislation is for ten years to December 2030.  This continued exemption provides for an ease of doing business in Ireland and spares some companies the associated costs of switching systems.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also contains a new requirement, namely, that only companies registered in Ireland before its commencement will benefit from its provisions, and I appreciate the inclusion of that requirement in the legislation.  It has been included to prevent future inversions, which have had a damaging effect on Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation.  With this extra criteria, extending the deadline until 2030 cannot be seen as Ireland encouraging further inversions.  Any measure that benefits Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation is always welcome.<\/p>  <p>  I met representatives of the Coalition for Irish International Companies a few weeks ago and they are anxious to get this Bill passed to avoid unnecessary financial expenditure if it is delayed.  Should the current deadline of 2020 stand, they will need to start their preparations for the alternative straight away.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill was before the Select Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation last week and we moved it through quickly in order to give companies concerned about this issue the reassurance of our commitment to it.

It essentially allows a sunset clause for companies that have engaged in inversions, which is a tax avoidance strategy by American multinationals, where, through a paper exercise, they switch their headquarters to here in order to avoid tax.  It is part of the global tax scam being perpetrated against the citizens of the world by these multinationals, which this country has been actively facilitating.  The behaviour of these multinationals in engaging in inversions and other tax scams in quite a shameful manner is the single greatest contributory factor to the spectacular and growing wealth and income inequality across the world.  Yet again, as in the case of the double Irish tax mechanism, because we are put under pressure on these matters, we have to finally and very reluctantly do something but we make sure that we provide a get out clause for the companies that have been engaging in this activity to date.  It is worth mentioning in passing that the double Irish tax mechanism continues to be utilised by companies such as Google and Facebook.  They are still evading their proper tax liabilities.  They are using the double Irish tax mechanism because, despite the trumpeted headlines about it being closed down, in reality, it was extended.  The companies using the double Irish tax mechanism were allowed, and will continue to be allowed, to do so for a number of years.  No doubt as the Minister said, and as alluded to by the previous speaker from Sinn F&eacute;in, this legislation will prevent it in the future but, in reality, it is giving them time to find new ways to avoid tax rather than being forced to apply these accounting standards now.<\/p><p>I oppose this because it still facilitates the wider architecture of tax evasion by big multinational companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100054#EEE02900","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1496251800,"counter":632,"content":"<p>I support this Bill, as I do with anything that tries to facilitate or help accommodate companies.

I also thank the Minister for coming to County Kerry, where she had a productive and workpersonlike visit.  She saw at first hand very great companies operating in my county that are giving very gainful employment, paying very good wages and doing very well.  I thank her for coming to Kerry because she has many places to go to and her visit was very important.<\/p>  <p>  I will cite one example.  Deputy Boyd Barrett knows I am very fond of him but at the same time we must agree to disagree on this matter.  Many years ago in the great town of Killarney, Mr. Hans Liebherr came to Ireland and he was looking to invest and start the manufacturing cranes.  He was brought here and politicians helped and encouraged him in every way they could.  The other night I passed the Liebherr factory perhaps between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. and there were hundreds of cars outside it.  There are over 1,000 people directly employed there, not to mention those who are employed indirectly, such as subcontractors, other contractors and hauliers who bring the raw material and leave with the finished product.  There are ships that transport it to Europe and the world.  If the politicians of the time had not the foresight to entice Mr. Hans Liebherr here, where would those 1,000 people be today below in Killarney and the environs, such as Kilcummin, Sneem, Killorglin or Milltown?  They might not have any work.  If wages are at one level ordinarily, the wages paid in the factory are at a higher level; it is above the norm.  This is because the people working in Liebherr are highly skilled and educated, producing very exceptional goods and selling them around the world.<\/p>  <p>  I hear politicians being critical of tax incentives.  One might call it tax evasion but there is such a thing as being tax-prudent and being intelligent about taxes so as to avoid tax.  I do not care if a businessman is a farmer, in plant hire or has a shop but if he is prudent about taxes, staying within the law while trying to minimise the tax bill, there is nothing wrong with that.  It is legal and it is okay to do so.  It is clearly wrong to evade tax and do anything illegal.  When I hear politicians being critical of a Minister, perhaps, who might try to entice foreign investment to the country, I would have one question, which is how many people received wages from that politician last week.  I look at politicians in this House whom I admire, as well as county councillors in local authorities and Senators but at the back of my head, I am asking how many people are on their payroll and how many people are they employing at home.  How many cheques do they write every week and how many houses are they keeping going in their local communities?  If a politician is to know the problems of people in business, we must ask how many people he or she is paying every week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100055#FFF00900","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1496251800,"counter":640,"content":"<p>We should ask how big are the profits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100055#FFF01000","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1496251800,"counter":641,"content":"<p>This will be a good judge of how well educated that politician is to discuss the jobs issue.  I always hear people saying they are here to represent the working man but outside of politics, they may have never done a day's work in their lives.  They certainly may not have paid anybody else to do a day's work in their lives.  I do not care if politicians are Labour, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in or Fine Gael but it is incumbent on every one of us to encourage as many people - from America, Europe or any part of the world - to come here.  We must make an environment that is attractive to them so they can provide much-needed jobs to our children and grandchildren, so they can stay working in Ireland.  Whether it happens through tax incentives or any other mechanism, I support any Minister who creates that environment.  I will stand shoulder to shoulder with any person, regardless of the political party or flag being flown, in that regard.  That is all I want to say on this matter.  It is so important that we encourage investment into our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100055#FFF01100","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1496251800,"counter":642,"content":"<p>What about the red flag?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100055#FFF01200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1496252400,"counter":643,"content":"<p>To confirm, as we have on previous Stages, Fianna F&aacute;il will support the Bill.  It is vital for the 8,000 highly skilled jobs that have already been mentioned in the Chamber.  As we are dependent in some shape or form on the enactment of these provisions, I welcome the manner in which the Bill was progressed in respect of the stakeholder participation, which I believe took place in July 2016.  A variety of stakeholders were invited to submit their views.  I note that the companies surveyed and the stakeholders involved were unanimously in favour of extending the measure to allow them to report in this way, which is critical.<\/p>  <p>  The wider theme, that is, how we support, facilitate and encourage this ongoing activity in the Irish market by the US and, in particular, multinationals is key to our whole industrial policy and has been for many years.  It brings to mind one thought on a similar vein.  The FDA agency is not represented in Ireland.  There may be an argument to be made for it to be given a kind of embassy or outpost here, which would facilitate those multinational corporations and American companies that are investing in Ireland, particularly the pharma industry, which is also critical to our industrial policy.  This might be something to consider.<\/p>  <p>  The legal certainty provided by this measure is long overdue.  The companies caught in the crux of this issue have been exposed to this question in recent years.  We are aware that many countries in the EU have already adopted these measures, including France, the UK, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Germany.  In particular, when we consider the UK, Brexit and the post-Brexit landscape, it is clear we are actively in competition for jobs with our closest companion, our English-speaking neighbour, which is within the same zone at present.  Therefore, it is particularly important we have clarity and certainty and reach out to those companies that may make investment decisions in the next few months and few years as we face into a post-Brexit landscape.  It is also important we have certainty and clarity as to how these 8,000 jobs and the companies that support them are protected.  I note that my party indicated it would table an amendment on Report Stage in respect of this measure.  I think the Government was considering the statutory audits Bill as a possible alternative.  I do not think that would have been sufficient because it would have delayed the process further and would not have brought the certainty required.  I, therefore, welcome the fact the Government has now taken this Bill on board and is at the stage at which it is ready to conclude the legislative process.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to address a few very general points made in the debate about the value of enterprise and the role it plays in the wider economy.  This is critical because without enterprise, where would we create the income that funds public services?  There is a philosophical debate at play there.  It is a very fundamental principle: without income, there can be no expenditure.  That is fundamental to this Bill as to so many other pieces of legislation in this area.  This is how we draw the finance to fund the public services that are so important.  We need measures of this kind to support enterprise and these kinds of industrial players.  One would not succeed without the other.  We support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100056#GGG00100","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1496252400,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I add my voice to those supporting the Bill.  As a member of the Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I have met the stakeholders involved in this.  Obviously, we want to continue creating a stable environment for these organisations so that they stay here and make a home in Ireland, in particular against the backdrop of Brexit and the uncertainty it brings.  When any of these organisations consider a country such as Ireland, they seek business stability, political stability and environmental stability.  Whatever we can do, we need to concretise that certainty.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe for a second the speculation that this gives companies more time to find ways to evade tax because, as was mentioned, if one is prudent about one's accounts, one will try to maximise one's potential as best one can within the law.  We are a competitive nation regarding tax - we had to be.  We were in the doldrums for years.  We had to consider alternative ways of providing employment and educating our citizens.  I feel very strongly about this, having worked in multinational organisations.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the House to consider the period from the late 1980s to the early 1990s.  In the small village where I am from, one person might have gone to university.  These multinational organisations facilitated more people to go to university because it was seen as a benefit of the job to be educated through one's job, and these organisations paid for that education.  These people went on to form domestic companies afterwards and became employers in their own right.  We have seen this when travelling throughout the world.  These people hold positions throughout the world and have experience in other, sister organisations.  I ask the House to take Dell as an example.  People went to Austin for five years, came back to Limerick, set up their own businesses or returned to work in Dell.  There has been huge development in this regard and these companies have been huge education drivers.  This is, therefore, much broader than just the economic side of things; it has a social implication as well.<\/p>  <p>  I hear the words of the hard left on this and I understand it is an ideological view but I never hear how, if what the hard left suggests were to happen, the transition from one part to the other would happen.  I have never heard anything about a transition in this regard.  I understand I am ideologically poles apart from the hard left when it comes to this.  We may have some similarities on social issues, but this is something I feel extremely strongly about.  I ask the House to take Limerick, my own county, as an example.  Since 2011, when we were in the depths of a recession, and since the previous Government came into office, the likes of Northern Trust has been increasing its workforce.  There were wastelands with factories which have now been taken over.  There is the likes of Regeneron, which has come in with 300 or 400 jobs.  I was speaking to someone on Sunday about this.  There is the likes of DesignPro in Rathkeale, a small town in the middle of County Limerick where my office is located.  DesignPro employs up to 90 people.  There is Ortec, which is coming to Newcastle West, one of the major towns of County Limerick.  Ortec is providing 110 jobs.  These people have to make a living.  The 100 cars outside at night were mentioned.  This is what will keep us going.  This is what sustainability means.  This is what we are talking about.  The bottom line is jobs, and this is an area in which we can compete extremely well and one in which we need to continue competing.<\/p>  <p>  I do not want the word to go out to the wider world that there is some kind of witch-hunt going on with these companies.  We want to keep them here.  They provide employment and education through their benefits, and the innovation side of these companies is driving education as well.  I am delighted to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100056#GGG00200","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1496252400,"counter":645,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100056#GGG00300","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1496252400,"counter":646,"content":"<p>First, I need to put on the record that this is not about tax; it is about how companies report their financial affairs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100056#GGG00400","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1496252400,"counter":647,"content":"<p>That is closely linked to tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100056#GGG00500","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1496252400,"counter":648,"content":"<p>My second point is something I have been waiting a long time to say to Deputy Boyd Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100056#GGG00600","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1496252400,"counter":649,"content":"<p>Sure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017053100056#GGG00700","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1496252400,"counter":650,"content":"<p>He needs to go to Sandyford Industrial Estate and see the thousands of people working there.
