The final submission from the sub-committee will come before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of both Houses and we will be in a position to debate the terms of reference of the inquiry by mid-October.  It is interesting that Fianna F&aacute;il's finance spokesperson, Deputy Michael McGrath, has said he is satisfied the inquiry will not be a witch-hunt against his party.  The acceptance of the suggestions of Deputy Joe Higgins that the inquiry should consider, for example, the role of the media is welcome because there have been allegations of a cosy consensus around the property market, given its value to the media during this period.  I am sure the media will welcome this.<\/p><p>It is a testament to the maturity of the members of the sub-committee from both sides of the two Houses that they have worked so well together and achieved such a consensus in a short time.  This leads me to understand there will be a full outcome to the inquiry during the term of this Seanad, to whcih I very much look forward.  Many people lost their life savings and had their lives destroyed.  Some remain in negative equity or have had their homes repossessed.  We can never move forward until we know the truth about what happened, not just on the fateful night in September 2008 but during the previous 15 or 20 years.  It is welcome that the inquiry's mandate covers the period from the mid-1990s, if necessary, and that we will have the terms of reference before us, I hope, by mid-October.<\/p> <p>We have raised the issue of the upcoming budget on a number of occasions.  The Budget Statement will take place in two weeks' time.  There is a lot of discussion in the media about conflicting suggestions from different bodies as to what the Government should and should not do in regard to the budget.  There has been debate on whether it should deal with the entire &euro;2 billion figure, as was suggested by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, &euro;800 million as suggested by the Nevin Economic Research Institute or, as the Minister suggested, that we have a neutral budget.  My concern is that much of the debate has focused on the issue of tax breaks.  I want to make a plea.  I and a number of other Members are working with the NGO sector.  I am well aware of the stress and crisis the sector has been under over the past number of years.  It has become a clich&eacute; to refer to doing less with more, but NGOs have been doing less with more for a long period of time when dealing with very vulnerable people in situations where there are no immediate outcomes.  We need to move forward in supporting the most vulnerable people rather than giving tax cuts and tax breaks to people who do not necessarily need them.  On that point, I call for a debate on the wider economy and the priorities we should have in terms of a fair and redistributive society.  I would like such a debate before the budget but if that is not possible it should take place shortly afterwards.  <\/p><p>Could the Leader check the status of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill?

It is one of the largest drug seizures in the history of the State and probably one of the largest in the history of Europe.  For every one caught bringing in drugs, there are possibly others getting through, using our coastline.<br\/>The seizure was of pure cocaine.  The trouble is that the people who use cocaine are fuelling the industry in Ireland and throughout the world.  Those who advocate the use of marijuana and other drugs are bringing young people into a life of drugs.  Cocaine is particularly dangerous but less hard drugs are also dangerous.  It is regrettable that anyone in public life and elected to the European Parliament should be advocating the use of these narcotic drugs and bringing young people into a life of misery.  We are very fortunate to have the support of the Garda.  The three suspects are now to be questioned in Cork.

Since he rightly raised the issue, I have received in my mailbox an incredible number of lobbying communications proposing that we spend a surplus that does not exist.  There have been calls from lobby groups for more corporate tax breaks and reliefs for the property, construction, hotel and film sectors and the usual suspects.

We should discuss the HIQA report on defibrillators.  It is essential and worth doing.  Some aspects of it need attention, one of which cropped up yesterday in a discussion.  The tax on betting is either 1% or 2%, but the tax on defibrillators - that is, VAT - is 23%.  That is unacceptable.  We have drawn the attention of the Minister to that and he said he would see what we could do about it in Europe, because it is a matter controlled by Europe.  The same applies to another Bill passed in this House, which relates to compulsory carbon monoxide detectors in houses.  Such detectors also attract a VAT rate of 23%, while the betting tax is 1% or 2%.  These are the sorts of thing we should discuss.  Senator Sean Barrett says that too many of us are looking for budgetary changes, but this is something that is being handled by Europe and we are told we do not have the freedom to do anything without going back to Europe.

The office of the Leader kindly sent me a copy of the debate that took place in the D&aacute;il, including a statement by the Minister, on petrol stretching.  In the statement, the Minister said he was satisfied with the progress by the Revenue Commissioners in tackling fuel fraud and with the excellent co-operation between the Revenue Commissioners and the fuel sector.  The Minister also said that, since 2011, 30 oil-laundering plants had been closed down, 3 million litres of illicit fuel had been seized and more than 120 filling stations had been closed.  That is great.  However, in the past week several containers of diesel sludge have been illegally dumped on Louth roads.  International bulk containers - transporter containers with liquid - have been removed by contractors for Louth County Council.  Six were dumped at Stephenstown Pond in Knockbridge.<\/p> <p>There was a slight spillage from one of them.  Last Wednesday Louth County Council was notified that nine barrels and one international bulk container of diesel sludge had been dumped on the roadside near Faughart graveyard.  On Thursday morning cubes of diesel sludge were dumped on the roads in Kilkerley, while three IBCs of diesel sludge were dumped at Ballykelly ESB station.  Years ago smuggling was a gentleman's game.  Smugglers and Customs and Excise and Revenue engaged in a game of cat and mouse and if they were caught, the smugglers held up their hands and took the hit.  A smuggler who attempted to smuggle several tonnes of butter or some cattle may have had his lorry seized and that would have been the end of the matter.  There is some evidence to suggest those trying to deal with this matter are being intimidated.

Unfortunately, these gangsters are, by and large, getting away with intimidating people.  People living in the Border counties and the councils that represent them must pick up the tab for dealing with the sludge that is abandoned throughout the area.  I call on the Minister to come before the House to discuss this issue.

His behaviour towards the Seanad has been regrettable from day one.  His pre-election promise to hold a referendum to abolish the Seanad was valid and an honourable question was put to the people and defeated.  However, the manner in which the campaign was conducted was not so honourable.  People sent a clear message that there was a real and palpable need for Seanad reform.  I was delighted, therefore, when Mr. McDermott of Young Fine Gael stated one of the things that needed to be fixed was the onerous panel system.  I fully agree with him that it should be abolished.  Why can we not have a reform based on universal franchise to a co-equal Chamber? <\/p><p>I propose to refer in passing to an extraordinary coincidence yesterday in respect of two sets of visitors to the House.  The first visitors were representatives of the Amahdi branch of Islam, a widely persecuted and admired near pacifist movement within the Islamic community whose members suffer terrible persecution in many parts of the world because of the perception that they depart somewhat from what some would regard as the orthodoxy of that peaceful religion.  They were followed by representatives of the Iranian Parliament who visited the House as part of the Iran-Ireland parliamentary friendship group.  I hope the visit provided an opportunity to raise the issue of the systematic persecution of people for their religious beliefs in the Islamic Republic of Iran.  I refer, in particular, to the Baha'i minority whose persecution extends to not being allowed to practise their faith and being regarded not as a religious but as a political movement which has resulted in the judicial deaths of several hundred of them.  I ask that Senators be given an opportunity, during the time remaining to us, to invite representatives of oppressed religious minorities in different parts of the world, be they members of the Baha'i faith, Amahdi Muslims or Coptic Christians in Egypt, to give us a flavour of how this problem is panning out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500007#F00700","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1411639800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Many more questions have been raised about the business of the Seanad by-election, notably a compelling interview with Mr. Gerard Craughwell on Newstalk this morning.  I urge anyone who has not heard the interview to listen to it.  What has happened in this case almost amounts to a fraud, of which Mr. Craughwell was the victim.  Senator Darragh O'Brien has proposed that the Seanad use its powers under the inquiries Act to launch a full and comprehensive investigation into what took place this week.  This presents a challenge to Senators who must to decide whether they wish to talk about this issue or find out exactly what took place.  It is essential that the Minister and the Taoiseach come before the House to discuss the issue.<\/p><p>Why does the website of the Companies Registration Office not feature any information on changes in the directors of the Irish Museum of Modern Art?  No change has been registered with the office and its website does not give any indication of a change in directors.  Apparently, the individual in question used his alleged directorship, which is not recorded in the Companies Registration Office as far as I can see, to qualify himself, belts and braces, for selection on the Cultural and Educational Panel.  If the Seanad is to take itself seriously, it must carry out a full investigation to ascertain what took place.<\/p><p>The fault for this issue lies not with Mr. McNulty but with his superiors in the Fine Gael Party and the Government who decided that this appointment needed to be made if Mr. McNulty was to qualify for the panel.  He would have qualified in any case; that is not the issue.  The issue concerns the shenanigans that took place at senior levels of the Government in appointing someone to the board of an important museum for a number of weeks.  I question whether the appointment has been made or is valid.  Senator Paul Coghlan has stated there are 15 board positions available in the IMMA.  The latest Companies Registration Office printout lists 14 members of the IMMA board.  How did the Minister allegedly appoint two people to the board?

Since then, it has become a major issue with householders across the country.  Members of the other House have raised questions about it and the Data Protection Commissioner has become involved.  Despite the fact that the Minister assured me at that time that the PPS numbers would be used exclusively by Irish Water, a suspicion has now emerged that Irish Water might be privatised eventually, which has resulted in concern about what would happen to the personal details held on its database.

The Data Protection Commissioner has examined the level of personal detail Irish Water proposes to seek from householders in the application form.  Irish Water will be liaising with the Department of Social Protection to verify that the PPS information provided is correct to ensure that customers are entitled to any allowances being provided.  This is necessary for Irish Water to account properly for the allowances that are to be funded by the Exchequer.  This will also ensure that there is transparency in the use of public funds.  Irish Water is a specified body under section 20 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014 and is therefore permitted to request PPS numbers to authenticate the identity of a person being provided with an allowance.  Irish Water will treat applicants' personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Acts of 1988 and 2003.  Irish Water has confirmed to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that its data protection notice is fully compliant with data protection requirements and that it is in regular contact with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner to ensure that this is the case.  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Senator.  <\/p><p>Senator Mooney also encouraged the link-ups between post offices and credit unions which have been suggested.

That is the spirit in which they are offered.  As stated in a previous discussion on these issues, these measures are absolutely necessary because as Sir Humphrey is not a natural democrat he will, unfortunately, use all of his skills to conceal information from the public.  As a parliament, we are trying to bring information into the open.  <br\/>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 arise out of the Explanatory Memorandum, and on the basis of the speech made by the Minister on the last occasion we discussed this Bill, which states that this Bill will enable FOI to apply to all public bodies.  Essentially, FOI is being extended to the widest possible definition of public bodies.  Amendment No. 2 seeks the deletion of the phrase &quot;or a prescribed body&quot; so as to provide that FOI applies to all public bodies.  It is nudge economics.  We are nudging bodies and people into this area and want to ensure there are no loopholes through which they might escape.  For example, a future Minister may be less enthusiastic about this matter and may not so prescribe.  Should we not, therefore, be providing that this applies to all public bodies and, <i>ditto<\/i>, in respect of all voluntary bodies in receipt of public money?  There should be no fudge around this.  All bodies know where the Exchequer is when looking for funding and should also know where the parliament is when seeking information.  That is the spirit in which amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are proposed.  In other words, there is no need to prescribe and every body is included.  <br\/>Amendment No. 13 relates to voluntary bodies and incorporates words from a later section of the Bill, which states:<blockquote>(1) Having regard to the need to ensure the oversight of entities that, although not public bodies, receive funding from the State and the need for such bodies to adhere to the principles of transparency and accountability in government and public affairs as respects those of their activities that are funded by the State, such bodies and activities are subject to this Act.<\/blockquote>This amendment seeks the provision of more power for the current Minister and his successors.  I know the Minister will utilise his power but I want to make sure his successors are similarly constrained.  It is a strong message of support which is influenced by the work being done by Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch in the banking arena, where there were amazing bouts of amnesia and failure to keep records.  Bodies should not be permitted to say that they do not keep records lest somebody at the behest of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, starts asking FOI questions.  As I said, I am on the Minister's side on this.  That is the spirit of the amendments.  All bodies and organisations which receive funding from the Exchequer should be included, as is every public body and, therefore, there is no need to prescribe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500010#K01300","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411641900,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

On receipt of the Senator&rsquo;s amendment I requested confirmation from the Office of the Attorney General that \"person\" as referred to in the definition of service provider on page 14 of the Bill does include a company within the meaning of the Companies Act.  Therefore, the intent of the amendment, that \"person\" would capture the word \"company\", is already, on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General, the position.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 11, tabled by Senator Byrne and other Fianna F&aacute;il Senators, raises the issue of Bus &Eacute;ireann's school transport operations.  It was always intended that the Bill would include Bus &Eacute;ireann school transport services carried out on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  I advised that the service would be covered within six months of the Bill's enactment through the restoration of the application of FOI records held by service providers in so far as the records related to a service provided under contract to the Department.  This was the original construction of the Bill.  However, a recent High Court judgment determined that the Department of Education and Skills does not have a contract with the transport providers but has what the High Court determined to be an administrative arrangement - not a contract - with Bus &Eacute;ireann for school transport services.  On foot of this judgment, I amended the definition of service provider in section 2 on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il to ensure that school transport services provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann to the Department of Education and Skills would be subject to FOI.  The amendment I made in the D&aacute;il addresses the concerns of Senator Byrne and his colleagues.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 18, also tabled by Senator Byrne and his colleagues, it would not be possible to provide a list of bodies that might provide services under contract to an FOI body into the future.  It is deemed unnecessary to provide such a list, since the provision came into operation subsequent to the 1997 Act, and I am not aware of any difficulty that has arisen since.  It would be an extraordinary thing to try to project which bodies might conceivably provide services into the future.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 35 seeks to remove Bus &Eacute;ireann from the list of exempt bodies, and the House knows my view on this.  Where there is a unique provider of a service, such as the school transport service, it is subject to FOI, but where it is in direct competition with the commercial sector it would seriously disadvantage a State body if it uniquely were subject to FOI.  Therefore, I am not extending FOI to the commercial semi-State bodies that are competitive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500013#N02400","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1411643100,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his explanation, but I am still not happy.

The insertion of this new subsection will guarantee that this Bill does not impede access to information vital for genealogical research or historical reasons.  The amendment aims to ensure that the current status of the records of the General Register Office as public records will be reaffirmed.  It is important to include this text in the legislation.<br\/>The report of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform pointed out that this legislation could have the unintended consequence of restricting rather than broadening access to certain records, especially those of a genealogical potential.  Genealogists are very concerned about the reclassification of the records held by the General Register Office from their current status as &quot;public records on individuals held by the State&quot; to personal records on individuals held by the State.<br\/>The reference in section 2(1) of the principal Act is of particular concern as it makes direct reference to the interpretation provided by the Civil Registration Act 2004, which deals with life events of the individual as follows: &quot;event&quot; means a birth, stillbirth, adoption, foreign adoption, marriage, death, decree of divorce or decree of nullity occurring or granted anywhere in the State or a birth to which section 26 or 27 applies or a death to which section 38 or 39 applies and includes a birth, stillbirth, adoption, foreign adoption, marriage or death that could have been, but was not, registered in a register formally maintained under the repealed enactments.<br\/>However, section 2(1)(b)(viii) of this Bill states, &quot;information relating to the religion, race, racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation or civil status (within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Civil Registration Act of 2004) of, any disability of, or the political opinions or the religious or philosophical beliefs of, the individual&quot;.  That seems to suggest that a number of the above recorded events would be reclassified as personal records.  Indeed, parts of section 2(1)(b) could be interpreted so as to impede access to land records, electoral rolls and other records of huge interest to genealogists and to local historians.  The Genealogical Society of Ireland believes that is an extraordinary and wholly unnecessary reclassification of public records.  It also believes that an amendment such as the one I have tabled would clear up other issues such as death certificates and refusals for information by freedom of information, FOI, bodies.<br\/>Overall, the organisation believes that the Bill as drafted has the potential, although I am sure unintentionally, of greatly impeding genealogical research by anyone not directly connected with the family or the individual being researched.  For these reasons I urge the Minister to accept this amendment to ensure that genealogists are not restricted in their work and that the spirit of the freedom of information principle is protected.<br\/>My amendment No. 17 also relates to genealogy matters.  It simply aims to further guarantee the right of access to records.  It is not a ground-breaking amendment but a simple clarification that aims to ensure that FOI bodies consider the public's access to records.  The clear statement in this Bill of public ownership and right of access to records is very important, especially when improving our overall FOI culture, that is, I believe a clear principle of public ownership and right of access to our genealogical heritage should be included in the text of the legislation.  This can serve as a guide for FOI bodies regarding public records, laying the foundations for what I would call a customer charter.<br\/>From a business perspective, this amendment aims to further ensure that this country continues to develop its expanding ancestry tourism market and top sustainability of Ireland as a destination for genealogical research.  More important, this amendment aims to ensure a people's human rights as well as their cultural rights that are protected in terms of allowing them access to records.  I hope the Minister can accept this amendment because I believe it will further improve the relationship between FOI bodies and the public, and ensure that the spirit of freedom of information is further enhanced.<br\/>Amendment No. 27 refers to including &quot;in relation to the operation of the principle of public ownership and right of access to a genealogical heritage.&quot;  This is a relatively straightforward amendment and one that the Genealogical Society of Ireland supports.  It is about improving the culture of freedom of information and, in some ways, ensuring there is a better interaction between the service provider - the FOI bodies and the customer - and the public who are seeking records.  <br\/>As I stated earlier, the word &quot;principle&quot; is very important.  I believe the over-arching principle of public ownership and right of access should be clearly stated in this Bill.  State bodies should give the Minister this as a guiding principle, and I hope the Minister can accept this amendment for that reason.<br\/>As the Minister can gather, to a certain extent I am quoting what the Genealogical Society of Ireland has asked me to put forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500014#O00500","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1411643700,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I call Senator Norris to speak to amendments Nos. 6, 17 and 27.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500014#O00600","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1411643700,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I also received this briefing from the Genealogical Society of Ireland and I completely concur with what Senator Quinn has said.

The purpose is to have information important to the public discourse available in public; it is not to have everything known about people available.  Let us consider the things that are excluded.  Information on the medical, psychiatric or psychological history of an individual is not subject to FOI; nor is information relating to the financial affairs of an individual, by and large, and so on.  The details are listed on page 14 of the original 1997 Act.<\/p><p>I am making no change to the current status of records of the General Register Office as public records.  I see no basis for Senator Quinn's concern that parts of the definition could be interpreted as impeding access to records or electoral rolls.  That is not the case.  Certainly, that is not my intention, and my advice from the parliamentary draughtsman is that this is not the effect of it.  The updating of the definition of personal information that I have carried out has no impact, good, bad or indifferent, on access to information.  It simply modernises the definition of personal information to include the two things to which I have referred.  Marital status has been broadened to include civil status, and I have included trade union membership as well.<\/p><p>The updating does not impact on access.  Indeed, an amendment on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il that I accepted expanded the definition of what is not classified as personal information.  Information relating to the terms and conditions of any individual who holds or has held any public office or any position in a body subject to freedom of information requirements and in respect of the remuneration of that person was excluded under the original Bill but is now included.  Information on everyone who is being remunerated from the public purse, unless it is specifically excluded, is incorporated into the Bill.<\/p><p>The General Register Office is part of the Department of Social Protection.  All the information held in the General Register Office is therefore subject to freedom of information provisions, and this will continue to be the case.  The proposed legislation does not prevent access to the register as provided for under the Civil Registration Act.<\/p><p>In the case of amendments Nos. 17 and 27, I am satisfied that the Freedom of Information Act can be availed of by genealogists for the purpose of seeking access to records in connection with a search in respect of an individual's genealogical heritage.  That has been the case up to now and it will continue to be the case.  It is not affected in any way, good, bad or indifferent, by what I am suggesting now.  I am not of the view that the legislation should be reconfigured specifically with the purpose of identifying such searches as a particular function of the Bill.  Freedom of information requests can be used for genealogical research, but that is not the prime purpose of the legislation.

Second, there may be cases in which a person is considering getting involved in a relationship and institutionalising it through marriage, civil partnership or whatever there is.  Let us suppose there was a concern that the other party had already been involved in a civil partnership or marriage.

An amendment along these lines was tabled in the D&aacute;il and I gave it very careful consideration.<\/p><p>Reflecting the constitutional provisions on the President, it has always been accepted that the President and the Office of the President are beyond the normal fray and to and fro of politics.  The tradition, both in this House and the other is that we do not discuss the President.  My approach is in keeping with the long-held tradition respecting the status and independence of the Office of the President.  All sides of the House agree this is vital to the dignity and role of the Office of the President and presidency.  This is very much appreciated by the public at large.<\/p><p>The FOI Acts exclude records relating to the President.  This obviously reflects the accepted view.  The amendments before the House do not propose to remove the exclusion of the records relating to the President, only the Office of the President, but I am of the view that the smallness and intimacy of that office would make distinguishing between the President and Office of the President very difficult.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 10 and 41 seek to include the administrative functions of Tourism Ireland under FOI.  The Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, in my absence on the closing of Second Stage, explained it is one of the North&ndash;South bodies established under the British-Irish Agreement of 1999 and given statutory effect under the British&ndash;Irish Agreement Act.  Since I am dealing with aspects of the North&ndash;South agreement constantly under the SEUBP with my Northern colleague, I can confirm that we cannot unilaterally alter the conditionality of bodies established under it.  This is done in a bipartisan way under the auspices of the North&ndash;South Ministerial Council.  It is not within our legal remit.  However, the FOI code that applies to North&ndash;South bodies is based on FOI legislation both in Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Its primary objective is to facilitate access to information held by these bodies.  In view of this arrangement, which ensures there is appropriate openness and transparency in regard to the bodies' activities, consistent with their status as North&ndash;South bodies, it is not possible to include them.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 12 seeks to include receivers and administrators, whether appointed by NAMA or other secured lenders, under the definition of &quot;public bodies&quot; in section 6.  The receiver or administrator, as the Senator is aware, is an independent legal officer appointed to take control of and realise the assets of securing any particular loan.  The receiver or administrator acts as the legal agent for the benefit of the borrower and not the lender or secured creditor.  The receiver or administrator's costs are borne by the receivership and not by the lender.  Accordingly, it is not appropriate to define receivers and administrators as public bodies.  I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 25, tabled by Senator Barrett, would delete the reference to any of the supervisory directives and the reference to &quot;within the meaning of the Central Bank Act of 1942&quot;.  The confidentiality and professional secrecy requirements contained in and stemming from the European system of Central Banks, ESCB, statute require that similar protections be provided in domestic law.  Under EU directives relating to banking supervision and the non-banking financial services industry, there is an obligation imposed of professional secrecy on the Central Bank of Ireland.  In proposing to bring the Central Bank within the scope of FOI, I had to be cognisant of what is actually allowable within EU law and notify the European Central Bank in that regard.  In view of these EU and Eurosystem constraints, which take precedence over Irish law, as the Senator knows, I proposed that the FOI Act be extended to the Central Bank of Ireland on a basis which excludes records relating to its ESCB-related tasks and those subject to the obligations of professional secrecy relating to financial obligations and the regulatory role under the supervisory directives of the European Union.<\/p> <p>On this basis, it is not possible to accept the amendment.<br\/>On amendment No. 31, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court are being provided with an exemption under FOI legislation to protect their functions in so far as they relate to dispute resolution, conciliation or mediation on a voluntary basis to settle disputes.  It includes the role of the Labour Court, the Rights Commissioner Service and the Labour Relations Commission in resolving industrial disputes.  The possibility that such records might be subject to FOI legislation would, potentially and, I think, almost certainly, undermine the value of these organisations in performing an extremely important public role.  It would deter individuals, public and private bodies and the unions in participating in this voluntary process.  Moreover, continued recourse to the State's industrial relations machinery to resolve industrial disputes is considered central to maintaining a stable industrial relations environment.  It is for these reasons that I do not propose to accept the amendment.<br\/><b><\/b>Amendment No. 32 has been tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il and concerns the NTMA and the terms and conditions of staff.  I understand fully its import.  Notwithstanding the established and strong general principle that pay information on persons employed by a State body should be subject to FOI legislation - a view that I know that Senators will strongly support - I have, after long consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, accepted that there should be partial exclusion.  As Members will know, there is a guideline whereby bands of pay are disclosed.  That is the appropriate balance to be achieved without putting at risk the potential of the NTMA and its family of companies to maintain the best category of employees.  As the economy improves, the pressure to recruit such persons into the private sphere is all the greater.  I have accepted the reasoned argument in that respect, but I know people will wish me to go further.  It is my view that information on remuneration should be in the public sphere and I have personally engaged on this matter.  It is the appropriate balance to be struck at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500016#Q01500","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411645500,"counter":317,"content":"<p>When we talk about the Office of the President, I am not talking about President Michael D.

There was a building society - I kind of knew as it was located not far from me - and everybody knew it was on the rocks.  The people in charge - this the phrase that has been used to describe them, as the Minister knows, were asleep at the wheel.<\/p><p>The idea of stricter regulation of the appointment of directors to banks seems to have disappeared into the sand, a phrase used by Mr. Sean Cromien, a former Secretary of the Department of Finance.  Why did people move from the Department of Finance to the Central Bank more or less on an assembly line?  Why did nobody know that when one moved from a banking system based on deposits to wholesale borrowing things changed?  Why did nobody in the banks know that one had to have strict rules on loan to value and loan to income ratios when lending?  <\/p><p>Like Senator Aideen Hayden, I commend the work Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch is doing with the committee.  Banking is the last sector which should receive an exemption because it crashed the country.  In the Central Bank which had 1,400 employees apparently two of them were supposed to regulate banks.  Finding all of this information, as a society, was like extracting teeth.  I would hate to think the slap dash way the Central Bank regulated was acceptable to anybody in Parliament.  We have all paid the price - all of our constituents have it, which is why I tabled my amendment.  We must get the message across to those involved in banking and those in the banking section of the Department of Finance and the Central Bank that we want records to be kept and that what went on in the country was unacceptable and that it had such disastrous consequences.<\/p><p>As the Minister will know, one of the matters on which Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch and the committee will place emphasis - not just the night when the bills finally came - is the hopeless analysis of banking by the bank regulator and hopeless conduct of banks.  Do we know, for instance, if the incentive structure in Irish banking was changed in order that people would not bother to check incomes and if banks paid bonuses for shovelling money out?  A large amount of damage was done by this sector, which is why I was reticent that it should receive an exemption.  Of all the information sought we need to know how they engaged on supervisory directives.  <\/p><p>It has been mentioned that the Europeans told us to do this.  The Europeans were not of much use to us when this country had to take the burden of defending the euro.  I hope there will be wider discussions between the Minister for Finance and Mr. Draghi.  Ireland was let down by design faults in the euro system.  Did anybody know this in the Central Bank?  We badly need its records and I would appreciate any help the Minister can give us in that regard.<\/p><p>My concern is that I am not so sure the banks and the property sector would not do the same all over again.  I am not so sure the new Central Bank Governor Honohan is trying to build is powerful enough yet to take on the continuity Central Bank which was rubbish and deserved the disapprobation of everybody for the way it  superised bank regulations.  These are my concerns that led to my tabling of amendment No. 25.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500017#R00700","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1411645500,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I will deal with Senator Sean D.

I considered whether this provision should be maintained in making an amendment to the Bill in the D&aacute;il to specify key information that would be required for inclusion in a publication scheme.  However, when I examined this closely, I questioned the appropriateness of the provision in an FOI Act.<\/p><p>If a public body, or a body funded by the public purse, provides a service or operates a scheme for members of the public, and by virtue of the fact that the body did not publish information or published incomplete or inaccurate information, which resulted in a person being prejudiced or penalised or impacted negatively in some way because he or she was not aware of rules or procedures concerning that scheme or service, he or she should have a right to redress in the normal way.  That is how it is done under the Ombudsman's legislation.  The person has the right to redress.  The old adage in law is ignorance is no defence.  There has to be an impartial adjudication of whether, for example, I did not pay my water charges because I did not receive the letter.  There has to be some reasonableness about this.  Rather than providing for this in FOI legislation, which simply relates to information, the non-publication of information or any other act that impacts negatively on the citizen is subject to the broadened powers I have given to the Ombudsman in the most recent legislation.  That is the appropriate vehicle to deal with the issue raised by the Senator.  I considered this and that is the way it should be as opposed to being couched in an odd way in FOI legislation.  It is a general administrative issue that would have an impact across the public service where people gave false information or withheld information.  That has to be adjudicated on and the Ombudsman is the right person to do that to see if the complainant has a case or whether he or she is trying it on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500018#S02000","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1411646100,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I understand what the Minister is saying and I accept his reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500018#S02100","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1411646100,"counter":345,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1411646100,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Section 8 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1411646100,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Sections 9 and 10 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1411646100,"counter":348,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1411646100,"counter":349,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 20, 26 and 28 to 30, inclusive, are related to amendment No. 15 and they may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500018#S02600","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1411646100,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 15:<blockquote><br \/>In page 25, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:&quot;11.

The report of the external review group set out that some Departments, including the Departments of the Taoiseach and Environment, Community and Local Government, already publish a disclosure log.  In addition to publishing details of what has been requested, a number of other Departments, such as the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and Transport, Tourism and Sport, publish the records disclosed.  While the external review group recognised the benefits of publishing such information, it also acknowledged the potential legal, administrative and practical difficulties of widely publishing information released under freedom of information legislation.  In addition, the Departments in question advised that there was no evidence that the publication of the records led to a more efficient freedom of information regime which reduced the number of freedom of information requests received from the same individual.    <\/p><p>Section 48 is a general overarching provision on the publication of a code of practice and guidelines for freedom of information.  While I do not intend to make specific reference in section 48 either to the records management issue or to the provision of statistics on freedom of information, as proposed by the Senators, I have addressed these issues in the draft code of practice that I published.  I hope Senators will have an opportunity to examine the draft code in some detail.<\/p><p>In amendment No. 26, Senator Byrne of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party seeks that a code of practice be drawn up and published within three months of enactment.

The Department of Finance had and should have had a role in this issue.  After the crisis hit, some people argued that they had seen the bust coming, knew when the boom would end and were worn out telling people the bubble would burst.  How come the records showed that these people were all what one could describe as \"soft landing merchants\".  The records were clearly not comprehensive and adequate.  People deliberately set out to deceive, yet we hear that everyone was on the right side and the crisis was caused by the sloth, neglect or indolence of someone else.  Those who do not have records should receive some sanction in law, rather than by means of a protocol or code of conduct because it is their job to keep records.  I agree with Senator Quinn and the Minister on the value of having records.  There were massive failures in information systems.<\/p><p>Does the Minister not consider it a bad idea to have a banking system based solely on property?  We are trying to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship, yet our banking system is obsessed by property.  We are not being told anything about the system by the Central Bank, nor do we hear of any concerns about the system in the Department of Finance.  While I hope our procedures have improved, I frequently doubt that is the case.  I believe we could do the same all over again.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to consider introducing some form of sanction.  We want better records than were revealed in this awful episode which did so much damage to the country.  Practices such as moving money into a financial institution at ten minutes before midnight and moving it out again just after midnight to pretend it was lodged in the bank for the entire year or disguising the amount of deposits were condoned.  A great deal of deception and corruption was missed.  <\/p><p>The Minister used the phrase &quot;light touch regulation&quot; in connection with the banking sector when the term &quot;non-supervision&quot; is more appropriate.  In most countries the state is, unfortunately, the lender of last resort in the banking sector.  I do not mind how dress hire companies conduct their affairs because if they go broke, someone else will get their business.  It is appalling, however, that in banking, which was an unregulated system, the State was the lender of last resort.  The purpose of amendment No. 20, which I do not propose to move, was to address this issue.  If anything can be done before Report Stage to improve information and record keeping in the banking institutions which we are supposed to be supervising, it would be valuable to the country, even if it comes late in the day. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500019#T01100","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1411646700,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I am sure the Senator has had an opportunity to read the draft code I published, chapter 5 of which deals with the review and updating of records and guidelines.

This is a societal issue that goes well beyond access to information. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500019#T01200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1411646700,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1411646700,"counter":365,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 16 to 18 not moved.<\/p><p>Section 11 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1411646700,"counter":366,"content":"<p>Sections 12 to 14, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1411647300,"counter":367,"content":"<p>SECTION 15<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1411647300,"counter":368,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 19 has been ruled out of order as it involves a charge on the Exchequer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500020#U00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1411647300,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 19 not moved.<\/p><p>Section 15 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1411647300,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Sections 16 to 22, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1411647300,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 20 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1411647300,"counter":372,"content":"<p>Sections 23 to 26, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1411647300,"counter":373,"content":"<p>SECTION 27<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1411647300,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That section 27 stand part of the Bill.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1411647300,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I raised this issue on Second Stage and it was discussed at length during D&aacute;il proceedings.  In the D&aacute;il, a new section 27, which introduced the new fees regime, was inserted.  While it eliminated the standard &euro;15 charge, it has not eliminated fees in their entirety.  There is concern that it will undermine rather than enhance a rights-based regime of access to information in so far as it makes access to certain kinds of information dependent not on need or public interest but on ability to pay or the cost to the State.  In some cases, applicants could be required to pay a charge that is many multiples of the previously imposed &euro;15 standard charge.  The Government amendment provided the power to refuse requests on administrative grounds due to time and cost and, in addition, required applicants to pay a deposit before any information, search or retrieval work commenced.<\/p><p>The Minister has spoken about the open data regime.  Once that is up and running, it should significantly reduce the need and therefore the demand for freedom of information requests.  There should be no introduction of a new fees regime prior to the completion of the open data regime.  While I accept that there will be an open data regime, eliminating the fees regime until that point is a possibility if the Minister introduces further amending legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500020#U01200","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1411647300,"counter":376,"content":"<p>The package of proposals for reform of the freedom of information provisions that I put forward goes well beyond what was done to roll back some of the advances made in the original Bill but goes beyond the original Bill in making access to information as cheap as possible.  Up to five hours of public service work, which will encompass the vast bulk of freedom of information requests, will be free under this system.  I am conscious of the significant burden this will impose on the public service, which is a public service that I have reduced in quantum over the past few years because of economic necessity.<\/p><p>Bluntly, the notion that Sinn F&eacute;in expounds is that everything should be free, that there should be no cost to anything, no charges for anything and no taxes on anything, and that we should expend any volume of money on anything.  My colleague in the other House took issue with Sinn F&eacute;in on that point, but there comes a time when one cannot be all things to all men.  At the same time as every service imaginable should be free and open-ended, with no additional taxes of any kind, Sinn F&eacute;in is against any charge or any imposition of any kind.  Sinn F&eacute;in is all things to all men.  The fees regime we set out in this enactment, which I thought might be acknowledged for once, is among the most progressive, liberal and inexpensive in any state.  That is where we should be, and the fact that we can be in that place while still in economic distress is a credit to everyone in the Houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500020#U01300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1411647300,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I acknowledge what the Minister has changed in respect of the section.

This is a major problem and it will become a crisis as the years go by and as elderly parents are trying to cope with their loved ones and find places for them.  I am asking for this case to be progressed.  I know that since my last meeting with St. John of God it has been agreed that this girl will receive respite hours.

In the long term we need an admissions policy or extra funding or whatever it takes.  I am raising the case of one individual, but there are three crises in County Louth and 30 people on the waiting list.  How many more are there throughout the country?

The HSE national service plan for 2014 and the 2014 operational plan for the social care division outline the quantum of specialist disability services, the key reform initiatives and the additional investment in 2014.  The HSE will spend &euro;1.4 billion and employ a staff level of approximately 15,000 whole-time equivalents in 2014 to provide specified levels of service.  An additional investment of &euro;14 million in 2014 also has been made to address deficits in disability services, implement a reform programme to transform services to a community-based model of person-centred supports, and focus on the implementation of the Health Information and Quality Authority standards for residential services for people with a disability.  These developments and reform proposals will be carried out in an environment of effective communications and engagement with all those involved in services, including people with a disability, through the HSE's National Consultative Forum.  The emerging residential need in the absence of residential development funding over the past number of years is a major challenge for all services providing support to clients with a disability.

I look forward to his reply, as he is under orders to be positive, to provide solutions, and not to talk about problems.  I am sure my query will be dealt with.<br\/>I wish to speak about the Fair Deal scheme - not how it operates, but its current funding.  The Minister could probably give some of the same answer that he gave to the previous speaker.  The scheme is a positive and effective one, which I discussed on many occasions with a previous Minister and T&aacute;naiste, Mary Harney.  I am concerned that we see the Fair Deal scheme as the only way of dealing with the accommodation needs of the elderly community.  I hope, as the Minister plans ahead, that home care packages, home help services and carer's allowance - although that is within the remit of another Department - will receive significant focus.  I noted in passing an interesting piece of legislation, perhaps not yet debated in the other House, tabled by Deputy Willie O'Dea of Fianna F&aacute;il.  He suggested that where a person is deemed eligible for the Fair Deal scheme, the cost of the scheme be made available for private care or home care arrangements.  We need to be much more flexible in regard to care of the elderly.<br\/>It has come to my attention from a few individual constituency cases, about which I have made inquiries of HSE staff, that since mid-summer or thereabouts a number of applicants have been approved as eligible for the Fair Deal scheme from a medical and income point of view, but the sanctioning of these applicants has slowed down by as much as 60%.  People who were advised in mid-summer that they would probably have to wait six or seven weeks for the final sanction have found that the waiting period has more than doubled, but I appreciate that this is a funding issue.  In one case, I put much pressure on a family, at the behest of a hospital, to have the person taken home from the hospital on the advice that the Fair Deal scheme would<b><\/b>apply after<b><\/b>five or six weeks, but now it could take ten, 12 or 15 weeks.  I know it is a funding problem, but the Minister may be in a position to comment.  It appears the situation has deteriorated since mid-summer.  There was a blip in February and March and the situation improved, but since late June or early July delays have increased significantly.<br\/>Perhaps the Minister would give an overview of his future approach to care of the elderly.  While I want to see the Fair Deal scheme supported, encouraged and properly funded, there must be solutions other than nursing homes.I have said here often that if our only aspiration for the elderly is a clean nursing home bed, that is inadequate.  Care in the community, care in the home, family support, carer's allowance, home help and so on should play a much more significant role.  The taxpayer would benefit because it is less expensive.  The older person would benefit as he or she would be with family, friends or neighbours.  Perhaps the Minister will work on this issue and comment on the current funding difficulty for the Fair Deal scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500024#Y01000","speaker":"1189"},{"type":"speech","time":1411649400,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has responsibility for older people and who is speaking at a health-related conference.<\/p><p>The nursing homes support scheme is a system of financial support for individuals who require long-term nursing home care.  Anyone who is ordinarily resident in the State and who may need nursing home care, regardless of age, can apply for the scheme.  The total budget for long-term residential care in 2014 is &euro;939 million.  It should be pointed out that a number of people covered by the funding arrangements which preceded the scheme are also covered by this.<\/p><p>The HSE operates a national placement list to enable it to operate within the budget allocated for the nursing homes support scheme.  All applicants who are approved for funding are put on the placement list in chronological order by the date of determination of their application.  Funding issues to applicants in this chronological order to ensure equity nationally.  The current waiting time on the placement list is 15 weeks, with 2,007 people on the list awaiting release of funding. The HSE makes every effort to match available funding to demand by releasing funding on a weekly basis.  In the first seven months of 2014, 3,553 new clients were funded under the scheme.  The length of time an applicant remains on the placement list depends on the number of new applicants awaiting approval for the scheme at any given time and the number of applicants currently receiving payment under the scheme.  Therefore, the duration of time on the placement list can fluctuate.<\/p><p>The provision of services must be managed within available resources.  The scheme is continuing to take on new clients within the limits of the resources available, in accordance with the legislation.  The resources that are available will be applied to provide the best possible mix of supports and services in a way that most effectively matches the needs and preferences of older people themselves.  There is a particular focus on enabling people to live as independently as possible.  For this reason, &euro;23 million was transferred from the nursing homes support scheme to provide additional community services, with a view to allowing more older people to be supported in their own homes and communities for longer, which is in line with the expressed wishes of older people.<\/p><p>The Senator will be aware that the nursing homes support scheme is currently the subject of a review.  The review will consider the long-term sustainability of the scheme as well as looking at the current operation and management of the scheme.  Work on the review is advanced and is expected to be completed in the coming months.  The report will then be made publicly available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500024#Y01100","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1411649400,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  He mentioned that the HSE makes every effort to match available funding to demand by releasing funding on a weekly basis.  That is fair enough, but I am advised that up to seven weeks ago, on a Monday or a Tuesday, the funding released each week from the central office would cover a five-day period and, obviously, a set number of applicants, whereas now that funding covers applicants only for two and a half days.  That is the reason the delays have more than doubled.  I am advised that sanctions for funding have decreased by 60%.  It is fair to say that money is being released weekly, but a significantly reduced number of applicants are sanctioned each week.  I ask the Minister to bring this to attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  I look forward to the review and I appreciate the funding crisis.  I appeal to the Minister to try to make progress but also to ensure that the broader spectrum of care for the elderly, services and future methods of dealing with the elderly are considered also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500024#Y01200","speaker":"1189"},{"type":"speech","time":1411649400,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I cannot confirm the detail of what the Senator has said, but the basic point he makes is correct.  The scheme's funding is constrained, as it was cut this year.  As a result, the waiting time has slipped from about four weeks, which most people found to be reasonably acceptable, to 15 or 16 weeks, which people find unacceptable.  They are right to find it unacceptable.  As things stand, that will get worse as the year goes on.  The effect is that older people cannot be transferred from hospital to nursing homes, where they would be much safer and less likely to acquire infections.  Thus, there is a problem of delayed discharges in hospitals.  There are almost 700 delayed discharges today.  If those beds were freed up, we would be able to deal much better with accident and emergency overcrowding and elective waiting lists.  That is the present situation and there is no point in denying it.<\/p><p>The Senator's second point is a valid one.  I have some experience of the health service in England, where home care and community care are much more advanced.  It is easier, therefore, to keep people in their homes for longer and to get people out of hospital because they know that the public health nurse and the home care services will click in on a Saturday or Sunday, or a Friday evening if the need arises.<\/p> <p>Ireland has underdeveloped social care services.  As a consequence, we have people going into nursing homes sooner in their lives than they might want to.  That is the major structural thing that needs to be changed over the next couple of years in Ireland.  The more immediate problem is one of funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500024#Y01300","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Seanad Elections","time":1411650000,"counter":473,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500025#Z00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1411650000,"counter":474,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is welcome to the House, particularly in respect of this problem.  My attention was drawn to this matter by Mr. Robbie Sinnott, who is in the Visitors' Gallery.  He is visually impaired.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach has declared his intention to respond to the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad by introducing minimal reform of the university seats prior to the next election.  Graduates of third level institutions will be entitled to vote for six Senators if the planned Seanad electoral (university members) (amendment) Bill is enacted prior to the next election.  However, graduates who suffer from impaired vision are only able to vote by asking someone else to vote for them, as the Constitution decrees that elections for these Seanad seats must be by postal vote.  Therefore, a blind person must disclose his or her intention to a third party and rely on the third party to vote as requested.  This is contrary to Article 18.5&deg; of the Constitution, which guarantees a secret ballot.  How can the dilemma be solved?  The answer can be found in modern technology.  The Constitution declares that the Seanad election must be a postal ballot, but that could include e-mail.  I understand that most graduates, even those who are visually impaired, are capable of using e-mail, and I urge the Minister of State to explore this solution.<\/p><p>Some 53,000 people have extreme visual impairment severe in Ireland.  I do not know how many third-level graduates are included in that figure, but the proposed Seanad electoral (university members) (amendment) Bill could be an early first step towards a solution to a challenge that will face the State in later years if we are to be a society that treats all the citizens equally.  I urge the Government to consider the problems that this entails.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500025#Z00200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1411650000,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly.  A fundamental principle of our electoral system is voting by secret ballot.  This is enshrined in the Constitution for D&aacute;il, Seanad and presidential elections.  For local and European elections and for referendums, the provisions on secrecy are set out in primary legislation.<\/p><p>Arrangements for the holding of elections and for registered voters to cast their ballots are all built on this principle.  The electoral Acts make special provision for certain voters and, over the years, improvements have been introduced aimed at making the voting process as accessible and inclusive as possible.  These include provision for voting at an alternative polling station if a person's local polling station is inaccessible.  Voters who cannot go to their polling station due to a physical disability or physical illness may avail of postal voting or the special voting arrangements provided in hospitals and nursing homes.  The placing of photographs and political party emblems on ballot papers and the display of a large-print copy of the ballot paper in polling stations are aimed at assisting visually impaired voters in particular.<\/p><p>Special provision is made for voters whose sight is so impaired that they are unable to vote without assistance at a polling station.  Such voters may vote with the assistance of a companion or the presiding officer, as they choose.  While this arrangement meets the needs of many voters, it may not meet the needs of all, and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is committed to improving these arrangements.  Our commitment to enhance access to voting by persons who are blind is stated in the national disability strategy.<\/p><p>In June of this year, officials of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government participated in a National Disability Authority trial of a range of options for voting by visually impaired persons.  These included the use of tactile voting templates.  The report on the trial is awaited from the authority.<\/p><p>That is an outline of the position generally.  Seanad elections are somewhat different in that voting does not take place in polling stations.  Article 18.5&deg; of the Constitution provides that the election of Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann shall be by secret postal ballot.  Senator Quinn, having been elected by the graduates of the National University of Ireland on many occasions, is no doubt well versed in the electoral procedures that operate for the constituency.  I am a member of that constituency.  At an election, each registered graduate is sent, by registered post, an envelope containing voting documentation, including a ballot paper and a declaration of identity form.  These arrangements apply to all voters in the NUI constituency.<\/p><p>Members of the House will be aware that in February 2014 the general scheme of the Seanad electoral (university members) (amendment) Bill was published for consultation.  There was a very useful debate in this House on its proposed provisions in March.  The general scheme is part of the legislative process to implement the 1979 constitutional amendment to extend the Seanad franchise to graduates of institutions of higher education in the State that heretofore did not form part of the Seanad university constituencies.<\/p><p>As part of the consultation process on the general scheme, a number of submissions were received - 22 in total.  One was about voting arrangements for visually impaired persons.  It recommended that consideration be given to allowing all those on the register for the university constituencies the option of voting by e-mail.  It is an interesting idea.  However, fundamental issues arise concerning whether e-mail would meet the constitutional requirement of conducting Seanad elections by secret postal ballot.  Notwithstanding this point, the technical feasibility of introducing such a system would have to be a consideration.  Our experience with electronic voting in Ireland was a not particularly good one.<\/p><p>Another idea proposed in the submission was to allow voters with a visual impairment the option of using a cardboard or plastic template which would be placed over the ballot paper.  This template would be in a format readable by a person with a visual impairment.  The National Disability Authority trials of these templates were already mentioned.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government looks forward to receiving the findings of this research and will give them due consideration.  The Minister is open to ideas that can improve upon the arrangements currently in place for voters with a visual impairment.  The Department must be mindful that any proposed reforms have to be consistent with existing constitutional provisions and must be capable of being deployed usefully in practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500025#Z00300","speaker":"1046"},{"type":"speech","time":1411650000,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I appreciate the reply.  This is a challenge, and the question is whether the Government can solve the challenge.  I am delighted to hear that there is research going on and I am delighted to hear some steps are being taken.  The first thing that must be done is to recognise the real difficulty there is for people who are blind and who cannot have a secret ballot without having somebody else vote for them.  We are capable of solving that problem.  The Minister of State has touched on one of two ways in which we can move in that direction.  We do not have much time, on the assumption that the Seanad electoral (university members) (amendment) Bill will come before the House some time soon.  I hope the Government will see that it is possible to do something to ensure that the large number of people - although a small number of graduates - who are visually impaired have this problem solved.  These people have to take part in a postal vote at home and must ask someone else to open the envelope, tell them they want to vote for A, B and C and then not know whether it has happened.  These people need to have a solution and I am delighted to hear the Government is working on it.  I urge the Minister of State to move as fast and as securely as he can in order to make sure this improvement takes place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014092500025#Z00400","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1411650000,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I will ensure the sentiments expressed will be conveyed.
