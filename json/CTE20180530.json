It is an honour and a pleasure to be in front of the committee for a second time.  In this short presentation I would like to walk the committee through the country-specific recommendations that were adopted last week on Wednesday, 23 May.  Before I do that I would like to explain the context in which these recommendations have been adopted by the Commission.<\/p> <p>  Last week the Commission adopted what we call the spring package.  The spring package is part of the European semester, which is a process of economic policy co-ordination within the European Union.  This package includes the country-specific recommendations, but also the assessment of the Commission concerning the national reform programme and also the assessment, in the case of Ireland as a country with the euro as its currency, of the stability programme.<\/p> <p>  The European semester starts in the autumn with the adoption of what we call the autumn package, which includes the annual growth survey, the alert mechanism report and the recommendations for the euro area.  In the annual growth survey the Commission establishes the policy priorities to be implemented in the European Union.  In November last year, in the annual survey, the main policy priority was to continue the efforts along the virtuous triangle which consists of boosting investment, pursuing structural reforms and ensuring responsible fiscal policies.  This year, on top of this, much emphasis has been placed on the European pillar of social rights.  The second document adopted by the Commission last autumn was the alert mechanism report in which we carry out a screening of the economic situation in every member state and identify the countries for which we have to carry out a more detailed analysis, what we call an in-depth review.<\/p><p>Last autumn Ireland was identified as one of the countries that would benefit from an in-depth review.  In November the Commission adopted the recommendations for the euro area.  These recommendations must be implemented and all member states in the euro area should ensure they implement them.<\/p><p> Once the Commission has adopted this autumn package which sets out the policy priorities and identifies the countries for which an in-depth review is necessary, the Commission services prepare the country reports.  The county reports were published on 7 March 2018.  They provide an assessment of the economic and social situation in the member state, including progress made in the implementation of the country-specific recommendations of the past year.  The country reports also include the results of the in-depth review of the concerned countries.  On the basis of the in-depth review published in the country report in March, the Commission concluded that Ireland was still experiencing macroeconomic imbalances characterised by large stocks of external private and public debt, a high number of non-performing loans and rising property prices.<\/p><p> On the basis of the conclusions of the country reports and taking into account the national reform programmes, which are presented by the respective member states in April, the stability programmes, which present the medium-term budgetary targets of the Government, and the national reform programme, which presents the economic policy priorities of each member state, the Commission adopts the proposal for the country-specific recommendations that we adopted last year.  This is the context in which the country-specific recommendations were adopted as part of the European semester cycle of economic policy co-ordination.<\/p><p> This year the country-specific recommendations adopted by the Commission are framed in a context of the fastest growth pace of the European economy in a decade, with record employment, recovering investment and improved public finances.  The Commission noted, however, that new risks are emerging such as volatility in global financial markets and trade protectionism.  For this reason, it is important that we use without delay the current favourable conditions to make Europe's economies and societies strong and more resilient.<\/p><p> The Commission proposes three recommendations for Ireland, that is, three blocks of priority areas: first, budgetary policy and fiscal structural issues, including taxation and sustainability of public finances; second, infrastructure and skills; and third, measures aimed at fostering productivity growth and reducing the stock of non-performing loans.<\/p><p> I will explain the rationale behind the different recommendations, beginning with the first, the compliance with EU fiscal rules.  In 2019, the structural balance is forecast to reach a deficit of 0.4% of GDP, thus achieving the medium-term budgetary objective of a deficit of 0.5% of GDP.  For this to happen, growth of Government expenditure should remain below 5.3% in 2019.  Ireland is expected to comply with these provisions, including the debt rule.  The debt-to-GDP ratio has declined significantly, but it is also true that part of the decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio is due to the denominator effect.  GDP in Ireland includes contract manufacturing.  Members will remember that in 2015, Irish GDP grew by more than 25%.  In terms of GDP, while we see that debt is declining, in nominal terms, in terms of size, Ireland's debt is still very high.  This is the reason that the Commission recommends that given the current cyclical conditions and the heightened external risks, Ireland should use any windfall gains to reduce general Government debt further.  The Commission is recommending that this is the prudent fiscal policy to follow.  I have learned that the recent plans for a rainy day fund would set aside &euro;8 billion over the medium term.  I believe this is an important development and could provide a fiscal buffer during a future economic downturn.<\/p><p> I will now deal with the composition of public finances, in particular taxation.  Corporate taxes as a proportion of total taxes continued to increase.  Such taxes are highly concentrated among a few large multinational enterprises which are prone to high volatility.  Some recent tax measures have focused on cuts and reliefs and seem to have increased further reliance on highly procyclical sources of revenue.  The Commission considers that broadening the tax base could help improve revenue stability in the face of economic fluctuations.  Moreover, there exists further potential to improve the way the tax system can support environmental objectives.<\/p><p> The long-term sustainability of public finances presents risks related to the cost of ageing, although it is true that Ireland has introduced some significant measures to increase the efficiency of public healthcare, such as a cost-saving agreement with the pharmaceutical industry, a financial management system and activity-based funding.  Some measures have also been taken to improve the availability of primary health care.  The Government has also introduced a wide range of reforms to contain public pension expenditure.  Nevertheless, according to the most recent long-term assessment approved by the ageing working group of the economic policy committee, the cost of ageing represents a medium fiscal sustainability risk for Ireland over the long term.  On this basis, the Commission believes there is a need to increase the cost-effectiveness of the healthcare system and to pursue the envisaged pension reforms.<\/p><p> I will now address the second recommendation.  The Commission found in the country report that barriers to inclusive growth remain in the form of skills mismatches and skills shortages.<\/p><p>The country report also found there was insufficient access to affordable and quality childcare.<\/p><p> Although unemployment fell to 6.7 % in 2017, certain groups are still largely detached from the labour market and socially excluded.  In addition, years of reduced Government investment are taking their toll on the availability of housing and appropriate clean energy, transport and water infrastructure.  In housing markets, persistent supply shortages, coupled with increasing demand, continue to fuel property price increases.<\/p><p> The Commission concludes that addressing emerging infrastructure bottlenecks is essential for sustainable and balanced growth in the future.  It therefore recommends that Ireland improve the skills of the adult population and effectively implement in a timely way the relevant parts of the national development plan, including infrastructure and childcare.<\/p><p> The Commission finds that the productivity of domestic companies is lower, or growing at a slower pace, in comparison with the multinationals operating in Ireland.  Given the current favourable economic conditions but also keeping in mind the existing risks and uncertainties, the Commission's third recommendation is that Ireland stimulate research and innovation with a view to enhancing the resilience of the domestic sectors.<\/p><p> Although Ireland continued to make progress in reducing non-performing loans, their ratio-to-total gross loans remains among the highest in the EU.  Particularly worrying are long-term mortgage arrears, which are those in arrears for over two years.  These represent 60% of the total mortgages in arrears in 2017.  Reducing the long-term arrears could improve the resilience of the Irish banking sector and help to address the problem of debt overhang, which reduces the incentives for SMEs to put credit to more productive uses.  On this basis, and as part of the same third recommendation, the Commission recommends promoting a faster and durable reduction of long-term mortgage arrears through promoting write-offs while protecting consumer rights.<\/p><p> In sum, the Commission proposes a comprehensive package to underpin the sustainability of public finances, foster productivity and enhance the resilience of Ireland's economy to external shocks, to which Ireland, like any other small open economy, is highly exposed.  This is along the lines of the strategy of the Irish authorities to build resilience in the face of global challenges and the recommendations of the National Competitiveness Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018053000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527685200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay.

That it is probably the greatest short-term risk is obvious.  In that regard, has Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay recommendations on our budgetary process?  What provision should we make for it?  Is he satisfied that the rainy day fund is sufficient or should we be doing something in addition to buffer our economy against the threat of Brexit?<\/p> <p>  My next question is on childcare and labour activation rates.  This issue impacts on women more.  How do we compare with our EU counterparts?  Is it a major concern for the Commission?<\/p> <p>  In line with the country-specific recommendations, Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay has stated that we need to reduce our reliance on countercyclical taxes, corporate tax receipts and windfall tax revenues to fund services.  Would he consider an increase in corporation tax receipts a windfall?  If so, how should we proceed if we see a substantial increase?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018053000002#F00300","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527685200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  We are not making a particular recommendation concerning Brexit, which we consider to be one of the risks to the current economic framework, because we have not introduced in our analysis in the country report and when preparing the country-specific recommendations any hypothesis or assumption regarding the final institutional framework of the relationship between the EU and the UK.  As the committee knows, negotiations are ongoing and we do not know exactly how the transition period will operate.  Issues remain to be resolved.  Nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed.  As such, the Commission will not make any hypothesis about particular impacts based on the process and final result of the negotiations.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the rainy day fund, it is important that we acknowledge that the Irish economy is a small and open one and, therefore, is exposed to external shocks.  Given that we are in the positive phase of the cycle, the Irish economy should be ready to deal with a possible slowdown owing to various causes.  Public finances are one of the first areas of an economy to be affected by a slowdown caused by an external shock.  For this reason, the Commission proposes the creation of buffers.  They will not only apply to Ireland.  The Commission's global recommendation is that Europe should take advantage of the good times to prepare the economy for a possible future slowdown.  As such, and without assessing whether &euro;8 billion is enough, the rainy day fund is important for us and we are supporting the Government's decisions because the rainy day fund would provide the necessary buffer to an external shock, no matter its cause, and allow Ireland to deal with a slowdown's impact on public finances.<\/p> <p>  In the Commission's view, the lack of affordable childcare in Ireland can be a barrier to accessing the labour market for certain workers, particularly single parents.  Childcare is a condition for more inclusive growth.  Workers who need someone to take care of their children during their working hours must be supported in accessing the labour market.<\/p><p> On corporate taxes, the Commission sees they are booming in Ireland at the moment.  Corporate tax receipts are increasing at a faster pace but at the same time we see that these receipts mainly come from, or are heavily concentrated in, a group of multinational companies.  Those revenues, therefore, are subject to high volatility.  That is the reason the Commission recommends that these extraordinary revenue gains are used to reduce debt further.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018053000002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527685200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I also want to touch on the rainy day fund.  We are told its creation will allow the Government to address future crises, if and when they happen.  The difficulty I have with the rainy day fund is that we have crises that need to addressed right now.  I refer to homelessness, the lack of affordable childcare, which Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay pointed out himself, and a skills mismatch, which he likewise pointed out.  To address them, I feel it would be more prudent to invest now rather than squirrelling away some funds in a rainy day fund.  There is an issue around whether what is being proposed by the Government is actually a rainy day fund or a contingency fund.  Given recent experience of downturns and shocks to the Irish economy, &euro;8 billion would be just a drop in the ocean of what has been previously spent.<\/p> <p>  I have some questions.  On the rainy day fund, would there need to be a change in the fiscal rules to allow its creation?  The Commission made, and Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay spoke of, some recommendations on the over-reliance on corporate tax, the narrow tax base, the issue - that we saw even this year - regarding commercial stamp duty, the effective and timely implementation of the national development plan, addressing the skills mismatch and the lack of affordable healthcare.  There is a contradiction between putting away the extra money we have into a rainy day fund but having to address all of these issues as well.  Will Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay comment on that?  <\/p> <p>  It was my understanding that the whole point of the fiscal rules was to create buffers in the first place that would ensure prudent public finances and prevent unsustainable expenditure and trends.  Would Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay agree that the Stability and Growth Pact, SGP, in the forms of the medium-term objectives, MTOs, and the expenditure benchmarks, is not an adequate countercyclical buffer in itself and therefore minimises the need for a rainy day fund now?  I refer to having crises that we have to deal with now rather than preparing for ones that may come farther down the line.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018053000002#G00200","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527685200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  His first question referred to the extent the Commission wishes to promote and support a rainy day fund in Ireland and if the fiscal rules would need to be changed.  We do not need to change the fiscal rules.  The rainy day fund is consistent with the fiscal rules in the sense that it has a countercyclical nature.  When the economy is booming and there are extraordinary revenues, those revenues are saved in the form of assets.  They can then be spent when the economy is in a slowdown, revenues are lower and expenditures increase - to pay unemployment benefits or other things.  The idea of the rainy day fund is precisely that the additional money is not spent in a procyclical way that may lead to overheating in good times.  On the other hand, when revenues go down, there is then a reserve of money which can be spent in the rainy days so that it is not necessary to go to the markets to borrow money.  That is the basic idea of the rainy day fund and therefore it is consistent with the spirit of the fiscal rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018053000002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay"},{"type":"speech","time":1527685200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>On expenditure, I am not talking about expenditure in respect of taxes or anything like that.

That is what I understood from the Deputy's reasoning.  The key issue is that most expenditures are permanent, while part of these revenues are extraordinary.  There is a risk that extraordinary revenues will be used to finance something which is permanent.  That would then have a permanent effect on total expenditure.<\/p> <p>  That is precisely the reason the European Commission is proposing not to be procyclical in good times.  The economy may be overheated if all the higher revenue from the good times is spent.  As the growth rate in Ireland is high compared with the potential growth, the country is in the positive phase of the cycle.  The European Commission is proposing on that basis not to use permanent revenues.  Some of the increases in revenues do have a permanent nature, but the part of the revenues that are purely cyclical will disappear once the economy slows down.  I mention that because the Deputy referred to it.  That is precisely the idea with reaching the MTO where the structural balance is zero given the conditions of each country.  <\/p> <p>  In Ireland's case, given its high growth, structural balance is considered to be in equilibrium when the structural deficit is 0.5% of GDP.  That will be reached next year.  The idea is that we then allow automatic stabilisation to operate so that permanent increases in expenditure are not adopted without being financed by permanent revenues.  That is the essence of the fiscal rules in the European Union once countries have reached the MTO.  Discretionary increases in expenditure should be matched by discretionary increases in taxation - but in permanent taxes and not in taxes associated with extraordinarily high revenues.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018053000002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay"},{"type":"speech","time":1527685200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay for a very interesting presentation.  My comments are not in order of importance but just as they come to me.<\/p><p> On the issue of labour activation and supporting the social benefits derived from it, there is a concern in some circles that the agenda being pushed by the European Commission and OECD discriminates against those who decide to stay at home and raise children.  An economist will argue that where someone looks after another person's child, that is good work which is measured, but where someone looks after his or her own child, that is not work as it is not measured and therefore does not count.  My preference is to leave it to parents to decide what is best because every family and every circumstance is different.  For example, the policy decision to introduce child benefit many years ago achieved this objective because the benefit is paid to all parents for all children.  It is a form of basic income.  However, in recent years we have discriminated by providing tax breaks and particular subsidies.  I would not argue against them, but I fear in that respect if it is done in a way that creates a differential.  The American Senator, Elizabeth Warren, has written about the dual income trap.  I do not know if Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay has read any of Senator Warren's books.  The trap she describes is that in an economy where everybody is working, the price of property increases and there is no flexibility or room to manoeuvre, for example, if one has a child who is sick.  Every family has different circumstances.  Elizabeth Warren argues that this is socially disadvantageous and the consequences are measurable and specific.  Everything I hear from the European Union is driving in that direction.  It is all about the economy, economic growth, labour activation and perhaps not having as many migrants, although that final point is an assumption on my part.  I express that fear and also that while economists can measure everything, perhaps they cannot measure the real value of quality of life.  Every family can achieve quality of life and balance in different ways but for us to discriminate so clearly carries a risk.  <\/p><p> I have a second broad question.  Ireland is an open trading economy and many of my friends work internationally.  Some who have returned from China tell me that the costs of wages in China have gone incredibly high.  The price of steel has also increased.  One of the reasons we have expensive construction costs is that material costs are all rising because the world economy is growing at full throttle.  We have also been printing money.  The printing presses in America and in Europe have been rolling for ten years now.  At some point, this will surely feed into inflation.  What is Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay's assessment?  When the Commission makes country assessments or wider assessments, how does it indicate a risk of inflation?  I presume inflation brings a risk of higher interest rates which, in turn, would create certain risks for a country such as Ireland with high nominal debt levels.  How does the Commission forecast inflation?  Does Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay hear the same argument that I hear from friends working in the global economy, namely, that inflationary pressures are becoming real?<\/p><p> My third question-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018053000002#G00800","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527685200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The Deputy has 30 seconds to put his third question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018053000002#H00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1527685200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay stated we should broaden our tax base to support environmental objectives.

On the question concerning whether the Commission is discriminating against people who would like to stay at home and take care of their children, the answer is definitely \"No\".  There is no discrimination.  The idea is to allow people to make choices and to give a choice to people who want to participate in the labour market but cannot do so because they have to take care of their children.  We are not promoting a choice but giving them a choice.  If people decide to participate in the labour market and would like to develop a professional life, the Commission's line is that we should ensure that a lack of sufficient and affordable childcare does not prevent them from entering the labour market.  We are not saying that everybody should work.  However, when an economy uses its maximum resources it is good for everybody because living standards increase.  I agree with the Deputy that some things cannot be measured by economists or statisticians.  In terms of the essence of the recommendation, we are not saying that everybody is obliged to participate but that a structure should be in place and all those who would like to benefit from it should have the option of doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018053000002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay"},{"type":"speech","time":1527685200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Can I come back on that point?

One side should not be neglected because in a rising property market, it becomes impossible to make the choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018053000002#H00700","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527685200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>It is difficult for me to see the link between both issues.  What the Commission tries to recommend is that governments, policymakers and economic policy put in place conditions to support people to make the most rational choices based on their preferences.  The failure to provide enough affordable and good quality childcare is not fair because it means many people who would like to develop a profession cannot do so.  That is the Commission's line.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that GDP does not cover everything and certain factors other than GDP are not easy to measure.  However, when one wants to buy a house, one needs the money to do so.  In respect of housing, the Commission is pushing and supporting the Government with its national development plan in order to foster and promote social housing.  The Commission is recommending action on both fronts.  Economic policy should allow people to make their own decisions, not to impose a decision from one side or another.<\/p> <p>  Concerning the risk of inflation, the Deputy will understand that as a representative of the Commission, I do not comment on monetary policy.  Inflation comes under the remit of the European Central Bank, ECB.  According to our forecasts to date, inflation is still subdued in the euro area.  In particular, in terms of core inflation, which is inflation net of the impact of energy prices and more volatile components of inflation, we are still far below the ECB target of 2%.  When the economy is gathering strength inflation increases and we see inflation building up.  However, it is still far behind the ECB targets.<\/p> <p>  On the question on broadening the tax base, the Deputy mentioned environmental taxes.  The way pollution is taxed in Ireland and the way the environment and environmental policies are supported leave some room for introducing some environmental taxes.<\/p><p>Such taxes would lead to a more permanent source of revenues, particularly as these taxes depend on investment in certain goods that are more or less stable.

The Commission acknowledges the Irish economy is growing fast but we must be careful about external factors.  However, Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay stated he cannot comment on the great damage that could be done to our economy by Brexit.  The Commission represents the EU member states which represent us in the Brexit negotiations.  The Commission has a duty to ensure the effect of Brexit on Ireland is minimised.  If everything goes south, we have a development plan for the next ten years that is not Brexit-proofed and against which both the ESRI and the Department of Finance have warned.  The Copenhagen Economics investigation discussed the significant effect Brexit will have on a wide range of sectors.  It is unfortunate, to say the least, that Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay cannot give us any comfort on that issue.  We are speaking in a vacuum when we do not address the issue of Brexit directly.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay states we have record employment but there is a skills shortage and a particular issue with childcare costs.  He states our public finances are under control but, because of years of underinvestment, we have major issues in housing.  If nothing else, Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay has confirmed for me and my party that this year's budget must be focused on health and housing.  I failed to mention Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay's point that we were not getting value for the investment made in health.  That is an understatement in capital letters, so to speak.<\/p> <p>  I have a question on Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay's comments on the mortgage arrears issue.  He stated the Commission recommends \"promoting a faster and durable reduction of long-term mortgage arrears\".  This goes back to the Central Bank which is, I am sure, dancing to the Commission's tune.  The Commission argues that certain banks in this jurisdiction should sell their loans that are in mortgage arrears.  In response, I put it to Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay that the D&aacute;il and the Minister with responsibility in this area want relevant and appropriate protections in place for consumers who are, in this instance, homeowners.  We cannot stand idly by on this issue and we will not take direction without safeguards and legislation being put in place.  I am surprised and disappointed that Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay has not qualified his comments on this matter with such an essential proviso.

I am a little sceptical that this is part of a political blame game the Commission is playing about Brexit and the decision by a member state to leave the European Union, in other words, that the Commission wants to send a warning signal to any other member state that might choose to go down the same road.  Let us say I am wrong and my scepticism is unjustified.  The position of people here, clearly articulated by the Opposition and the Government, is not only that we do not want a hard border but we will not accept one.  Much of the focus has been on whether Britain, despite the so-called backstop, might try to wriggle its way out of that commitment and have a hard border of sorts through another name.  We will not accept that.  There will be resistance if there is an attempt to impose a hard border.  Will Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay provide an assurance that if the negotiations with the EU do not work out, the Commission will not insist on some sort of border by another name in order to protect the integrity of the European market?  In the same way that Irish people have no intention of accepting hard borders imposed by Britain, they have no intention of accepting from the European side a demand to impose hard borders or any other kind of border to protect markets or anything else.<\/p><p>I would like a comment on that. <\/p><p> Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay is correct to identify huge infrastructural deficits in housing, health and childcare.  We could add water infrastructure, which is a huge area, to that.  We might not have such infrastructure deficits if the European Union had not imposed such cruel austerity in the aftermath of the banking collapse.  Setting that aside, as Deputy Jonathan O'Brien said, it seems a little odd to identify the need for urgent investment in these areas to essentially buffer our economy, diversify our economy, prepare it for possible external shocks and so on, and then say we should put a load of money into a rainy day fund, which effectively means investing in bonds, the international markets, etc., rather than investing in these key areas of education, housing, health or childcare.  Such investment would buffer the people and the economy against external shocks, rather than essentially depending on the vagaries of the financial markets.  If there are further financial shocks, rainy day funds based on that could evaporate quickly.  We should not set aside on a rainy day fund.  We should invest in areas that would genuinely enhance the strength and infrastructure of the economy to provide a meaningful buffer against further external shocks and over-reliance on certain sectors, which Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay rightly identifies.<\/p><p> I have a question regarding the windfall gains.  I do not agree that they should be put against debt but they should not just be squandered on pointless expenditure.  They should also be diverted into meaningful capital investment and infrastructural development in education and so on to build up the skills base to which he referred.  Would he include in those windfall gains the &euro;13 billion that Europe has said we should collect in taxes from Apple.  Does he think it is folly in the extreme for the Government to legally resist the collection of that money rather than use it for investment?<\/p><p> I agree with the Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay on tax reliefs but I would like him to elaborate because there is massive over-reliance on tax reliefs.  Whatever economic benefit we might get from them now, that could evaporate, because, in many cases, they are not strengthening the underlying domestic economy.  The benefit is going in many cases to multinationals.  Could he elaborate on what is meant by shifting from tax reliefs?  One of our major corporate tax reliefs is research and development, mostly benefitting large multinational corporations.  Does he mean that expenditure should instead go into universities, third level education and so on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018053000002#J01100","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527685200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I am going to stop the Deputy there.

Nothing is decided until everything is agreed.  My personal reassurance here is not relevant.  All I can do is remind the committee that there was a first phase of the negotiations in which the Irish Border was a key issue, among the three most important issues.  Now the negotiations go on.  Mr. Barnier reports back to the member states and he travels to the different capitals to inform and maintain contact.  I have nothing more to add on this.<\/p> <p>  Concerning infrastructure and the social income, there have been several questions relating to the same issue.  I have answered them indirectly.  First, the key issue is that the Commission does not decide composition.  Composition is Ireland's business.  It is up to Ireland to decide which part of the expenditure goes where; it is not up to the Commission.  The Commission can recommend certain areas which we consider to be our priority in the country.<\/p> <p>  Second, the Commission does not establish the level of structural expenditures or the level of structural revenues.  The rules say that member states should achieve what we call \"structural equilibrium\", which means a structural balance that simply allows automatic stabilisers to operate, and does not create any pro-cyclical fiscal policy, either in good times or bad times.  However, it is up to the member states to decide on the levels of expenditure and revenues.  By that I mean that one can perfectly comply with fiscal rules by setting certain levels of expenditure and setting the corresponding level of revenue.  It is up to the national parliaments to decide the spending they want to carry out and then set up the corresponding level of revenue.<\/p> <p>  What the Commission is saying, not only to Ireland but to almost every member state, is that revenue has a volatile component.  This volatile component, which depends on the cycle, and in the case of Ireland, depends on the role and activities of multinationals, can disappear in the same way it appears. It should not, therefore, be allocated to finance permanent expenditure.  This is the reason the Commission says that next year, Ireland should in principle achieve the medium-term budgetary objective, MTO, that is, equilibrium in structural terms.  Now it is up to the Irish to decide their level of expenditure.  I cannot remember the figure exactly, but let us say it is 22% and the Government would like to spend 27%.  The Commission is saying that Ireland should look for a way to finance this additional 5% of GDP in a permanent way, with permanent revenues, that is, structural revenues.  The Commission is not telling Ireland that it is spending too much or too little or how much it should spend on every item; that is up to Ireland to decide.  The Commission is telling Ireland that given its cyclical position and the fact that it is growing above its potential, these additional revenues should be put aside to be prepared in the case of a slowdown, to avoid needing to go to the markets for additional money when the markets are closed or not ready to lend much money.  <\/p> <p>  The need for infrastructure, which the Commission clearly recognises, has been mixed up with the need to create a buffer.  The buffer can be created.  The Commission is not exactly recommending the rainy day fund, although we support the initiative.  The Commission is telling member states - not only Ireland because there are other countries in the same situation with booming economies growing above potential - that extraordinary revenues should be allocated to reduce debt.<\/p><p>The less debt there is in a slowdown the easier the access to the markets.<\/p><p> Concerning Apple the answer is simple.  Apple is paying the &euro;13 billion to the State but it is in an escrow account, which means that the money cannot be touched until there is a decision of the European Court of Justice.  Fortunately, in the European Union we are under the rule of law.  The Commission decided that Ireland had in place a selective tax system and was giving some competitive advantage to a given company.  Ireland opposed the decision, as was its right, which is the beauty of the law, and now we have to wait until the court decides who is right and who is wrong.  If, for instance, the court decides that the Commission is right, this money can be spent by the member state because it is revenue it should have received in the past.  It is possible that the court will decide the Commission was not right for reasons I do not know and then the member state should surrender the money.  So for now, this money cannot be touched but it will be there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018053000002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527685200,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I very much agree with the concept of a rainy day fund because counter-cyclic economics make sense.

The other issue, on which we need to do further work, is how this is accounted for by an independent authority, EUROSTAT and the EU's statistical network with which Ireland's statistical institute works.  From the economic point of view, the rainy day fund is completely consistent with the spirit and the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, in particular with the preventive act because the idea is precisely that when the good times come we prepare for the bad times so that over the cycle we have a totally neutral fiscal policy.

I understood from the beginning, when nationalisation of the banks was required as a result of the financial collapse, that the position of the European Union that we might have to nationalise but at no point should nationalised banks depart from a commercial profit-orientated focus.  That has had bad consequences for mortgage holders.  I do not understand the logic of it.  I want to understand the extent to which this preference is imposed on the country.  I have no doubt that the Government wants to do that anyway because that is its ideological predisposition but I would like to know why the European Union favours the reprivatisation of the banks given that these institutions nearly bankrupted Europe and did bankrupt this country.  Having nursed them back to health at a terrible cost, Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay thinks we should set them up to potentially do it all over again to us and that they should have the power to crunch on credit and not invest in particular sectors.  He said we need to invest in particular areas of infrastructure, which is great, but now the people who have all the money might just say they do not want to invest in that area or they do not want to extend credit.

First, the treaties are totally neutral with respect to the ownership of the companies.  Nobody in the Commission, on the basis of the treaties, is suggesting that public ownership is bad.  This is not stated anywhere in the treaties.  On the contrary, the treaties say that wherever the ownership is, if the company is operating in a market, it should follow the market rules. The Commission is completely neutral with respect to the ownership.  It will not accept a public company receiving public money when a private investor would not put a single euro in it while the company operates in an open market because this public company would have a selective advantage with respect to the other companies operating in the market.  This is the basic rule.<\/p><p>There is no preference for any kind of ownership, but if public and private enterprises operate in the same market they have to operate on the same level playing field.  What happened with the banks, not only in this country but in other countries, was that we had a private company that went bankrupt.  A private company, such as a news agency, should go to the market.  In the case of the banks, since they carry systemic risk it was accepted that public money would be put into companies which were already bankrupt.  We kept rolling, thanks to public money, companies that should have disappeared from the market.  Public money is the taxpayers' money.  In some cases, and I do not mean all of the decisions made concerning banks, the Commission accepted putting in this public money, with the single goal of ensuring the company would go back to the markets in an independent way without the need for more support.  In some cases, and I do not want to enter into the specifics of each case, the positive decision by the Commission to allow the Government to put money into a given bank was made with the condition that the money should be recovered.  Who should pay this money back?  It is the bank and nobody else.  In my view, and perhaps this is more personal, the taxpayers have the right to get back the money they put into the banks.  This is why in some cases when the public money has done its work, which is to put the company back on its feet, and the company has recovered value, then this value should go back to the taxpayer.

We are grateful for the opportunity to present our submissions on behalf of our members who are home economics teachers.  I am the president of the Association of Teachers of Home Economics and my colleague, Maria Barry, is its vice president.  We represent 700 teachers and student teachers of home economics.  Being faced daily in schools with the health of our young people, we are acutely aware of the challenges that exist around overweight and obesity.  The fact that one in four children is obese is alarming.<\/p><p>This rising level of childhood and adult obesity is placing an ever-increasing burden on individuals and society.  We propose that home economics, as a school subject, is ideally placed in the context of the school setting to work towards addressing this alarming health issue facing our society.<\/p><p> The new junior cycle home economics specification starting in schools in September 2018 has a strong focus on health and well-being and will teach young people essential life skills in a practical way.  A key strand of the specification is food, health and culinary skills, which focuses on developing a healthy, sustainable attitude and positive relationship with food through practical, experiential learning.  The student will apply his or her understanding of nutrition, diet and health principles to adopt a healthy lifestyle and make informed decisions that impact the health and well-being of themselves as individuals as well as within their families.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, this is still only an optional area of study.  As a collective group of home economists, the Association of Teachers of Home Economics, ATHE strongly calls on policymakers to make home economics compulsory for all post-primary students in Ireland.  This would put the food literacy of our young people at the forefront of the agenda.<\/p><p> Home economics is the only school subject that teaches young people how to cook and prepare food, which are essential life skills for young people.  Being able to cook for oneself ensures a dependency culture does not develop whereby people rely on processed and takeaway foods.  Research demonstrates that if a young person can cook, it can have a positive impact on their health, diet quality and confidence.  Internationally, in countries such as Korea, Iceland, Japan and Finland, home economics is compulsory for students to junior cycle equivalent to teach young people nutrition and food skills.  These countries have superior health standards and prioritise home economics as a food education intervention.<\/p><p> The ATHE shares the view of the Department of Health that childhood obesity and health inequalities are critical issues that must be addressed.  Therefore, the ATHE recommends as vital the investment in making home economics a compulsory subject on the school curriculum for all students in their junior cycle school years.  Home economics is the only school subject on the Irish school curriculum that teaches young people food literacy and culinary skills.  It is critical that all citizens of Ireland have the food and culinary skills and knowledge to provide nutritionally balanced meals for themselves and their families.<\/p><p> I thank the members for listening on behalf of the Association of Teachers of Home Economics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018053000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Hickey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527669000,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hickey.

The CHErIsH study is a Health Research Board funded study focused on the area of infant feeding and childhood obesity prevention.  I am speaking today as a postdoctoral research fellow on the CHErIsH study, which is an interdisciplinary collaboration between University College Cork, National University of Ireland Galway, and Trinity College Dublin.<\/p> <p>  The first two years of life represent a critical window for the prevention of childhood overweight and obesity.  How, what, and when parents feed their child during the child's first two years influences children&rsquo;s feeding behaviours, preferences and subsequent weight outcomes.  Parents' feeding behaviours therefore represent important modifiable targets for childhood obesity prevention.  Primary care healthcare professionals such as general practitioners and public health nurses have frequent contact with parents of young children.  In Ireland, parents and young children currently have up to 24 contact points, such as routine vaccination visits, with healthcare professionals in the first two years of the child's life.  As such, healthcare professionals are in a unique position to guide and influence parent feeding behaviours to prevent childhood obesity.<\/p> <p>  To date, the CHErIsH study has conducted a number of studies to inform development of an evidence-based infant feeding intervention to be delivered in primary care in Ireland.  As a result of the findings of our research to date we have a number of key recommendations to inform primary care based infant feeding childhood obesity prevention strategies in Ireland.  I will now outline these recommendations.  In the content and foci of obesity prevention strategies, these strategies must focus on informing and training parents in accurate and developmentally appropriate responses to child hunger and satiety cues.  Early child feeding supports must include and acknowledge the importance of family and friends in infant feeding.  This can be done by developing family or community-based strategies and by providing information to parents about the role of family and friends in their infant feeding experience.  In addition, infant feeding must be considered as a process with changes over time for children and for parents.  Provision of support to parents by healthcare professionals for both positive and negative experiences, which can change over time, is important to promote healthy infant feeding and prevent childhood obesity.<\/p> <p>  With regard to delivery of infant feeding advice and strategies in Ireland, this must be done in a clear and consistent manner across healthcare professionals, using appropriate trustworthy resources.  Provision of adequate resources, training and capacity for healthcare professionals to deliver infant feeding interventions and strategies is crucial.  There is also a need for greater consensus and clarity regarding the role of healthcare professionals around infant feeding in primary care.  The CHErIsH research team is working with key stakeholder groups, including parents and healthcare professionals, to finalise our infant feeding intervention based on these research findings and recommendations.<\/p> <p>  I thank the members for their time and the opportunity to present to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018053000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen Matvienko-Sikar"},{"type":"speech","time":1527669000,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Matvienko-Sikar for her presentation.

We welcome the consultation being undertaken by the committee and are most grateful for the opportunity to address the committee today.<\/p> <p>  As it is a core aspect of home economics, I will brief the members on food education and specifically the contribution of home economics as a post-primary school subject in addressing the issue of childhood obesity.  We believe that prioritising the study of home economics in post-primary schools for all students is one of the most effective health promotion strategies available to combat poor dietary choices and unhealthy eating practices and consequently, assist in achieving the aims of A Healthy Weight for Ireland: Obesity Policy and Action Plan 2016-2025.<\/p> <p>  Home economics in schools is a comprehensive programme which incorporates nutritional knowledge and practical culinary and food skills, underpinned by scientific theory.  It is taught within a whole of school approach.  It is the only school subject which teaches young people how to cook.  It develops students&rsquo; practical food and health literacy skills, empowering them with not just the nutritional knowledge but also the practical hand-on skills to integrate healthy food choices into their own daily eating habits.  Research indicates that learning to cook as a young person is positively related to cooking confidence, good health and diet quality in later life.  Notably, as ATHE has said, developing food, health and culinary skills is a key focus of the new junior cycle home economics specification.  Due to the practical nature of home economics, students engage in a critical way with food and health issues with an emphasis on the application of practical skills, including menu planning, shopping, cooking, health and safety, portion control, reading food labels, dietary analysis, food budgeting, and food waste.<\/p> <p>  Internationally, home economics is considered a key ingredient in the development of healthy populations.  In countries such as Finland, Korea, Japan and Northern Ireland, home economics is a compulsory component of the curriculum in junior cycle education.  Never has there been such a fundamental need for compulsory food education through home economics for all students, and never has there been a better time to allow this to become a reality with the new junior cycle home economics specification.<\/p> <p>  While the solution to the obesity phenomenon is multifaceted, education emerges as a clear area of access.  Home economics teaches young people practical and theoretical aspects of food and the basic skills of how to prepare food for themselves and their families.  Consequently, students will develop confidence in choosing, preparing and cooking food.  Home economics is a key ingredient in a recipe for a happy and healthy life.  It is time to wake up and get cooking.

The results showed that those who were taught to cook as young children and teenagers had better cooking skills and a better diet as adults than people who had not received such training.  It was also revealed that they also had greater confidence when preparing home-cooked meals.<br\/><br\/>In terms of scientific evidence, the preparation of food at home is a key part of a multidisciplinary approach to tackling obesity implemented in other countries.  In addition, the scientific literature refers to what is called a nutrition and culinary skills transition, where people no longer have the same level of cooking skills as in the past.  Norway and Finland are two countries that exemplify best practice.  Both countries have integrated the teaching of these necessary skills into the curriculum because that is when they can reach more students, and at a relevant age.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018053000002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elaine Mooney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527669000,"counter":79,"content":"<p>In 2017, as many as 36% of the total junior certificate population studied home economics or 22,257 people, on average, studied home economics.<\/p> <p>  In terms of pressure, the study of home economics could be introduced here on a phased basis like in Northern Ireland.  That jurisdiction has made it compulsory to study home economics up to key stage 3.

The single class period is used to teach theory.  Due to having an integrated skills approach, theory forms part of the practical class period but in general, kitchen time takes place during the double periods.  One would be hoping for an hour and 20 minutes as one's cooking time.  The practical examination lasts an hour and a half, with half an hour set aside for preparation beforehand.  In other words, for examinations students are allocated half an hour to organise themselves and an hour and half to cook.  However, students are more prepared for national examinations and one has more time to set them up.  The time of one hour and 20 minutes in school is good.

We have found, particularly for some leaving certificate classes in the past, that those schools have joined up with an all-girls school in the area and have used the facilities there.  Opportunities are available.<\/p> <p>  To kit out a school with ten stations would cost approximately &euro;100,000.  That is a ballpark figure; the cost depends on the services available and what it would take to kit out the actual room.  There are approximately 700 schools, and we would have to find out how many schools actually have fully functioning kitchens.  We would have to work particularly closely with the schools for boys to find out how we could strategically and incrementally kit those schools out with kitchens.  According to the Department of Education and Skills criteria, kitchens are specified in the plans for all new builds of schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018053000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Amanda McCloat"},{"type":"speech","time":1527669000,"counter":91,"content":"<p>During the course of discussions in the Committee on Education and Skills the importance of making PE a compulsory subject was discussed.

We propose that modules of home economics be integrated into subjects that already exist in the curriculum, called SPHE, or social, personal and health education, in the primary school.  At the moment primary school teachers teach nutrition during that subject.  We have carried out island of Ireland research, funded by SCoTENS, the Standing Conference on Teacher Education, North and South, which looked at primary school teachers' experiences of teaching nutrition and food related matters on the curriculum.  Overwhelmingly the teachers would say that, of all information, it is the most relevant and most worthwhile, and the students enjoy it.  The teachers specifically said that to enhance teaching in that area, they need to teach practical food.  They called for classroom-appropriate resources as opposed to kitchen-appropriate resources.  It would not cost the enormous amount one might imagine, because the type of work the teachers would like to do would require tabletop appliances, a fridge, a hand-held blender or a microwave to enhance the experience in terms of active learning methodologies.  The teachers felt that it would be really worthwhile and would not involve huge costs.

It is an additional few minutes but it is a cumulative cost to the health service.  A study conducted by my colleague, Dr. Michelle Queally, using Growing Up in Ireland data, indicates that parents, particularly mothers of three-year-old and five-year-old children, tend to consistently misperceive their children's weight.  When children are overweight or obese, mothers in Ireland tend not to be as good at noticing, particularly when a female child has a high birth weight or a mother is of a lower socio-economic status or is overweight.  Having the weighing within the primary care setting and public health contact points is an opportunity for this early prevention strategy to be implemented.

Current statistics indicate that of the 36% of people studying home economics, the majority are female.

If it was made available to all students, it would remove the stigma of a boy doing the subject.  With the new specification coming on-stream for junior cycle in September 2018, it comes from a life skills approach and there are no inflictions that males or females should look at a particular aspect.  Home economics teachers are conscious of the students in front of them and do not stereotype roles in the home.  By making it compulsory, the stereotypical notion of who should be studying the subject would be removed.<\/p> <p>  Japan has had compulsory home economics for males and females since 1989.  It had a traditional gendered, segregated society and it faced the same challenge of having males coming in to work with textiles, cooking, and learning about child rearing and development.

As Ms Barry noted, most students, including me, had a choice between a practical subject or home economics in first year at around the same time.  In the 1980s, I did not have any practical reason to choose the subject so I chose something else.  As the witnesses implied, being exposed to it through friends in secondary school, it is a subject I would not have minded doing.  I am fortunate in that I grew up in a house where both my parents cooked, predominantly my father during the week and my mother at the weekend.<\/p><p>That is possibly role reversal, but that is the way my family was.  I was very much involved in the cookery.  There is a great deal of pressure on parents to find the time to cook a healthy meal.  Many people, although not enough, do batch cooking.  People get home from work at 6 p.m. to 6.15 p.m. on a weekday and the last thing they want to do is all the preparation to produce food in a meaningful way for the family or for the adults.  It becomes an even bigger issue when adults and children need to be fed and one must plan ahead.  One of the worst aspects of parents being extraordinarily busy is that they have to consider what the childminder, the nanny or the childcare facility where the children go feed them?  <\/p><p> Based on my experience of the past couple of years, I have observed what it is that children are eating.  Often parents do not think about it.  People my think about in the car or on the train on the way home, but many people do not think about it at 4 p.m. when the minder is thinking about what she or he will feed them.  An important aspect of childcare is giving children that skill set.  Dr. Elaine Mooney referred to giving people confidence.  One of the major issues for me a busy parent is having the confidence to go into the kitchen to prepare something healthy for all to eat or instead pick up the phone or, worse, use an app, which is tempting and dangerous, to order food.<\/p><p> What are the practicalities of making home economics not only a compulsory subject at second level but introducing it as a more hands-on subject at primary level?  I agree that pooled resources in a primary school that can be lifted and moved into a classroom once a week or so makes sense.  How much it will cost is the question that must be asked but it is our job to address that.  From a practical perspective it makes sense.  I camped frequently when I was a child and I know how easy it is to use a portable kitchen, but it would not necessarily be wise to bring a gas cylinder into a classroom.  There are many options now and they are affordable as well, which is good.  How should this be resourced?

We are looking for practitioners on the ground.  In other countries, home economists are to be found only in small numbers in the school setting.  They work with families in the community.  The ethos of our subject is to help families with their practical problems and to give them the skills to problem solve.  That is what true home economics is about.  In Ireland, we have it pigeon-holed into schools and few people refer to themselves as home economists.  However, we refer to ourselves as home economists because we see it as much more than just teaching in a secondary school.  We would like to move it out more into the community.<\/p> <p>  Over the coming weeks the committee will engage with other people from different agencies to examine different policy interventions which have taken place in other countries such as calorie posting on menus and front-of-pack labelling.  While these measures are effective, they are only effective if people are taught how to use them.  Students are taught in the home economics classroom how to read a label, what is the difference between calories in and calories out, and balancing the two.  We often call on the food industry to re-formulate products.  Home economics students are taught in the home to do recipe modification in order that they can look at a recipe and reduce the saturated fat in that or increase the fibre and reduce the salt.  Those are skills that we want every student to have in the home as well as managing their meal planning and cooking age-appropriate meals.  It is important to emphasise that these policy interventions in other countries have been effective because there have been adopted in the education system at the same time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018053000002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elaine Mooney"},{"type":"speech","time":1527669000,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I did home economic and I recall that we had to bring in our own ingredients, which sometimes was quite costly.

Whether people stick to that advice is dependent on a range of factors, but we consistently found that the parents tended to be less trusting of that type of food packaging.  However, many of the constraints that we have mentioned relating to time and cost lead parents to still buy and use those products because they provide a quick and easy alternative for them.

I am a dad to two girls, Amy, two, in cr&egrave;che and Jess, nine, in St. Kevin's primary school, Greystones.  In July 2013, a drive-through fast-food outlet applied for planning permission just 35 m away from an education campus of three schools, two primary and one post-primary, of 1,850 students.  A group of concerned parents and I came together to prevent this from happening, primarily because the location was completely inappropriate and unsuitable.  Over the past five years we have learned much about the planning process, the county development and how the proximity of fast-food outlets to schools can impact on childhood obesity.<br\/><br\/>Working with Wicklow county councillors over an 18 month period, a no-fry zone objective, RT 17 was adopted into the Wicklow County Development Plan 2016-2022.  The important point of this objective was that it included a specific distance of 400 m where no new fast-food or takeaway outlets could be built or operated in proximity of schools or playgrounds.  The distance was chosen based on the evidence gathered in studies over the past ten to 15 years, primarily in the US and Canada.  These studies show conclusively that obesity rates among schoolchildren increase by at least 25% when fast-food outlets are located within 400 m of a school, particularly in lower socio-economic areas.  Within that distance, schoolchildren have enough time to access these fast foods at low prices at break times.  Additionally, these junk foods are promoted heavily to target schoolchildren who are impressionable and have disposable income.<br\/><br\/>Our no-fry zone proposal received significant and credible support from leading healthcare experts throughout the country through written submissions, 58 in total, during the county development plan process.  These experts included the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland's policy obesity group, chaired by Professor Donal O'Shea and Professor Catherine Hayes; the Association for the Study of Obesity on the Island of Ireland, ASOI; the Irish Heart Foundation; the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute, INDI; <i>safe<\/i>food; and the healthy eating active living programme in the HSE.  Many academics made submissions from DCU, DIT, NUI, TCD, UCC and UCD.<br\/><br\/>There is a need for no-fry zones.  No-fry zones around schools will reduce the rate of obesity by preventing easy access for schoolchildren to unhealthy foods.  They will reduce the direct, constant and targeted promotion of these junk foods to schoolchildren.  No-fry zones of 400 m around schools will ensure consistency in local planning when it comes to fast-food outlet applications and proximity to schools.  This is very much lacking today.  They will help reshape the local planning framework to reduce the obesogenic environment for our schoolchildren and in our communities.  This action was proposed in the Healthy Weight for Ireland Obesity Policy and Action Plan 2016-2025.<br\/><br\/>Obesity is not a local issue but a national one.  As happy as we are in Wicklow to have a no-fry zone, we believe strongly that such zones should be implemented around schools throughout the country as soon as possible.  No-fry zones will contribute to the health and well-being of children and are part of the overall solution to tackle childhood obesity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018053000002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Moyles"},{"type":"speech","time":1527669000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Jennifer Feighan and Ms Louise Reynolds of the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute to make their opening statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018053000002#L00300","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527669000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to give evidence on the important subject of childhood obesity in Ireland.  In our longer submission we describe the contribution made by dietitians and the evidence to support the impact of nutrition interventions.  The Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute, INDI, is the professional organisation for regulated dietitians in Ireland.  There are 900 registered dietitians in Ireland and the INDI has a membership of 760.  Dietitians are the only health professionals who are qualified to give specialised clinical nutrition advice to patients.  They are qualified to degree or postgraduate level and have an extended period of clinical placement in recognised training hospitals.  The title of dietitian is also protected by legislation.<br\/><br\/>Good nutrition starts at home.  Prevention of childhood obesity starts before the child is born and involves ensuring that a mother&rsquo;s nutritional care is optimised because we know that maternal obesity has been found to be the most significant risk factor for obesity in children.  Mothers need to be supported to start breastfeeding and to continue for at least six months as breastfed babies are less likely to become overweight while babies who are weaned too soon are more likely to become overweight.  We also know that 80% of children who are obese between the ages of 10 and 14 will be obese adults.<br\/><br\/>We know that there is a link between childhood obesity and socio-economic position.  Dietitians are trained to be able to communicate with people from all areas of society and are skilled at explaining complex issues using simple, positive and motivating language.  They use these techniques to help children and their families to identify the reasons they are struggling to manage their weight.  Preventing childhood obesity involves both home and school life.  It encompasses supporting parents to encourage their children to be more active, eat more nutritious foods and reduce screen time.  It also involves working with educators to develop a curriculum that includes healthy eating and physical activity and that promotes positive body image.<br\/><br\/>Dietitians educate families, community workers and teachers in how to promote healthy eating habits, behaviours and attitudes to food.  They are also involved in very practical, peer-led cooking courses.  Dietitians have a role to play as part of a multi-disciplinary team in the treatment<b><\/b>of childhood obesity and can provide specialist nutrition support such as therapeutic diets and artificial nutrition following weight loss surgery.  All of this work is done by dietitians every day and we welcome the recognition that nutrition has a key role to play in so many aspects of health.  The HSE alone has over 120 strategic actions relating to nutrition across its various work streams.<br\/><br\/>We anticipate some challenges when it comes to delivering these, however, due to our low numbers.  There are 450 dietitians employed by the HSE, mostly delivering specialist care in hospitals.  A total of 144 dietitians work in the community.  In Ireland we have one dietitian per 50,000 of population but the international guidance is 1 per 15,000.  The national dietetic adviser at the HSE estimates that we need to recruit 80 dietitians per year into the community alone to deliver our national objectives.  We look forward to so doing and thank the committee members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018053000002#M00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Jennifer Feighan"},{"type":"speech","time":1527669000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Feighan and now invite Dr. Mimi Tatlow-Golden to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018053000002#M00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527669000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I am a lecturer in developmental psychology and childhood and a director of the centre for children and young people's wellbeing at the Open University in the UK.  I was formerly based at UCD where, in collaboration with colleagues at Queen's University and Ulster University, I carried out the studies that form the basis of my written submission.  Those studies were funded by <i>safe<\/i>food.  I still collaborate with colleagues at UCD, with the Irish Heart Foundation and also do work on behalf of the WHO.  I am here today in a personal capacity and thank the committee members for their interest in our work.<br\/><br\/>Systematic reviews have long since established that marketing exposure to unhealthy food and drinks influences children&rsquo;s food preferences, requests and eating and contributes to overweight and obesity.  International research shows that experimental marketing exposure increases a child's intake by 30 to 50 calories.  Given that an imbalance of between 40 to 70 calories per day can tip one into being overweight over time, it does not take much marketing exposure to have an effect.  Our research on the island of Ireland showed that by three years of age, children recognised over half of the food brand logos associated with unhealthy food items shown to them, and by the time they were five, they recognised almost all of them.<br\/><br\/>In 2010, the WHO recommended reductions in the marketing of unhealthy food and drinks to children and this was adopted by the World Health Assembly that same year.  A child rights perspective and the upholding of children&rsquo;s best interests as mandated in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child require states to support parents in relation to children's health.  All of the responsibility for children's health should not be put onto parents.  They cannot be expected to make healthy choices all of the time in an environment saturated with marketing for food products that nobody should be eating except as an occasional treat.  Our forthcoming WHO report on the implementation of those recommendations notes patchy progress including in Ireland. <br\/><br\/>Here in Ireland, the evidence gathered in the <i>safe<\/i>food study a number of years ago indicated that young children see upwards of 1,000 television advertisements for unhealthy foods per year.  This is in a climate of regulation and regulation compliant television, but there are weaknesses and loopholes in the regulations as they stand.  The new non-broadcast code is welcome in terms of establishing the principle that we should be looking beyond broadcast television, but it is voluntary, unfortunately, and it lacks defined monitoring mechanisms.  We are very concerned about how it is going to play out in reality.<br\/><br\/>Something potentially radical for children's health and well-being happened here last week with the profiling amendment to the Data Protection Bill, but we will have to wait and see how that works out in practice.  It is unclear how the voluntary code provisions on targeting on social media are going to play out.  Other forms of marketing beyond broadcast and digital affect children&rsquo;s eating, such as brand marketing and packaging, but are not regulated.  I have made detailed recommendations on same in my written submission and would be delighted to discuss those further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018053000002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mimi Tatlow-Golden"},{"type":"speech","time":1527669000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I thank all of our witnesses for their opening statements.

I am very interested in the work done by Philip Moyles on no-fry zones, but I note that it is only in one area of the country.  Has the policy been rolled out elsewhere?  In terms of county development plans, would such a policy be difficult to enforce?  In terms of fry zones, one is not just talking about the traditional chip shop.  There are also fry zones in most service stations these days and they might get planning permission for construction quite close to schools.  That is my concern.  I know a lot about the good work done by Mr. Moyles through my colleague, Deputy Pat Casey.  If we are serious about tackling childhood obesity, should we as legislators be seeking the enforcement of similar policies in county development plans?<\/p> <p>  Advertising to children is a pet issue for me.  I believe that the broadcasting and social media codes should be reviewed.  The fact that children know brands by the time they are three, even before they know their ABCs, is very worrying.

I agree absolutely with a watershed.  It was really interesting when we did the research.  We started with figures.  We got the data through the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland on actual viewing times of young children.  They were altogether different from what people had imagined.  People thought young people were watching between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. at the weekends before their parents had got up.  In fact, they were watching across the day and a great deal of viewing is taking place beyond 9 p.m.  A watershed is the least we would need to put in place to achieve some effects.<\/p> <p>  What we saw in the study was that people were complying with the legislation completely but it was not reducing advertisement exposure.  We have seen this in other jurisdictions as well.  The reason is that the advertisers move to other times.  If they were advertising heavily towards children at one time, then they moved to the mixed audiences.  The idea was that it would not only be during the big movie time but at the times of big sporting events.  A major football tournament is coming up.  If I wanted to put money on it, I would say there will be a great deal of advertising that should not really be tied in with the heroes, high-stakes physical activity and all the excitement and emotion.  Psychologically, all of that gets transferred onto the brand.  There is a reason they want to advertise during these events &ndash; it is not only because of the large viewing numbers.<\/p> <p>  It is certainly about identifying when children are watching television and taking the advertisements out of those times.  It is sometimes considered politically unpalatable because those times are when many other people are watching television as well, including adults.  However, I believe we have reached the point when we need to consider how we protect children and future generations rather than considering whether we are facilitating certain kinds of marketing activity.  That is one point.<\/p> <p>  The other point relates to nutrient profiling.  This is where it gets technical and it relates to the way we decide whether something should be advertised.  It is a question of how we classify food and how we decide whether it is healthy or less healthy.  The model we use in Ireland is derived from the UK nutrient profiling model.  Studies have shown that model is very weak in terms of deciding on whether we should advertise certain products for children.  In the study, we used the World Health Organization nutrient profiling model that was developed subsequently.  It has been rolled out in Slovenia and other places.  We found that of all the food advertisements watched by the children, half related to unhealthy food because the children were watching at times not scheduled for children's programming.  However, when we classified the advertising by the WHO criteria, the figure jumped up to 75%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018053000002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mimi Tatlow-Golden"},{"type":"speech","time":1527669000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Is that what you meant by loopholes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018053000002#O00500","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527669000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Yes.  There are weaknesses in the legislation.  The two key weaknesses I see relate to the definition of children's programming.  Really, we need to target children's viewing.  It is really about what a child is seeing rather than where the advertisements are being placed.  The other part relates to nutrient profiling.  If we are stricter in these areas, then we take more products out.  Something that came through strongly in the study was how many brands that we generally associate with unhealthier eating were leading with advertising for healthier items.  This might be a fast food company advertising water, carrot sticks or milk.  However, we know that when people go into those places, they have nuggets and chips.  The diet is completely different.  Some experimental evidence was produced by my colleague, Emma Boyland, in Liverpool.  It shows what happens when children view those advertisements with the healthy items.  Then, they are taken off to select things to eat.  They do not select the items advertised but rather the things the brand in question is generally associated with.<\/p> <p>  It is about understanding the whole ecosystem of the marketing and not only a specific advertisement.  The idea is to find where they are active in all the various areas.  It extends to brand marketing.  A great deal of advertising will be done using only a logo.  At this point, the logo is all a company needs &ndash; the logo is enough.  We have shown that at aged three years, children know what the logo is for.  Before children are speaking and before they know what it is called, they can bring a picture of the unhealthy item that the logo is associated with and put the two together.  As the Deputy noted, they are being reached before they know their ABCs.<\/p> <p>  Another thing strikes me from the talk today.  It has been really interesting to hear about the junior certificate.  We have a generational cascade that needs to be addressed.  The junior certificate students are future parents.  Food and food education in preschools need to be explored as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018053000002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mimi Tatlow-Golden"},{"type":"speech","time":1527669000,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I have a few brief questions.

Alternatively, he recommended that if they were going to keep the objectives, then the distance should be taken out.<\/p> <p>  From our perspective, the whole idea of the no-fry zone was that we needed a distance set out.  There was a reason we found ourselves in this situation with a fast food application only 35 m from schools in Greystones.  The planning guidelines, although well intentioned, use terms such as \"careful consideration\" and \"vicinity of\".  They are open to interpretation and that is what happened.  There is a lack of consistency in planning at local level.  The chief executive recommended that the objectives should come out.  We countered that by providing councillors with all the information and the evidence we gathered from the studies in the USA and Scandinavia.  We supported this with all the submissions from healthcare experts.  The councillors could see that this was the right step forward and that putting in a no-fry zone of 400 m represented the minimum distance required for it to be effective.

As I mentioned earlier, since we are now at a stage where we are getting a little publicity, people are contacting us.  I was contacted by a person in Skerries last week because an application has gone in for a fast food outlet only 270 m from a school.  A lady contacted me this morning to say that an application has gone in only 150 m from a school.  They are looking for us to provide our experience and the knowledge we have gained through the process.  That is great, but we believe we should not be in this situation.<\/p><p>It is very clear that if the planning guidelines were revised to ensure that no fast food outlet could be located within 400 m of a school or all of the county development plans were changed, there would be consistency in local planning.  We do not have such consistency now, which is very frustrating.  People do not want fast food outlets in certain locations because they might not be appropriate and they do not know what to do and they are trying to get interested parties together to fight it.  That should not need to happen.  The evidence is very clear that if one locates fast food outlets close to schools, one will see an increase in obesity.  Children are then exposed to targeted aggressive marketing.  We are in the middle of an obesity crisis and unless we start taking decisive clear action now, the problem will get worse.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018053000002#O01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Moyles","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527669000,"counter":192,"content":"<p>Well done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018053000002#P00200","speaker":"1362"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527669000,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018053000002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Moyles"},{"type":"speech","time":1527669000,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I hope we will see other councils make a similar move in their development plan.<\/p> <p>  I wish to address questions to the dieticians.

Without doubt, the evidence shows that breast-feeding is the best option for babies.  Traditionally in Ireland, we have not had a culture of breastfeeding.  It is now becoming more well established.  The latest figures are that 58% of mothers are breastfeeding in hospital, so they will initiate breastfeeding.  That drops quite dramatically when the mum goes home.  Problems can arise in the first couple of weeks and support may be needed but the supports are not there.  There will be one visit from a public health nurse but there are no daily visits to help.  Unless somebody has a mum, a sister or a friend who has breastfed, very often women can drop breastfeeding at that stage.  We know that at three months, the number of mothers still breastfeeding are down to 36%.  The target is to try to get that number up to 40% at three months.  That is the first issue.  We know that is the culture in Ireland compared with Scandinavian countries, where the initiation rate of breast-feeding is 98%.  There is a significant distance way to go.  That is something that is really important.  We know that infants who are breastfed for six months or longer have a 50% less chance of being overweight or obese at the age of nine years.  The evidence has shown that outcome when these children are followed.  That is not only because of social class.  We know that breastfeeding mothers tend to be educated to a higher level and also tend to be from a higher socio-economic group, however, we need everyone to be supported in breastfeeding.  That is really important.  Breastfeeding comes first and then weaning.  Traditionally, I would imagine that all present were weaned at three months of age as that was what was done.  One now has grandparents suggesting that such children be given something to eat because they are hungry or are crying.  Following on from that, the advice was to start feeding the child at four months, but now the WHO has pushed weaning out to six months.  This is due to the maturation of the baby's immune system.  The baby's immune system is poorly developed when the baby is born.  The reason that a baby is born at nine months is that the baby's head size can fit through the birth canal but there is a great deal of maturation that still needs to go on once the baby is born.  That is why breastfeeding is the perfect food for babies.  Exclusively breastfeeding up until the age of six months is now advocated and beyond that, the introduction of complementary foods.<\/p> <p>  It can get confusing because the information on some packaging of baby foods will say the product is suitable for babies from four months.  The guidelines from the WHO first said that breastfed infants should be weaned at six months, but formula-fed infants were being weaned at four months.  That caused a lot of confusion.<\/p> <p>  The advice now is to reduce the risk of allergy, because babies who are weaned too early tend to be at a greater risk of allergy and are at a greater risk of being overweight and of obesity because they tend to be overfed.  Another issue is that breastfed babies stop feeding when they are full.  One has no idea how much they have had.  That may cause a bit of anxiety for the mother because she is worrying whether the baby has had enough but that allows the baby to develop his or her own sense of satiety, with the baby tuning in to when he or she is full.  They are developing their own signals of feeling full.  If a baby is on formula, one is anxious that the baby finishes the bottle.  The baby may be full but the mum is feeling anxious because the baby has not drained the bottle.  There are lots of cues and a lot more going on, which is really important.<\/p> <p>  We need to get more mums to breastfeed, but I know it is difficult.  When I look back on my own experience, it was the support of friends and the knowledge that I was doing the right thing that helped me to stick with it during the first couple of weeks.  After that, it can be plain sailing.  It is during the first few weeks that support for breastfeeding mothers is critical.  If we could get the breastfeeding rates up, it would be phenomenal for children's health and for mothers' health as well, because it protects against breast cancers and various types of ovarian cancers.  There are lots of benefits to the mum from breastfeeding.  I agree that breastfeeding and early weaning are critical issues.<\/p> <p>  Dieticians are trained and know the evidence base behind it.  It is not based on an idea or a feeling but on scientific evidence.  As for any access to dietetic support, public health nurses are trained and have some contact with dieticians in the community.  The issue is to get support for mums and that is really important. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018053000002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Reynolds"},{"type":"speech","time":1527669000,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I think that is so important.

The resources might not be there for the mother at that point.  The public health nurse might not be there.  The HSE has a programme, the Nurture programme, which is part-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies.  I am sure members have heard of it.  Part of that involves community dieticians training other healthcare staff to give evidence-based nutrition advice to support appropriate weaning and to support appropriate menu development and cookery skills for mums in the community, so that when a mother weans her baby, she is weaning him or her on to a good diet.  That is really important.<\/p> <p>  Last year we put in for nine community dieticians in the Estimates, one per CHO to support these programmes.

It was just plain packaging.  There was a lot of that in my house when I was growing up.  Perhaps that was a good thing, but it is not as prevalent now.  We are tackling sugar sweetened drinks, but there are also high content sugar products.  We have to start looking at those, particularly confectionery - I do not want to name particular products - which includes chemically sweetened chewy bars.  They are not chocolate or nougat; I do not know what they are made of.  Kids are buying many such products which are clearly not good for them.

The situation is inverted at the moment; the food pyramid is on its head in respect of what is advertised and so on.  There will be many steps along the way to achieve that.  Those steps can be picked off, one by one, or we can think about more achievable goals we can start with.<\/p> <p>  Relatively simple measures could be taken, which we recommend in the forthcoming World Health Organization, WHO, review, such as targeting what children are viewing rather than programming targeted at children.  We should seek to have a nutrient profile model that restricts the foods that are advertised even more than is currently the case, even with its cheese derogation.  There should be a statutory rather than voluntary code for broadcast marketing.  The current code launched by the Department of Health is voluntary, and all the evidence shows that voluntary codes are not as effective.  It must be well monitored and a transparent monitoring mechanism must be defined in advance.  There are many parts to the code, and questions have to be asked about how they will work in practice.  Brand equity characters need to be dealt with, which are the characters which are not brought in from another programme but which are associated with the product.  Companies are really wedded to those for obvious reasons because they are powerful marketing tools.  We need to deal with brand marketing, rather than just marketing for foods.  These are difficult issues to address because companies will say that they need to reformulate and that they need space to do that.  Hard questions need to be asked about them.  <\/p> <p>  Information must be provided in schools and preschools.  I asked the St. Angela's College representatives earlier whether marketing is part of the junior certificate curriculum, and they said that there was not really any but that there was space for teachers to insert it.  It would be nice to develop, and I will talk to them about that.  <\/p> <p>  Ultimately, two actions must be taken.  We need to understand that choices are not made by people standing in a vacuum; they are made as a result of endless influences.  We have to do away with the language of healthy choices and come up with a different phrase, because it implies that the individual, as an agentic person, whether child or parent, can make all these decisions themselves.  We have to have a whole systems approach to this.

I recognise the work the committee has completed thus far.  The members of oversight group, including me, have read with interest the two reports published by the committee. <\/p> <p>  As I indicated during my previous appearance, the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care and the oversight group share many of the same concerns.  The work of the oversight group has, in the first instance, concentrated on assessing A Vision for Change, our national mental health policy, to determine what changes are needed to this foundation to refresh it in today's context.  While the term of this policy came to an end last year, many of its recommendations helped to shape our current mental health system and remain at the heart of effective and appropriate mental health services.  With this in mind, it was important to take a considered and staged approach to this work.  In line with the oversight group work plan, consultation is taking place will continue in the coming weeks and feedback will be incorporated into the final report.  This approach is similar to that taken by the joint committee, which has heard from different stakeholders over the course of its work.  It is with interest that the group has observed the insights provided by the committee meetings.  Our group will consider the stakeholder feedback in our discussions as we deliberate on how best to include it as we proceed. <\/p> <p>  My purpose this evening is to share with the committee the work of the oversight group of which I am chair.  While I am sure members are familiar with the context within which the oversight group was created, I will nonetheless begin at the initial stages of the group.  A Vision for Change was published in 2006 and set out a ten-year policy framework for Ireland's mental health services.  It recommended that interventions should be aimed at maximising recovery from mental illness and building on service user and social network resources to achieve meaningful integration and participation in community life.  It was welcomed as a progressive, evidence-based policy which guided the development of our mental health services towards a new model of service delivery, one which would be service user centred, flexible and community-based.<\/p> <p>  A Vision for Change highlighted many areas which were in need of increased attention in the shift from a service with an institutional focus to a community-based service, and many of the recommendations are still valid today.  However, A Vision for Change came to an end in 2016 and preparations for a review and updating of policy have been under way since early 2016.  The initial step was the commissioning of an evidence-based expert review in September 2016.  This looked at the implementation of A Vision for Change and how future policy and services could be improved.  The review provides evidence to inform the policy direction for a revision of A Vision for Change, both in terms of international best practice and the experience obtained since the adoption of the policy.  It presents a broad overview and mapping of evidence and developments in the mental health area that are helpful in guiding policy development and practice in Ireland.  Coincidentally, the report was published on the same day as the joint committee was established in July 2017. <\/p> <p>  In October 2017, the Minister for Health established the oversight group which was tasked with producing a high-level policy framework setting out future service priorities.  I was honoured to be appointed by the Minister to chair the group.  In considering the appropriate membership, it was decided to keep the group small, efficient and inclusive of leaders in the area to ensure a clear focus on the task of producing a refreshed policy in a timely manner.  The oversight group, in line with its terms of reference, is overseeing the development of this refreshed policy for mental health, based on the recommendations arising out of the expert review and other relevant contributing documents.  Work is scheduled to conclude in December of this year. <\/p> <p>  The oversight group engaged in a detailed consideration of current policy actions and recommendations.<\/p><p>It established a number of subgroups to focus on specific areas of attention, including child and youth mental health, the mental health of the over-65 age group and examination of policy outcomes.  The outcomes subgroup focused on how outcomes can operate as a paradigm shift within the system to work better and more efficiently and to serve the service user in a better way, drawing from existing research and practice.  The oversight group has determined that its work will have a focus on developing measurable outcomes within an outcomes focused framework.<\/p><p> An ecological framework will also inform the refreshed policy.  This approach focuses on both population level and individual level determinants of health and interventions.  It is acknowledged in much recent research that health is determined by influences at multiple levels, such as public policy, community, institutional, interpersonal and intrapersonal factors.  An evaluation of the current context and how that relates to A Vision for Change and other current mental health related policies was also deemed necessary.  This document examines whether specific actions have been implemented and, if so, to what success.  The evaluation also examines whether specific actions have been implemented through other policies in this area and considers whether actions are still relevant if they are not implemented.  I understand this is the document the committee referred to in its second interim report.  A preliminary report has been received and is tabled for discussion at the next meeting of the group which takes place tomorrow.  Following this meeting, the researcher will be asked to finalise the report.  When this final version is received it will be shared with the members of the committee.<\/p><p> I also note that the committee has referenced engagement with the Department of Health as an area for action in its second interim report.  As mentioned in my letter to the committee last December, the oversight group agreed to report further to this committee when the initial part of our deliberations was completed.  As members will have seen in the oversight group's work plan furnished to the committee in March 2018, these deliberations have taken place mainly within the oversight group up to this point.  While we have not been in a position to share working documents, I reassure the committee of our shared goal and the oversight group's ongoing commitment to this goal.<\/p><p> We are currently engaged in a stakeholder consultation process and we have just left the first advisory group meeting this afternoon.  For this part of the process two half-day meetings have been scheduled - one today and the other, which was due to be held in June, will be in September.  At these meetings we will gather input from mental health clinical experts who currently work in front-line services and service user representative organisations.  It has been important to the group that the positive aspects of A Vision for Change would not be lost.  The group is attentive to its mandate which is to complete a refresh of A Vision for Change.  The oversight group is working on developing a framework document that will both guide the stakeholder process and assist the oversight group to work within a shared vision.  Stakeholder feedback received is extremely important to us and it is hoped that all relevant information received will inform the recommendations in the refreshed report.<\/p><p> While the final domains have yet to be decided, it is anticipated that the following five domains will be considered: social inclusion and recovery; prevention and early intervention; access, co-ordination and continuity; improvement and innovation; and accountability and transparency.  Outcomes and specific actions will then flow from these domains.  Enablers that exist will also be explicitly recognised, as it is important to note what has contributed to the positive aspects of current service provision in order to ensure it continues.  Wider public consultation is also set to take place in Dublin, Cork and Sligo in August.  All of this feedback will be incorporated into the work of the group, with the group ultimately producing \"an updated draft policy framework which sets out current and future service priorities within a time-bound implementation plan\".  The feedback from these stakeholder sessions and the working document mapping recommendations against current context, alongside any other completed items of work, can be provided to the committee once available.<\/p><p> The oversight group acknowledges the good work completed by the Oireachtas committee.  In several of our meetings it was agreed that the existence of the Oireachtas committee was a very positive development because its work would assist greatly in ensuring that the policy refresh would have political support.  The oversight group is clear that the terms of reference ask it to focus on refreshing policy.  Policy determines outcomes for individuals in need of mental health support and shares a vision of what good mental health outcomes should be.  This differs from the work of the joint committee, whose focus is on service improvement, staff shortages and funding.  There is certainly a role for both groups and working together will result in a real shift in prioritising mental health in government, resulting in positive changes in policy and service provision.<\/p><p> Once again I thank the committee for inviting us to today's meeting.  I will be happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018053000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Kane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527697800,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Kane.

I regret, and it is unfortunate, that there is a sense that we are doing different things and that we are not on the same side in terms of what we are trying to achieve.  The particular work we were tasked with in our terms of reference was to review A Vision for Change and to come up with a refreshed version of it.

There are some ongoing issues.  One is that we are a voluntary group and all of us have other day jobs.  That mitigates against us being able to get together as often and to do work as required, so that is a particular challenge.<\/p><p>The focus of work during our first three meetings was deliberating on this complex area of mental health and what would be a good way to approach the development of a refreshed A Vision for Change.  We spent a good bit of time deliberating, thinking about and discussing among ourselves the direction in which we would go.  <\/p><p> When I was here on the previous occasion, I noted that the oversight group decided to take an outcomes-focused approach rather than focusing on outputs and that we would examine the issue in the whole other context I outlined.  Considerable thought and deliberative time went into that.  As we are an independent group whose members are drawn from many different backgrounds, we engaged in a considerable amount of discussion to reach consensus and agree on the best way forward.  In respect of trying to write a report based on that kind of deliberative approach, nothing really comes out of that because one goes through a process and we work as colleagues, share ideas, argue the points backward and forward and move on.  That took a particular amount of time.  <\/p><p> We were anxious to establish the current status of all the recommendations in A Vision for Change.  We contracted an external group to do that particular task.  Obviously, when we were trying to determine what was in and out of scope in terms of the work we were doing, we felt this was a fairly key piece of work.  We received a draft report in at the end of February on that work.  This identified what was finished, what was not finished and why it was not finished, what else might be missing and whether changes had taken place in other areas that we needed to add to our work.  We decided to hold that piece of work while we moved on to developing the overall framework we are using to look at the development of policy.  Again, in looking at that framework, we spent a good bit of time looking at other jurisdictions that have used an outcomes approach and the places where it has worked really well.  A few moving pieces are starting to fit together.  We are at the point where we have a draft framework into which we can build a policy.  That is what we consulted extensively on today with the people we met.  We will work on that kind of framework.  Tomorrow, we must finish the piece of work with the consultants who carried out the work on A Vision for Change to identify the gaps and the final pieces that need to be done.  Once that is done, that becomes an output and, as I said, we will share that with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018053000002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Kane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1527697800,"counter":240,"content":"<p>Mr. Kane says the group has begun meeting stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018053000002#D00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527697800,"counter":241,"content":"<p>Yes, we met the first group of stakeholders this afternoon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018053000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Kane"},{"type":"speech","time":1527697800,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Did the group not meet any stakeholders between October 2017 and today?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018053000002#D00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527697800,"counter":243,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018053000002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Kane"},{"type":"speech","time":1527697800,"counter":244,"content":"<p>How often does the group meet?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018053000002#D00600","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527697800,"counter":245,"content":"<p>We meet every month.

We have had so many stakeholders inform the committee that they have an evidence-based proposal, namely, the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  By the way, today is its birthday.  We had the life experts in the Seanad tell us how the system is not working.  Mr. Kane said he is currently engaged in a stakeholder consultation process.  We will have to move away from consultation to implementation.  The experts are telling us that it is difficult to access mental health services.  Fancy information campaigns on TV and so forth can be run, but I am hearing day in, day out on the ground about the difficulties people have accessing mental health services.  The first point of access, GP services, are swamped.  One might not even get to see a GP now.  We should not have have more of these reviews.  Instead, we should have a committee such as this to take the first six pages of a report's recommendations and implement them.<\/p><p> Mr. Kane said in his opening statement, \"While we have not been in a position to share working documents, I would like to reassure the committee of our shared goal and the oversight group's ongoing commitment to this goal.\"  It is ongoing because there are two planes flying parallel to each other and will not meet.  It is like asking a bank manage to cash a \"Thank you\" note.  I am not being disrespectful to the witnesses.  I am angry and disappointed with the Minister.  I was excited at the start.  I believed that if we could work together and achieve something positive, the people who would benefit would be those who needed these services most.  While there has been excellent work done since the committee started, the subs are warming up on the other pitch and might never get a game.<\/p><p> First, we need to achieve access the services.  We will hear about lack of staff and recruitment and retention.  If that is the case, then we should roll out pilot projects.  We know where systems are working well and where there are problems in the State.  I was recently at a meeting in Tipperary attended by 200 people who were protesting about the lack of availability of mental health services.  Up to 220 shoes were displayed at the meeting, each one representing somebody who had taken his or her life since 2012.  That is in one county.  Surely, that is a red flag and there should be some pilot scheme to address this.<\/p><p> Mr. Kane referred again to evidence-based proposals.  We have heard from all the experts and documents have been published.  Can we not ask the Minister to take a different view on this?  Can we not have an early intervention system to deal with a problem in a certain area of the country and then roll out it out in other areas?<\/p><p> There is a high incidence of cancer in certain areas which are then targeted.  There are high instances of youth suicide in certain places which are targeted.  In Dublin as many mothers and young women are dying by suicide as fathers and young men.  Surely, that has to be red flagged.  I am aggrieved that we keep talking about coming up with a plan but it is then claimed more evidence is needed.  The evidence is available.  We are heading towards a major crisis in mental health services.  There is a shortage of up to 500 staff in the system.  There will be 1,700 retirements in the next five years but there is no plan to replace them and begin a recruitment drive.  I do not mean to be condescending but I am trying to flag that we must be realistic.  If this is not working now, can we start thinking outside the box to implement a system that will work instead of just talking about it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018053000002#E02100","speaker":"1279","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527697800,"counter":277,"content":"<p>We have a little piece of the jigsaw on which we are working.

I am blue in the face, however, from talking about documents which go nowhere.  A Vision for Change is 12 years old.  Psychiatric nurses were excited when it was first launched because we had an input into it.

When we established this committee, we said it would be a committee of action.  However, it is just rolling on with talk and reviews.  I apologise if I seem to be giving out but it is frustrating and action is needed.  Earlier the Seanad debated the Seanad Public Consultation Committee report on children's mental health services, which was produced under the stewardship of the Chairman and we called for her Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 to be enacted as soon as possible to stop children being nursed in adult psychiatric units.<\/p><p>It is possible but there is no political will to do it.  That is an action that is doable but we are not even getting timelines.  There are lots of barriers but there is a significant amount of legislation that could be enacted.  I am sorry for ranting.<\/p><p> Professor Harry Kennedy from the Central Mental Hospital was here last week, along with witnesses from the Irish Penal Reform Trust and others.  He was of the opinion that we should scrap A Vision for Change but I disagree with him.  I do not think we have the right to scrap what is a decent document that requires implementation.  He believes the document does nothing to address the issue of prisoner mental health, the rise in psychosis among prisoners or the fact that our prisons are becoming our new mental institutions because of the closure of so many long-term mental health facilities.  I asked Professor Kennedy to be proactive and to write to the oversight group for A Vision For Change.  I also urge the oversight group to write to him.  He is a very able individual with some very useful ideas.  However, I urge the oversight group not to take up his idea of scrapping A Vision for Change and starting again because we do not have the luxury of the time to do so.  <\/p><p> A lot of research has been conducted by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in collaboration with the Psychiatric Nurses Association, whose members have on-the-ground experience.  A study was published in recent years which showed that 73% of the recommendations in A Vision for Change had not been implemented.  I was very cynical when the oversight group was set up because I thought it signalled more of the same.  I hope that the oversight group is using the evidence provided by the aforementioned study as guidance in its work.  <\/p><p> I was quite impressed with the oversight group's work plan, which is just like the care plans that are drawn up in hospitals.  It identifies the problems, the objectives, the dates and how we will get where we want to go.  I would love to see all of the boxes filled out and ticked off.  There was a suggestion that five town hall meetings would be rolled out across the country, which I welcome.  I recommend the use interactive materials at those meetings and urge the oversight group to invite questions from participants and to get their feedback, either directly or through applications like Mentimeter.  It is important to reach out to as many people as possible.  Most importantly, I urge the group to hurry up and to carry out its work quickly.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018053000002#F00500","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1527697800,"counter":282,"content":"<p>One of the items on our agenda tomorrow is the issue of prisoners.

We had fantastic presentations on prisoners and mental health from a range of different people recently. They described the scale of the mental health difficulties for people who are locked up, who have no safe place to be and who cannot escape their surroundings.  It was quite shocking.  Every time this committee meets a new group, we are shocked.  We had members of the Traveller community before us and were shocked at the statistics that they presented to us.  We listened to people who spoke about human trafficking and were shocked at what they told us.  These are not ordinary, small problems.  They are huge problems and the scale of the challenge cannot be overstated but the sense of stasis is overwhelming.    I have a number of specific questions on the work plan.  Action 8 refers to reducing the over reliance on prescription medication by increasing investment in counselling and talk therapies.  The response refers to the HSE having commenced \"a service improvement initiative\".  When one hears such a response, one feels that the issue of talk therapies has disappeared into a black hole.  The document refers to access to talk therapies being examined where clinically indicated.  We already have evidence and know that talk therapies are valuable in terms of helping people to address problems.  When I worked with the Simon Community in Cork we had walk-in therapy sessions with approved counsellors.  We did not get a penny for that service from the State but provided it using fundraised money.  We did not commence research with a view to producing a report.  People were coming to the sessions and disclosing historic abuse issues that they needed to address.  We did not tell them that they had to get sober first.  If they were inebriated on the day in question, we told them to come back the next day.  That service is still in place.  Simon did not wait for reviews or examinations.  I want a commitment from the oversight group that it will move forward on action 8.<\/p> <p>  In the context of action 22, the rate of mental ill health and suicide among Travellers is exponential, shocking and a disgrace to us all.  Again, we do not need more reports on this.  I see that nine grade 7 mental health service co-ordinator posts were created.  Are those posts all filled?  Are all of those co-ordinators in place?  They were being recruited in October 2017, as I understand it.  While to me, that is a bee in a bear's belly in terms of addressing the issues, I wonder if even that much has been done.<\/p> <p>  Given the exceptionally high rates of mental ill health and suicide among Travellers, including young people, the &euro;1.5 million in dormant accounts funding is no more than crumbs from the table.  While it is welcome, it is nowhere near the kind of concerted, mainstream effort and funding needed.<\/p> <p>  Action 27 refers to integrating mental health supports into the health programme for victims of human trafficking but once again we have mention of a review.  We are talking about people, mostly women, who have been trafficked into this country and who have experienced enormous trauma.  We had a presentation recently outlining the experience of trafficked women in particular.  What needs to be reviewed?  <\/p> <p>  While I accept the bona fides of the witnesses here today, it seems that we are dealing here with a cesspit of bureaucracy that is disconnected from reality.  We saw the same with CervicalCheck, where good people in the system were disconnected from real people.  Part of our job here is to listen to people and to connect with them.

It was fairly moving, as one might imagine.  We accept the witnesses have major challenges ahead in their work.  I am not long on this committee.  There is a credibility issue with the work being done because of the work already done but which has not been implemented.  That is a problem.  We are picking up from the groups coming in that the structures seem to be all over the place.  There does not seem to be great co-ordination.  Services seem to be dependent on where a person lives, so if gaps exist, something needs to be done.  I hope that is on the agenda.  It is wrong that if a person lives in a particular area, that person cannot access services.  The Ireland that allows such things should be gone, as far as I am concerned.  Similarly, if I do not come from a wealthy background, those services should still be available to me and my family.<\/p> <p>  Where do many of the families looking for that help go?  It is the biggest problem we face.  They normally go to politicians like us and we are probably the worst people to go to.  Some will go to their GP and so on but there is a gap in the knowledge.  These are simple problems such as who to contact at a service level.  The answers are not available to us so if they are not available to us as elected representatives, how can they be available to Joe Citizen?  These are the simple issues that could be life-changing for people.  I wish Mr. Kane well but as well as anybody like him on a committee, there is a major responsibility on the Minister to explain why the recommendations of predecessors were not carried out.  Before taking on a new role, Mr. Kane must be clear in his own mind that he is not wasting time and ticking boxes in the same way.  This committee is sitting down and coming up with recommendations but I hope they will not sit on a shelf.<\/p> <p>  This is not an attack but I am looking for a sensible way forward.
