I am grateful to Indecon for their work on this and welcome the findings of the review. <\/p>  <p>  The Report supports the rationale and continued relevance of the policy changes made since 2012.  It highlights that employment rates increased among lone parents and welfare dependency decreased.  However, the report also highlights the risk of poverty for lone parents with no or low-paid employment and the associated policy challenge to integrate these lone parents into the Irish labour market. <\/p>  <p>  These findings reinforced my commitment to make lone parents one of my priorities in Budget 2018 and I have delivered on that commitment.  Budget 2018 includes a &euro;5 increase per week in the rates of payment, an increase in the qualified child payment of &euro;2 per week, an increase in the earnings disregard on the one-parent family payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment from &euro;110 to &euro;130 per week.  It also extended the fuel allowance season by an additional week, and provided for an increase of &euro;10 per week in the working family payment thresholds (formerly the family income supplement) for families with 1 to 3 children and the continued availability of the back to work family dividend.

Additionally, all projects are reviewed by the Department&rsquo;s Programme Governance Committee (comprising the Department&rsquo;s most senior managers) approx. every two months with status reports and risk assessments of the various programme elements.<\/p>  <p>  The original Government Decision relating to SAFE identity verification and the PSC was made in 2005 and my Department began the implementation of SAFE registrations and the issuances of PSCs in 2011.  My Department complied with all legal Data Protection requirements at that time.  Privacy impact assessments will become a legal requirement under the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (&ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;) in May 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Department obviously takes its data protection obligations very seriously. Consequently the Department works extensively with the Data Protection Commissioner and consults regularly with her office on any major developments or proposed changes, including over the years in relation to the PSC.  The Data Protection Commissioner is clear that all uses for the PSC must be set out in legislation and that the Department should be transparent in the provision of information on the programme.  The Department fully agrees with that, and with the help of the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s Office, has published a Comprehensive Guide on SAFE Registration and the Public Services Card on its website. <\/p>  <p>  SAFE identity verification and the PSC also allow the provision of an online account to individuals called MyGovID.  All three are investments in the future of public service provision.  They provide significant benefits in that they will allow all public service providers over time to be assured that they are dealing with the right person, that identity registration can be completed on a &ldquo;once and done&rdquo; basis, that identity fraud is minimised, that personal data can be protected, that high-value and personalised public services can be made available to individuals online and remotely, and that Ireland is aligned with the EU&rsquo;s electronic ID regulations.  As a result, more and more public services are beginning to use SAFE 2, the PSC and MyGovID in the provision of their services securely to individuals.<\/p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the PSC, my Department has detected 167 cases of suspected identity fraud which have been referred to the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit (SIU).  Of these, 65 cases have been concluded with 22 finalised in Court (where 19 of them received a custodial sentence), 15 not proceeded (mainly due to the person leaving the jurisdiction), and 28 with formal proceedings issued and awaiting court appearance.  Fraud overpayments of approx. &euro;3 Million have been assessed in these 65 cases.  <\/p>  <p>  The other 87 cases are under investigation or at various stages of the prosecution process.  Assessments will be determined for these (and any others in the future) as they are brought to conclusion.<\/p>  <p>  Where a customer does not attend for a number of SAFE appointments without explanation, the relevant payment can be suspended. In general, experience is that where a claim is suspended as a result of a non-attendance for SAFE registration, the customer gets in touch and complies with SAFE registration, upon which payment is restored.  SAFE-related savings are calculated in accordance with the relevant multiplier of the DSP scheme in payment.  As of 31\/07\/2017, savings of over &euro;3 Million has been recorded in respect of 438 cases of suspension.  It is important to bear in mind that the SAFE registration process is a dynamic one, with a number of stages to be followed and statistics representing a snapshot at a particular point in time.  Claim suspensions are a temporary measure and savings are not claimed where a claim is suspended and the customer subsequently complies with SAFE registration.   The relatively small number of cases (438) of claimed savings for payment stopped reflects the generally very high overall rates of compliance with SAFE registration. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the Free Travel variant of the PSC, i.e., the PSC-FT, has seen a significant reduction in the number of confiscations of free travel passes.  In Q1 and Q2 2017, there were no PSC-FTs confiscated for attempted forgery and 59 PSC-FTs were confiscated as the photo on the card was not that of the cardholder.  By contrast, in the same period, 19 paper Free Travel passes were confiscated across the CIE Group and Luas for attempted forgery and 134 paper passes were confiscated as the travel pass was not being used by the correct pass holder.  Even this number of 134 is a significant reduction on the 323 paper passes confiscated in Q1 and Q2 2016 (a year earlier) arising from the fact that over 87% of free travel entitled customers now have the PSC-FT rather than a paper pass.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700065#WRA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Leave","counter":36,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700065#WRA03400"},{"type":"question","counter":37,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[46703\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700065#WRA03500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to examine the possibility of extending maternity leave and benefit to mothers of premature babies that were on leave before the commencement date of 1 October\u00a02017; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":1187,"qnumall":"[45803\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700065#WRA03600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the way in which women may avail of the reformed maternity leave entitlement that did not reach the criteria for the entitlement due to a premature birth; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":39,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 1187 together. <\/p>  <p>  On 3 October 2017 I, together with my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, Charlie Flanagan T.D., announced increased maternity leave and maternity benefit for mothers whose babies are born prematurely.<\/p>  <p>  Under the new arrangements, in addition to the current 26 weeks of paid maternity leave a mother will be entitled to an additional period of maternity leave and benefit where her baby is born prematurely, where she meets the ordinary qualifying criteria for the schemes.

There was then a European Council Article 50 - without the UK - which discussed progress in the Brexit negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  Iran was discussed as part of the the external relations items on Thursday evening.  France, the United Kingdom, Germany and the EEAS all voiced their strong support for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and confirmed that it continues to function.  This is a key element of the nuclear non-proliferation global architecture, and is crucial for the security of the region.  Ireland together with all other Member States has re-affirmed our commitment to all parts of the JCPOA, and to its continued full implementation. <\/p>  <p>  Neither the situation in Catalonia nor Article 155 of the Spanish constitution was discussed.  <\/p>  <p>  I was invited, along with the Dutch Prime Minister, to join the leaders of the Nordic and Baltic countries - Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - for a meeting ahead of the European Council discussions. Although Ireland is not part of a formal group in the EU, as a small northern European nation with an open economy, we have similar positions on many issues, particularly economic issues. I was very pleased therefore to attend this meeting with like-minded partners and to have the opportunity to share our views, including on the future of Europe debate.<\/p>  <p>  I had no bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Michel, President Macron, Chancellor Merkel or Prime Minister May in the margins of the October European Council although I did, of course, greet and interact with these and other colleagues over the course of the European Council itself.  <\/p>  <p>  The Future of Europe was discussed over breakfast on Friday 20 October.  This came in the context of an ongoing process, and discussions at a series of informal Summits in Bratislava, Valletta, Rome and Tallinn. <\/p>  <p>  President Juncker and President Macron have also recently made useful contributions to the debate on the Future of Europe and possible EU reforms.  At the meeting on Friday 20 October, it was agreed that the unity of the EU is particularly important and there was general support for the process proposed by President Tusk, on the basis of his &lsquo;Leader&rsquo;s Agenda.&rsquo;  <\/p>  <p>  I expressed strong support for this approach and thanked President Tusk for taking the time to speak informally to all the 28 Heads of State or Government in advance of the meeting. <\/p>  <p>  It is important that we approach the debate on the future of Europe in a positive way - membership of the European Union has been and will remain very important to Ireland.

PRTLI has complemented other research funding programmes of Government including in particular the funding provided by my Department through Science Foundation Ireland (&euro;162m in 2017).<\/p>  <p>  Innovation 2020 includes an action to scope out and develop a successor to PRTLI to support new investment in research infrastructure.

This particular programme is to be rolled out through Science Foundation Ireland and further detail on the programme will be provided by SFI in the coming months.\u00a0 I envisage that additional funding will be provided in 2019 and subsequent years to continue growing this programme and to allow for new student intake in subsequent years.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of Budget 2018, the Minister for Education and Skills also announced a range of measures addressing physical infrastructure and human capital development in the higher education sector including for research.

In line with this the\u00a0Programme for a Partnership Government has\u00a0set out a number of important and practical\u00a0measures\u00a0which seek\u00a0to improve the position of variable rate mortgage holders.<\/p><p>As\u00a0part of the Programme for a\u00a0Partnership Government, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) was requested to\u00a0conduct a review of the Irish mortgage market.\u00a0 The CCPC has recently\u00a0produced its\u00a0report and it outlines\u00a0a range of short, medium and long term\u00a0options to improve the operation of the market.  The Government will now evaluate and\u00a0consider these options in detail.  A web link to the report is attached for information: <\/p><p>The Government also believes that measures to encourage and promote a greater level of switching in the mortgage market will\u00a0help boost the level of competition in the market for existing mortgages.  In particular, the Programme for a Partnership Government considers that the development of a code of conduct\u00a0for switching mortgage provider would be a useful and practical initiative\u00a0which would have the potential to deliver savings to many existing mortgage holders.\u00a0 In line with this commitment, in 2016 the Central Bank commenced\u00a0research in the area of mortgage switching which\u00a0was completed\u00a0earlier this year.  Based on this research, the Central Bank has now commenced a consultation process on proposed measures\u00a0to help consumers to compare their existing mortgage to other mortgage options and to provide consumers with standardised switching information<\/p><p>().<\/p><p>The\u00a0Central Bank has already made some changes to require lenders to better inform and protect variable rate mortgage holders\u00a0in relation to changes in mortgage rates. These were\u00a0set out\u00a0in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012\u00a0and\u00a0require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an interest rate increase.  The measures will also improve the level of information to be provided to borrowers about other mortgage products their lender\u00a0provides that could provide savings for the borrower and signpost borrowers to the CCPC's mortgage switching tool.<\/p><p>In overall terms, the Government is of the opinion that increased competition rather than administrative controls is the best way to ensure that retail lending rates are driven down in a sustainable way for the market as a whole but without giving rise to potentially undesirable consequences for the provision of new mortgage lending. <\/p><p>It should be noted that there has been some progress\u00a0in this area. Recently published Central Bank data showed that standard variable mortgage rates for new PDH mortgages fell by 23 basis points to 3.34 per cent in quarter 2 2017 since the same period in 2016.  This does not include\u00a0the recent rate reductions\u00a0by a main mortgage lender which will have a further welcome impact on overall mortgage rates.\u00a0 However, this is a policy\u00a0area that the Government will continue to keep under active review in its\u00a0ongoing engagement with mortgage lenders\u00a0and in implementing the Programme for Government commitments to help deliver on a long term basis better outcomes for all mortgage borrowers.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700070#WRF07600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Application","counter":347,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700071#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":348,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[45818\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700071#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to introduce a 23% VAT rate on certain music and art schools; the reason for this change in VAT rules; the reason certain institutions are affected and others are not; his views on whether these changes are in line with the findings of the report Culture 2025 - &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach, a Framework Policy to 2025 published by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in July 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":349,"content":"<p>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply.

The amount of the debt released is to be treated as a receipt of the trade in the tax year in which the release is effected. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the section is to ensure that individual land dealers\/developers do not obtain the benefit of losses for tax purposes where no economic loss was incurred.  Section 87B treats the amount of the loan written down as a trading receipt effectively clawing back any tax deduction that they may have received from a write down in the taxpayers books e.g. if land was acquired for &euro;10m and the market value fell to &euro;1m, the value of the closing stock of the land in the accounts of the developer would be &euro;1m.  The developer would have incurred a loss of &euro;9m.  However, where the acquisition was funded by borrowings and a debt of &euro;9m was released by the lender, no economic loss was suffered by the developer.  If the release of the debt was not treated as a trading receipt, a loss of &euro;9m would be available for offset against other income even though no economic loss was actually incurred.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation provides that, in a case involving a discharge from bankruptcy, or a discharge from debt under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, the release of the debt is treated as having been effected on the date of discharge.  Revenue has also confirmed that, in the case of bankruptcy, it will accept the date of final distribution as being the date of release where this falls after the date of discharge.  As regards the date of release, it should be noted that the first occasion on which the amount of debt to be released can be fully quantified is the date of discharge or the date of the final distribution to creditors, if later than the date of discharge.  It is only when amounts have been fully distributed to the creditors, that it is possible to know how much debt has been released and accordingly how much income is deemed to be received under section 87B TCA.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that in many instances no additional income tax liability should arise as a result of the application of section 87B TCA.  A corresponding write-down in the cost of the trading stock should be available as a tax deduction where there is a debt release and therefore any taxable receipt arising as a result of the write down should be matched by the corresponding write down of the trading stock.  If the taxpayer has previously written down his\/her trading stock and has losses carried forward under section 382 TCA, this trading loss should be available to offset against the s87B income tax charge.  It is only in those circumstances where taxpayers have already written down trading stock, taken the tax deduction and used the losses to shield other income from tax that any net charge to income tax can arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700072#WRH02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tracker Mortgages","counter":418,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700072#WRH02600"},{"type":"question","counter":419,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[46357\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700072#WRH02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether legislation should be introduced to stop repossession proceedings on tracker-related mortgages until all affected customers are redressed (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":420,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the Central Bank is independent in the performance of its duties in the supervision of regulated financial service providers and it is working to ensure the Tracker Mortgage Examination is completed as soon as possible.

The reinvestment of principal payments on maturing securities purchased under the programme will continue for \"an extended period of time\" after the end of net asset purchases, meaning the ECB will remain in the secondary sovereign bond market beyond September 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Economic evidence generally points to QE as having had positive effects on the European economy, contributing to lowering sovereign debt yields and providing a small boost to bank lending, investment, real GDP, headline inflation, and medium-term inflationary expectations.  The Irish economy has benefitted in particular via a reduction in sovereign borrowing costs, additional liquidity in the banking sector, and an improvement in economic activity in key export markets. The extension of the programme to September 2018 is expected to continue to contribute to these effects, supporting overall economic growth and inflationary expectations.<\/p>  <p>  In my view, the ECB's decision to downsize the scale of its QE purchases, whilst also leaving open the possibility of an extension beyond the new end date, is a measured response that balances favourable short-run economic data flow and a generally positive outlook, against possible market disruption that may occur in the event of an abrupt wind-down.  Downsizing is based on a view that the euro area economy no longer needs the same level of monetary stimulus, a view that is supported by recent outturns in the euro area which showed a solid growth rate of 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter in Q3 2017, or 2.5 percent year-on-year.  As such, any negative impacts of winding down are expected to be limited. My Department will continue to monitor developments, including with respect to growth and inflation in the euro area, and advise accordingly. <\/p>  <p>  The extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy adopted by the ECB, and the associated decline in sovereign borrowing costs, clearly cannot last indefinitely.  This heightens the need to implement prudent fiscal policies to keep sovereign borrowing costs low. In this regard, I would point out that while our debt-to-GDP ratio will continue falling in the coming years (on the basis of my Department's forecasts), this is solely due to rising GDP; in purely money terms, we will continue to increase public debt next year and in 2019.  In these circumstances, it is crucial that prudent budgetary policies are implemented in order to minimise debt interest payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700072#WRH06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Licence Applications","counter":454,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700072#WRH06200"},{"type":"question","counter":455,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[46537\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700072#WRH06300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there are applications with the Central Bank for a banking licence for retail banking services; if so, the number of applications with the Central Bank; the amount of time it takes to receive a banking licence from the initial application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":456,"content":"<p>The Central Bank utilises a three-stage banking authorisation assessment process, the first two stages being part of a pre-application assessment, followed by submission of a formal application.

Some of these include\u00a0differences in national legal and housing systems, cultural preferences, the proximity of lenders to borrowers.  More directly, credit and market conditions, mortgage default rates and the funding of mortgage credit will also be relevant factors.<\/p>  <p>  There\u00a0have, however, been some developments which seek to promote a more harmonised market for\u00a0credit across the EU.  In particular, the 2014 Mortgage Credit Directive, which has now been transposed into Irish law by the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016, seeks to develop a more harmonised, efficient and competitive internal market for the provision of residential mortgages to consumer borrowers and this should help to promote the closer integration of EU mortgage markets over time.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the national context, the issue of the level of variable mortgage rates is an important one for this Government and it is committed to reducing the cost of secured mortgage lending and\u00a0promoting competition in the supply of mortgage finance.  To that end, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has recently produced a report which sets out options for consideration to help improve the level of competition and general efficiency of the market.  Additionally, the Central Bank has recently carried out research which showed the scope for borrowers to save money by switching mortgages.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Following on from this, and building on the 2016 addendum to the Consumer Protection Code in relation to standard variable rate mortgage holders, last August the Central Bank\u00a0 published a consultation paper\u00a0proposing new measures which would enhance the framework of protections for variable rate mortgage holders and in particular to require lenders to, inter alia, better inform consumers about other available mortgage options that could save them money, to help them compare their existing mortgage to other mortgage options and to provide consumers with standardised switching information.  A copy of the Consultation Paper is available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website and the consultation process was open for comment until 1 November 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In overall terms, the Government is of the opinion that the development of a\u00a0healthy banking system, which is one which delivers\u00a0increased competition, which is in a position to provide finance to credit worthy customers and which is also resilient to economic and financial market shocks, is the best way to ensure that retail lending rates are driven down in a sustainable way for the market as a whole but without giving rise to potentially undesirable consequences for the provision of new mortgage lending.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700073#WRJ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Supervisors","counter":480,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700073#WRJ02000"},{"type":"question","counter":481,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[46715\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700073#WRJ02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason why community employment scheme workers are not liable for tax but those working for T&uacute;s are; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":482,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that income arising from participation in a Community Employment Scheme is liable to income tax and that such income is, in fact, taxed under the PAYE system.<\/p><p>If the Deputy is aware of a situation whereby participants in a Community Employment Scheme are not paying income tax, he should provide relevant details to Revenue who will examine the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700073#WRJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Exemptions","counter":483,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700073#WRJ02300"},{"type":"question","counter":484,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[46746\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700073#WRJ02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if progress has been made in discussions at a European level to designate defibrillators at zero rate of VAT; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":485,"content":"<p>The Programme for Partnership Government recognises the difficulties faced by community groups in relation to VAT rates on certain products such as defibrillators.

Parts or accessories are also liable to VAT at the standard rate.  There is no provision under existing VAT law that would make it possible to apply a reduced rate or zero rate to the supply of such products.  Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rate on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services.  As such a zero rate cannot be applied to defibrillators.  Any changes to VAT rates outside of what is currently permitted by the EU VAT Directive must be negotiated at EU technical working groups and ultimately agreed by the EU Council of Finance Ministers.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Action Plan on the future of VAT published on 7 April 2016 which sets out the Commission&rsquo;s pathway for modernising the VAT system, the EU\u00a0Commission is due to publish a proposal on the reform of VAT rates later this month.  Earlier in the year, preliminary details of the\u00a0proposed changes were discussed as part of the EU Commission&rsquo;s Group on the Future of VAT - a forum for consulting VAT experts from Member States on pre-legislative initiatives.  Officials from the Department of Finance contributed to these discussions.\u00a0 With regard to what activity should be subject to a reduced rate of VAT going forward, Ireland specifically recommended to the Commission to include defibrillators and other emergency-medical and rescue equipment.  After the Commission proposal is published, technical and political discussions will commence at EU Council among all Member States and Ireland will take the opportunity to continue to recommend that Member States should be able to apply specialised VAT rating to defibrillators and other emergency-medical and rescue equipment.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of any change that might be made at EU level to the VAT rating of defibrillators and other products that pose difficulty for community groups, I am happy to draw your attention to the\u00a0Budget 2018 announcement of\u00a0a VAT compensation refund scheme, which will compensate charities for the VAT they occur on their inputs, in recognition of the work undertaken by the charities sector.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The scheme will take effect from 1 January 2018 but will be paid one year in arrears.  That is, charities may make a claim in 2019 for VAT costs arising in 2018.  Charities will be entitled to a proportion of VAT based on the level of non-public funding they receive.  A capped fund of &euro;5 million will be available to the scheme in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is very committed to supporting community groups and we will continue to press for a reduction in the VAT rate on defibrillators at EU level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700073#WRJ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":486,"content":"<p>Question No. 242 answered with Question No. 233.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Compliance","counter":487,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700073#WRJ02700"},{"type":"question","counter":488,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[46818\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700073#WRJ02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the tax implications for Irish citizens living here that held property abroad (details supplied); if an amnesty is still available to such persons to retrospectively comply with their obligations without penalties and interest; if so, the details of such amnesty; if not, his plans to re-establish such an amnesty to permit the substantial number of persons that wish to meet retrospective tax liabilities which arise from rental income from property in other countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1346","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":489,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the provisions relating to penalties for failing to make a correct tax return where one is required are set out in section 1077E of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997.

This was not an amnesty, the full tax liability, statutory interest and penalties were payable.<\/p>  <p>  However, section 56 of Finance Act 2016 introduced a new provision which excluded any tax defaults relating to offshore matters from the qualifying disclosure regime with effect from 1 May this year.  As a result any tax defaults which have not yet been declared cannot avail of the mitigation in penalties.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  These changes were introduced as part of Ireland&rsquo;s fight against offshore tax evasion, and following increased levels of international tax transparency and data exchange.

Therefore, the total amount paid out of the ICF to date in relation to Setanta Insurance is &euro;7,087,421.99.<\/p>  <p>  The Liquidator has informed my Department that, as of 30 September 2017 - the latest information available -, there are 1,576 active claims, of which 573 claimants have been paid compensation from the ICF subject to the 65%\/&euro;825,000 limits.  The process of settling claims is still ongoing and are subject in some cases to complex negotiations between all relevant parties.  The Liquidator is currently working on settled claims and preparing them for inclusion in the next application to the High Court, expected to be made in February 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Over and above the 65% ICF payment, it is expected that a proportion of the balance of money due to third party claimants will be met from the proceeds of the distribution of Setanta&rsquo;s assets on completion of the liquidation process.  An actuarial report, commissioned by the Liquidator, estimates the claims reserves at 30 June 2017 at between &euro;105.9 million and &euro;112.9 million.  This is an increase from the first report in 2014, which estimated the claims reserves at between &euro;87.7 million and &euro;95.2 million.<\/p>  <p>  A consequence of this is that based on this actuarial report, the liquidator now estimates that he will not be in a position to meet more than 22% of the claims out of the assets of the liquidation, rather than the not more than 30% of claims figure previously indicated.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy should note as previously indicated that there is a legal concern that any Government intervention could undermine the priority status of claimants in the liquidation.  The Department of Finance has therefore sought legal advice on the impact on the State's ability to recover from the liquidated company if it were to compensate third party claimants.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Once this legal issue is clarified, the Government will be in a better position to consider its overall position on the liquidation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700073#WRJ04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Property Sales","counter":502,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700073#WRJ04200"},{"type":"question","counter":503,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[46893\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700073#WRJ04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if NAMA owns properties in an area (details supplied); if so, the details; if the agency has plans to dispose of these properties in the foreseeable future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":504,"content":"<p>I am advised that NAMA does not own properties.

The Central Bank has indicated that\u00a0appeals form an important part of the overall Examination process by ensuring independent and transparent processes to address complaints from customers about the level of redress and\/or compensation offered to them.  The Central Bank requires lenders to have such appeals processes in place in advance of making redress and compensation payments to impacted customers.  The Central Bank has advised that three lenders have now established appeals processes for customers who have received redress and compensation offers as part of the Examination process. T he Central Bank continues to engage with the remaining lenders regarding the setting up of their appeals processes.  Redress and compensation\u00a0are to be paid to impacted customers up front at the point of offer and\u00a0cannot be reduced by virtue of a customer lodging an appeal.  This ensures that a customer&rsquo;s need to receive payment upfront is not a determining factor in deciding whether or not to appeal an offer from a lender.  To assist customers in the consideration of the redress and compensation offers made to them, including whether to make an appeal in respect of the adequacy of the offers, an additional payment is provided to impacted customers at the point of offer to enable them to take professional advice.<\/p><p>Given the key role the appeals process will have in delivering fair outcomes for impacted customers, the Central Bank has also developed and issued guidance to lenders outlining its expectations in respect of the establishment and operation of their appeals processes.  This guidance includes the expectation, mentioned above, that redress and compensation paid to customers at the point of offer cannot be reduced by virtue of those customers lodging an appeal.  This ensures that a customer&rsquo;s need to receive payment up front is not a determining factor in deciding whether or not to appeal an offer.  Further information can be found within the Central Bank&rsquo;s , available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>However, the Central Bank has also advised that, generally speaking, it can only disclose supervisory and regulatory information in a summary or aggregate form so that individual firms cannot be identified.  The Central Bank has further indicated that, due to the fact that only a minority of lenders are at appeals stage at this point, the disclosure of data in relation to appeals at this point could be attributed to individual firms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700073#WRJ06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tracker Mortgage Examination","counter":523,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700073#WRJ06300"},{"type":"question","counter":524,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[47001\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700073#WRJ06400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the range of compensation as a percentage of redress available to persons affected for each of the 15 lenders included in the Central Bank's examination of tracker mortgage-related issues; the minimum and maximum percentage compensation for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":525,"content":"<p>The Central Bank has advised that in accordance with the Tracker Examination Framework, the Central Bank expects that for all impacted customers, lenders&rsquo; redress and compensation offers will restore them to the position they would have been in had the detriment not occurred and that they are appropriately compensated for the detriment suffered.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank expects the majority of the 13,000 impacted customers identified to date under the Examination will receive redress and compensation by year-end.  The Bank has\u00a0also advised that its decisions regarding the groups of customers identified as part of the Examination and disputed by some lenders to date will be issued to lenders by mid-December.  As of end-September, &euro;120m has been paid in redress and compensation to approximately 3,300 impacted borrowers.  This is in addition to redress and compensation provided by permanent tsb plc (&euro;36.8 million) and Springboard Mortgages Limited (&euro;6.2 million) to customers pursuant to their Mortgage Redress Programme (MRP), which was required by the Central Bank and predated the industry wide Examination.  Accordingly from July 2015 to end September 2017, the aggregate figure for redress and compensation to customers arising from the MRP and the Examination is &euro;163 million.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s mandate to ensure that the best interests of consumers are protected,\u00a0the Bank's\u00a0immediate focus is to ensure that lenders prioritise the identification of impacted customers, stop the harm and then provide appropriate redress and compensation in line with the Principles for Redress.  The purpose of redress is to return customers to the position they would have been in had the issue not occurred.  Compensation should be reasonable and reflect the level of detriment suffered by customers.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank\u00a0Framework requires that lenders categorise impacted customers by reference to the type and level of detriment suffered.  The types of detriment identified range from overcharging due to the application of incorrect interest rates up to loss of ownership of mortgaged properties.<\/p>  <p>  The calculation of redress and compensation proposals for customers can be complex.  The Central Bank has challenged all lenders with particular regard to their redress and compensation proposals for loss of ownership customers and as a result lenders have substantially improved their proposals.<\/p>  <p>  Each lender's compensation package is tailored to the specific circumstances of its customer.

The relief takes the form of a 90% reduction in the taxable value of gifted or inherited business property. <\/p>  <p>  In order for business relief to apply, business assets that are the subject of the gift or inheritance must constitute what is defined as &lsquo;relevant business property&rsquo;.  Included in the definition of relevant business property are unincorporated businesses, unquoted shares in certain family companies, and also assets used wholly or mainly for the purposes of a business carried on by a family company or a partnership, but not owned by the company or partnership.

On that basis, there is no legal restriction\u00a0on a lender taking social welfare entitlements or payments into account in their assessment of creditworthiness.\u00a0 However, subject to these provisions and also subject to\u00a0compliance with any other legal or regulatory provision governing the provision of services to consumers, it will ultimately\u00a0be a matter for lenders to determine their own credit policies and to make their own individual credit and\u00a0lending decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700074#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":536,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700074#WRK00800"},{"type":"question","counter":537,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[47025\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700074#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the criteria used by the banks in each of the years 2009 to 2016 and to date in 2017 whereby a hire purchase loan could be sold to vulture funds at a discount; the type of calculation or formula that was used to determine that a loan was impaired and that it could be sold to a third party; if the Central Bank monitored or issued parameters whereby hire purchase loans could be deemed to be impaired and sold to a third party; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":538,"content":"<p>The ability to sell loans to a third party is governed by the original contract between the lender\u00a0and the customer and I do not have the data requested by the Deputy in respect of individual banks. <\/p>  <p>  If a borrower has a difficulty with interpretation by a\u00a0particular lender,\u00a0I should point out that the Financial Services Ombudsman can investigate complaints from individual consumers about the actions of hire purchase firms and I would urge a customer who may have a complaint about such a firm to make a complaint to the FSO if the issue cannot be resolved with the firm concerned.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I understand from the Central Bank that the impairment of any exposure on a Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet is governed by the relevant accounting standard.

Effectively the new Scheme halved the maximum entitlement to paid sick leave previously available, other than in the case of serious illness or injury.<\/p><p>In a situation where sick leave was taken prior to the introduction of the new Scheme it is taken into account in the following way:<\/p><p>Where an individual is out on sick leave their record over the previous four years is examined to determine if they have access to paid sick leave.

Where they do have access to paid sick leave, their record over the last twelve months is examined to determine whether they can receive sick pay at the full or half rate of pay. \u00a0Or where an individual has exhausted access to full or half pay they may have access to a further form payment called Temporary Rehabilitation Remuneration (TRR).<\/p><p>This look back over an individual&rsquo;s sick leave record is not a new concept.\u00a0 It was in place in relation to the calculation of sick leave pay in the old sick leave scheme and has continued under the current scheme.

This would mean that individuals would have access to even greater levels of paid sick leave than they had before the new scheme was introduced.\u00a0 Public servants with a high rate of absenteeism would go back to having access to the full allowance of paid sick leave.

However, in order for a course to be funded it must be established that the course is of benefit to the official concerned in his\/her capacity as a Civil Servant. <\/p><p>Other lines sections that present business cases to the Staff Training Unit at my Department as to the benefits of having staff enrolled on particular courses are funded as they embellish the skill sets of the staff concerned and in turn improve outputs and efficiencies.<\/p><p>In the event a Civil Servant is funded to undertake a third level course of education that leads to an academic qualification a condition of the funding is that the official must remain an employee of the Civil Service for a period of one year in respect of each academic year that the course is funded.  In the event the person concerns resigns as a civil Servant prior to this period coming to pass, the fees concerned must be refunded to the Department. <\/p><p>Under section 9 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan training will be centralised and a new organisation Onelearning was launched earlier this year and commenced operations in September.\u00a0 It is responsible for the provision of learning and development interventions which are common throughout the Civil Service. <\/p><p>I trust the Deputy will appreciate that the question as tabled is rather wide ranging and it would take an inordinate amount of staff time to compile the information as requested.  However, I have included data below on the amount spent and the number of training days undertaken by staff in the respective years. <\/p><p>In the event the Deputy has a concern about a particular aspect of expenditure on staff training he should bring this matter to my attention and I will arrange for officials to forward the information in due course.<table><tr><th>Year <\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>Expenditure <\/b><\/td><td>&euro;441,888.74<\/td><td>&euro;478,266.64<\/td><td>&euro;401,758.20<\/td><td>423,810.82<\/td><td>&euro;369,587.18<\/td><td>&euro;357,005.18<\/td><td>&euro;475,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>No. of training days delivered <\/b><\/td><td>2813 days <\/td><td>2977 days <\/td><td>3024 days<\/td><td>2153 days<\/td><td>2224 days<\/td><td>2431 days<\/td><td>Not yet avail.<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700077#WRN02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Relations Contracts Data","counter":763,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700077#WRN02200"},{"type":"question","counter":764,"qnumday":338,"qnumall":"[46075\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700077#WRN02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the public relations companies or agencies the services of which his Department used for information campaigns since 1 January 2017; and the costs incurred to date in 2017.","asker":"1221","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":765,"content":"<p>Details in relation to public relations services used for information campaigns in 2017 in my Department will not be compiled until early 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700077#WRN02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":766,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700077#WRN02500"},{"type":"question","counter":767,"qnumday":339,"qnumall":"[46092\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700077#WRN02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps he has taken to ensure that grant aided organisations are spending their moneys appropriately in view of the revelations regarding a charity (details supplied) in 2016; if his attention has been drawn to concerns in relation to organisations funded by his Department; if so, the action he has taken; if his Department has issued new procedures regarding the use of credit cards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":768,"content":"<p>Departmental grant funding to bodies is made in compliance with central guidelines, as set out in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Circular number 13 of 2014, \"Management of and Accountability for Grants from Exchequer Funds.\"\u00a0 The aim of these procedures is to ensure that\u00a0there is transparency and accountability in the management of public money having regard to economy, efficiency and effectiveness.\u00a0This circular sets out the full range of obligations which must be met, including oversight arrangements (such as Service Level Agreements),\u00a0financial and performance reporting, inspection and accounting and control arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  My Department seeks regular information from bodies in receipt of Departmental funding in respect of any potential irregularities.\u00a0 Where the Department is made aware of any cases of suspected irregularities, the Comptroller and Auditor General is informed and the Department makes all reasonable efforts to recover\u00a0Exchequer funds where fraud or irregularities have occurred.  \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills has a very strict policy in relation to the use of credit cards.\u00a0 Their use in the Department is restricted to Ministerial Private Secretaries and the Principal Officer responsible for the Department's IT Unit.

More recently, on the 3rd July 2017, the T&aacute;naiste, and Minister for Enterprise and Innovation Frances Fitzgerald TD, and I co-hosted a joint stakeholder dialogue on enterprise skills needs and Brexit. The outputs from these events have been made publicly available. A further joint stakeholder dialogue on research with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is also being planned. <\/p>  <p>  Among the key challenges and risks identified in these consultations are Brexit's likely impact on the future of the Common Travel Area and its implications for students, teachers, academic staff and researchers; mutual recognition of qualifications; our enterprise skills base; UK\/Ireland research collaboration and partnerships between education institutions and enterprise; as well as the implications for EU funding for research and the impact on EU funding programmes such as Horizon2020, PEACE IV and Erasmus+.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  All of these issues are being factored in to my Department&rsquo;s overall approach to future discussions and negotiations and our input to Government's preparations for EU-UK negotiations including the finalisation of our sectoral response plan.

Section 37 of the Education Act 1998 provides the statutory basis\u00a0for Education Support Centres and outlines the policy framework underpinning their recognition and functions, funding, staffing\u00a0and governance.  The Act\u00a0empowers me as Minister to make regulations relating to the operation of centres including the appointment and remuneration of staff which includes the post of director.<\/p>  <p>  The regulations I recently promulgated under Section 37(6) of the Education Act underpins my Department's policy for the secondment of\u00a0teachers to\u00a0Education Support Centres.  These regulations comply with relevant legal and policy requirements.  Accordingly, there are no plans to change the approach.<\/p>  <p>  By way of background, my Department\u00a0arranges for the secondment of teachers from their teaching posts for the purpose of developing and providing CPD for teachers and for the appointment as Directors of Education Support Centres (ESC's).  Secondments are a temporary arrangement renewable on a year to year basis.  While on secondment, teachers retain their school post, the terms and conditions that apply to teachers and receive their salary and a secondment allowance which are met in full by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  In 2010, as part of the rationalisation of\u00a0the\u00a0Departments support services announced in the Budget by the then Minister for Finance Mr. Brian Lenihan T.D., a new policy of secondment was negotiated with the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform (DPER).  The policy sanctioned a new limit on secondment numbers and established an upper limit of 5 years on the length of a secondment, following which the Directors return to their posts either as a teacher or an inspector. <\/p>  <p>  There are many benefits from the revised policy for teachers, their boards of management and the system as a whole.

There are widespread, credible reports of human rights abuses by the Myanmar security forces against the minority Rohingya people and around 600,000 refugees, mostly Rohingya, have fled to neighbouring countries, primarily Bangladesh.<\/p>  <p>  The situation in Rakhine State has received considerable attention from the international community since this recent outbreak of violence.  This has included discussions by the UN Security Council and UN Human Rights Council in recent months.  During the HRC&rsquo;s September session, the mandate of the UN Fact Finding Mission established earlier this year was extended and it will now examine allegations of human rights violations by the Myanmar security forces since August 2017.  The EU has engaged in discussions in these fora and as well as bilaterally with the Government of Myanmar to stress the need to bring an end to the violence, to restore humanitarian and media access, to carry out an independent investigation of human rights abuses and to enable the safe and voluntary return of refugees.<\/p>  <p>  The international response to the crisis has also sought to alleviate suffering and meet the immediate humanitarian needs of people displaced by violence in Rakhine State, especially those now in Bangladesh.  The UN&rsquo;s revised response plan for Bangladesh anticipates a humanitarian funding need of US $434 million over the next five months.  To this end a Pledging Conference for the Rohingya Refugee Crisis was held in Geneva on 23 October, co-hosted by Kuwait and the EU, where Ireland pledged &euro;2m in direct support.<\/p>  <p>  In spite of the efforts of the international community to date, it remains clear that the situation has not improved significantly in Rakhine State, notably that humanitarian aid and media access to Rakhine State remain restricted and that refugees continue to arrive in Bangladesh.  In this regard, Ireland will continue to press for international engagement on this issue, in line with the EU&rsquo;s position which was elaborated in Conclusions adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council on 16 October.  The Conclusions furthermore announced the suspension of invitations for all senior military officers from Myanmar, reaffirmed the EU arms embargo, and indicated that the Council may consider additional measures if the situation does not improve.<\/p>  <p>  To bring about sustainable peace, long standing drivers of tensions between the Buddhist majority and the Muslim Rohingya communities of Rakhine State must be resolved.  The report of the Kofi Annan-led Advisory Commission provides a roadmap for peace building and development. Ireland, along with our partners in the international community, will continue to press for the full and swift implementation of the recommendations contained within this report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700081#WRR05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Properties","counter":1061,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700081#WRR05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1062,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[45972\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700081#WRR06000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the estimated cost of the provision of a defibrillator in each public building owned by his Department and agency under the aegis of his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1063,"content":"<p>My Department occupies 12 buildings in Ireland which are provided by the Office of Public Works.

Work at Cabinet level is being prepared through cross-Departmental coordination structures. These represent a frequent and active channel through which all relevant Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s wider response to Brexit, including its priorities for the ongoing Article 50 negotiations between the EU and the UK. <\/p>  <p>  As the outcome of the negotiations is not yet known, an important focus of the planning and preparation being undertaken through these structures is on deepening the Government&rsquo;s analysis and understanding of the exact consequences of a range of different possible scenarios, including one in which no Withdrawal Agreement is concluded. This represents an intensification of efforts to build on the Government&lsquo;s previous contingency planning.  <\/p>  <p>  Aside from its wider co-ordination responsibilities, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has lead responsibility for planning for, preparing positions on, and following the EU-UK negotiations. This requires research on and analysis of very many legal, institutional, and political issues, the eventual outcome of negotiations on which will of course be decisive in determining the shape and effects of Brexit.  This work is led by the European Union Division in co-operation with the Ireland and United Kingdom and Americas Division, the Legal Division, the Political Division and the Trade Division. Our Permanent Representation in Brussels, and our Embassies in all Member States, send in a constant stream of reports describing and analysing the concerns and priorities of the EU Institutions and our partners.<\/p>  <p>  This work is reflected in the Government&rsquo;s policy positions and public statements but it would not be helpful or appropriate to publish detailed material which is heavily informed by confidential discussions with other Member States and the EU Institutions. <\/p>  <p>  The Department is also analysing the possible impact of Brexit on policy areas within its remit, notably the EU&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy and the EU&rsquo;s policy on international development.<\/p>  <p>  We have already seen the implications that Brexit has had for our consular and passport services. There has been a marked increase in demand for passports and citizenship via foreign birth registration from applicants in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. In this regard, the Passport Service in Dublin, Cork and London as well as Consular Division have recruited a number of additional temporary and full-time officers to meet increased Passport and Foreign Birth Registration demands including increased demand as a result of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also works closely with the European Commission and European Parliament Offices here in Dublin and with civil society organisations including the Institute for International and European Affairs and European Movement Ireland.

I wish, first of all, to extend to the family of Mr. Jair Cort&eacute;s, as well as to all of those affected by the recent incidents of violence in this region, my sincere sympathies and condolences.<\/p>  <p>  Incidences of violence and intimidation against local communities in marginalised rural areas of Colombia, notably among Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities, as well as the continued presence of armed groups in such communities, remain a matter of great concern, as evident from the views expressed by the local community council and referred to by the Deputy. <\/p>  <p>  Tumaco is among the regions of Colombia which has suffered most consequences of the country&rsquo;s conflict.  It is important that the programme of forced eradication of coca crops in this and other regions is carried out with due regard for the rights and well-being of the local communities.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad of this opportunity to reiterate that such violence is entirely unacceptable.  I urge the Government of Colombia to ensure that these incidents are thoroughly investigated and their perpetrators brought to justice.  <\/p>  <p>  The governor of the Nari&ntilde;o Department has issued a statement condemning the killing of Mr. Jair Cort&eacute;s and calling for a full investigation into his death, and I would support that call. <\/p>  <p>  I note also that the President of Colombia has instructed the National Police and the Colombian Armed Forces to cooperate with the Colombian DPP to determine what occurred in the incident of 5 October, and that the Colombian National Police has ordered the suspension of four of its officers in connection with that incident. <\/p>  <p>  I welcome these statements as a sign of the resolve of the Colombian authorities to address this deplorable violence.    The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has an ongoing commitment to supporting peace and human rights in the most affected areas of Colombia and officials from my Department visited Nari&ntilde;o in 2015 and 2016.  As well as ongoing exchanges with the Colombian authorities at Government level, officials of my Department engage regularly with human rights defenders and civil society leaders active across Colombia, including those working in some of the communities most affected by conflict.  <\/p>  <p>  The recent acts of violence in Tumaco are a cause for great concern.  At the same time, however, we must acknowledge the strides which have been made in the implementation of the peace process in Colombia to date.  The full decommissioning of FARC weapons was completed by July 2017, eight months after the agreement was finalised.  A cease-fire with the country&rsquo;s second largest guerrilla group, the ELN, took effect at the beginning of October.  The peace process provides the framework in which the endemic violence and impunity which has afflicted Colombian society for decades can successfully be addressed.  Ireland is committed to supporting its full implementation to ensure a future of peace for all Colombians.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700082#WRS02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":1097,"qnumday":461,"qnumall":"[46441\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700082#WRS03000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has discussed the civil war in Yemen with that country&rsquo;s diplomatic representatives; if he has discussed it at European level; and the measures he will take on this issue.","asker":"1242","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1098,"content":"<p>I am extremely concerned about the current situation in Yemen, in particular as the humanitarian crisis continues to deteriorate. The war has entered into its third year, the political process has stalled, and fighting is continuing, with increasingly devastating consequences for the civilian population. Meanwhile, the country is on the brink of famine and is facing the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing cholera epidemic.  EU Foreign Ministers last discussed the situation in Yemen at the Foreign Affairs Council in April. The Council called on the parties to start negotiating a peace agreement, and committed to increasing its engagement with Yemen once a political solution to the conflict is agreed. The EU is the largest humanitarian donor to Yemen and has provided over &euro;170 million in humanitarian aid since the conflict began, to which Ireland contributes via the EU Development Budget.   Ireland has also worked in the UN system to address the human rights situation in Yemen. At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, Ireland was part of a small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption of a Resolution on Yemen. This Resolution established a group of international experts to examine allegations of human rights violations of human rights during the conflict, and to report back to the UN Human Rights Council next year. This investigation is an important step towards accountability in Yemen, and will help establish the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground. <\/p>  <p>  Although Ireland has diplomatic relations with Yemen, there is no resident Embassy in Dublin to allow for regular contact. However, Ireland has shown support for the Yemeni people through our significant contributions of humanitarian aid, amounting to over &euro;10 million since the conflict began in 2015. This includes humanitarian funding of &euro;4 million announced by Minister of State McHugh at the High-Level Pledging Event for the Humanitarian Crisis in Yemen, held in Geneva in April 2017. Ireland is the sixth largest contributor to the UN Humanitarian Fund for Yemen since the outbreak of the conflict.<\/p>  <p>  There can be no military solution to the conflict in Yemen. The only way to improve the situation for the Yemeni people is through peaceful resolution of the conflict. Ireland supports the efforts of UN Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed and his team, who are working towards a peace agreement that is acceptable to all parties to the conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700082#WRS03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Advisers","counter":1099,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700082#WRS03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1100,"qnumday":462,"qnumall":"[46469\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700082#WRS03300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the names of the special advisers employed in his Department; the names of special advisers to junior Ministers in his Department; the annual salary of each adviser; if these persons were special advisers immediately prior to taking up their current role or immediately prior to the June 2017 Cabinet reshuffle; if so, the Minister to which they were appointed to; the date each special adviser was appointed with effect as stated in the Government order; the date of the Government order; if they received a salary for the period before the appointment order was signed in the case of special advisers whose appointment order date has an effect date earlier than the order date; if so, by whom they were paid; if a special adviser during a period later backdated by appointment order had access to confidential material and-or Cabinet papers; if they were subject to the Official Secrets Act 1963 during this period; if any persons currently employed as special advisers have not yet been appointed by order since the Cabinet reshuffle of 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1101,"content":"<p>There are currently two Special Advisors employed by my Department; the Special Advisor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Special Adviser to the Minister of State for European Affairs.

It is encouraging to note that since the launch of Operation Thor in late 2015, the CSO burglary figures have shown a significant 30% decrease in burglary for the twelve months of 2016 when compared to 2015.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Operation Thor involves a broad range of activities to tackle organised crime gangs and other prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. This comprehensive operation is supported by the enhanced Government investment in Garda resources, including an allocation of almost &euro;100 million for Garda overtime in 2017. We have also invested heavily in the Garda fleet, with over 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015 and a provision of &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles under the Capital Plan 2016-2021. <\/p><p>These additional investments in policing make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting of burglaries and related crime via Operation Thor.<\/p><p>I am further informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that a number of Days of Action, in conjunction with the retail communities, were organised throughout the Dublin Metropolitan Region in June and July 2017 to reduce the threat of criminality in shops and retail outlets within the Division and, ultimately, to reduce losses occurring in those businesses as a result of thefts and other criminal activities.  Data provided through the analysis of crime trends and the identification of recidivist criminals, to ensure intelligent policing based on evidence-based analytics, was utilised to guide, inform and formulate the operation. <\/p><p>Under Operation Thor we have seen over 87,060 targeted checkpoints and 65,960 crime prevention patrols nationwide. This concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 6,060 arrests and 6,700 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences. <\/p><p>I am further advised that initiatives for the winter months will include:<\/p><p>- Planned Days of Action around targets and areas as predicated by crime trends and analysis provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service (GSAS) in the DMR, and as approved by local District Officers;<\/p><p>- Covert and Overt policing initiatives;<\/p><p>- Crime Prevention days at locations identified for high-volume through-put, including shopping centres, public transport hubs and termini and other suitable, highly visible locations;<\/p><p>- High visibility patrols by foot and mountain-bike personnel;<\/p><p>- High visibility Public-Order patrols, again in areas identified through crime trends and analysis conducted by the DMR GSAS personnel, in consultation and conjunction with local Garda Management;<\/p><p>- Planned and random patrols and checkpoints in order to disrupt criminal activity and to deprive the roads network to criminals and others.<\/p><p>This Government has also made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b><\/b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary. This new legislation is now available to support the work which is being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities. This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders and other stakeholders. There are a range of partnership initiatives which have been established between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the retail sector and important rural-based organisations such as the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na Tire and other rural community organisations. These include the well established Community Alert Programme, which receives annual funding from my Department, as well as the work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme. <\/p><p>Furthermore, I was pleased to recently announce that an additional &euro;100,000 was being made available to Text Alert Groups, registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to provide modest financial assistance with the running costs they incur each year.  This Text Alert Rebate Scheme will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and Groups wishing to participate in the Scheme can find more details at www.muintiir.ie. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country. <\/p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this  Government's vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.<\/p><p>Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700082#WRS07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":1139,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700083#WRT00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1140,"qnumday":476,"qnumall":"[45744\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700083#WRT00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the plans he and the Garda Commissioner have to locate a new Garda station in Clonburris in which the SDZ plan is being developed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1141,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the allocation of Garda resources in the State and, in the context of Garda stations, the Garda authorities work in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.

There are also 6 Garda Reserves and 32 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  <\/p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 20 of whom have been assigned to the Clare Division.  In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.  <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this Government&rsquo;s vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  <\/p><p>I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.

The Bill, as proposed, will update all existing laws on the regulation and licensing of gambling activities, including betting and gaming.  The Scheme does not include the National Lottery whose activities are separately regulated under the National Lotteries Act 2013.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Having been given special responsibility in this area, I am working to ensure that legislation providing for the regulation of the gambling sector can be published at the earliest opportunity.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the specific point raised by the Deputy, the new legislation to regulate the gambling sector will have consumer protection generally as one of its core principles, and it will include necessary measures aimed at assisting and protecting vulnerable persons, including young persons and children.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  For example, the Bill will include prohibitions on the employment of young persons in the industry, they will not be permitted to participate in gambling and there will be arrangements for age verification checks by licence holders.  The regulatory body proposed in the legislation will have an inspection role to ensure compliance by licence holders with the terms of their licence and with the new legislation generally.  In addition, restrictions are proposed on advertising, promoting and sponsoring of events by licence holders to ensure that these activities should not be targeted at young people.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that such restrictions need to be carefully thought through to prevent unintended consequences.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme also proposes the establishment of a Fund to aid research, education and awareness activities.  The Fund will be based on contributions from the industry, but the proposals will ensure independent supervision of the disbursement of monies collected. I would envisage educational efforts with regard to gambling will be directed towards young people.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I should mention, that the Civil Law and Courts (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017, now under preparation, will impose a standard age of 18 years for participation in gambling activities.  In recognition of that, Tote Ireland recently announced that it has implemented this age limit from 1 October.  Previously no age limit applied to betting on the Tote.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700083#WRT02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":1162,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700083#WRT02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1163,"qnumday":485,"qnumall":"[45786\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700083#WRT02750","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if persons are obligated to report a suspected crime to their nearest Garda station regardless of the opening hours of that station..

The Act's\u00a0definition of mediation\u00a0states that mediation means a confidential, facilitative and voluntary process in which parties to a dispute, with the assistance of a mediator, attempt to reach a mutually acceptable agreement to resolve the dispute.  It would\u00a0not be appropriate, therefore, to make mediation compulsory in family mediation cases.  <\/p>  <p>  I should point out, however, that section 23 of the\u00a0Act provides for\u00a0delivery of a\u00a0scheme of\u00a0mediation information sessions for those\u00a0involved in family law disputes.  The intention is to promote and explain the benefits of mediation as an alternative to court proceedings for the resolution of such disputes.\u00a0However, it will remain a matter for the parties themselves to decide whether to use mediation or commence legal proceedings.  <\/p>  <p>  As regards\u00a0the level of uptake of mediation\u00a0in family law cases in this jurisdiction, the position is that\u00a0the Legal Aid Board became responsible for the provision of the State-funded family mediation services in November 2011 following the enactment of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011.  State funded services have been available since 1986.  <\/p>  <p>  Family mediation is a free, confidential service in which a professional mediator assists those involved in family law cases,\u00a0in particular separating or divorcing couples,\u00a0to negotiate the terms of their separation or divorce.  It also assists same sex couples as well as\u00a0couples who have never lived together\u00a0but have a child.  The Board operates on a number of levels, through its general mediation offices, through dedicated court-based projects and through the provision of mediation information sessions at 3 locations.  <\/p>  <p>  The latest data\u00a0from the Legal Aid Board in relation to the Family Mediation Service indicate that\u00a0the total number of couples in mediation in 2016 was 2,249, of which 1,390 couples reached agreement and a further 547 couples were continuing in mediation at end 2016.  Of the 1,702 concluded mediations, the success rate was in the order of 82%.  I am not, however, in a position to provide comparable data in respect of\u00a0other jurisdictions.  <\/p>  <p>  As regards the role of experts in private family law proceedings, the position is that\u00a0section 47 of the Family Law Act 1995 provides that a court may, of its own motion or on application to it in that behalf by a party to the proceedings, order a report in writing on any question affecting the welfare of a party to the proceedings or any other person to whom they relate.  The Court in question is the Circuit Court or the High Court.  <\/p>  <p>  The power under section 47 of the 1995\u00a0Act\u00a0to order a report lies with the Court.  As the Deputy is aware, the Courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and the conduct of any family law case is a matter for the presiding judge.  <\/p>  <p>  The qualifications of experts appointed under section 47 are determined by the issues of concern in the cases\u00a0concerned.  There are no regulations that require experts to hold specific qualifications, but those\u00a0engaged in this process are usually qualified and practising psychologists or psychiatrists, depending on the issues involved.  Experts appointed under section 47 are required to act in accordance with the standards and codes of conduct of their professional bodies.  <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 contains new provisions regarding the best interests of children which have been in operation since 18 January 2016.  One of the Act&rsquo;s important reforms is to facilitate the hearing of the voice of the child in any court proceedings where the guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child is in question.  Section 63 of the Act inserted a new section 32 into the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 which provides the court with the option to seek a written expert report on the welfare of the child. Section 32 also enables the court to appoint an expert to determine and convey the child&rsquo;s views to the court, so that the child&rsquo;s voice can be heard in the proceedings.  These provisions allow the courts to take account of the evolving capacity of children, and give them the flexibility to ensure that all children&rsquo;s views can be heard.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, is currently finalising\u00a0regulations under section 32(10).  These regulations will specify the necessary qualifications and experience of child&rsquo;s views experts appointed in private family law proceedings and the fees and expenses that may be charged by such experts.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700083#WRT05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":1188,"qnumday":494,"qnumall":"[45872\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700083#WRT05300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on the notion that practising lawyers and solicitors must have achieved an academic specialism, not just certificates in continuous special development, in child and family matters before undertaking cases related to family law; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1311","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1189,"content":"<p>The issue of how solicitors and barristers engage in the course of family law cases is, as conveyed by the Deputy&rsquo;s Question, a matter of delicate balance in terms of best representing the interests of the respective parties to the proceedings concerned, some of whom will be minors.  It is also an inherent part of the administration of justice under which the lawyers concerned have certain duties to the courts as well as to their clients.  In that capacity they are also obliged, in exercising their right of audience before the courts, to adhere to the professional principles and to act with independence and integrity.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may also be aware, the area of Family Law is covered extensively in the university law degree courses and also in the professional qualification processes for both barristers and solicitors.  To this extent those receiving their parchments as solicitors or those being called to the Bar will have arrived at that point having already had very substantial academic, theoretical and practical grounding in family law matters.  Thereafter, the practice requirement for people who choose to specialise in the family area would be for continuous professional development in relation to family law matters and ongoing awareness of the relevant developments in case law at the various court jurisdiction levels.  <\/p>  <p>  At the same time this framework does not prevent a person with an academic background in child and family matters, for instance, from acquiring the necessary qualifications to become a specialist legal practitioner.  This is evidenced by the number of legal practitioners from a variety of academic backgrounds who specialise in various areas of the law including, as raised by the Deputy, in family law, and who enjoy a high reputation in that regard.  In so far as judicial proceedings in family cases will be concerned, a knowledge of family law will always be essential to ensuring that the best interests of clients are represented.  While I appreciate the sensitivities behind the Deputy&rsquo;s Question, therefore, I would at the same time be cautious about taking an overly prescriptive approach from either a purely academic or a purely legal perspective in this regard.  <\/p>  <p>  At the same time, I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the Government&rsquo;s ongoing working commitment to significant reform of the courts, including the establishment of a family law court structure that is streamlined, more efficient, and less costly.  Consequently, my Department is working on the General Scheme of a Family Court Bill which will aim to streamline family law court processes, clarify jurisdictional issues and provide for a set of guiding principles to help ensure that the Family Court will operate in a user-friendly and efficient manner.  My Department is also engaged in further consultations with stakeholders in relation to the operational aspects of a new family court structure.  The intention is to establish a dedicated Family Court within the existing court structures.  The proposed General Scheme, for which I hope to secure Government approval in the coming months, will also support the proposals in the Mediation Act 2017 by encouraging greater use of alternative dispute resolution to assist in the more timely resolution of family law cases. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700083#WRT05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates","counter":1190,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700083#WRT05500"},{"type":"question","counter":1191,"qnumday":495,"qnumall":"[45907\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700083#WRT05600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the concerns expressed by quarry owners regrading the current review of commercial rates and valuations and the adverse effect this will have on the cost of doing business and the construction industry; if the methodology being used to calculate the valuations will be reassessed in view of complaints received; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1248","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1192,"content":"<p>The Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 provide for the valuation of all commercial and industrial property for rating purposes.  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in decisions made in this regard.  As the Deputy will be aware, under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates.  The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors.  This has been the policy of successive governments for many years and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme now being rolled out by the Valuation Office.  To this end, the Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect relative changes and differential movements in property values arising from evolving economic factors and changes in the local business environment over time.  The Valuation Office is currently carrying out an extensive series of revaluations, the immediate objective of which is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years is conducted across the country, as soon as possible, and on a phased basis.  This is a welcome and positive development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made to date.  Revaluation is an important instrument in addressing historical anomalies in relation to commercial rates for both urban and rural properties and between particular classes of property within a local authority area.  <\/p>  <p>  In September, as part of the phase of the programme known as \"REVAL 2017\",final Valuation Certificates were sent to all ratepayers in the rating authority areas of Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Longford, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, South Dublin, and Westmeath County Councils.  The valuations will be used to calculate the rates charged in 2018 and subsequent years.  Work has recently commenced on the revaluation of all rateable properties in the rating authority areas of Cavan, Fingal, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow County Councils.  <\/p>  <p>  Where the Valuation Office proposes to enter a new valuation or amend an existing valuation on a Valuation List, there is an extensive process available to cater for ratepayers who may be dissatisfied with the proposed valuation they receive from the Valuation Office.  A dissatisfied person can, in the first instance, make representations to the Valuation Office within 40 days of the date of the issue of the proposed valuation certificate.  The Valuation Office considers any such representations and, based on the evidence and material provided by the ratepayer or his or her agent, may or may not change the proposed valuation depending on the circumstances of each individual property.  If any ratepayer is still dissatisfied with the final valuation to be placed on their property following consideration of the representations, they have a right to lodge a formal appeal with the Valuation Tribunal within 28 days of the publication of a new valuation list in the case of a revaluation and within 28 days of the of the final valuation in the case of a revision.  The Tribunal is an independent statutory body established for the purpose of hearing appeals against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s particular enquiry in relation to quarries, I am informed that the revaluation of such properties are conducted according to the same basis of valuation as all other classes of rateable property, as prescribed by part 11 of the Valuation Act 2001, as amended.  This requires the Valuation Office to determine the Net Annual Value of the property, as defined in section 48, and by reference to a particular valuation date.  I am informed by the Commissioner of Valuation that, in accordance with well established international valuation principles and best professional practice, and in keeping with the case law of the Valuation Tribunal and the jurisprudence of the Higher Courts, various methodologies may be used in estimating the net annual value of a property or class of properties for the purposes of section 48.  I am also informed that the valuations placed on all quarries as part of REVAL 2017 programme, as outlined above, have been arrived at using established valuation practice that was deployed previously in the revaluation of quarries in Waterford, Limerick and Dublin and which is in accordance with the findings of the Supreme Court in the recent case of Kilsaran Concrete &ndash;v- Commissioner of Valuation [2016] IESC 61.  Accordingly, there are no plans at present to reassess the methodology used to determine the rateable valuation of quarries under the National Revaluation Programme.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700083#WRT05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":1193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700083#WRT05800"},{"type":"question","counter":1194,"qnumday":496,"qnumall":"[45930\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700083#WRT05900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress to date in the determination of an application for stamp 4 in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1195,"content":"<p>I am advised\u00a0by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department\u00a0that the person concerned applied for\u00a0a residence permission and\u00a0a right to work based on their parentage of an Irish citizen child.\u00a0A decision letter issued to this person on 26 April 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The operation involves a broad range of activities to tackle organised crime gangs and other prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. This comprehensive operation is supported by the enhanced Government investment in Garda resources, including an allocation of almost &euro;100 million for Garda overtime in 2017. We have also invested heavily in the Garda fleet, with over 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015 and a provision of &euro;46 million for continuing to purchase new Garda vehicles over the years 2016-2021. <\/p><p>These additional investments in policing make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting of burglaries and related crime via Operation Thor. <\/p><p>Under Operation Thor An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has undertaken 87,060 targeted checkpoints and 65,960 crime prevention patrols nationwide. This concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 6,060 arrests and 6,700 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences. <\/p><p>The success of the Garda measures to tackle burglary being implemented through Operation Thor is borne out by latest available CSO crime figures which show a very significant decline in property related crime. It is encouraging to note that since the launch of Operation Thor in late 2015, the CSO burglary figures showed a significant 30% decrease in burglary for the twelve months of 2016 when compared to 2015. Indeed, burglary figures for Sligo\/Leitrim and Donegal Divisions show decreases in burglary of 33%, which is just above the national average of 30%.<\/p><p>This Government has also made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b><\/b>2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary. This new legislation is now available to support the work which is being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities. This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations. <\/p><p>There are a range of partnership initiatives which have been established between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and important rural-based organisations such as the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na T&iacute;re and other rural community organisations. These include the very effective Community Alert Programme, which receives annual funding from my Department, as well as the work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme. <\/p><p>Furthermore, I was pleased to recently announce that an additional &euro;100,000 was being made available to Text Alert Groups, registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to provide modest financial assistance with the running costs they incur each year.  This Text Alert Rebate Scheme will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and Groups wishing to participate in the Scheme can find more details at www.muintir.ie. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country. <\/p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress on achieving this Government's vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.<\/p><p>Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. In addition, there are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700087#WRX01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":1421,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700087#WRX01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Development Projects","counter":1420,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700087#WRX01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1421,"qnumday":575,"qnumall":"[45790\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700087#WRX01200","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"her plans to utilise the site and property of the old Dingle hospital to develop an innovation hub for Dingle and west County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1422,"content":"<p>I have been informed by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta that the site\/property referred to by the Deputy is owned by the HSE and comprises a building of over 2,500 square metres which is registered as a protected structure and which is situated on a 21.53 acre site.<\/p>  <p>  In recent months a local development group, Mol Teic, has engaged with the HSE with a view to ensuring that this important part of the local community infrastructure can be redeveloped with the support of the relevant public authorities and development agencies.

The next report is due in 2019. <\/p><p>The 2013 report stated that the Hare is found throughout the country from coastal habitats to upland heath and bog. Hares in Ireland are more abundant in lowland, farmland habitat, while upland areas support lower densities of the species. As a result, changes in agricultural practice can have a significant impact on hare populations. <\/p><p>The hare is widespread and common in Ireland with a broad habitat niche.

Following from this report the Health Service Executive established an Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Steering Group early this year.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of this project is to improve survival rates for those who suffer an out of hospital cardiac arrest through the development and implementation of an out of hospital cardiac arrest strategy.  This work will support the National Ambulance Service (NAS) and Community First Responder Ireland (CFR Ireland) in their commitment to improve clinical outcomes for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA). <\/p>  <p>  Both the NAS and CFR Ireland are working with other partners to enable a sustainable response to such events.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE National Community First Responder framework for Ireland declared that CFRs offer a valuable and complementary resource to emergency ambulance provision, positively impacts NAS response time and achieves improved survival for OHCA. It demonstrated how the NAS and CFR Ireland intend to consolidate, enhance and implement further CFR schemes over the next five years through a National Community First Responder Framework.  Its ambitions over the next few years include increasing the availability of training in CPR in schools, work places and local groups and making Public Access Defibrillators more easily accessible with people knowing how to use them. It also aims to:<\/p>  <p>  - Work in partnership with all relevant organisations (statutory, voluntary, community and private sectors) to increase the availability of Public Access Defibrillators;<\/p>  <p>  - Put in place effective arrangements to ensure that Public Access Defibrillators are mapped, maintained and accessible to the public; and<\/p>  <p>  - Commence a public awareness campaign to increase the level of provision of CFR Schemes in geographical areas of priority.<\/p>  <p>  And so one of the means to help improve outcomes in this area is CFR groups. These are people from local communities who are trained in basic life support and the use of defibrillators that attend a potentially life threatening emergency in their area.  They are then able to provide an early intervention in situations such as heart attack or cardiac arrest by providing, among other things, resuscitation and defibrillation.<\/p>  <p>  Cardiac First Responders (CFR) Ireland, launched in 2015, is the national umbrella organisation for Community First Responders Groups. CFR Ireland works with the National Ambulance Service, Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council and the Centre for Emergency Medical Science UCD.  Both the NAS and CFR Ireland currently support over 145 Community First Responder schemes throughout Ireland, who train community members to provide emergency care support.<\/p>  <p>  If an emergency 999\/112 call for cardiac arrest, choking, chest pain or breathing difficulties is made to the National Ambulance Service in an area where a CFR group is established, the on-duty CFR member gets a text from the National Ambulance Service at the same time that an ambulance is despatched with location and call details.  The First Responder then goes straight to the scene and administers initial care (defibrillation if required) until the National Ambulance Service Emergency resources arrive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700088#WRY05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Fluoridation","counter":1529,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700088#WRY05200"},{"type":"question","counter":1530,"qnumday":614,"qnumall":"[46186\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700088#WRY05300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to a study published in October 2017 in a journal (details supplied), his plans to review the fluoridation of drinking water policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1531,"content":"<p>The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, advises the Minister on all aspects of fluoride.

This is used to complete the Financial Assessment by the HSE which assesses the person&rsquo;s contribution to care and his\/her corresponding level of financial assistance (&ldquo;State Support&rdquo;).  The Financial Assessment takes account of a person&rsquo;s income and assets in order to determine the person&rsquo;s contribution to their care. <\/p><p><b>-  Step 3<\/b>is the decision to approve financial support for the applicant under the scheme. <\/p><p>The Nursing Home Loan (Ancillary State Support) is an optional benefit of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, the purpose of which is to ensure that a person does not have to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for long-term nursing home care.  Where a person&rsquo;s assets include land and property in the State, the contribution based on such assets (7.5% of the value of such assets per annum) may be deferred.  The loan can be repaid at any time but will ultimately fall due for repayment upon the applicant&rsquo;s death. <\/p><p>Applicants to the scheme can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home.  However, in order for financial support to be provided, the nursing home must have an available bed and be able to cater for the applicant's particular need.  The HSE's Nursing Homes Support Offices can advise an applicant or their family on the options available to them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700089#WRZ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Suicide Prevention","counter":1567,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700089#WRZ02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1568,"qnumday":626,"qnumall":"[45653\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700089#WRZ02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if all front-line staff working the public health system and related voluntary agencies receive suicide prevention training such as the HSE's SafeTALK suicide alertness for everyone half-day training programme or its equivalent;

However, on 1 December, 2016, which was the date on which the final payment was made by my Department under the Scheme, it transpired that only &euro;214,965.88 in payments had been outstanding.  <\/p><p>The payments made between the date of receipt by me of Judge Clark's report (19 October, 2016) and the date on which the final payment relating to the Scheme was made, (1 December, 2016) and also the overall total amount paid under the Scheme to each payee, are set out in the table:<table><tr><th><b>Date<\/b><\/th><th><b>Amount paid after receipt of Judge Clark's report  &euro;<\/b><\/th><th><b>Payee<\/b><\/th><th><b>Total amount paid to payee under the Scheme 2014 -2016  &euro;<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>20-10-16<\/td><td>5,943.37 <\/td><td>Judge Clark, Assessor<\/td><td>316,272.19 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>26-10-16<\/td><td>704.04 <\/td><td>Viking Direct Ltd<br \/><br \/>(office requirements)<\/td><td>2,837.66 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>26-10-16<\/td><td>4,305.00 <\/td><td>MacGeehin Toale Solicitors (Applicants' Solicitor)<\/td><td>1,098,400.29 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>26-10-16<\/td><td>1,458.33 <\/td><td>Health Service Executive <br \/><br \/>(Rental of office) <\/td><td>23,333.28 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>02-11-16<\/td><td>10,700.00 <\/td><td>Dr. Leo Lawler<br \/><br \/>(Clinical Advice) <\/td><td>58,950.00 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>02-11-16<\/td><td>1,230.00 <\/td><td>Dr Barry O'Reilly<br \/><br \/>(Clinical Advice) <\/td><td>1,230.00 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>02-11-16<\/td><td>250.00 <\/td><td>Dr Mary Kearney<br \/><br \/>(Clinical Advice)<\/td><td>250.00 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>03-11-16<\/td><td>3,396.21 <\/td><td>Judge Clark, Assessor<\/td><td>316,272.19 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>09-11-16<\/td><td>250.46 <\/td><td>Electric Ireland<\/td><td>3,059.83 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9-11-16<\/td><td>1,500.00<\/td><td>Dr James Cashman<br \/><br \/>(Clinical Advice) <\/td><td>1,500.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>09-11-16<\/td><td>153.23 <\/td><td>Bryan S.Ryan Ltd<\/td><td>153.23 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>09-11-16<\/td><td>204.30 <\/td><td>Judge Clark, Assessor<\/td><td>316,272.19 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16-11-16<\/td><td>27,521.25 <\/td><td>Donal McGuinness, BL<\/td><td>158,817.60 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16-11-16<\/td><td>44,212.35 <\/td><td>Rebecca Broderick, BL<\/td><td>187,538.11 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16-11-16<\/td><td>110,392.25 <\/td><td>Denise Brett  BL<\/td><td>415,808.45 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16-11-16<\/td><td>1,458.33 <\/td><td>Health Service Executive<br \/><br \/>(Rental of office)<\/td><td>23,333.28 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16-11-16<\/td><td>861.00<\/td><td>MacGeehin Toale Solicitors<br \/><br \/>Applicants' Solicitor) <\/td><td>1,098,400.29<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16-11-16<\/td><td>200.00 <\/td><td>Dr Leo Lawler<br \/><br \/>(Clinical Advice)<\/td><td>58,950.00 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>23-11-16<\/td><td>160.62 <\/td><td>Eir<\/td><td>4,719.55 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>01-12-16<\/td><td>65.14 <\/td><td>Bord Gais<\/td><td>706.07 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700089#WRZ03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Administration","counter":1583,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700089#WRZ04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1584,"qnumday":632,"qnumall":"[45672\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700089#WRZ04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the details of efforts being made to minimise, in so far as possible, the number of \"did not attends\" in respect of scheduled outpatient hospital appointments across the health service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1585,"content":"<p>In order to ensure that outpatient services are used to best effect, it is important that the HSE progresses initiatives to reduce the number of people not presenting for outpatient appointments.

Regional co-ordinators have been appointed to assist individuals by providing advice, information and access to local services.<\/p>  <p>  The ex-gratia health supports include clinical care pathways to ensure access to diagnosis and treatment, multi-disciplinary assessments led by clinical experts, counselling services for both the individuals and their families, discretionary medical cards for those who have been diagnosed have been provided to allow unlimited access to GP care and any prescribed medication, ex-gratia reimbursement of vouched expenses incurred in the process of diagnosis and treatment, including travel expenses for attending medical appointments; physiotherapy, occupational therapy assessments, dental  assessments and dietary services all on a needs basis.   <\/p>  <p>  The development of a national service for patients with all forms of narcolepsy in adults, and in children transitioning from paediatric services, in St James Hospital is being prioritised in the 2018 Estimates process.  In the interim, the HSE will continue to pay for access to services, such as dietician and psychology services, that would have been provided in the Centre of Excellence from private providers to so that none of the affected individuals miss out on receiving these supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700089#WRZ06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Suicide Prevention","counter":1605,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700089#WRZ06300"},{"type":"question","counter":1606,"qnumday":640,"qnumall":"[45731\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700089#WRZ06400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures he will take to reduce the level of suicide and mental health problems in the Traveller community in view of recent research (details supplied) showing 82% being directly affected by suicide; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1434","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1607,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700089#WRZ06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1608,"content":"<p>Question No. 641 answered with Question No. 620.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emergency Departments Waiting Times","counter":1609,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700089#WRZ06700"},{"type":"question","counter":1610,"qnumday":642,"qnumall":"[45736\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700089#WRZ06800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on a recent report (details supplied) that persons under 20 years of age at Beaumont Hospital waited less than ten hours for admission while the wait was as high as 24 hours for persons aged 90 years and over and that 6,000 older persons were made wait for more than 24 hours in emergency departments to date in 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) data are usually not available at European or global level until mid- to late-season.  <\/p><p><b><\/b>In Europe influenza vaccine effectiveness studies were initiated by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) and have been followed systematically since the influenza season 2008&ndash;09 by a network of public health and academic researchers (I-MOVE). Influenza vaccine effectiveness is determined by several multicentre primary care and hospital based case&ndash;control studies and analyses.<\/p><p>In general, a vaccine effectiveness of approximately 40-60% has been estimated for the three different influenza A (H1N1, H3N2) and B strains (Victoria or Yamagata lineages) (these are the strains in the current flu vaccine).  <\/p><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that  recent studies show that flu vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness by between 40% and 60% among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are well-matched to the flu vaccine see www.cdc.gov\/flu\/about\/qa\/vaccineeffect.htm  .<\/p><p>In the Northern Hemisphere, the majority of influenza VE estimates for influenza A (H3N2) were less than 50% for the 2016\/2017 influenza season.  This has been the case for the past 9 seasons. Influenza vaccines provide substantial protection against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B, and reduced protection against influenza A(H3N2). <\/p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis of influenza VE global studies from 2004-2015 was published last year in Lancet. www.thelancet.com\/journals\/laninf\/article\/PIIS1473-3099(16)00129-8\/abstract.<\/p><p>Effective: the effectiveness is the amount of protection the vaccine offers against circulating strains i.e. influenza A (H3N2), A (H1N1) and B. <\/p><p>Also there are host factors as the elderly may not mount a good response due to a relatively weaker immune system.  Those with chronic illness or immunosuppression don't mount the same response as healthy people. The vaccine effectiveness can wane over the season also as the virus evolves.  The vaccine can be up to 70% effective against one or two types\/subtypes\/strains e.g. B or H1N1 and not as effective against H3N2 hence the overall quoted effectiveness against all influenza may decline as the flu season progresses. <\/p><p>I recently met with senior officials from my Department  and the Health Service Executive for an update on influenza plans for the coming season.<\/p><p>A National Steering Group is currently in place and each Hospital group and Community Health Organisation have developed plans, based on lessons learned from last year.  These include additional measures to vaccinate health care workers, as well as measures to control flu in long term care facilities.  The Health Service Executive is also running a programme for immunising at risk groups including people over 65 years of age and pregnant women.<\/p><p>The Chief Medical Officer has been in contact with his counterparts in Northern Ireland and the UK, and at EU level, and all of the available data shows that influenza activity in Ireland is currently low but this is being monitored very closely in advance of the flu season when it can be expected to increase.<\/p><p>An additional 60,000 doses of the flu vaccine have been administered this year so far compared to the same period last year.<\/p><p>The HSE will continue to monitor the level of influenza across the population in the coming weeks, as well as the control measures in place in hospitals and the community, and will brief me on developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700090#WRAA04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1659,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700090#WRAA04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1660,"qnumday":659,"qnumall":"[45813\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700090#WRAA04700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans for south Tipperary general hospital, Clonmel; his views on the impending hospital group transfer which may take place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1661,"content":"<p>I have no plans to move South Tipperary General Hospital out of the South South West Hospital Group. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the report of the cross-party Committee on the Future of Healthcare was published on 30 May last.

Where a service is provided in Ireland but a patient wishes to access care in another EU\/EEA Member State, this can be possible by seeking treatment under the Directive on Patients' Rights in Cross Border Healthcare, otherwise known as the Cross Border Directive (CBD).  <\/p>  <p>  The CBD provides rules for the reimbursements to patients of the cost of receiving treatment abroad, where the patient would be entitled to such treatment in their home Member State, and supplements the rights that patients already have at EU level.  Patients may access the healthcare they require in either the public or private healthcare system of another Member State under the CBD. Access to healthcare abroad is based on patients following public patient pathways, i.e. they must demonstrate they have followed the equivalent public patient pathways that a patient would follow if accessing public healthcare in Ireland.  It is important to note that reimbursement is confined to the costs of the care itself and that the rates of reimbursement cannot exceed the cost of provision of the care if it were provided in the Irish public health service.   <\/p>  <p>The HSE operates the CBD in Ireland. Referral for care under the CBD may be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other clinicians.  In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE through the National Contact Point (NCP) provides information for patients on the CBD on its website which can be accessed at www.hse.ie\/eng\/services\/list\/1\/schemes\/cbd\/ and also by phone at 056 7784551.   The HSE advises where a patient is in any doubt as to the need to seek prior authorization before availing of a consultation or treatment abroad to contact the NCP. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE also operates the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) for persons entitled to treatment in another EU\/EEA Member State or Switzerland under EU Regulation (EC) No. 883\/2004, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulations (EC) No. 987\/2009. The TAS provides for the cost of approved treatments in another EU\/EEA member state or Switzerland through the issue of form E112 (IE) where the treatment is:<\/p>  <p>  -  Among the benefits provided for by Irish legislation; <\/p>  <p>  -  Not available in Ireland; and <\/p>  <p>  -  Not available within the time normally necessary for obtaining it in Ireland, taking account of the patient's current state of health and the probable course of the disease.<\/p>  <p>  GPs refer patients to consultants for acute care and it is the treating consultant who, having exhausted all treatment options including tertiary care within the country, refers the patient abroad under the terms of the TAS.  The consultant must specify the specific treatment and in making the referral accepts clinical responsibility in relation to the physician and facility abroad where the patient will attend. <\/p>  <p>  Applications to the TAS are processed and a determination given in accordance with the statutory framework prior to a patient travelling to avail of treatment.  The statutory framework stipulates the patient must be a public patient and is required to have followed public patient pathways.  Information on the TAS can be accessed on the HSE website at  www.hse.ie\/eng\/services\/list\/1\/schemes\/treatmentabroad\/ and also by phone at  056 7784551.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700090#WRAA05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Children's Hospital Expenditure","counter":1668,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700090#WRAA05500"},{"type":"question","counter":1669,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[45832\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700090#WRAA05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the funding source of the &euro;2 million estimated cost for the additional fire safety measures for the national children's hospital (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1670,"qnumday":669,"qnumall":"[45897\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700090#WRAA05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if all fire safety regulations have been adhered to with respect to the national children's hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1671,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 662 and 669 together.<\/p><p>Everyone involved with this project holds the view that safety is paramount in relation to this project and ensuring that children, parents and staff operate within a safe environment.

This is a generic policy framework for rare diseases. The scope of the plan is broad given that there are 8,000 rare diseases approximately affecting millions of EU citizens; and consequently, there can be a dearth of expertise and knowledge about some rare diseases, simply because they are so rare. Earlier this year, the Department published a Progress Report on the Rare Disease Plan. <\/p><p>The Steering Group Recommendations on access to medicines and technologies for people with rare disease in the Republic of Ireland and the actions taken to date are outlined as follows: <table><tr><th>Recommendation<\/th><th>Action<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>30. The HSE develop a Working Group to bring forward appropriate decision criteria for the reimbursement of orphan medicines and technologies. The approach should include an assessment system similar to that for cancer therapies established under the National Cancer Control Programme and link with the CAVOMP at European level. <\/td><td>The terms of reference have been developed for a Rare diseases technology review committee and this will largely follow the approach in place for technology review of cancer treatments.  Michael Barry has been appointed Chair of this committee.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>31. The HSE undertake a preliminary economic evaluation of current activity and costs for orphan medicine and technologies for rare disease patients across all hospitals settings. <\/td><td>The Acute Hospital Drugs Management Programme is undertaking a project to understand the patient numbers on enzyme replacement treatment, the cost of this treatment and the place of treatment.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>32. Applications for the use of orphan medicines and technologies in hospitals be dealt with in the context of a national budget, rather than through individual hospital budgets, and that the HSE take account of this. <\/td><td>The Acute hospitals drugs management programme is examining how approved enzyme replacement treatment might be funded via a centralised mechanism in a similar way to multiple sclerosis.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>33. The HSE develop a publicly available annual report documenting the use of both existing and new-to-market orphan medicines and technologies in Ireland and a summary of applications received and decisions relating to those applications. <\/td><td>Not commenced<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>34. The existing horizon scanning between pharmaceutical companies and the HSE, including clinical value assessment authorities, continue and be enhanced so as to improve information available regarding orphan medicines in the pipeline and the future needs for these medicines. <\/td><td>There is a formal horizon scanning process in place via the corporate pharmaceutical unit in the HSE.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>35. The capacity to prescribe all orphan medicines and technologies for ultrarare conditions be limited to specialist teams designated through the Centres of Expertise. <\/td><td>Enzyme replacement treatment this is in place.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>36. The HSE apply a set of guidelines on the prescribing of orphan medicines and technologies in Ireland. The HSE should evaluate clinical outcomes regarding use of orphan medicines. <\/td><td>This is a function of the Rare Diseases Technology Review committee.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>37. Clinicians should provide data necessary to the monitoring of prescription patterns and pharmacovigilance, so as to ensure patient safety and high-quality healthcare. <\/td><td>This is already in place for some orphan conditions and clinicians are obliged to report any adverse events for drugs which they prescribe.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>38.

These agencies are reminded of their obligations each year in their Letter of Determination which confirms their funding for that year.  Each year also, each agency confirms to my Department that it has complied with the requirements in the Code of Practice.  <\/p>  <p>  A primary function of the HSE is to manage and deliver health and personal social services.  It can either do this itself or it can enter an arrangement under section 38 or section 39 of the Health Act 2004 with a service provider to deliver the service.  Funding oversight of the 39 agencies funded under section 38 of the Health Act and over 2,000 agencies funded under section 39 of the Health Act is the responsibility of the HSE under its establishing legislation. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has established a framework of governance over funded agencies including a requirement for those agencies to sign a service level agreement or a grant aid agreement depending on the level of grant funding being provided.  Agencies in receipt of funding in excess of &euro;250,000 are subject to a service level agreement and agencies in receipt of funding less than &euro;250,000 are subject to a grant aid agreement.  The framework provides national standardised documentation which governs grant funding provided to the agencies.  It also seeks to ensure the standard, consistent application of good governance principles which are robust and effective to ensure that both the HSE and the grant-funded agency meet their respective obligations. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE requires that all grant aided non-statutory agencies submit their annual audited accounts to the HSE.  As part of its annual audit plans, the Internal Audit Division of the HSE conducts audits of a number of the agencies each year.  Such audits generally focus on the systems of internal control operated by the funded agencies, and compliance with the HSE Service Level Agreement (SLA).  The scope is distinct from the statutory annual audit of accounts carried out by the external auditors of the agencies.  A number of Internal Audits have also been conducted by the HSE into its own management processes and controls over the funding and monitoring of services provided by non-statutory agencies.  In addition, the Comptroller and Auditor General may also undertake a review of the HSE's monitoring and oversight of grants to health agencies and the findings of such a review were the subject of a recent meeting of the Public Accounts Committee.  <\/p>  <p>  New procedures have not been issued by my Department to the agencies under its aegis in relation to credit cards.

A key issue will be to ensure that there is minimum disruption to health services and that essential services are maintained on a cross-Border, all-island and Ireland-UK basis.  The health sector has a highly mobile workforce and free movement issues and the mutual recognition and assurance of professional qualifications are being considered.  On regulatory issues, it is clear that having a single set of rules across the European Union is enormously helpful &ndash; to protect human health, to ensure consumer protection and to provide a level playing field for industry.  The UK no longer being part of a harmonised regulatory system in relation to food safety standards, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and cosmetics could necessitate increased certification requirements or disrupt trade between Ireland and the UK.  Ensuring continuity in the supply of medicines and medical devices following the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU is a priority.  The issue of customs is of relevance as it relates to additional food safety controls and medicines.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  The amount of funding allocated to the NHSS in 2017 was  &euro;940 million.  This amount was increased to &euro;949.7 million in the recent budget.<\/p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and agencies.<\/p>  <p>  An interdepartmental\/agency working group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the review.  This group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  These recommendations include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the scheme.  The programme for a partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.  It is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation and changes to the NHSS will require legislative implementation.<\/p>  <p>  On this basis, I have requested legal advice from the office of the Attorney General regarding potential changes to the legislation that will address this matter.  My department has also been cognisant of this matter in the context of this years estimates process. I have recently met with representatives from the IFA to discuss various strategies that may assist with addressing their members concerns and have apprised them of the current progress.

Valproate medicines have been authorised in all EU Member States and in Norway and Iceland for the treatment of epilepsy; valproate-containing medicines are also approved nationally in Ireland to treat bipolar disorder.<\/p>  <p>  Valproate medicines should be initiated and supervised by a specialist experienced in the management of epilepsy or bipolar disorder.  It is also recommended that valproate should not be used in women of child-bearing potential unless other treatments are ineffective or not tolerated because of the risk of congenital malformations and developmental disorders in infants exposed to valproate in utero.  Women who could become pregnant should be given medical advice on the benefits and risks of treatments before valproate is prescribed and use effective contraception during treatment.  Clinicians, in consultation with their patient, may consider the therapeutic benefit of valproate to outweigh any possible risks for individual patients where discontinuation of therapy or switching to alternative therapies is not possible or poses an unacceptable risk to the health of that patient and consequentially to the health of the unborn child.<\/p>  <p>  In March of this year, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) initiated a new review of the use of valproate-containing medicines in the treatment of women and girls who are pregnant or of childbearing age.  This review is examining the available evidence and consulting with relevant stakeholder groups.  The most recent component of the current review was a public hearing held at the London offices of the EMA on 26 September.<\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the PRAC&rsquo;s current review of valproate will be concluded before the end of this year.  As soon as the review is concluded, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which is  the competent authority for the regulation of medicines in Ireland, will communicate the outcome and recommendations of the review to Irish patients, healthcare professionals and relevant stakeholders, including the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  A previous EMA review of valproate, in 2014, resulted in measures to strengthen the warnings and restrictions on the use of valproate medicines in women and girls, due to the risk of malformations and developmental problems in babies who are exposed to valproate in the womb. The HPRA has highlighted the results of previous reviews of valproate and provided revised educational materials for both healthcare professionals and patients.  A warning label for the outer packaging of Epilim (sodium valproate) products was introduced in Ireland earlier this year; products carrying the new external warning label are now being supplied to retail pharmacies. <\/p>  <p>  In October 2016, the HSE's Medicines Management Programme (MMP) launched its &lsquo;Valproate Toolkit&rsquo;, an online resource consisting of a patient information booklet, summary guide for prescribers and a patient\/prescriber checklist. This information highlights that sodium valproate should not be prescribed to girls or women of childbearing age or pregnant women unless other treatments are ineffective or not tolerated. The MMP continues to monitor the use of valproate by women of childbearing age.  The MMP is also in regular contact with the HPRA regarding the EMA's current review of valproate, and will consider any recommendations arising from the review. <\/p>  <p>  Foetal Anti-Convulsant Syndrome (FACS) is the name of a syndrome that can affect some babies if they were exposed to certain anti-epileptic drugs while in the womb. FACS can manifest as physical malformations as well as developmental, behavioral and learning difficulties. Children with FACS can have a mixture of mild to more serious symptoms. The management of FACS usually involves a multidisciplinary approach with different specialties depending on the nature and severity of the symptoms. Children born with developmental delays may require specialist paediatric care, as well as speech and language therapy and physiotherapy. Information published by the HPRA indicates that children exposed in utero to valproate are at high risk of congenital malformations in approximately 10% of cases, and of serious developmental disorders in up to 30-40% of cases.  There is also an increased risk of autistic spectrum disorder, childhood autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). <\/p>  <p>  In October of this year, and in 2015, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, as regulator for pharmacists and pharmacies in Ireland, again highlighted the risks of the use of valproate in women of child-bearing age to ensure that those patients are informed and understand:<\/p>  <p>  -  the risks associated with valproate use during pregnancy; <\/p>  <p>  -  the need to use effective contraception; <\/p>  <p>  -  the need for regular review of treatment; and<\/p>  <p>  -  the need to immediately consult a healthcare professional if they are planning a pregnancy or if they become pregnant.<\/p>  <p>  Pharmacists were encouraged to bring these issues, and any other relevant educational materials, to the attention of patients presenting in their pharmacy.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register, based in Beaumont Hospital, was set up in 2001 for pregnant women with epilepsy in Ireland.  The aim of this Register is to find out which type of epilepsy drugs women are taking while pregnant and to collect information on the health of their babies after delivery.  Since 2007, the Irish Register has had a formal link to the United Kingdom Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register. Women with epilepsy who become pregnant, whether or not they are taking anti-epileptic drugs for their epilepsy, are eligible to register their pregnancy.<\/p>  <p>  Patients currently taking valproate containing medicines are advised not to stop taking these medicines and, if they have any concerns about their specific drug treatment and management of their condition, to discuss these with a healthcare professional. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700093#WRDD02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":1852,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700093#WRDD02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1853,"qnumday":724,"qnumall":"[46309\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700093#WRDD03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the care pathways in place for children possibly impacted by sodium valproate; the process for getting a diagnosis; if his attention has been drawn to reports of the current waiting time being two years for a diagnosis; and if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that there is an urgent need to have the complex needs of children assessed and appropriate pathways for diagnosis and treatment put in place immediately","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1854,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; is forecast at just over &euro;1.7 billion in 2017. <\/p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster (Versatis) is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It was reimbursed in the community drugs schemes from 2010.  The projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. Currently, over 25,000 patients receive this item. <\/p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of Versatis highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of prescribing of this product is for the licensed indication of PHN. <\/p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for Versatis from 1 September 2017.  This process supports the appropriate use of Versatis, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.<\/p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who receive antivirals for shingles are automatically approved for Versatis for three months.  No action is required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy is notified of his or her approval status.<\/p><p>All patients who currently use Versatis have been identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and will continue to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017.  However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients will no longer get Versatis under the community drugs schemes.  The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. <\/p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications.  GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system.  The MMP reviews applications before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.<\/p><p>Full details of the Versatis review are available on the HSE website at .<\/p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.

The Deputies may be familiar with the background to the closure of both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant schemes in February 2013. Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,700 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.<\/p><p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.

The Government's legislative programme for 2017 includes the Health (Transport Support) Bill.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that: <\/p><p>-  There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;<\/p><p>-  There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme; <\/p><p>-  Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and <\/p><p>-  The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>The draft General Scheme and Heads of Bill were circulated to other government Departments and have been the subject of consultation between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

This strategy sets out a number of objectives and a road map for the delivery and implementation of eHealth for the benefit of patients. The <i>Knowledge &amp;amp; Information strategy<\/i>, published in 2014 by the Office of the Chief Information Officer in the HSE, builds upon the eHealth strategy and outlines how integrated information and enabling technology will support the delivery of innovative, safe and high quality patient care to meet the needs of our population across all patient pathways and care settings.<\/p><p>Significant progress has been made on both strategies since their publication.  This includes the establishment of eHealth Ireland, the appointment of a Chief Information Officer for the HSE, the establishment of the eHealth Ireland Advisory Committee and the development of the Irish eHealth Ecosystem.<\/p><p>Progress has also been made in relation to the implementation of the Health Identifiers Act 2014, which provides for a system of unique identification for patients, professionals and providers, via an Individual Health Identifier (IHI). The Individual Health Identifier will enhance patient data security and confidentiality and support administrative efficiency. On 30 May 2017, a Commencement Order and Regulations under the Health Identifiers Act 2014 were signed, allowing for the implementation of the Individual Health Identifier.<\/p><p>The HSE have also developed a business case for the implementation of an electronic health care record (EHR) in Ireland. The business case sets out a number of investment scenarios including timescales for implementation and roll out.  Progress has been achieved with the roll-out of the Maternity and Newborn Clinical Management System (MN-CMS), which is the design and implementation of an electronic health record for all women and babies in maternity services in Ireland, going live in Cork in December 2016 with Kerry following in March 2017.  In both locations the new MN-CMS successfully replaced paper processes with efficient digital processes.  Further implementations are planned for the Rotunda Hospital by year end and the National Maternity Hospital in early 2018.<\/p><p>eReferrals<b><\/b>(National Electronic General GP Referrals), an initiative that has developed the infrastructure to electronically transmit referrals from GPs to Acute Hospitals, have now been rolled out to all six hospital groups.<\/p><p>Implementation of a new Financial Operating Model for the HSE is at an advanced stage and this will be underpinned by a single national technology platform which will be adopted by all health entities as it will provide the most cost effective and expedient approach to financial management.<\/p><p>The MedLIS project promotes patient safety and quality improvement of services being provided by Laboratory Services and is currently being closely monitored by the HSE project steering group and is anticipated to 'go-live' in St. James Hospital in Q2 2018.<\/p><p>My Department also participates in a number of international eHealth forums, including the EU eHealth Network, in the context of digital services in support of the Cross-Border Directive (Directive 2011\/24\/EU) on the application of patients&rsquo; rights in cross-border healthcare and is also aimed at furthering the eHealth agenda on issues such as interoperability and common standards for the exchange of information in support of patient care.<\/p><p>The delivery of digital health care services will require a robust legal framework to ensure confidentiality and security of patient data consistent with the new EU data protection regulation, Regulation (EU) 2016\/679 (General Data Protection Regulation).  The GDPR will have a significant effect on how and where data is gathered and the purpose for which it is used.  My Department is currently examining the appropriate information framework that will provide the optimum environment to support future developments in eHealth.  In this context, a public consultation is currently being carried out by my Department to seek views on the proposals to inform the drafting of a national health information policy in 2018.<\/p><p>Increases in capital spending and resources have been facilitated and the capacity and capability of HSE ICT to successfully undertake large scale ICT projects have been further developed, which will see continued progression on the area of ICT and eHealth.<\/p><p>Delivery of eHealth is also being examined in the context of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which advocates the <i>&ldquo;Continued strong support of the e-health strategy<\/i>&ndash; <i>particularly ensuring the necessary funding for timely roll-out of the EHR system<\/i>&rdquo;.

For example, this includes Part 4 Co-Decision Making and Part 7 Enduring Powers of Attorney, which are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality, and Part 8 Advance Healthcare Directives, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700095#WRFF03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":2001,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700095#WRFF03600"},{"type":"question","counter":2002,"qnumday":776,"qnumall":"[46644\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700095#WRFF03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason there is only one HSE appointed optician in County Kerry; the number of persons on the waiting list from four years of age onwards; the average waiting time; if another optician will be appointed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2003,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700095#WRFF03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":2004,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700095#WRFF03900"},{"type":"question","counter":2005,"qnumday":777,"qnumall":"[46659\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700095#WRFF04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 391 of 26 September 2017, the plan in place to deal with the closure of two operating theatres at Merlin Park hospital, County Galway; the assessment carried out by the external engineering firm of the damage; the timeframe for the completion of repairs; the arrangements in place for surgeries to be carried out at alternative sites, more particularly, the full complement of beds at St. Finbar's ward; if they are now all available for patients; the number of persons that had been scheduled for surgery; when they can expect to have their operations; if the persons involved have been written to in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2006,"content":"<p>In response to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700095#WRFF04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Procedures","counter":2007,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700095#WRFF04200"},{"type":"question","counter":2008,"qnumday":778,"qnumall":"[46665\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700095#WRFF04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of inpatient and outpatient procedures, respectively, which are expected to be carried out in 2018 across the various hospital groupings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2009,"content":"<p>The HSE is currently in the process of preparing its 2018 Service Plan, which will include details of the type and volume of health services being provided in 2018.

Under section 30(1) of the Pharmacy Act 2007 (the Act) PAs may perform the same functions as a pharmacist, in the temporary absence of a pharmacist, with the exception of functions that are restricted to pharmacists under specific medicines legislation, such as vaccination services.  Since 1994, the provisions of &quot;temporary absence&quot; have been understood with reference to a Code of Practice agreed that year between the PSI and the Pharmaceutical Assistants' Association (PAA).<\/p><p>Section 30(2) of the Pharmacy Act 2007 provides that the PSI Council may make Rules, with the consent of the Minister, to provide further as to what constitutes the temporary absence of a registered pharmacist and what may or may not be done by a PA when acting on behalf of a pharmacist. In 2013, the PSI Council directed that a policy position be developed to enable and facilitate the drafting of rules relating to the circumstances in which a registered PA may act in the temporary absence of a registered pharmacist in line with the requirements of Section 30(2) of the Act.  The PSI Registration and Qualification Recognition Committee (RQR) was assigned responsibility to progress this work.  A Pharmaceutical Assistant was sought to join this Committee and was appointed by the PSI Council in March 2014.<\/p><p>The PSI developed the draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Regulation of Temporary Absence Cover by Pharmaceutical Assistants) Rules 2016 following debate and engagement with interested parties including the Pharmaceutical Assistants Association (PAA).  The draft Rules were issued for public consultation on 8 February 2016.  Following discussion at the PSI Council meeting of 23 March 2017, and taking account of the responses received through the consultation process, the Council decided not to submit the draft Rules to me for approval.  The Council instead directed that the matter be re-examined by the PSI Executive with further consideration to be given to what could be covered within the scope of the Rules.  In making its decision at this meeting the Council confirmed that the current approach to regulating temporary absence by PSI inspection staff under the 1994 Code of Practice would continue to apply pending the future adoption of statutory Rules.<\/p><p>A working group consisting of 6 persons (<i>two Council members, two PSI staff members, and two external participants - a Pharmaceutical Assistant and a person with regulatory and risk expertise<\/i>) was then established to provide expertise, advice and input to assist in developing policy options and drafting rules.

At present the regulations made under this section of the Act do not specifically prohibit the sale of the so called combi boxes referred to by the Deputy.  As outlined in my response to the Deputy's previous Parliamentary Question on this issue (Ref:41867\/17), a number of measures have recently been introduced aimed at having a positive public health impact on the numbers of people smoking roll-your-own tobacco.  The EU Tobacco Products Directive came into force in 2014 and was transposed into Irish legislation in 2016.  Under that legislation the sale of roll-your-own tobacco packs weighing less than 30 gram is prohibited.  Prior to this roll-your-own tobacco could be purchased in 12.5 gram and 25 gram packets.  This increase in the size of the packet has the effect of making roll-your-own tobacco less affordable than before, particularly to younger adults.  Evidence indicates that pricing is a key means of  reducing tobacco consumption.  Government Policy, <i>Tobacco Free Ireland <\/i>contains recommendations in relation to raising taxes on tobacco products including reducing the price differential between roll-your-own tobacco and cigarettes.  I was very pleased that in the context of Budget 2018, my colleague, Minister Pascal Donohue TD increased the excise duty on tobacco products generally and, in particular, specifically increased the excise duty on roll-your-own tobacco so as to reduce the price differential between roll-your-own tobacco and cigarettes.<\/p><p>Irish legislation which came into force on 30 September 2017 provides that all retail packaging of tobacco products manufactured from that date must be in standardised packaging.  The aim of standardised packaging is to make all tobacco packs look less attractive, make health warnings more prominent and prevent packaging from misleading consumers about the harmful effects of tobacco.  In relation to the health warnings the EU Tobacco Products Directive had the effect of significantly increasing the size of the picture health warnings on tobacco packaging.<\/p><p>It is anticipated that these and other tobacco control, cessation and health promotion measures will continue to reduce the numbers smoking tobacco.  I, and my Government colleagues, are committed to the on-going implementation of<i>Tobacco Free Ireland.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700097#WRHH04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres","counter":2151,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700097#WRHH04400"},{"type":"question","counter":2152,"qnumday":825,"qnumall":"[46889\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700097#WRHH04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the inclusion of a foot bath at a centre (details supplied) the plans for which have been drawn up and submitted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2153,"content":"<p>As the HSE has responsibility for the provision, along with the maintenance and operation of Primary Care Centres and other Primary Care facilities, the Executive has been asked to reply directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700097#WRHH04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":2154,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700097#WRHH04700"},{"type":"question","counter":2155,"qnumday":826,"qnumall":"[46894\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700097#WRHH04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 220 to 225, inclusive, of 24 October 2017, if he will provide updated replies to all questions, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2156,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, with effect from  28 June, 2016, under Dail Standing Order 42(a) where a question is referred for direct reply to a body under the aegis of my Department such as the Health Service Executive (HSE).

Situations do exist where, due to multiple sensitivities, the amount of area eligible for payment may exceed the 15% eligible area threshold, resulting in a landowner receiving a payment based on an area less than the gross area of the project.  However, these represent a minority of cases and often, with good design, these ineligible areas can be excluded from the afforestation application and left as part of the open farm enterprise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700099#WRKK05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Payments","counter":2297,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700099#WRKK05800"},{"type":"question","counter":2298,"qnumday":879,"qnumall":"[45675\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700099#WRKK05900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason for the delay in his Department's processing GLAS I payments for persons (details supplied); when payment can be expected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2299,"content":"<p>The persons named were approved into GLAS 1 with a contract commencement date of 1 October 2015 and have received all payments in respect of 2015 and the 2016 advance payment.<\/p>  <p>  A Farm Nutrient Management Plan (NMP) must be submitted on behalf of each GLAS 1 and 2 participant to the dedicated online system before the 15% balancing payment or any future GLAS payment can issue.

No. 125 of 2016) establishes a point system, which will apply to the Licence Holder of a sea-fishing boat when a serious infringement of the Common Fisheries Policy\u00a0is detected.  It is intended that the new Statutory instrument which I intend to sign shortly will amend S.I. No. 125 of 2016 to change the make-up of the Determination Panel set up under the 2016 S.I. to determine if on the balance of probabilities a serious infringement occurred and whether it is a serious infringement.  This will involve the appointment of three independent legal professionals nominated by the Attorney General, thereby completely separating the enforcement and the determination functions.  The new SI will, to the extent possible, take on board the issues of concern in relation to procedures and processes highlighted in High Court judgments on this matter.  It will also amend S.I. No. 125 of 2016 to address certain minor technical and drafting issues arising.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2016, I advised the Oireachtas that subject to addressing some important legal and administrative issues, that I was hopeful of moving towards a system of sequential application of EU points in conjunction with the prosecution process, having consulted with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  I made it clear that this move was subject to addressing some important legal and administrative issues in order to ensure compliance with EU law.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  There has been extensive examination and consideration of all the issues in relation to meeting our EU obligations to implement the points system in the interim period.  The firm legal view available to me is that it is not possible to deliver on an effective and dissuasive points system, as required under EU law, by assigning points to licence holders upon successful prosecution.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted in this context that Pilot Infringement proceedings by the EU Commission for non-implementation of the EU points system have been taken against Ireland.  It remains an option for the EU Commission to proceed to formal infringement proceedings in respect of the licence holders system.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There are also serious implications with regard to the release of funding under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF).  Implementation of the EU Points system was an ex-ante conditionality for the approval of Ireland&rsquo;s European Maritime Fisheries Fund Programme, given that the programme is intended to facilitate implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy in Ireland.  The EU Commission has signalled in writing that the delivery of funding under Ireland&rsquo;s EMFF Operational Programme is firmly linked to the implementation of the points system.  This programme is investing &euro;241m of EU\/Exchequer funding in total in the fisheries sector over the lifetime of the programme, which is crucial at a time of Brexit uncertainty.  The immediate concern is with regard to the control and data collection funds.  The EU Commission wrote in July 2017\u00a0advising that due to the non implementation of the Points system,\u00a0EMFF funding allocated for control spend will be suspended.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Having an effective, proportionate and dissuasive system of points for all fishing vessels, Irish and non Irish, operating in our 200 mile zone is beneficial to maintaining the sustainability of fish stocks on which our seafood sector is dependant.  This system will ensure that the vast majority of our law abiding fishermen are able to compete effectively and look forward to a sustainable future in the industry. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700100#WRLL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Grocery Industry Data","counter":2319,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700100#WRLL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":2320,"qnumday":886,"qnumall":"[45742\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700100#WRLL00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the details of deaths and injuries of greyhounds for each track held by the IGB here and by the ICC in Northern Ireland.","asker":"1259","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2321,"content":"<p>Bord na gCon is a commercial State body, established under the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, chiefly to control greyhound racing and to improve and develop the greyhound industry.<\/p><p>Bord na gCon is a body corporate and a separate legal entity to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

The Irish Wildlife Trust also identifies sprat as the target species for this activity. <\/p>  <p>  Sprat is a short-lived species\u00a0and an important prey fish\u00a0for many marine species thus vital to the ocean food chain as well as an important source of income for inshore fishermen.<\/p>  <p>  The central objective of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is to ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term through the conservation and sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources and the management of fisheries and fleets exploiting such resources.  Ireland is committed to ensuring the conservation of the seabirds and marine life around our coast through the Birds and Habitats Directive, among other instruments.<\/p>  <p>  Sprat in Irish waters is\u00a0not a species subject to fishing quotas or Total Allowable Catches established under EU regulation.  Scientifically, relatively little is known about the sprat species.  The International Council of the Exploration of the Seas (ICES)\u00a0considers sprat to be a data limited stock which means that more detailed data is required in order to form a full understanding of the state of the stock. <\/p>  <p>  Available scientific information is that sprat in Ireland spawn from January to June with a fishery normally taking place from October to Christmas.  This is a fortuitous situation, allowing some degree of reproductive output as the fishery takes place after the fish have been able to spawn.\u00a0 The Marine Institute advise that there is no evidence that spawning sprat are or ever have been targeted in Irish fisheries nor is there evidence that sprat actually spawn inshore.\u00a0 That of course is not to deny that they are easily targeted inshore when they occur there.<\/p>  <p>  In order to address the lack of accurate information in respect of the sprat stocks in the waters around Ireland, a three year research project, partially funded by industry,\u00a0commenced in October 2014 and is now\u00a0in its final stage, under the auspices of the Marine Institute in cooperation with\u00a0the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.<\/p>  <p>  This project aims to develop an accurate and detailed understanding of the stock structure of sprat around Ireland.  It will determine whether the sprat in Irish coastal waters is one stock or several separate stocks and it aims to increase our understanding of their role in the broader marine ecosystem.  This data will in turn contribute to the ICES assessment of the vulnerability or otherwise of sprat in the waters around Ireland.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition to this research project, the Marine Institute is \u00a0committed to\u00a0working closely with Industry to obtain increased observer coverage in the sprat fisheries.  Six such observer trips (five off Donegal and one off the South West Coast) have taken place in the past four weeks with more proposed in November.  The purpose of the observer scheme is twofold:\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - To obtain biological information on the resource itself and on any other fishery bycatch, ie herring, juvenile mackerel, etc.<\/p>  <p>  - To obtain information on any bycatch this fishery might have of\u00a0protected, endangered and threatened species, under the European maritime and fisheries fund (EMFF) marine biodiversity scheme such as marine mammals, seabirds and listed fish species. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is expected that these projects\/observer schemes\u00a0will allow for more intensive data collection and enhanced scientific knowledge on the sprat stock\u00a0thus\u00a0supporting any future management actions considered necessary including the issue of pair trawling.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of sea-lice, this is managed by the Marine Institute on behalf of the State.  The sea lice monitoring and control programme in place in Ireland is comprehensive and transparent with all farms inspected 14 times per annum by independent inspectors from the Marine Institute.

The Irish monitoring and control programme is unique in that it is completely independent of industry and the full results are published.

The Irish Wildlife Trust also identifies sprat as the target species for this activity.<\/p>  <p>  Sprat is a short-lived species\u00a0and an important prey fish\u00a0for many marine species thus vital to the ocean food chain as well as an important source of income for inshore fishermen.<\/p>  <p>  The central objective of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is to ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term through the conservation and sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources and the management of fisheries and fleets exploiting such resources.  Ireland is committed to ensuring the conservation of the seabirds and marine life around our coast through the Birds and Habitats Directive, among other instruments.<\/p>  <p>  Sprat in Irish waters is\u00a0not a species subject to fishing quotas or Total Allowable Catches established under EU regulation.  Scientifically, relatively little is known about the sprat species.  The International Council of the Exploration of the Seas (ICES)\u00a0considers sprat to be a data limited stock which means that more detailed data is required in order to form a full understanding of the state of the stock.<\/p>  <p>  Available scientific information is that sprat in Ireland spawn from January to June with a fishery normally taking place from October to Christmas.  This is a fortuitous situation, allowing some degree of reproductive output as the fishery takes place after the fish have been able to spawn.\u00a0 The Marine Institute advise that there is no evidence that spawning sprat are or ever have been targeted in Irish fisheries nor is there evidence that sprat actually spawn inshore.\u00a0 That of course is not to deny that they are easily targeted inshore when they occur there.<\/p>  <p>  In order to address the lack of accurate information in respect of the sprat stocks in the waters around Ireland, a three year research project, partially funded by industry,\u00a0commenced in October 2014 and is now\u00a0in its final stage, under the auspices of the Marine Institute in cooperation with\u00a0the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.<\/p>  <p>  This project aims to develop an accurate and detailed understanding of the stock structure of sprat around Ireland.  It will determine whether the sprat in Irish coastal waters is one stock or several separate stocks and it aims to increase our understanding of their role in the broader marine ecosystem.  This data will in turn contribute to the ICES assessment of the vulnerability or otherwise of sprat in the waters around Ireland.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this research project, the Marine Institute is \u00a0committed to\u00a0working closely with Industry to obtain increased observer coverage in the sprat fisheries.  Six such observer trips (five off Donegal and one off the South West Coast) have taken place in the past four weeks with more proposed in November.  The purpose of the observer scheme is twofold:\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - To obtain biological information on the resource itself and on any other fishery bycatch, ie herring, juvenile mackerel, etc.<\/p>  <p>  - To obtain information on any bycatch this fishery might have of\u00a0protected, endangered and threatened species, under the European maritime and fisheries fund (EMFF) marine biodiversity scheme such as marine mammals, seabirds and listed fish species.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is expected that these projects\/observer schemes\u00a0will allow for more intensive data collection and enhanced scientific knowledge on the sprat stock\u00a0thus\u00a0supporting any future management actions considered necessary including the issue of pair trawling.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The monitoring and control of fishing vessels within Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fisheries Zone are matters for the Irish control authorities.

The new RESS will provide pathways for delivering on the 2015 Energy White Paper commitment to ensure communities and citizens are at the centre of the future energy transition in Ireland.  Communities are effectively being designed into the fabric of the new scheme and a comprehensive assessment of polices and support measures to increase community ownership from renewable electricity projects has been undertaken.  The most effective policies to increase community ownership and participation in renewable electricity projects have been assessed and examined within an Irish context.<\/p><p>Micro generation, which typically involves an element of self-consumption and the selling of excess electricity to the grid, was also appraised as part of the RESS economic assessment.  The analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before a support scheme for micro generation can be developed.  These include amongst others, a reform of network charges, an assessment of the distributional impact of such a policy decision on the PSO (cost burden sharing), and development of a fair tariff for exported electricity taking the benefits of self-consumption into account.  This approach is in line with experience from other EU member states who have attempted to introduce supports for micro generation.<\/p><p>I am committed to further exploring opportunities for supporting micro generation, as I believe that micro-generation will have an important role\u00a0in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a carbon free economy,\u00a0in assisting Ireland meet its renewable electricity targets, and increasing social acceptance of and promoting renewable energy projects right across the country.

As the Deputy will be aware, the NBP is being achieved via a mix of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State led intervention in those areas where commercial providers acting alone will not provide this essential service.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In relation to the NBP, I note that the report recommends that the Local Authorities, for whom the report\u00a0was commissioned, &quot;should fully embrace what is a remarkable plan&quot;.\u00a0Representatives from ICBAN\u00a0have requested a meeting with my Department to discuss the report and I am happy to confirm to the Deputy that a meeting is being arranged. <\/p><p>The Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) will ensure high speed broadband access (minimum download 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland,\u00a0regardless of location.\u00a0 The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecommunications sector so that to date approximately 1.5m or 65% of the 2.3m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband and this footprint is expanding. By 2020 it is expected that 90% of premises in Ireland will have access to high speed broadband.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Government is determined to ensure that the network is built out as quickly as possible and at a minimum cost. As part of the competitive process in awarding a contract(s) under the State led Intervention, my\u00a0Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan. A prioritisation programme will support this process, in consultation with the Minister for Rural and Community Development.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In addition, the Department of Rural and Community Development has established two Regional Action Groups, working with all Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies.\u00a0It has also provided funding to support each Local Authority to appoint a Broadband Officer. \u00a0The Regional Action Groups will help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded, by ensuring that there are no local barriers to deployment and by identifying priority areas for roll-out. The Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact\u00a0in local authorities for their communities.\u00a0 The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring\u00a0a much greater degree of consistency\u00a0in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure<\/p><p>In\u00a0April of this year, I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map, searchable by eircode.\u00a0 The map is available at www.broadband.gov.ie.The map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included\u00a0in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan (NBP).\u00a0 <\/p><p>The map shows that there are over\u00a0101,200\u00a0premises in County Donegal, about 68,000 of which fall within a BLUE area of the Map\u00a0and will be covered by commercial operators.\u00a0 Just over 16,500 of these 68,000\u00a0premises form part of eir's planned rural deployment to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and the end of 2018. .Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at The\u00a0remaining\u00a033,000 premises in County Donegal\u00a0fall within an AMBER area and will be part of the State led Intervention under the National Broadband Plan. <\/p><p>The procurement process for the State led Intervention comprising some 540,000 premises and represented as\u00a0AMBER on my Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map is progressing.\u00a0 My Department is currently evaluating the &quot;Detailed Solutions&quot; submitted by two bidders in\u00a0September.\u00a0 This is the last stage in the procurement process before seeking\u00a0final tenders and\u00a0progression to the appointment of a preferred bidder(s). <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700104#WRPP01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":2607,"qnumday":986,"qnumall":"[46500\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700104#WRPP01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding fibre broadband; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":2608,"content":"<p>In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map, available at www.broadband.gov.ie , which outlines how premises around the country will be able to access a high speed broadband service.

It is anticipated that by 2023, half of the bus fleet (approximately 500 buses) will be converted to low-emission vehicles, with plans for full conversion by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has also established a Green Public Transport Fund to support the uptake of low carbon technologies within the public transport sector. This Fund supports the uptake of energy efficient technologies within the public transport sector; specifically to transition the national bus fleet to low emission technology by covering the price differential between the cost of a conventional diesel bus and the cost of an alternatively fuelled vehicle, as well as refuelling infrastructure. Furthermore, the National Policy Framework for Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland was published in May to support the deployment of alternative fuels for transport in Ireland and assist in removing any barriers that exist towards greater uptake of low emissions vehicles (LEVs).<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a series of measures were announced in Budget 2018 that clearly reflect the Government&rsquo;s determination to promote a low-carbon electric vehicle future.

They deserve to be recognised, valued and respected for this.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs acknowledges that pay and conditions are major issues facing the sector.  My Department is exploring how this can be addressed.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government commits to carrying out an independent review of the cost of providing quality childcare.  The <i>'Independent Review of the Cost of Delivering Quality Childcare'<\/i>which will be carried out by Crowe Horwath, will examine the costs faced by childcare providers in delivering quality childcare, including a survey of childcare providers.  Following completion the review is intended to be used to strengthen the evidence base underpinning investment in early years.  As such, it will feed into future policy development, including in relation to levels of payments to services.<\/p><p>In terms of pay for the Early Years sector, it must be noted that my Department is not the direct employer of childcare workers.  However, in terms of improving pay and conditions I have suggested to the sector that they could apply to the Labour Court for a Sectoral Employment Order (SEO), asking the Court to make a recommendation in relation to pay for the whole Early Years sector. <\/p><p>Under an SEO process, organisations substantially representative of employers and employees come together to agree a way forward and submissions are sought from key stakeholders.  My Department would not be party to the SEO process, however, as a significant funder, and with policy responsibility for quality, my Department would be well placed to make a submission to the Court once it publishes its notice in relation to the matter of the application for a SEO for the sector.  I will be very supportive of any reasonable measures aimed at improving pay and conditions of the Early Years sector.  While my Department does not have direct control over the matter, it will continue to support any appropriate initiatives in this area.<\/p><p>In the interim, my Department continues to invest significant resources in the early years sector. In the last three Budgets (2016, 2017 and 2018) investment in Early Years sector has increased by some 87% which reflect the emphasis being placed on developing a quality service with appropriately supported staff.  This has helped to address affordability, access and quality, although it is recognised that there is more to be done.  The announcement under Budget 2018 to increase ECCE capitation rates by 7% is intended to support the workforce. <\/p><p>The funding provided by my Department has always been intended to be sufficient to cater for all of the costs associated with the childcare schemes funded, including administrative and &quot;non-contact time&quot; work, or to fund this pro-rata where my Department's contribution is a part of the total cost of care provided.  Notwithstanding this, to take account of the additional administrative burden on childcare providers as the result of significant changes to the childcare schemes in 2016-2017, including the expansion of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme to include three intake points, contractual changes and the coming into force of the Childcare Regulations, some &euro;14.5 million was provided in 2017 to be drawn down as a &quot;non-contact time&quot; payment for providers, equivalent to seven days' funding.  I have also secured an additional once-off payment of up to &euro;3.5 million in December in respect of the Community Childcare Universal Subsidy (CCSU).  This will bring the overall total 'non-contact' support (or 'Programme Support Payments') to &euro;18m in 2017.  In Budget 2018, it was announced that &euro;18m in programme support payments will be continued for the coming year.  This funding is also intended to support providers and their employees. <\/p><p>On 11 April 2017, I made an announcement that the Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS) would not commence this September but that a range of measures would be introduced in September by my Department to make childcare more affordable for thousands of families throughout Ireland.  This honours a key commitment in the Programme for Government. <\/p><p>The &lsquo;September measures&rsquo; relate to the introduction of the Community Childcare Subvention Universal (CCSU) payment and the increase in band rates across the different strands of the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) Scheme and the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Scheme.  As part of these 'September measures', a universal subsidy is available for all children aged between 6 months and 3 years of age (or until they qualify for ECCE if later than 36 months) in registered childcare.  This amounts to up to &euro;20 a week or &euro;1,040 per year for children in full time childcare.<\/p><p>I am keenly aware of the pressures on the sector with regard to availability of places and sustainability and, following on from significant investment in 2016 and 2017, my Department will provide &euro;6.86m for its capital funding programme under Budget 2018. <\/p><p>Although my Department has been successful in securing additional funding for this sector over the past three budgets, as outlined above, it is acknowledged that much more must be done if we are truly to have affordable, accessible, quality childcare and continue to improve both the affordability and quality of childcare.  To this end I will continue  to engage with Government colleagues with a view to securing additional investment for the Early Years sector in future budgets.  Childcare workers are part of a growing sector, which the Government is strongly supporting.  My Department and I believe that by working together with all the stakeholders in the Early Years sector we can ensure that it is a viable and strong sector which makes a significant contribution to the care and personal development of our children.<\/p><p>I am committed to ensuring childcare is affordable, accessible and of a high quality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700108#WRTT06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Websites","counter":2933,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700108#WRTT06600"},{"type":"question","counter":2934,"qnumday":1099,"qnumall":"[45854\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700108#WRTT06700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the external company undertaking an audit of her departmental website; the cost of the audit; the timeframe for its completion","asker":"1221","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":2935,"content":"<p>There is no audit of the website of my Department being undertaken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700108#WRTT06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education Data","counter":2936,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700108#WRTT06900"},{"type":"question","counter":2937,"qnumday":1100,"qnumall":"[45933\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700108#WRTT07000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of ECCE places available in each county as of September 2017 in tabular form.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":2938,"qnumday":1101,"qnumall":"[45934\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700108#WRTT07100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of children that were eligible for the ECCE scheme in September 2017 by county.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":2939,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1100 and 1101 together.<\/p><p>The information requested is not yet available for September 2017 so I have provided the same information for the previous year (2016 - 2017) as published in the Early Years Sector Profile 2016 - 2017.

All are engaged in the provision of specific services to children and young people.  In discharging funds, my Department operates within the overall framework of Circular 13\/2014 - <i>Management of and Accountability for Grants from Exchequer Fund<\/i>.  This Circular outlines the public financial management principles, procedures and additional reporting requirements to be followed in the management of grant funding provided from public money.  The overall principle is that there should be transparency and accountability in the management of public money, in line with economy, efficiency and effectiveness.  <\/p><p>The Circular sets out detailed requirements, both for the grantor and for the grantee of any public funds.  The operation of the Circular recognises that a differentiated approach needs to be adopted depending on the level and type of grant payment to ensure proper administration of the funding.  All organisations, regardless of size of funding, who receive grants either directly or indirectly from my Department, are informed of their responsibilities under the Circular and of the specific financial reporting and performance reporting expected of them in respect of the funding they receive.  For example, the very detailed financial and performance reporting required of statutory agencies reporting directly to my Department such as Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, are very different to those applied to a small community organisation receiving a once-off minor grant.  <\/p><p>The Circular also provides a useful Statement of Principle for Grantees which sets out 4 clear principles applying to bodies in receipt of grant funding either directly or indirectly from Exchequer funds.  The guiding principles are<\/p><p>1. Clarity - e,g, understand the purpose and conditions attaching to the funding and the outputs required;<\/p><p>2. Governance - e.g. ensuring appropriate governance arrangements are in place with particular reference to the control and safeguarding of funds from misuse, misappropriation and fraud;<\/p><p>3. Value for Money - e.g. be in a position to provide evidence on the effective use of the funding and avoiding waste and extravagance; and<\/p><p>4. Fairness - e.g. managing public funds with the highest degree of honesty and integrity.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700109#WRUU03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Negotiations","counter":2971,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700109#WRUU03300"},{"type":"question","counter":2972,"qnumday":1112,"qnumall":"[46114\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700109#WRUU03400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the details of all planning and research work under way for the impact of the result of Brexit negotiations in her Department or related State agencies; if this analysis is intended for publication; the expected completion and publication date respectively of this research, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1436","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":2973,"content":"<p>As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade with special responsibility for Brexit, Minister Coveney has responsibility for coordinating the whole-of-Government response to Brexit.

This represents an intensification of efforts to build on the Government&lsquo;s contingency planning.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to my own Department, the Deputy will be aware that in January of this year I hosted an all-Ireland sectorial dialogue with young people, members of the Advisory Council for Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020, and other stakeholders in Croke Park to discuss the potential impact of Brexit on the lives of children and young people on the island of Ireland.  The key findings of this important event have been published in a report which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.

The objective of Early Years Capital funding is to increase the number of childcare places in areas of greatest need and to contribute to improving the quality of early years provision.  The School Age Capital Programme was first introduced in 2017, under the Action Plan on School Age Childcare, to support the provision of services aimed at school-going children.  <\/p><p>Pobal also facilitates The Youth Services Grant Scheme.  This scheme amounting to over &euro;10.65 million in 2017, provides funding on an annual basis to national and regional youth organisations.  The funding is intended to ensure the emergence, promotion, growth and development of youth organisations with distinctive philosophies and programmes aimed at the social education of young people.  <\/p><p>Pobal oversees the administration of the Comhairle na &Oacute;g Development Fund (&quot;the Fund&quot;).

The Government has provided &euro;31.5 million for exceptional and urgent needs payments in 2017.  <\/p><p>The ENP scheme is demand led and provides assistance to those with exceptional needs taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  <\/p><p>ENPs are provided for in Section 201 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, as amended, which states that &ldquo;a designated person or deciding officer may, in any case where the designated person or deciding officer considers it reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, so to do, determine or decide that supplementary welfare allowance shall be paid to a person by way of a single payment to meet an exceptional need.&rdquo; <\/p><p>The legislation does not confer a statutory right or entitlement to ENPs. The principle consideration in making a payment under the ENP scheme is to address a particular once-off and exceptional need which is not of an expected or recurring nature and is therefore unforeseen. <\/p><p>The guidelines issued to staff administering the scheme assist them in the decision making process. However, they do not affect the discretion available to officers in issuing an ENP to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise. Any person who considers that they have an entitlement to an ENP should contact my Department. <\/p><p>The Deputies will be aware that my Department has re-engineered its business model to support the provision of integrated services across all business streams involved in the delivery of localised services.  As part of this strategy, the Department is engaged in the delivery of integrated Intreo centres, which provide a full range of services, including the Community Welfare Service (CWS), generally available in one location. <\/p><p>People claiming supports under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme generally only interact with the Department on an occasional basis, for example, when seeking an exceptional needs payment or in claiming additional supports such as rent supplement, which are usually reviewed once to twice yearly.  The availability of the CWS during normal office hours is therefore sufficient for general day to day requirements.  In the event of emergency situations such as that in response to severe flooding, emergency clinics are established as required.<\/p><p>Statistics are maintained relating to payments under the ENP scheme, however they are not maintained on the number of applications or the outcome of those applications.  The number of ENPs made on a monthly basis in each of the past twelve months to date is contained in the attached tabular statement.  For reporting purposes this data includes numbers of urgent needs payments (UNP). A UNP is a once-off payment made to persons who would not normally qualify for SWA but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or an alternative is not available at that time. <\/p><p>I can assure the Deputies that the ENP scheme is kept under review to ensure that it continues to support those most in need of assistance.  I trust this clarifies the matter.<\/p><p><b>Tabular Statement <\/b><\/p><p><b>Number of Exceptional Needs Payments and Urgent Needs Payments in each month for the past twelve months to date:<\/b><table><tr><th>Month<\/th><th>Number of Payments (Rounded)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>November 2016<\/td><td>9,400<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>December 2016<\/td><td>9,100<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>January 2017<\/td><td>7,700<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>February 2017<\/td><td>8,500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>March 2017<\/td><td>9,200<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>April 2017<\/td><td>7,600<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>May 2017<\/td><td>9,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>June 2017<\/td><td>8,300<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>July 2017<\/td><td>8,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>August  2017<\/td><td>8,900<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>September  2017<\/td><td>8,900<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>October 2017<\/td><td>8,800<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700112#WRXX02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Benefit Applications","counter":3180,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700112#WRXX02300"},{"type":"question","counter":3181,"qnumday":1182,"qnumall":"[45764\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700112#WRXX02400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when a decision on an application by a person (details supplied) in County Kerry for carer's benefit will issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":3182,"content":"<p>I confirm that my Department received an application for carer's benefit from the person concerned on 31 August 2017. <\/p><p>The application is currently being processed and once completed, the person concerned will be notified directly of the outcome. <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700112#WRXX02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights","counter":3183,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700112#WRXX02600"},{"type":"question","counter":3184,"qnumday":1183,"qnumall":"[45766\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700112#WRXX02700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if concerns have been raised with her office in regard to working conditions at a company (details supplied) contracted for security services by her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":3185,"content":"<p>No concerns have been raised with my Department in relation to the non-payment of holiday pay or breaches of the Organisation of Working Time Act by the SAR group. <\/p>  <p>  SAR Group are obliged under their contract with my Department to comply with all Legislative requirements including the Organisation of Working Time Act.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is aware that SAR Group underwent a WRC inspection last year.

The Department and An Post agreed a protocol in 2014 governing the forms of identification which claimants, or their agents, must produce in order to collect payments.  There has been no change in this agreed protocol or in the forms of identification required of claimants to collect their social welfare payments.  <\/p><p>Social welfare claimants must present one of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payment cards when collecting payments.  These cards are; the Public Services Card, the Social Services Card and the Temporary Payment Card.<\/p><p>The Public Services Card, or PSC, is an identity token, issued by the Department, following a face to face registration process which involves the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature plus the verification of identity data already held by the Department.  No other identification is required of clients when a PSC is presented.<\/p><p>The Social Services Card, or SSC, is a payment token, used to collect DSP payments.  The token is issued to claimants who have not yet been registered for and received a PSC.  If presenting for payment with an SSC, a person must also provide additional identification.  Ideally this should photographic.  Acceptable forms of photographic ID are:<\/p><p>- Current Passport (For Irish and UK passport holders, a passport which has expired within the previous 12 months is acceptable)<\/p><p>- Current (in date) National ID card for EU citizens other than Ireland or UK<\/p><p>- Current (in date) Irish or UK Drivers Licence or Irish Driver Learner Permit<\/p><p>- Current (in date) Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) Card<\/p><p>- Emergency Photo ID produced by the Department.<\/p><p>If a claimant holds an SSC but does not have appropriate photographic ID then the following documents are acceptable:<\/p><p>- Medical Card and Proof of Address<\/p><p>- Bank Card and Proof of Address<\/p><p>- Recent work ID and Proof of Address<\/p><p>- Recent communication from Public Service body or Local Authority and Proof of Address<\/p><p>If a customer holds an SSC but is unable to present either acceptable Photo ID or alternative ID, An Post may make payment based on the personal validation of the Post Office staff on the basis that the customer is known to them by sight and name.  <\/p><p>Finally the Temporary Payment Card is a paper document issued by the Department for short-term use by a claimant pending receipt of a PSC or SSC.  A temporary payment card is valid for a specific period.  An Post may not accept the Temporary Payment Card without the additional forms of identification listed above for the SSC.<\/p><p>In addition to the identity requirements for claimants collecting in person, post offices are obliged to apply the following controls in respect of payments collected by authorised agents.  These agents are of two types; temporary and permanent.  <\/p><p>Payment should only be made to a temporary agent on presentation of the following:<\/p><p>- A Temporary Agent form (TA1) signed by the claimant authorising the agent to collect their payments.<\/p><p>- The claimant&rsquo;s PSC, SSC or Temporary Card<\/p><p>- The Agent&rsquo;s own photo ID.  Acceptable forms of photo ID are the same as set out for SSC card.<\/p><p>The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection also obliges An Post to further validate the identity of the person presenting for payment by carrying out a PPSN or date of birth check against the payment data on the post office counter screen.  The post office teller is also required to record the date and time of the transaction, the post office reference number, the customer details contained in the payment record, the payment scheme and amount plus the type of identification presented.<\/p><p>This data is necessary for the reconciliation of the An Post cashed payment records against the Department&rsquo;s issued payment records.  It is also essential in order to investigate cases of suspected fraud.  <\/p><p>An Post have recently begun the roll out of an automated system to allow tellers to more easily record this data.  While it might appear to the person across the counter that new data is being collected, in fact it is simply a more automated method to record the same payment transaction details that have been captured by post office tellers since the commencement of the current contract in 2014.

In the case of individuals who more than one income source, PRSI is generally paid on all forms of income.  <\/p>  <p>  Prior to 2013, exemptions from PRSI applied to the self-employed income of specific groups.  These exemptions have since been abolished. <\/p>  <p>  In 2013, modified rate employees contributors (i.e. civil and public servants recruited prior to 1995) who also have earned self-employed income or unearned income over &euro;5,000 became liable, for the first time, to pay PRSI on that income.  This income is liable at the class K rate of 4% and recorded as K9.  Entitlement to social insurance benefits does not accrue from the payment of this charge.  <\/p>  <p>  Since 2014, all employees (in the public and private sector) and occupational pensioners under 66 years, with unearned income only, are liable to pay Class K PRSI on that unearned income where it exceeds &euro;5,000.    Class K PRSI is charged at 4% and recorded as class K9 and does not give access to social insurance entitlements based on the payment of the charge.  Prior to 2014 these employees were exempt from PRSI on such unearned income, which includes rental and investment income, dividends and interest on deposits.    This provision applies to all employees, regardless of the PRSI class they pay on their employment income.  <\/p>  <p>  All workers pay PRSI on their earnings from employment.  If an employee has income from self-employment e.g. taxi driver, farmer etc. he or she also pays PRSI as a self-employed contributor on the profits from, say, the taxi driving plus any other unearned income he or she might have e.g. rental income.  The measure to charge class K PRSI on employees who were previously exempt was introduced to ensure equity by ensuring that PRSI is chargeable, regardless of the source of the employee&rsquo;s additional income.  <\/p>  <p>  Employees paying class K PRSI on unearned income can generate entitlement to social insurance benefits based on PRSI they pay on their employment income.  Class A employees with unearned income already have access to the full range of social insurance benefits, because of their PRSI class A status.  Modified rate employees have access to a limited range of social insurance benefits but have entitlement to generous Exchequer-funded occupational pensions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700112#WRXX04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Waiting Times","counter":3201,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700112#WRXX04200"},{"type":"question","counter":3202,"qnumday":1190,"qnumall":"[45824\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700112#WRXX04300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the processing time for payments (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":3203,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is detailed in the following table:<table><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Number of Claims Pending and Average Time to Award by Scheme at 30 September 2017<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Schemes<\/td><td>Average time to award (weeks)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension Contributory (Dom)<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Widow, Widower&rsquo;s and Surviving Civil Partners Contributory Pension <\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Widowed Parent Grant<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension Non-Contributory<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care Allowance<\/td><td>19<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carer's Allowance<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carer's Benefit<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700112#WRXX04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Data","counter":3204,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700112#WRXX04500"},{"type":"question","counter":3205,"qnumday":1191,"qnumall":"[45833\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700112#WRXX04600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of applications received in relation to the artist's social welfare pilot scheme; the number of persons in receipt of welfare payments in respect of the scheme; the number of applications refused; the reasons therefor; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":3206,"content":"<p>The jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes provide income support for people who have lost work and are unable to find alternative full-time employment.

There are two State pensions. Firstly, the State pension non-contributory is a means-tested pension funded from taxation. Secondly, the State pension contributory, which is not means-tested, but is based on social insurance contributions, is paid from the Social Insurance Fund. Accordingly, it is important to ensure those qualifying for the State pension contributory have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions, paid or credited, over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.   <\/p>  <p>  The idea of a universal State pension, paid at full rate to everyone over 66, regardless of their contributions or their means, has been proposed on a number of occasions, and officials in my Department have examined such proposals a number of times. There are significant issues regarding the scope such a pension would have, particularly in respect of its interaction with public service pensions, and with occupational pensions in companies that were previously part of the public service. Additionally, consideration would have to be given to the treatment of retirees who are not resident in the State, but who have built up a contributory pension entitlement over the years that they worked here and paid PRSI. There are also potential legal issues regarding treating occupational pensions differently when they are in the public or private sector.   <\/p>  <p>  These factors make precise costing of such a pension challenging. However, it is clear that regardless of decisions made regarding these factors, the cost would be very substantial, and officials in my Department believe that the additional cost could be expected to be over &euro;1 billion per annum, and potentially substantially more depending on some factors. <\/p>  <p>  Clearly, this would either be very expensive or, if introduced on a cost-neutral basis, require very significant diversion of funds from elsewhere, e.g. a 14% reduction in the current rate of the State pension, substantial increases in the rate of PRSI deductions, or equivalent measures reducing tax relief on occupational and private pensions, which would impact very significantly upon the take-home pay of the workers affected, and act as a disincentive to such pension provision. <\/p>  <p>  This would be difficult to justify given that the biggest beneficiaries would be people who, not only contributed less to the Social Insurance Fund, but who have significant additional means, resulting in their not qualifying for a non-contributory pension. Those who contributed most to the system, including those with no additional means, and widows depending on a single pension from the state, would receive no benefit at all from the additional spending involved. However, such people could be significantly impacted by any subsequent restraint in increases in the rate of the pension caused by the larger state pension bill faced by the Exchequer.   <\/p>  <p>  As a result of these reasons, I have no plans to introduce such a pension.   <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700112#WRXX05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Websites","counter":3222,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700112#WRXX06000"},{"type":"question","counter":3223,"qnumday":1197,"qnumall":"[45859\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700112#WRXX06100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the external company undertaking an audit of her departmental website; the cost of the audit; the timeframe for its completion; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":3224,"content":"<p>The Department&rsquo;s external website (www.welfare.ie) currently acts as the core information link between the Department and its customers and stakeholders.<\/p><p>With some 7.9m visits and 4.3m unique visits during the period from October 2016 to October 2017, it is a central source of up to date information on the schemes, programmes and initiatives provided by the Department.  <\/p><p>It is important that the Department&rsquo;s website keeps pace with changes in website and user interface design in order to provide a modern, responsive and accessible website that more fully meets a wide range of customer information needs and expectations.  <\/p><p>The last independent strategic review of the website was undertaken in 2006 and the last design update of the Department&rsquo;s current website took place in 2011.

There are two State pensions.  Firstly, the State pension non-contributory is a means-tested pension funded from taxation.  Secondly, the State pension contributory, which is based on social insurance contributions rather than a means-test, is paid from the Social Insurance Fund.  Accordingly, it is important to ensure those qualifying for a State pension contributory have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions, paid or credited, over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p><p>The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension contributory easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension.  Backdating it in respect of periods before its introduction in 1994 is estimated to cost &euro;290 million per year, and this figure would rise annually and at a faster rate than the overall cost<b><\/b>of State pensions.<\/p><p>It is clear that this is a very substantial sum, which is not affordable without very significant cut-backs in other areas.  Therefore, a change along the lines suggested in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, where everyone affected by the 1994 cut-off point for the Homemakers scheme would receive a maximum rate pension, is not a feasible option at the present time. <\/p><p>Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension non-contributory, which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.<\/p><p>It is planned that a total contributions approach will replace the yearly average approach from around 2020.

During the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.

The ten year strategy is a cross-Government approach co-ordinated by the Department of Justice and Equality and provides a roadmap to ensure that people with a disability who are able to and want to work are supported and enabled to do so.<\/p>  <p>  As part of delivering on my Department&rsquo;s commitment, an interdepartmental &ldquo;Make Work Pay&rdquo; group was established and its report, published earlier this year, included a number of recommendations designed to assist people with disabilities achieve their employment ambitions.  In launching the report, the Government announced that people with a long-term disability payment who move off the payment to get a job will retain their free travel pass for a period of five years. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has also accepted the report&rsquo;s recommendation to dispense with the requirement that work be of a &lsquo;rehabilitative nature&rsquo; for the disability allowance earnings disregard.  This means that a report from a doctor is no longer required before commencing work and that the focus is on capacity rather than incapacity.  The legislative provisions giving effect to this measure are included in the Social Welfare Pensions and Civil Registration Bill, 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Other recommendations relate to extending the principle of early engagement to disability allowance and other disability payments.  In keeping with the Government promise for a process of consultation with people with disabilities, their parents and the disability sector, my Department, with the assistance of a Make Work Pay Disability Stakeholders Focus Group and an independent external facilitator, has been co-designing an extensive consultation process about the Make Work Pay recommendations on early engagement. There has also been progress on ensuring a fast track return to welfare payments for people with disabilities, who having taken up or returned to work, are unable to continue in employment.<\/p>  <p>  The Ability programme, which was launched in September 2017, is aimed at bringing young people with disabilities, who are not work-ready, closer to the labour market. The programme will promote employment prospects and meaningful social roles for young people with disabilities and in particular, young people who are distant from the labour market using a range of person-centred supports. <\/p>  <p>  The focus of the programme will be on projects aimed at young people with disabilities (aged 15 &ndash; 29) and designed to assist in their transition from school to further education and employment. The funding for this programme will amount to some &euro;10 million over a three year period and is co-funded by the Irish Exchequer and the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning operational programme, 2014-2020 (PEIL, 2014 &ndash; 20).<\/p>  <p>  Also under the CES, my Department has in recent years rolled out its full Intreo service to people with disabilities who wish to avail of the service on a voluntary basis.  In such cases, people with disabilities who present at an Intreo Centre will be offered an interview by an employment support officer with a view to agreeing a suitable progression plan. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2018, I announced the introduction of the Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS). This is a new work experience scheme which will be available to jobseekers and other eligible cohorts including people with disabilities in receipt of disability allowance and blind person&rsquo;s pension.  Participation in YESS will be voluntary and the net weekly payment for a person working 30 hours per week will be &euro;283.96.  A designated case officer will liaise with the participant and the host organisation throughout the period of placement, which will generally be for 3 months, and each placement will involve defined learning and development outcomes for the participant.<\/p>  <p>  Progress in implementing actions under the Strategy is regularly reported by the Department to the Comprehensive Employment Strategy Implementation Group. The Chair of this Group, Mr Fergus Finlay, presented his first progress report in March 2017.

JA is a means tested social assistance payment whereas JB is a contribution based insurance scheme.  The 2017 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;2.5 billion.<\/p>  <p>  It is important in the interests of equity and fairness that the conditions for receipt of a jobseekers payment apply to all recipients, including those who could be categorised as seasonal and part-time workers.  <\/p>  <p>  One of the conditions for receipt of JB is that the person must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 in order to qualify.  However, there are circumstances where it is possible for a person to be engaged in employment (either insurable or self-employment) on a given day and still satisfy the unemployment condition for that day.  This type of employment is known as &lsquo;subsidiary employment&rsquo;.  In order to be deemed &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo;, the employment must be capable of being carried out outside the ordinary working hours of person&rsquo;s &ldquo;usual employment&rdquo;.  In addition, the employment is subject to a daily earnings limit of &euro;12.70 per day unless the person has more than 117 contributions paid in the preceding three years from the date of their claim (in which case no earnings limit is applicable).   <\/p>  <p>  Where a person exhausts their entitlement to JB, they must pay 13 additional PRSI contributions after the last day of payment in order to re-qualify.  The 13 contributions needed to re-qualify for JB can be paid in respect of full time employment, seasonal employment, part-time employment or casual employment.  If a seasonal or a part time worker meets this requirement they may re-qualify for JB.  This requirement is in place to ensure the person has a reasonable connection with the labour market before he or she can re-qualify for payment.  If a person does not re-qualify for JB or has used up his or her entitlement to JB, then he or she can apply for JA.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 I provided for an increase of &euro;5 per week in the maximum personal rates of all weekly payments, including JA and JB as well as proportionate increases in weekly payments for qualified adults and a &euro;2 per week increases in payments in respect of qualified children.  These increases will come into effect from the week beginning 26 March 2018.  There are no changes to the qualifying conditions to the JA or JB schemes.<\/p>  <p>  An Taoiseach, in his previous role as Minister for Social Protection, gave a commitment at D&aacute;il report stage of the Social Welfare Bill 2016 that he would ask officials to examine the issue of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the treatment of part-time and seasonal workers, including those categorised as having subsidiary employment.

This includes enhancing the position of the self-employed through a supportive tax regime and, very importantly, improving the level of PRSI based benefits available to self-employed people.   <\/p>  <p>  Self-employed people who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year, are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.   This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and paternity benefit.  <\/p>  <p>  Since March 2017, the self-employed have access to the treatment benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental examinations, and contributions towards the cost of hearing aids.  Treatment benefit entitlements were also extended from October 2017 so as to provide further dental and optical benefits. <\/p>  <p>  Even more significantly, self-employed contributors will be eligible for the invalidity pension from December 2017.  For the first time, this will give the self-employed access to the safety net of State income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability without having to go through a means test.  This is a real advance in the level of cover available to the self-employed.<\/p>  <p>  The extension of additional social insurance cover for the self-employed to other benefits on a phased basis in future Budgets, is being considered.  This will have to take account of the cost of providing such cover, including implications for the long-term financing of social insurance benefits generally.  While the social insurance fund currently has a surplus, it faces significant financial challenges in the years ahead in order to ensure adequate and sustainable social insurance pensions and benefits for a growing and aging population. <\/p>  <p>The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published on 18 October 2017.  The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.<\/p>  <p>  The review found that while the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure it will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards over the medium to long term, as the aging of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  As referenced above self-employed workers will be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017 and the cost of this introduction has been factored into the actuarial review.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.<\/p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  <\/p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.<\/p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable only to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension (contributory).  <\/p>  <p>  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.

The necessary legislation to effect the recommendations of the National Pensions Board was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997 (now incorporated in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005) which provided for the implementation of the change in two stages, with the paid contribution requirement being standardised at 260 from 2002, rising to 520 from April 2012.  This condition applies for all new claims to the State pension (contributory).<\/p>  <p>  The Yearly Averaging method of calculating the level of entitlement has been used since the introduction of the State Pension (contributory) in 1961.  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension contributory easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the increase in paid contributions required, from 260 to 520, does not impact upon the yearly average calculation, which is still calculated in the normal way.  It should also be noted that backdating the Homemakers scheme, which was introduced in 1994 and took effect from that date, would not assist someone with insufficient paid contributions to qualify for a contributory pension, as it involves the disregard of years, rather than the creation of paid contributions.<\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension non-contributory, which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.<\/p>  <p>  It is planned that a total contributions approach will replace the yearly average approach from around 2020.

The rate bands prior to 2000 were less generous, and the improved rate bands introduced in 2000 were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time.  The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension, which many pensioners were solely dependent on, were maintained. Instead, the rates for people who had additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced. <\/p>  <p>  The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are not proportionate with their level of contribution.  A person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still get an 85% pension.  Had all pensions been cut, regardless of means and contribution records, the hardest hit would have been pensioners with no additional incomes, those paid a State pension non-contributory, and widows and widowers living alone on only one pension payment. <\/p>  <p>  People on the lower rate bands with other income, which meant they did not qualify for a non-contributory pension which is paid at a rate of over 95% of the contributory pension, are generally in a better financial position than those solely dependent on the non-contributory pension, as otherwise they could claim that payment instead.  Changing these bands would give additional money to people who already have means.  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10-12 million each following year.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is examining in depth whether the 2012 rate band changes have impacted disproportionately or unfairly on specific groups in relation to the contributions they have made for the pensions they receive.  If that is the case, measures to alleviate that impact on people who, as a result of homemaking duties, have reduced pension entitlements following the 2012 changes, would be considered.  Such measures should be more targeted than a simple reversion to the previous rate bands, which would benefit many people with significant additional means, and who in many cases, despite making limited PRSI contributions over the years, were not involved in homemaking.<\/p>  <p>  It is intended to introduce a total contributions approach for new pensioners from around 2020.

All non-contributory recipients are accepted as satisfying this means test. <\/p><p>A fuel applicant and members of his\/her household may have a combined assessable income of up to &euro;100 a week above the appropriate rate of State Pension Contributory and qualify for a payment.  This ensures that the fuel allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.  The &euro;100 a week means limit is significantly higher that the weekly fuel allowance rate of &euro;22.50 and also the combined weekly total of household benefits and fuel allowance added together (&euro;33.65).  <\/p><p>Fuel applicants must also satisfy the household composition criteria, i.e., they must live alone or only with the following: <\/p><p>-a qualified spouse\/civil partner\/cohabitant or qualified child(ren);  <\/p><p>-a person in receipt of a qualifying payment who would  be entitled to the allowance in their own right;  <\/p><p>-a person who is receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit in respect of providing full time care and attention to the Fuel Allowance applicant or their qualified spouse \/ civil partner \/ cohabitant or qualified child(ren); <\/p><p>-a person receiving short term Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) or Basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (less than 391 days for JA and less than 15 months\/456 days for Basic SWA).<\/p><p>Therefore a social welfare dependant who is living with someone other than those listed above would not be entitled to the fuel allowance.  <\/p><p>The Guidelines for the Fuel Allowance Scheme are kept under review.  However, any decision to change the household composition requirement and to increase the combined assessable income for a household would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  <\/p><p>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs due to ill health or infirmity.  Exceptional needs payments may also be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which a person is unable to meet from his\/her own resources.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700115#WRAAA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Eligibility","counter":3436,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700115#WRAAA02000"},{"type":"question","counter":3437,"qnumday":1274,"qnumall":"[47010\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700115#WRAAA02100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the extent to which State pension contributions will be enhanced in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":3438,"content":"<p>Entitlement to state pension (contributory) is assessed on the basis of an applicant&rsquo;s social insurance record and the eligibility conditions applicable on the date they reach pension age.<\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to determine a person&rsquo;s pension entitlement until a pension application is received in the Department from the individual, and their social insurance record is examined by a Deciding Officer.

The scheme allows for up to 20 years (since 1994) spent caring for children less than 12 years of age, or for an incapacitated person(s), to be disregarded for pension calculation purposes.

As a result appeal processing times improved year on year between 2011\/2012 and 2016 as evidenced in the attached tables.  For example, the average time taken to determine an appeal requiring an oral hearing reduced from 52.5 weeks in 2011 to 28.6 weeks in 2014, 25.5 weeks in 2015 and 24.1 weeks in 2016.  The average time taken to finalise an appeal decided by way of a summary decision reduced from 25.1 weeks in 2011 to 21.1 weeks in 2014, 18.1 weeks in 2015, and 17.6 weeks in 2016.  <\/p><p>I understand from the Chief Appeals Officer that there has been a slight increase in overall appeal processing times to date in 2017 with appeals requiring an oral hearing taking an average of 26 weeks and summary decisions taking 20 weeks to finalise.  However she is hopeful that this will be addressed in the coming months as a number of newly appointed Appeals Officers who have replaced officers who retired become more experienced in their roles.<\/p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects all aspects of the appeal process including the time spent in the Department preparing the appeal submission.  The quasi-judicial nature of the system impacts on appeal processing times which are proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal which often require a high level of judgment, in addition to the need to ensure due process and natural justice. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that where a claimant has been refused a payment and is appealing the decision, the payment in question does not continue pending the completion of the appeal process.  In the event that the appeal is successful, the payment will be reinstated with effect from the date it was withdrawn.  However, if a person is appealing a decision and their means are insufficient to meet their needs pending the outcome of the appeal process, it is open to that person to apply at their local Intreo Centre for Supplementary Welfare Allowance in the interim.  If their application for Supplementary Welfare Allowance is not successful, they can also appeal that decision.  Supplementary Welfare Allowance appeals are prioritised for attention within the Social Welfare Appeals Office as soon as the appeal file and submission are received from the Department.<\/p><p>The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that every effort will continue to be made to improve appeal processing times. <\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p><p><b>Appeals processing times by scheme 01\/01\/2014 &ndash;

Overall, 59.2% of the 23,220 appeals which were finalised in 2016 had a favourable outcome for the appellant, i.e. were either allowed in full or in part, or resolved by way of a revised decision by a Deciding Officer\/Designated Person.  To date in 2017, 59.4% of the 15,551 appeals finalised have had a favourable outcome for the appellant.<\/p><p>Of the 16,990 appeals which were finalised by Appeals Officers in 2016, 6,527 (38.4%) were determined following an oral hearing.  4,251 (65.1%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.  Of the 10,786 appeals finalised by Appeals Officers to date in 2017, 4,554 (42.2%) were determined following an oral hearing.  2,853 (62.6%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.<\/p><p>There are a number of reasons why a decision which was refused at first instance might be successful on appeal and it is not necessarily the case that the first decision was wrong. <\/p><p>Where new evidence is provided with an appeal the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person as was the case in some 37 per cent of favourable appeal outcomes in 2016.  Where the decision was not revised in the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds and in addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at oral hearing which may influence the outcome of the appeal.<\/p><p>Decisions concerning entitlement to a social welfare payment or insurability of employment often require a high level of judgment and may involve complex legal questions.  The Courts have found that decision makers are required to be free and unrestricted in discharging their functions.<\/p><p>Where an appellant requests an oral hearing, the request is generally granted unless the Appeals Officer is of the opinion that the appeal can be allowed on a summary basis, or where there is clearly nothing to be gained by granting an oral hearing, for example where the appeal question relates to contribution conditions or means and the underlying PRSI contribution figures or means are not disputed.  Social Welfare legislation provides that an Appeal Officer may determine an appeal without an oral hearing where s\/he is of the opinion that it can be determined fairly on the basis of the documentary evidence provided.  In general, where there is a conflict in the documentary evidence presented, an Appeals Officer will convene an oral hearing in order to explore the evidence and seek to resolve any conflict.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700115#WRAAA04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3462,"content":"<p>Question No. 1284 answered with Question No. 1252.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Welfare Services Provision","counter":3463,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700115#WRAAA04700"},{"type":"question","counter":3464,"qnumday":1285,"qnumall":"[47118\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700115#WRAAA04800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the extent to which community welfare services remain readily accessible in all areas throughout County Kildare, with particular reference to meeting out-of-hours and emergency needs when necessary; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":3465,"content":"<p>County Kildare is administered by 3 separate departmental divisions, for the purposes of the provision of community welfare services to its customers.

In this regard, action 5.1 of Rebuilding Ireland commits to the development of a national vacant housing reuse strategy, informed by Census 2016 data. \u00a0<\/p><p>To this end, the Housing Agency established a working group comprising senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and from the Housing Agency itself to inform the strategy.  My Department has received the output from the work of this group and is presently engaging with key Departments and agencies to consider the analysis and agree on the recommended actions prior to publication. <\/p><p>Ahead of finalisation of the strategy, it is important to note that my Department has already introduced a number of significant measures under pillar 5 of Rebuilding Ireland to incentivise the increased use of vacant housing stock to help meet the needs of those in receipt of social housing assistance.  These initiatives include the Repair and Leasing Scheme, the Buy and Renew Scheme, and the Housing Agency Acquisitions Fund.  My Department will continue to engage actively with local authorities, working together with the housing bodies, to maximise delivery from these schemes, particularly in respect of the repair and leasing scheme, and to progress the wider range of actions to be finalised as part of the broader vacant house reuse strategy.<\/p><p>I also announced, in August 2017, a number of key actions already being taken by my Department and local authorities to quickly progress the delivery of vacant homes back into use as soon as possible.  These actions included the preparation of  city action plans for the Dublin area and the four other main cities which are\u00a0currently being developed with a view to being finalised and submitted to\u00a0my Department as soon as possible,\u00a0supporting these local authorities in bringing\u00a0 as many vacant properties as possible back into use expeditiously.<\/p><p>Also, the Housing Assistance Payment does facilitate inter-authority movement for persons qualified for social housing support.  The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a flexible and immediate housing support that is available to all eligible households throughout the State.  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector, which best suits their needs in their area of choice.\u00a0\u00a0The flexibility of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) as a social housing support is one of the scheme&rsquo;s key characteristics and was one of the primary benefits envisaged at the outset of the scheme.  Since April 2017, local authorities can facilitate incidences where a HAP applicant wishes to have their housing need met in a different local authority area.\u00a0 In cases where a household, currently on a local authority waiting list, for example in Dublin and wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area, local authorities have been directed to provide that HAP tenants continue to be dealt with by their originating local authority.  However, the rent limits will be those that apply in the local authority where the property is situated. The originating local authority will engage with the relevant new local authority to facilitate eligible requests for inter-authority movement under the HAP scheme.  In order to maintain the equitable treatment of all housing applicants, inter-authority movement for HAP applicants is based on the current Social Housing Eligibility Income Bands, i.e. movement will only be facilitated across local authorities with Income Bands that are equal or higher; or where shared areas of choice are already operated.  The current Social Housing Eligibility Income Bands are available on my Department's website at the following link: <\/p><p><i>.<\/i><\/p><p>Following the outcomes of the first phase of my review of Rebuilding Ireland,  I announced a number of new measures and initiatives in relation to the delivery of social housing and, as part of Budget 2018, the funding for housing is being\u00a0increased by 46% to &euro;1.9bn next year to enable the social housing needs of 25,500\u00a0households to be met through measures including HAP, new builds, acquisition and leasing.<\/p><p>Arising from the recent Housing Summit, I announced that homeless families in Dublin wishing to move to locations outside Dublin will be facilitated where possible<b>.  <\/b>My Department is currently working with local authorities to ensure that a<b><\/b>Place Finder Service is in place in each local authority\u00a0to \u00a0assist these homeless households who wish to relocate to access a suitable property, as well as providing them with advice and support in establishing their new lives in a different local authority area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700116#WRBBB02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","counter":3509,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700116#WRBBB03000"},{"type":"question","counter":3510,"qnumday":1302,"qnumall":"[45801\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700116#WRBBB03100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the resources available to support local groups seeking to meet their housing needs through the co-operative housing model; his plans to issue a circular to local authorities encouraging support for co-operative housing groups including the provision of low-cost sites; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":3511,"qnumday":1329,"qnumall":"[46444\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700116#WRBBB03200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the progress made in regard to the introduction of an affordable housing scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":3512,"qnumday":1357,"qnumall":"[46974\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700116#WRBBB03300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the date on which he plans to introduce a new affordable housing scheme; the way in which it will differ from the scheme of 2011; the criteria of eligibility for the new scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":3513,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1302, 1329 and 1357 together.<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously signalled, the Government recognises the housing affordability pressures faced by households with low to moderate income in parts of the country where housing costs are highest.

In light of weather forecasts and Met &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s indication that they would likely be issuing a RED LEVEL weather warning for Atlantic Coastal counties and an ORANGE LEVEL for the remainder of the country, a final decision was made by the National Director on Friday afternoon to convene a NECG meeting for Sunday 15 October and I was informed accordingly.<\/p><p>The preparatory work continued on Saturday 14 October and the NECG met in the National Emergency Coordination Centre on the morning of Sunday 15 October to review the latest information relating to Storm Ophelia, to review preparedness for the anticipated storm and to issue appropriate public safety messages.  Met &Eacute;ireann continued to work with the NDFEM throughout the day and RED LEVEL wind warnings were issued for the entire country on Sunday evening.<\/p><p>Work on monitoring the arrival of the storm began at 06:00 hrs on Monday 16 October.  The NECG met formally three times on Monday 16 October to assess the impact of Storm Ophelia as it moved up the country and to identify emerging issues.  The objective of Monday&rsquo;s NECG meetings was to bring all Government Departments and relevant services together to manage national level issues and support the local response.  The operation in the National Emergency Coordination Centre enabled continuous updating and provision of the latest information regarding the impacts of the storm to the public.  It also enabled consistent public safety messaging as the storm impacted on different areas of the country.  <\/p><p>The NECG met twice on Tuesday 17 October to coordinate the activities of the agencies involved with clean-up and recovery, with a view to prioritising restoration of critical infrastructure.  The NECG also collated updates on the post-storm situation and assessed emerging issues in the aftermath of the storm, as well as providing the focus for public information.<\/p><p>The NECG met at 14:00 hrs on Wednesday 18 October to review the ongoing clean-up, service restoration and recovery operations.  Given the situation at the time, and in light of the very considerable progress already made in clearing roads at that stage and the local authorities&rsquo; capacity to manage the situation at local level, the decision was taken by the Chair to stand down the NECG as a formal national level co-ordination mechanism.  However, the NDFEM continued to liaise with national infrastructure providers and local authorities and took any actions that were deemed necessary.<\/p><p>Over the course of this emergency the NECG met a total of seven times.  I attended the three NECG meetings on Monday 16 October and the two meetings on Tuesday 17 October.  My colleague, Minister of State Damien English T.D., attended the NECG meeting on Sunday 15 October, the three meetings on Monday 16 October and the two meetings on Tuesday 17 October.  An Taoiseach Mr. Leo Varadkar T.D. attended meetings on Monday 16 October and on Tuesday 17 October and Mr. Paul Kehoe T.D., Minister of State with Special Responsibility for Defence, Mr. Shane Ross T.D., Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Mr. Kevin &ldquo;Boxer&rdquo; Moran T.D., Minister of State for the Office of Public Works and Flood Relief attended at various times between 15 and 18 October.<\/p><p>A full list of the Government Departments, Agencies, national infrastructure providers and other organisations that attended the NECG are listed below:  <table><tr><th>Department of Finance <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Department of An Taoiseach <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Department of Justice and Equality <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Department of Public Expenditure and Reform <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Department of Education and Skills <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Department of Defence <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Department of Children and Youth Affairs <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Department of Health <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Office of the Revenue Commissioners <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Office of Public Works <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Health Service Executive <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Office of the Government Chief Information Officer <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Environmental Protection Agency <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>County and City Management Association <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Office of Emergency Planning <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Defence Forces <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Irish Coastguard <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Civil Defence <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Met &Eacute;ireann <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Electricity Supply Board Networks <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bord G&aacute;is <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin Bus <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bus &Eacute;ireann <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Transdev\/Luas <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Eirgrid <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Irish Water <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>An Taoiseach, Mr. Leo Varadkar T.D. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mr. Eoghan Murphy T.D., Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mr. Damien English T.D., Minister of State for Housing and Urban Development <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mr. Paul Kehoe T.D., Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and Defence with Special Responsibility for Defence <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mr. Kevin &ldquo;Boxer&rdquo; Moran T.D., Minister of State for the Office of Public Works and Flood Relief <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mr. Shane Ross T.D., Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700116#WRBBB05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Functions","counter":3535,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700116#WRBBB05800"},{"type":"question","counter":3536,"qnumday":1310,"qnumall":"[45953\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700116#WRBBB05900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his Department encourages and facilitates town twinning; the role of local authorities in this regard; the procedures to be adhered to in order to effect a town twinning; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Of the 3,765 cases submitted, 2,909 were ineligible or terminated during the process.  Of the remaining cases submitted, 282 have been completed, and the remaining 574 are actively being progressed. <\/p><p>The Housing Agency publishes, on a quarterly basis, detailed statistical information on the operation of the MTR scheme, including the number of applications that have been received, the number of completed cases and the number of cases that have been terminated and the reasons for same.  This information is available on the Agency's website at the following link:<\/p><p> .<\/p><p>The reasons why a case may not have progressed are varied and can depend on the lender, the property, the household and the ability of the AHB sector to increase their involvement in the scheme.  Following a Review of the Mortgage to Rent (MTR) Scheme, published on 8 February 2017, a range of amendments to the eligibility criteria and administration of the MTR scheme came into effect to enable more properties to qualify and to make the scheme more flexible and accessible to borrowers. The Review, available at the following link: , explored the impediments to participation in the scheme and recommended a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers.  Key changes include:<\/p><p>- Lenders are now required to formally communicate with borrowers as to why they are not suitable for the scheme; <\/p><p>- The property price threshold for a house in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow has been increased to &euro;365,000 (from &euro;350,000) while the threshold for an apartment \/ townhouse in these areas has been increased to &euro;310,000 (from &euro;300,000).  For the rest of the country, the threshold for a house has been increased to &euro;280,000 (from &euro;250,000) and for an apartment \/ townhouse to &euro;210,000 (from &euro;190,000); <\/p><p>- Flexibility has been provided in relation to the size of properties which qualify for the scheme.  In practical terms, this means that an assessment of the property size suitable to a particular household now allows for a maximum of two additional bedrooms in the property above the actual needs of the household, with the property still being considered eligible; <\/p><p>- The administrative process has been streamlined, including certain steps of the MTR process now being required to be completed prior to the submission of a completed MTR application to the Housing Agency;<\/p><p>-  There are a number of actions to improve knowledge and understanding of the scheme.  A range of state agencies are being facilitated to assist and guide borrowers who could benefit from the scheme.  <\/p><p>My Department and the Housing Agency are working with all stakeholders to ensure that the actions set out in the Review are being effectively implemented to benefit a greater number of households.  I am providing an additional &euro;5m for the MTR scheme in 2018, which will support at least 250 additional MTR cases to be completed by Approved Housing Bodies working together with lenders using the existing MTR scheme.<\/p><p>The MTR Review also concluded that the current financial model of the MTR scheme may not, in its current configuration, be capable of delivering the scale of successful cases that could benefit from the scheme over time.  In order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency has been working with a number of financial entities who have expressed an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a number of alternative long-term lease arrangements.  In advance of these pilots and to establish the operability of an alternative financing approach, a targeted market testing exercise has been undertaken by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), to test the suitability of the proposed enhanced leasing arrangements to ascertain if they would be viable for a MTR cohort, taking account of the necessity to provide a long-term stable solution for eligible households.  <\/p><p>The responses to the market testing exercise have been reviewed by the Housing Agency and my Department.  A call for Expressions of Interest from bodies interested in pursuing pilot operating models was initiated by the Housing Agency on 26 October 2017. Once the Expressions of Interest process is concluded, the Housing Agency will make recommendations to my Department as to the make-up of the pilots, which can then be initiated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700117#WRCCC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3573,"content":"<p>Question No. 1323 answered with Question No. 1299.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Data","counter":3574,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700117#WRCCC01900"},{"type":"question","counter":3575,"qnumday":1324,"qnumall":"[46358\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700117#WRCCC02000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the average cost of providing public water to domestic customers of Irish Water; the average cost of providing wastewater services to domestic customers; if the subsidy to Irish Water is based on these costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":3576,"content":"<p>The Commission for Regulation of Utilities\u00a0(CRU) determined\u00a0in December 2016\u00a0the cost of water services for the two year period\u00a02017 and 2018 at &euro;1,843m (2015 prices).

In recognition of this, the Programme for a Partnership Government published in May 2016 set out\u00a0an ambitious priority for urban renewal with a view to breathing life back into\u00a0our urban centres and\u00a0helping to\u00a0make them more attractive places in which to live and work.  The subsequent Rebuilding Ireland\u00a0Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, published in July 2016,\u00a0reinforces the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the area of urban regeneration, and proposed a further range of measures. <\/p>  <p>  As announced in Budget 2018 last month, a new programme of &euro;50m in Exchequer funding, supplemented by an additional minimum 20% contribution from local authorities, is being introduced to support projects and initiatives to regenerate and revitalise depopulated urban areas.  A particular focus of the scheme will be on addressing vacancy and dereliction with a view to bringing properties back into productive use for housing and other purposes while also maximising linkages with other existing programmes such as the Repair and Leasing and Buy and Renew Schemes.  An initial &euro;10m is being made available in 2018 to get the programme underway.\u00a0 The\u00a0terms of the new scheme\u00a0will be finalised later this year, in consultation with local authorities and other relevant stakeholders, to maximise the potential outcomes from the available\u00a0funding.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Specific initiatives, the Repair and Leasing Initiative and the Buy and Renew Scheme, have been introduced to support efforts by local authorities to engage with property owners with a view to bringing vacant residential property back into use for social housing purposes.\u00a0 Further actions are also being developed to help address vacancy and dereliction.  In this regard,\u00a0action 5.9 of Rebuilding Ireland commits to reviewing planning legislation to allow the change of use of vacant commercial units in urban areas, including vacant or under-utilised areas over ground-floor premises, into residential units without having to go through the planning process.  This proposal is also incorporated in Action 6 of the Action Plan for Rural Development, launched in January 2017.  My Department is presently progressing the drafting of the necessary revisions to the planning regulations to give effect to this action and it is intended that the new regulations, which will require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, will be made as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to dereliction generally, the Derelict Sites Act 1990 imposes a general duty on every owner and occupier of land to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the land does not become or continue to be a derelict site.\u00a0 It also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of any appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become or continue to be a derelict site.\u00a0 In this context, local authorities have a range of powers to deal with derelict sites within their functional areas, including powers to require specified measures to be taken in relation to a derelict site, to impose a levy on sites which are included in the local authority&rsquo;s derelict sites register, or to compulsorily acquire any derelict site.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that Monaghan County Council has\u00a0been adopting a pro-active\u00a0approach on urban regeneration and addressing dereliction in its five main towns and to a lesser degree in\u00a0its villages since 2015.

The current fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three year average, equates to 6.9 deaths per million of population and is almost half what it was fifteen years ago when it stood at 11.9 deaths per million of population.  This level of fire fatalities positions Ireland among countries with lower fire fatality rates.<\/p>  <p>  KCS is based on the systems approach which emphasises the further development and enhancement of fire prevention and fire protection as well as fire service response.  KCS places an appropriate priority on isolated communities for Community Safety programmes to ensure that households in such areas are given advice on fire prevention and have smoke alarms and other appropriate fire protection facilities.  These measures are regarded as the most effective means of ensuring the safety of persons in the case of fire. Community fire safety initiatives involving the provision of fire prevention advice and installation of smoke alarms, fire blankets and fire extinguishers were developed and provided for off-shore island communities and are maintained and renewed as appropriate by the relevant local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a risk management approach which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires which occur as well as the fire protection measures in place.  Donegal County Council has undertaken an area risk categorisation process and Arranmore is classified as E2, which is the very low fire risk categorisation. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the existing arrangements for fire safety and fire fighting in isolated communities which are provided by fire authorities based on a risk management approach make the optimal use of available resources while providing a sufficient level of fire cover to these communities. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has channelled significant investment to fire authorities over the last number of years and as a consequence, the high quality of Ireland&rsquo;s fire service infrastructure is now widely acknowledged.<\/p>  <p>  Donegal County Council, in partnership with my Department, has made substantial progress in modernising fire stations in Co Donegal and has replaced 12 of the 15 fire stations following investment of some &euro;11 million by my Department over the last decade or so.<\/p>  <p>  In February 2016, my Department announced a five-year Fire Services Capital Programme with an allocation of &euro;40 million, based on the current annual &euro;8 million allocation, to be used for the building or upgrading of prioritised Fire Stations, purchase of fire appliances and specialist equipment, an upgrade of the Communications and Mobilisation system and improvements to Training Centres.<\/p>  <p>  A copy of the report referred to by the Deputy has been received in my Department. It is a matter for Donegal County Council to consider local fire cover needs and to submit any funding proposal to my Department for a new\/refurbished Fire Station in its functional area as it sees fit.  In considering any proposal, my Department will have regard to established national priorities for funding in this area and the totality of requests from fire authorities countrywide, as well as the value for money offered by the proposal.  <\/p>  <p>  I have no plans to amend the Fire Services Act to mandate that fire authorities provide fire stations in specific locations.  This siting of fire stations is appropriately a local matter to be determined by the relevant fire authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700118#WRDDD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Private Rented Accommodation Data","counter":3632,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700118#WRDDD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":3633,"qnumday":1347,"qnumall":"[46788\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700118#WRDDD02100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of persons who are registered as both a tenant and a landlord of a residential property; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":3634,"qnumday":1348,"qnumall":"[46789\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700118#WRDDD02200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number and percentage of tenancies ended in the most recent period for which figures are available on the basis of the tenancy being required for refurbishment; the way in which these figures compare with previous years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":3635,"qnumday":1349,"qnumall":"[46790\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700118#WRDDD02300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number and percentage of tenancies ended in the most recent period for which figures are available on the basis of the tenancy being required for family use; the way in which these figures compare with previous years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":3636,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1347 to 1349, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department does not hold or collate the data referred to by the Deputy in relation to the number of landlords who are registered as both a landlord and tenant of a residential property.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), through its tenancy registration system, collects information on tenancies and landlords.

Under HAP, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector and the tenancy agreement is between the HAP recipient and the private landlord.  The local authority does not have a role in the tenancy.  As with other private rental tenancies, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended), governs the relationship between the landlord and tenant.  When entering into contracts and agreements, it is always advisable to seek independent legal advice.  The landlord's\u00a0declaration on\u00a0the HAP Application Form refers to this and\u00a0also makes clear,\u00a0the\u00a0landlord's obligations under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  HAP addresses many long standing issues raised by landlord groups in relation to the operation of Rent Supplement.  The HAP payment is made directly to landlords on the tenant's behalf and all payments are made electronically directly to the landlord - the landlord does not have to collect the rent.  There are minimal barriers to setting up HAP, and\u00a0tax compliance and private rental inspections can follow the setting up of a HAP tenancy.  In 2016, the scheme had a 99% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants and local authorities, and a 99% rent payment rate with minimal payment difficulties arising for landlords.  Furthermore, any household assessed for social housing support is immediately eligible for housing support through the HAP scheme.  HAP recipients can avail of full-time work and retain their housing support, with an adjustment in their differential rent; under Rent Supplement, these households would lose their housing support payment.<\/p>  <p>  Misunderstanding of the scheme is often to blame for discrimination and it highlights the need for the State to continue to explain and outline the many benefits of HAP to landlords.  My Department and local authorities have been involved in a range of national and local actions to clarify the operational benefits of HAP to landlords and agents.<\/p>  <p>  A landlord or an agent acting on behalf of a landlord is not legally obliged to enter into a tenancy agreement with a HAP recipient.  However, since 1 January 2016, a person cannot be discriminated against when renting because they are in receipt of certain housing related payments,\u00a0including HAP.  If a person feels that they have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent, they can make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts to the\u00a0Workplace\u00a0Relations Commission.<\/p>  <p>  A number of cases have been taken under the 'housing assistance' ground of the Equality Act against landlords.\u00a0 I believe that the body of case law that the Workplace\u00a0Relations Commission is building in this regard complements the clarity that my Department is working to provide to landlords and agents in relation to the operation of the HAP scheme.  It is clear that such cases are rare and the vast majority of landlords are happy to engage in the scheme, and adhere to the terms and conditions.\u00a0 In fact, the average number of new\u00a0additional tenancies being\u00a0supported by HAP\u00a0per week over the last number of months is close to 350.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  HAP is working for both recipients and landlords.  Over 28,500 eligible households are currently being supported across the State with over 20,000 individual landlords and agents providing accommodation via the scheme and receiving housing assistance payments.  HAP will continue to be a flexible support available to assist people with their long term housing needs immediately their need arises.  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  In\u00a0general,\u00a0I am satisfied with the operation of the HAP and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme outlined under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700118#WRDDD03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3643,"content":"<p>Question No. 1352 answered with Question No. 1346.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Approved Housing Bodies","counter":3644,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700118#WRDDD03400"},{"type":"question","counter":3645,"qnumday":1353,"qnumall":"[46860\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700118#WRDDD03500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his Department has sanctioned funding to an association (details supplied) to fund the purchase of houses yet to be built at Rhebogue, Limerick city; the amount of funding that was sought; the amount that was approved; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the number of houses will be less than the amount for which funding was originally sought as a result of a planning decision by Limerick City &amp; County Council; if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that the houses that were specifically proposed for persons with a disability have been removed from the scheme; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there is widespread opposition to this proposal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":3646,"content":"<p>My Department gave approval-in-principle for the development of special needs social housing at Rhebogue at a cost of &euro;3.8m.\u00a0 This approval was subject to planning permission and to the successful advancement of the project on technical and cost grounds.\u00a0 The costs sought initially for the project were &euro;3.9m.<\/p>  <p>  The advancement of this project, including the planning permission and all other aspects, is a matter for the approved housing body and for Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council in the first instance.\u00a0 I understand that the Council, as the planning authority, has recently granted\u00a0planning permission for 17 new social homes, 4 less than originally sought.<\/p>  <p>  All housing projects are subject to planning permission and while I am keen that the maximum delivery for social housing is achieved, there is a balance to be struck with regard to planning issues which is the responsibility of the planning authority.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700118#WRDDD03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unfinished Housing Developments","counter":3647,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700118#WRDDD03700"},{"type":"question","counter":3648,"qnumday":1354,"qnumall":"[46880\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700118#WRDDD03800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 165 of 30 March 2017, the reason an estate (details supplied) is being omitted from the unfinished housing list in 2017 in view of the occupancy rate in the estate; the detail of the report by his Department on the estate; the reason for the decision in view of Louth County Council's applications to have it added to the list.","asker":"1329","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":3649,"content":"<p>The\u00a02016\u00a0Annual Progress Report on\u00a0Unfinished Housing\u00a0Developments, published in March 2017, highlighted that the number of &lsquo;unfinished&rsquo; developments had reduced by over 85% from just under 3,000 developments in 2010 to 420 developments in 2016, with 248 developments resolved in 2016 alone.<\/p>  <p>  Funding of the resolution process is now centred around investment by housing providers and their funders as well as income from bonds and securities.<\/p>  <p>  The residual level of\u00a0unfinished housing\u00a0developments remaining\u00a0is expected to\u00a0show further reduction when the 2017 survey is finalised and the 2017 Annual Progress Report is published by year end.

In this capacity, he is working closely with his colleagues across Government to address the many challenges resulting from Brexit.  This co-operation also involves the relevant State Agencies.  Work at Cabinet level is being prepared through cross-Departmental co-ordination structures.  These represent a frequent and active channel through which all relevant Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s wider response to Brexit, including its priorities for the ongoing Article 50 negotiations between the EU and the UK. <\/p><p>As the outcome of the negotiations is not yet known, an important focus of the planning and preparation being undertaken through these structures is on deepening the Government&rsquo;s analysis and understanding of the exact consequences of a range of different possible scenarios.  This represents an intensification of efforts to build on the Government&lsquo;s contingency planning. <\/p><p>While the vote does not give rise to fundamental strategic issues for Defence Forces operations or for Ireland&rsquo;s continuing engagement within the EU in the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), it is expected that Brexit will have an impact on future developments in the Defence sphere. <\/p><p>As the Deputy has previously been advised, on 19 January, 2015 Ireland signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Department of Defence, Ireland and the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence on enhancement on certain aspects of Security and Defence Cooperation.  This provides a framework for developing and furthering bilateral co-operation and relations between the Department of Defence and the UK Ministry of Defence. <b><\/b>The signing of the Memorandum of Understanding placed already existing cooperation arrangements in the Defence area between Ireland and the UK on a more formal and transparent footing, while fully respecting the differing policy positions and security arrangements of both States.<\/p><p><b><\/b>The MoU takes into account matters such as military forces training; exercises and military education; exchange of views on EU Common Security and Defence Policy; potential for joint contributions to UN Crisis Management Operations; joint procurement initiatives; pooling and sharing resources; general sharing on reform in defence services; potential for staff exchanges; joint contribution to Security Sector Reform and capacity building in crisis locations and the sharing of information.  Given the bi-lateral arrangements already in place, and the fact Brexit does not give rise to fundamental strategic issues for Defence Forces operations or for Ireland&rsquo;s continuing engagement in the EUs Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), it is the case, given the unique nature of Defence that other than normal internal policy considerations, there is no specific Brexit related research currently being undertaken by, or on behalf of, my department.

A certain level of turnover is desirable as a human resource and organisational objective, in order to maintain an appropriate age profile across the Defence Forces and to retain an approach to regular revitalisation.  However, it is also important to ensure that turnover is ultimately beneficial to the organisation.  In recent years the levels of departures have exceded intakes and this has presented difficulties in meeting the establishment strength of 9,500 personnel.  In order to fill vacancies there is significant ongoing recruitment at both enlisted and officer level and it is anticipated that approximately 800 new personnel will have been inducted into the Permanent Defence Force during 2017.  This includes general service recruits, apprentices, cadets and direct entry officers. <\/p>  <p>  A range of recruitment methods are being employed including direct entry competitions for specialist positions and the scope to further expand direct entry is being considered.  I have also directed civil and military management to develop proposals for expanding direct entry recruitment of specialists and a scheme to facilitate former PDF personnel with appropriate skill-sets to re-enter the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>From the most recent figures available, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force is currently at approximately 9,200 personnel.  As I have previously outlined there are particular challenges with vacancies in certain specialist posts such as Pilots, Air Traffic Controllers and certain Technicians.  These specialists can prove difficult to retain where, as in the current economic circumstances, there are ongoing private sector and commercial semi-state sector job opportunities.  I understand that he retention of such specialists has proved challenging for many military forces internationally   <\/p>  <p>As the Deputy will be aware, there is also an ongoing programme of HR development within the Defence Organisation.  The Defence Forces Climate Survey identified a range of issues that were identified as impacting on satisfaction levels within the PDF.  Whilst pay for the lowest paid members of the Defence Forces was highlighted as an issue, there were a broad range of HR matters raised.  I am satisfied that these are being addressed and I have recently announced a number of initiatives ranging from a review of the C&amp;A Scheme, a review of the crtieria governing Contracts for enlisted personnel and a comprehensive skills gap analysis across the Defence Forces.  These directly address issues raised in the Climate Study.  In addition the Chief of Staff is actively addressing matters relating to military management of work practices in the Defence Forces.   <\/p>  <p>  Following sign up by the Defence Forces Representative Associations to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, members of the Permanent Defence Force have benefitted from pay increases.  These post-dated the Climate Survey.  I was particularly pleased with recent adjustments to salary scales for general service recruits and privates who joined the Defence Forces since 2013 (increases of between 8% and 24% depending on scale point).  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 -2020 also provides for further pay increases ranging from 5.75% to 7.25% depending on the individual&rsquo;s current wage threshold and this is under consideration by RACO and PDFORRA. <\/p>  <p>The fact that further consideration by the Public Service Pay Commission of recruitment and retention issues is provided for under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, is also a welcome development.   <\/p>  <p>I remain committed to maximising recruitment to the Defence Forces and ensuring that, where possible, the terms and conditions of service are appropriate to the needs of the organisation and as favourable as they can be within the current budgetary parameters.   <\/p>  <p>With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, the Government is committed to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government, both at home and abroad.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700119#WREEE06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Recruitment","counter":3740,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700119#WREEE06500"},{"type":"question","counter":3741,"qnumday":1386,"qnumall":"[46752\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017110700119#WREEE06600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if 70% of persons that have applied recently to the Defence Forces through its targeted recruitment campaigns did not subsequently present themselves for the initial physical fitness test; the number of persons that submitted the initial recruitment application form but failed to attend the initial physical test; and the number of persons that attended the initial physical fitness test but failed to reach the basic level of physical competency and were rejected to date in 2017, by month, in tabular form.","asker":"1305","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":3742,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is being compiled by the military authorities.
