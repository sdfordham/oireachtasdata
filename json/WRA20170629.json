South to North trade in goods was valued at &euro;1.65 billion in 2016 and North to South trade was &euro;1.05 billion.  This trade is particularly significant for SMEs &ndash; over 15% of Irish SME exports are destined for the Northern Ireland market.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A recent study undertaken for InterTrade Ireland by the ESRI analyses a so-called &ldquo;worst-case scenario&rdquo; whereby WTO tariffs would apply to the trade of goods between the UK and the EU&rsquo;s Member States.  The report&rsquo;s key findings are that the imposition of WTO tariffs alone would have an effect of reducing cross-border trade by 9%.\u00a0 In addition to the imposition of WTO tariffs, if the cost of Non Tariff Barriers, e.g. administrative and regulatory requirements were included, this would reduce cross-border trade by 16%.

There have been 13 fatalities\u00a0in the sector in Ireland so far this year. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority (HSA, is adopting both a prevention approach and an enforcement approach in relation to improving safety on farms. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The &ldquo;prevention approach&rdquo; seeks to involve all stakeholders in the development and provision of sector specific information and guidance on all major areas of risk in farming.  This is being primarily rolled-out through the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee which is an advisory committee to the HSA.  Membership of the Farm Safety Partnership is drawn from all of the main farming organisations such as IFA, ICMSA, Farm Relief Services, Macra na Feirme, Teagasc, Irish Cattle and Sheep Association, Coillte, Farm Relief Services Network, Irish Rural Link etc. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Its current Farm Safety Action Plan runs from 2016 to 2018 and has set out six goals as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - To achieve cultural behavioural change in health and safety of persons working in the agricultural sector through Research, Education and Training;<\/p>  <p>  - To develop programmes which will foster Innovative Approaches and deliver Engineering Solutions to reduce the risks to persons working in Agriculture;<\/p>  <p>  - To reduce the level of death and injury arising from Tractor and Machinery use;<\/p>  <p>  - To establish initiatives to reduce the level of death and injuries arising from working with Livestock;\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A cornerstone to the prevention approach is the Farm Safety Code of Practice (Code of Practice for Preventing Injury and Occupational Health in Agriculture) which is a simplified approach to on-site farm management of occupational safety and health.  This Code of Practice has recently been updated by the HSA to reflect modern farm risks.  Access to quality assurance schemes and farm modernisation grants, available from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, are now being linked to compliance with this Farm Safety Code of Practice. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition the Farm Safety Partnership has developed extensive user friendly guidance on all farm safety issues which is being brought to the attention of farmers through farm walks, Knowledge Transfer Groups, articles in the farming media and through farm TV at all major marts, through major events such as the Tullamore Show &amp;amp; National Ploughing Championships as well as dedicated farm safety campaigns. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The enforcement approach by the HSA involves farm visits and inspections to assess compliance standards.  These inspections are being carried out throughout the year but particularly during three targeted inspection campaigns in 2017.  The March campaign focused on Livestock Safety, the recent May campaign focused on Tractors &amp;amp; Machinery and the forthcoming November campaign will focus on Falls from Height and Falling Objects.  These visits and inspections are carried out in a cooperative approach seeking buy in from the farmer on the fundamental importance of safe farm practices.  These inspections are well received even though in about 50% of inspections some level of enforcement action will be taken by the inspector.  These include written advice, legal Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices all of which legally must be complied with. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the activities of the HSA my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has advised me that Teagasc is also re-focusing its efforts to assist the farming community to improve safety standards in the following ways; \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - Teagasc Advisory and Education and Training staff\u00a0 are highlighting the current trend in fatal farm accidents at all Teagasc events and classes and highlighting preventative measures;<\/p>  <p>  - Teagasc recently provided training on farm health and safety to all Knowledge Transfer Programme Facilitators operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

There have been 13 fatalities\u00a0in the sector in Ireland so far this year. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority (HSA, is adopting both a prevention approach and an enforcement approach in relation to improving safety on farms. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The &ldquo;prevention approach&rdquo; seeks to involve all stakeholders in the development and provision of sector specific information and guidance on all major areas of risk in farming.  This is being primarily rolled-out through the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee which is an advisory committee to the HSA.  Membership of the Farm Safety Partnership is drawn from all of the main farming organisations such as IFA, ICMSA, Farm Relief Services, Macra na Feirme, Teagasc, Irish Cattle and Sheep Association, Coillte, Farm Relief Services Network, Irish Rural Link etc. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Its current Farm Safety Action Plan runs from 2016 to 2018 and has set out six goals as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - To achieve cultural behavioural change in health and safety of persons working in the agricultural sector through Research, Education and Training;<\/p>  <p>  - To develop programmes which will foster Innovative Approaches and deliver Engineering Solutions to reduce the risks to persons working in Agriculture;<\/p>  <p>  - To reduce the level of death and injury arising from Tractor and Machinery use;<\/p>  <p>  - To establish initiatives to reduce the level of death and injuries arising from working with Livestock;\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A cornerstone to the prevention approach is the Farm Safety Code of Practice (Code of Practice for Preventing Injury and Occupational Health in Agriculture) which is a simplified approach to on-site farm management of occupational safety and health.  This Code of Practice has recently been updated by the HSA to reflect modern farm risks.  Access to quality assurance schemes and farm modernisation grants, available from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, are now being linked to compliance with this Farm Safety Code of Practice. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition the Farm Safety Partnership has developed extensive user friendly guidance on all farm safety issues which is being brought to the attention of farmers through farm walks, Knowledge Transfer Groups, articles in the farming media and through farm TV at all major marts, through major events such as the Tullamore Show &amp;amp; National Ploughing Championships as well as dedicated farm safety campaigns. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The enforcement approach by the HSA involves farm visits and inspections to assess compliance standards.  These inspections are being carried out throughout the year but particularly during three targeted inspection campaigns in 2017.  The March campaign focused on Livestock Safety, the recent May campaign focused on Tractors &amp;amp; Machinery and the forthcoming November campaign will focus on Falls from Height and Falling Objects.  These visits and inspections are carried out in a cooperative approach seeking buy in from the farmer on the fundamental importance of safe farm practices.  These inspections are well received even though in about 50% of inspections some level of enforcement action will be taken by the inspector.  These include written advice, legal Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices all of which legally must be complied with. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the activities of the HSA my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has advised me that Teagasc is also re-focusing its efforts to assist the farming community to improve safety standards in the following ways;<\/p>  <p>  - Teagasc Advisory and Education and Training staff\u00a0 are highlighting the current trend in fatal farm accidents at all Teagasc events and classes and highlighting preventative measures;<\/p>  <p>  - Teagasc recently provided training on farm health and safety to all Knowledge Transfer Programme Facilitators operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

It contributes significantly to job creation, exports and investment, and the competitiveness of the indigenous enterprise base, and also to embedding the foreign direct investment base in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  It is clear that a strong interdependence exists therefore between science, technology and innovation policy and enterprise policy.  My Department has developed its Innovation 2020 strategy for Research and Development, Science and Technology and its Enterprise 2025 policy side by side.  A critical objective for my Department is delivering on the actions and commitments set out in Innovation 2020. <\/p>  <p>  A report published by my Department in October 2016, Economic and Enterprise Impacts from Public Investment in R&amp;D in Ireland, focuses on the public R&amp;D investments that are aimed at achieving enterprise impacts.  These relate to investments by this Department, through Enterprise Ireland (EI), IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, and also through the Irish Research Council and the Higher Education Authority. <\/p>  <p>  This study has shown that investment in R&amp;D translates into improved job creation and enterprise performance.  Among the findings are:<\/p>  <p>  - Firms that invested in R&amp;D grew employment by 14% between 2000 and 2014 while those that did not invest in R&amp;D saw employment decline by 40% <\/p>  <p>  - R&amp;D performing companies grew exports by 181% between 2003 and 2014 compared to a loss of 42% in exports for non-R&amp;D performing companies over the same period <\/p>  <p>  - R&amp;D activity was identified as being one characteristic of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland client firms that has driven growth in sales and exports since 2003.  During the recession these firms exhibited greater resilience than non-R&amp;D active firms and have increased their contributions to sales, exports and employment <\/p>  <p>  - For Enterprise Ireland client firms funded through its R&amp;D Fund scheme, there was an 8% growth in net employment (22,003 jobs to 23,739 jobs) between 2002 and 2012.  In comparison there was a 6.2% decline in employment in the total Enterprise Ireland client base over the 2002 to 2012 period (131,144 jobs to 119,935 jobs).<\/p>  <p>  EI has played a particularly important role in supporting job creation in Ireland.  Between 2014 and 2016 employment in EI backed companies reached 200,000.  In its new strategy 2017 - 2020, Building Scale, Expanding Reach, EI is aiming to increase this further with a new target to create an additional 60,000 new jobs by 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The Strategy also aims to drive innovation in Irish enterprise to unprecedented levels through new supports to reach the target of &euro;1.25bn in R&amp;D expenditure by its client companies per annum by 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland operates a range of supports to help companies engage with third level researchers to undertake collaborative research for the benefit of companies.  Again, evidence shows that R&amp;D active firms who collaborate with the Higher Education sector do significantly better in terms of job creation and exports than those that do not collaborate. <\/p>  <p>  A further aspect of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s work is to extract maximum value from Ireland&rsquo;s investment in the research system &ndash; the objective is to secure commercial purpose, leading to jobs and sales by transferring technologies and ideas developed in Irish research institutions out into firms. \u00a0Knowledge Transfer Ireland is instrumental in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Going forward, in order to support companies to increase job creation and exports, EI will continue funding its critical existing programmes along with new supports for Innovation such as:<\/p>  <p>  -The Business Innovation Initiative (BII) aimed at driving innovation beyond selling products based on technical innovations, providing more customer focussed process and service solutions;<\/p>  <p>  - The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Initiative which is a cross-government process that allows public bodies to use public procurement to source R&amp;D and innovative solutions to solve identified &lsquo;challenges&rsquo;.\u00a0 This provides significant business opportunities for innovation focused companies; <\/p>  <p>  - New initiatives to equip graduates and researchers in the higher education system with the key skills required by the enterprise base.<\/p>  <p>  As the outcome of the Brexit vote forces Irish companies to employ R&amp;D in a bid to protect their current exports in the UK and to explore different markets, innovation will continue to play a central role in growing exports as well as employment.\u00a0 To address this and in addition to the new supports listed above, Enterprise Ireland will also:<\/p>  <p>  - Help companies develop their internal innovation capabilities and capacities through training and assistance with new key Hires and access to Innovation expertise and capabilities at home and abroad. <\/p>  <p>  - Help companies increase their investment in Innovation (up by 50% by 2020) with the introduction of the new Innovation toolkit which includes:<\/p>  <p>  - Redevelopment of EI Research, Development &amp;amp; Innovation (RDI) Offer<\/p>  <p>  - The Health Innovation Hub &ndash; a new support to unlock and focus the Irish Healthcare system&rsquo;s ability to drive healthcare Innovation through access to companies <\/p>  <p>  - Support to provide Multinational Sub supply and partnering opportunities for SMEs.<\/p>  <p>  - Increased focus on assisting young Irish disruptive technology companies to access the significant EU H2020 SME instrument.<\/p>  <p>  - Support to enable Irish companies to access funding support and contracts from H2020 and the European Space Agency respectively.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - Extensions of the Campus Incubation facilities (In Athlone, Waterford and Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology) to provide more support for regional start-ups.<\/p>  <p>  - Access to key talent: Enterprise Ireland will help with finding, hiring, growing and reaching impactful innovation people particularly through the Marie Curie Co-Fund which will enable 50 leading edge international researchers to work for Irish companies and a new offer to better condition new Graduates to work in industry so that they can contribute to companies growth more quickly and effectively. <\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s main objective is to encourage investment into Ireland by foreign-owned companies.  The Agency reported a second, consecutive record year in 2016. 199,877 people are now employed in IDA Ireland supported client companies, up from 188,035 in 2015.  This is the highest level of employment in the Agency&rsquo;s history. <\/p>  <p>  The area of RDI is of strategic importance to IDA Ireland.  A company decision to invest in RDI may be to support improvement in productivity; to develop a strengthened reputation for quality or to develop new products and services. <\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy Winning FDI 2015-2019 outlines a plan to support clients in creating 80,000 new jobs and increase employment in the client portfolio to 209,000 by 2019.  Support for RDI will be key to achieving these targets.  Research, development and innovation investments not only embed existing FDI operations and employment but pave the way for future investment, job creation and export growth.  As the global battle for FDI intensifies, investment in research and development will become even more critical to attracting and retaining FDI companies. <\/p>  <p>  The increase in RDI investment since 2000 has improved our attractiveness as an FDI location.  60% (just under &euro;60m in 2015) of IDA&rsquo;s total grant-aid budget is allocated to RDI projects each year.  This investment leverages RDI expenditure of &euro;600m by IDA clients for these approved projects and an overall annual spend by IDA supported companies of &euro;1.53bn per annum on RDI.  This has the effect of anchoring FDI clients and securing sustainable employment and related benefits to the Irish economy. <\/p>  <p>  The National Support System for Horizon 2020, the EU Framework Programme for research and innovation, is coordinated by Enterprise Ireland.  Horizon 2020 is one of seven flagship initiatives in Europe 2020, the European Union's ten-year jobs and growth strategy.  It has a budget of almost &euro;75 billion and runs over the period 2014-2020.  Horizon 2020 includes a programme tailored specifically to the needs of SMEs, namely the SME Instrument, which has &euro;3 billion in funding available over the period 2014-2020.  The SME Instrument helps high-potential SMEs to develop ground-breaking innovative ideas for products, services or processes that are ready to face global market competition.<\/p>  <p>  Companies in Ireland (both foreign-owned and Irish-owned) that compete successfully for funding from Horizon 2020 will boost their innovative capability and competitiveness which in turn will deliver strong national economic impacts, including job creation.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has won &euro;424 million from 2014 to May 2017 in competitive, EU funding from Horizon 2020.  Higher Education Institutions accounted for &euro;233 million of the total and companies, &euro;151 million.  The funding for companies included &euro;94 million awarded to SMEs.  Ireland has the highest success rate in Europe for the Horizon 2020 SME Instrument with a 16% success rate, compared to a European average of 6%. <\/p>  <p>  A budget of &euro;30 billion has been allocated to the final three years of Horizon 2020, which will provide significant funding opportunities for companies in Ireland that participate in the programme over the period 2018-2020.<\/p>  <p>  The recent national ex-post evaluation of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7) estimated that the European Commission contribution of &euro;625M to Ireland from 2007 to 2013 would lead to an estimated 2,000 jobs created per year.  It is expected that such figures will grow considerably in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s current target to double participation in the period 2014-2020. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900067#WRC03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":162,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[30675\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900067#WRC03800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which she expects support from the EU Commission in the context of innovation and technology in respect of job retention or job creation here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":163,"content":"<p>Innovation is a key mechanism by which companies can gain competitive advantage.

In its Report of June 2017, the National Competitiveness Council found that Ireland&rsquo;s cost base has improved across a range of metrics over the last five years (e.g. the cost of starting a business, communications costs and average income taxes).  This has made Irish firms more competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in.  However, despite these improvements Ireland remains a relatively high cost location and already the return to sustained levels of growth has resulted in upward pressures in property, labour and business service costs.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is particularly vulnerable to negative economic shocks which are outside the influence of domestic policymakers.  A number of short and medium term downside risks have already emerged that could undermine national competitiveness.  Over the past 12 months, we have seen the challenges created for Irish firms exporting to the UK as a result of Brexit, resulting from the weakness of sterling on international currency markets.\u00a0 The international price of oil has almost doubled over the past 12 months and the low international energy prices, which to date have countered increases in other domestic costs, is now dissipating.  To pre-empt such threats we must improve our cost competitiveness. \u00a0In this regard, costs are paramount: a competitive cost base helps to create a virtuous circle between inflation, wage expectations and cost competitiveness.<\/p>  <p>  Government is committed to take action to address unnecessarily high costs (i.e. cost and price levels not justified by productivity) wherever they arise.  A range of initiatives, as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, are in train across Government Departments to improve the ease of doing business, reduce the administrative burden, enhance our cost competitiveness and increase productivity and drive greater efficiencies across the enterprise base.  The issue of rising cost residential property will be addressed through a suite of measures in Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  The Cost of Motor Insurance Action Plan provides measures to help reduce the cost of insurance cost. <\/p>  <p>  The National Competitiveness Council and my Department and its agencies are continually engaged with relevant stakeholders on the particular policy needs required to support cost competitiveness.  The stakeholders include other Government Departments, regulatory bodies and public and private bodies.  In this regard, there is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage the controllable portion of their respective cost bases, drive efficiency and continue to take action to address unnecessarily high costs.  Such actions will ensure that improvements in relative cost competitiveness are more sustainable, leaving Ireland better positioned to cope with external shocks. <\/p>  <p>  As part of these engagements, my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Enterprise Ireland and the SBCI are working on developing of Brexit Working Capital Guarantee Scheme and to scope out the need for a longer term Business Development Loan Scheme which would assist Irish firms in investing for a post-Brexit environment and increase their competitiveness.

Recent EGFSN reports have anticipated future job opportunities arising from both expansion and replacement demand for a range of occupational roles, including in biopharma, ICT, data analytics, hospitality, manufacturing, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, international sales and marketing, project management, freight transport, distribution and logistics.<\/p><p>The EGFSN also provides information on employment trends, job opportunities and demand for skills through the annual &ldquo;<i>National Skills Bulletin&rdquo; <\/i>and the &ldquo;<i>Vacancy Overview&rdquo; <\/i>reports.  It also provides information on the supply of skills from the Irish education system through the &ldquo;<i>Monitoring Ireland&rsquo;s Skills Supply&rdquo; <\/i>publication.  The EGFSN also publishes reports on specific sectoral, or cross-sectoral skills needs, as well as &ldquo;<i>Regional Labour Markets Bulletins&rdquo;<\/i>which assist in informing regional education and training provision.<\/p><p>The development of ICT skills is one example which this Department has examined and worked closely with the Department of Education and Skills to deliver on.  ICT skillsets are important in both the manufacturing and services sectors.  The 2013 EGFSN report on &ldquo;<i>Addressing Future Demand for High-Level ICT Skills&rdquo; <\/i>indicated that the continuing strong demand from employers for people with high-level ICT skills across the economy could lead to 44,500 new job openings arising from expansion and replacement demand over the period to 2018.  To achieve this jobs potential, the report noted that all available policy levers would need to be utilised to increase high-level ICT skills supply. <\/p><p>In this context, the Government has initiated an ICT Action Plan, now in its second iteration, which provides an integrated response within the education system to increasing the domestic supply of high level ICT skills.  The aim of the Plan is to support the flow of people into ICT education, training and careers.  Overall implementation of the Plan is driven by a High Level Steering Group which my Department co-chairs with the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p>The skills needs in other areas of the economy are being addressed through the Further and Higher education system, through Springboard+ courses which help to upskill or re-skill unemployed people, and through the enterprise-led Training Networks Programme run by Skillnets.  This year, Skillnets will deliver over 43,000 training places for those in employment, in a range of sectors and regions across over 63 training networks who will identify training needs and source provision to ensure it is aligned to the needs of workers and enterprise.<\/p><p>In the Higher Education Sector, the primary objective of Springboard+ in 2017 is to provide upskilling and reskilling courses to develop the talent base in Ireland in key growth sectors of the economy including ICT; hospitality; biopharma, medical device technologies and manufacturing; financial services; and entrepreneurship.  This year the eligibility criteria has been expanded to include homemakers and those in employment who wish to upskill or reskill in specific high demand skills areas such as in Biopharma. <\/p><p>The Governments Action Plan for Education 2016 &ndash; 2019 provides a key statement on the reform agenda across the education and training system.  The Plan contains a range of actions to be implemented with particular focus on disadvantage, skills needs, and continuous improvement within the education service. <\/p><p>The Governments National Skills Strategy 2025 has over 120 Actions involving over 50 stakeholders.  The purpose of the Strategy is to provide a framework for skills development that will help drive Ireland&rsquo;s growth both economically and societally over the next decade<\/p><p>Within the Further Education and Training (FET) sector, significant improvements have been made in the planning and funding of provision since the publication of the FET Strategy in 2014.  Education and Training Boards engage in a service planning process annually against a range of detailed parameters set by SOLAS.  This process has been refined and improved each year and includes the use of strengthened labour market data provided by the SLMRU to ensure that the skill needs of learners and enterprise are met. <\/p><p>In 2015, the Minister for Education and Skills announced the development of 25 new Apprenticeships which cover a wide range of sectors such as manufacturing and engineering, tourism and sport, financial services, information technology, transport distribution and logistics, and business administration and management.<\/p><p>Earlier this year, the Government launched an Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020 was launched, setting out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period to 2020.  The Plan sets out how the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals in 2015 will be managed to provide for the needs of all sectors.<\/p><p>In May 2017, the Apprenticeship Council's announced the second call to employers for proposals for new apprenticeship programmes, where areas where apprenticeships have not traditionally existed will be targeted, so as to offer robust new career pathways and options to at least 20% of school leavers.  The call is a key action in the plan to double the number of annual apprenticeship and traineeship registrations in 120 different schemes so that by 2020, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes.<\/p><p>In April 2017 the National Skills Council and nine Regional Skills Fora were established - both of which are key elements of the new skills architecture as set out in the National Skills Strategy 2025.  Working together with Government Departments and agencies along with education and training providers, the work of the Council and fora, will ensure that we can anticipate and respond to current, future and rapidly changing skills needs across all sectors of the economy.<\/p><p>The Council had its first meeting on the 15th May 2017.  The Council will oversee research and advise on prioritisation and delivery of identified skills needs.  Skills information from the EGFSN, the SLMRU and the Regional Skills Fora will feed into the work of the Council. <\/p><p>Co-operation between employers and the education and training system has proven to be crucial in developing effective responses to skills needs, and this co-operation is being strengthened through the Further and Higher education and training systems, including via the new Regional Skills Fora put in place by the Department of Education and Skills to connect employers, enterprise development agencies and education and training providers. <\/p><p>The Governments Action Plan for Jobs has proven to be an effective mechanism for coordinated cross government action focused on job creation and on creating an environment that is conducive to entrepreneurship, investment and enterprise growth.  The existing process will continue to ensure the required focus on the achievement of sustainable full employment on an annual basis in the context of considerable international uncertainty.<\/p><p>The ambition in Enterprise 2025 is to achieve sustainable full employment by 2020.  The required actions to achieve sustainable full employment were set out in Enterprise 2025, in terms of building the resilience of the enterprise base through productivity, innovation and market diversification.  These are to be delivered by DJEI and the enterprise development agencies and also by a number of government departments that have a role to play in ensuring we have a supportive and internationally differentiated business environment.<\/p><p>The delivery of the right skills and talent is essential for the in terms of building up the enterprise base and the Department of Enterprise and Innovation will continue to work closely with the Department of Education and Skills to ensure a supply of the right skills which will support continued job creation and productivity growth.  Enterprise also has an important role to play investing in the skills development of its workforce aligned to their strategic business plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900067#WRC04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":171,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900067#WRC04700"},{"type":"question","counter":172,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[30682\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900067#WRC04800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which she expects Ireland to be in a position to increase trade with the US, Canada and other EU and non-EU locations post-Brexit;

These Regulations\u00a0apply to any term in a contract concluded between a seller of goods or supplier of services and a consumer which has not been individually negotiated. <\/p>  <p>  The legislation is designed to protect consumers against unfair terms in particular when they enter into standard form contracts with traders and regulated financial services providers.\u00a0\u00a0Contractual terms may be considered unfair where they cause a significant imbalance in the parties rights and obligations to the detriment of the consumer.  In that context, it could be noted that Schedule 3 of the Regulations sets out an indicative and non-exhaustive list of terms that may be regarded as &ldquo;unfair&rdquo;.  Some examples of contractual terms that\u00a0may be considered unfair include:<\/p>  <p>  - terms unreasonably limiting the liability of the trader or regulated financial services provider to the consumer;<\/p>  <p>  - terms unreasonably restricting the rights of the consumer;<\/p>  <p>  - terms unreasonably allowing the trader or regulated financial services provider to terminate or alter the contract or alter the product\/services to be provided under the contract without recourse to the consumer; and<\/p>  <p>  - terms which are not expressed in plain, intelligible language.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation provides the Central Bank with powers to protect consumers from unfair contract terms where they relate to regulated financial services providers such as banks, insurance companies and retail intermediaries.  Under the legislation, certain supervisory powers are available to the Central Bank to ensure compliance with the legislation by regulated financial services providers.  These powers mean that the Central Bank may require amendments to consumer contracts.  In certain circumstances, the Central Bank may seek a court order preventing the use of contract terms that are considered to be unfair or use other regulatory tools, including the Administrative Sanctions Procedure, to combat the use of unfair contract terms in consumer contracts.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank\u00a0Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) will also be relevant.  The Code provides that a regulated entity must ensure that in all its dealings with customers and, within the context of its authorisation, it acts honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers and the integrity of the market.  In particular, provision 3.8 of the Code provides that\u00a0a regulated entity must not, in any communication or agreement with a consumer (except where permitted by applicable legislation), exclude or restrict, or seek to exclude or restrict:<\/p>  <p>  - any legal liability or duty of care to a consumer which it has under applicable law or under the Code;<\/p>  <p>  - any other duty to act with skill, care and diligence which is owed to a consumer in connection with the provision to that consumer of financial services;<\/p>  <p>  - any liability owed to a consumer for failure to exercise the degree of skill, care and diligence that may reasonably be expected of it in the provision of a financial service.<\/p>  <p>  Chapter 10 of the Code also sets out the framework to deal with\u00a0any complaint a consumer may have with\u00a0a regulated entity.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has advised that it is difficult to comment further on the above mentioned clause based on the limited information provided.

The full detail of Ireland's provisional approach has been published by the OECD, along with the provisional approach of each signatory country.\u00a0 Ireland will have to confirm its\u00a0final binding approach to the options in the MLI when it is ratified in Irish law.\u00a0 It is intended that the first steps to ratify the Instrument would be taken as soon as possible with a view to completing the ratification process during 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has 72 tax treaties in effect and the MLI will enable the majority of these treaties to be updated to ensure that they are compliant with the BEPS recommendations, without the need for separate bilateral negotiations for each treaty concerned.\u00a0 However, no treaty will be changed until both Ireland and the relevant treaty partner have each fully ratified the MLI under domestic law.\u00a0 Also, a provision of a treaty cannot be changed unless both treaty partners agree to the amendment by making matching MLI choices in relation to the provision.\u00a0 Because of this, the potential implications will vary from treaty to treaty. \u00a0However, the principal MLI changes include:<\/p>  <p>  - introducing general anti-avoidance clauses into tax treaties;<\/p>  <p>  - preventing differences in countries&rsquo; tax laws being exploited by hybrid mismatch arrangements;<\/p>  <p>  - new rules on how much presence a company must have in a country to create a taxable presence there; and<\/p>  <p>  - allowing a taxpayer to seek mandatory binding arbitration if the two countries that are parties to a treaty cannot agree on how the treaty should be applied in the taxpayer&rsquo;s particular case.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Some 50 of Ireland&rsquo;s treaty partners signed the MLI on June 7 in Paris.\u00a0 Approximately 10 treaty partners are not yet members of the group that developed the MLI.\u00a0 Also, a small number of Ireland&rsquo;s treaty partners have expressed a preference to implement the anti-BEPS minimum standards by way of bilateral protocol, instead of through the MLI.\u00a0 I am informed by Revenue that negotiations are ongoing with two OECD countries that are co-signatories of the MLI, to agree protocols to implement MLI measures for existing treaties, and that this number will rise if other treaty partners&rsquo; domestic ratification procedures require the agreement of a protocol.<\/p>  <p>  Tax treaties are bilateral agreements which are negotiated\u00a0between individual\u00a0countries rather than being negotiated at OECD or EU level.\u00a0\u00a0Renegotiations of existing treaties with three OECD countries are underway.  These general renegotiations may result in the implementation of anti-BEPS measures bilaterally, instead of through the MLI.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the extension of Ireland&rsquo;s tax treaty network, a first round of negotiations has been held in 2017 with one European country and efforts to initiate negotiations with other countries are ongoing.

In\u00a0that response I explained that NAMA is required, under Section 10 of the NAMA Act 2009, to obtain the best financial return from its acquired loans.  I also explained in my previous response that, among the measures adopted to achieve this statutory objective, NAMA enters into arrangements with some co-operative debtors which involve measures to motivate debtors to maximise the return to NAMA from the workout of the assets controlled by these debtors.  NAMA must operate as a commercial entity and I am advised that, in the absence of arrangements with debtors, the return achieved on the assets securing NAMA loans would fall short of the best achievable financial return required under Section 10.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by NAMA that, in return for concessions which improve NAMA&rsquo;s return, arrangements agreed with debtors include compromises of personal guarantees, debt compromise, potential profit share arrangements and debt restructuring.  The details of such arrangements vary according to the particular circumstances of each debtor connection and no two arrangements are the same.  The Deputy will be aware that NAMA is prohibited under sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act from disclosing confidential debtor information, including information on debtor arrangements which could identify particular debtors.  I am advised that concessions are conditional on the achievement of agreed milestones and on meeting stretch targets.  In such cases, the debtor may share a small proportion of surplus proceeds.  Such arrangements are particularly appropriate and necessary where facilities are non-recourse or where there is limited recourse.<\/p>  <p>  Under arrangements agreed with debtors, the concessions granted to NAMA by debtors include charges over unencumbered assets, improvement in NAMA&rsquo;s legal priority over charged assets, the perfection of legal security deficiencies by the debtor, cooperation with professional practitioners and the completion of development projects aimed at enhancing debt recovery.  It is a matter of public record that, as part of the loan acquisition process, NAMA encountered difficulties with some of the legal documentation received from the participating institutions, including items of security not actually taken, guarantees not confirmed on the granting of new facilities and development loans with no security over work-in-progress or step-in rights.  Other issues included defective land registry dealings and missing original documents (such as title).  In many cases, the co-operation of debtors was required to ensure remediation of these issues.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by NAMA that such arrangements have been agreed with 34 debtor connections to date.  It should be remembered that NAMA acquired the loans of almost 800 debtor connections and 5,000 borrowing entities from the participating institutions.  I am further advised that NAMA remains in ongoing negotiation with at least 20 other debtor connections in relation to prospective arrangements, debtor concessions and the requisite cooperation which would enable NAMA to maximise debt recovery.  It is not certain that agreement will be reached in all of these negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The fundamental principle underlying any arrangement is that NAMA&rsquo;s return under the arrangement exceeds the return that would apply in the absence of the arrangement.  I am advised that the adoption of agreed arrangements with debtors has been an important mechanism to enable NAMA to ensure ongoing debtor co-operation in cases where otherwise debtors would refuse to cooperate and would opt instead for an insolvency process which would ultimately yield a lower net return to NAMA, particularly when enforcement costs are taken into account.  NAMA advise that many debtors would not have maintained their co-operation unless they had clarity as to the long-term benefit to them of that co-operation.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by NAMA that the information sought by the Deputy in relation to the number and value of incentives is confidential and that disclosure of this information would compromise NAMA&rsquo;s negotiating position and thereby place it at a commercial disadvantage in its ongoing negotiations with debtors.  This would ultimately be to the detriment of the financial return that NAMA could generate from the acquired loan portfolio.  Under Section 202 (1) (d) of the NAMA Act 2009, &lsquo;confidential information&rsquo; is defined as including &lsquo;information the disclosure of which would tend to place NAMA, a NAMA group entity or the NTMA at a commercial disadvantage&rsquo;. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900069#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Regulation","counter":258,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900069#WRE02000"},{"type":"question","counter":259,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[30699\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900069#WRE02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when he expects the liquidator of a company (details supplied) to complete their report on the estimate of the proportion of claims expected to be covered by the liquidation of the company; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":260,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Liquidator of Setanta that the actuarial report the Deputy is referring to is in the process of being commissioned.

A deviation in excess of 0.5 per cent of GDP from either or both of the rules may lead to a warning of a significant deviation from the European Commission following an overall assessment that takes all relevant factors into account. \u00a0If a warning of a significant deviation is made to Ireland by the European Commission, then the Government has two months to prepare a corrective action plan and present it to the D&aacute;il. \u00a0It would only be in the event that Ireland takes no effective action to correct the significant deviation in line with Council recommendations that the issue of sanctions arise in the form of an interest bearing deposit of up to 0.2 per cent of GDP. \u00a0Importantly, a warning of a significant deviation requires it to be an observed outcome, i.e. it must be ex-post. \u00a0This means that any warning in relation to 2017 or 2016 and 2017 taken together could only be made following the assessment of the 2018 Stability Update Programme that will be submitted at the end of April 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission's Spring Economic Forecasts project a structural balance improvement of 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2017, which is the required level of improvement. \u00a0Taking 2016 and 2017 together, the Commission forecasts a risk of some deviation but well below the level of a significant deviation.  My Department forecasts a structural improvement of 0.3 per cent in 2017, which does not constitute a significant deviation. \u00a0Importantly, my Department estimates that Ireland remains on track to achieve our medium-term objective (MTO) of a structural deficit of 0.5 per cent of GDP in 2018.  Achievement of the MTO represents an important milestone in ensuring the sustainability of the public finances.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the expenditure benchmark, my Department estimated that there would be a deviation in 2017 at Budget time last October due to the increase in the EU Budget contribution.  Based on the forecasts in the SPU, this projected deviation has increased to c.&euro;450 million (0.16 per cent of GDP) for a number of reasons. \u00a0The key one is that the expenditure outturn for 2017 came in lower than projected in Budget 2017. \u00a0Taking 2016 and 2017 together, my Department is forecasting a small deviation (c.0.1 per cent of GDP).<\/p>  <p>  On the other hand, the European Commission is forecasting a risk of a significant deviation under the expenditure benchmark taking 2016 and 2017 together. \u00a0The background to this is that the commission is retrospectively applying an amendment to assessment of compliance that was agreed in late 2016.  This new methodology will take one-offs into account in the assessment process. \u00a0Retrospective application removes the AIB share transaction in 2015 from the assessment, thus changing the 2016 assessment from a positive deviation to a negative deviation, albeit not a significant one.<\/p>  <p>  In my view, this methodological change cannot be retrospectively applied and should not affect the 2016\/2017 average compliance.  The Commission have admitted that there may be legal uncertainty with the approach taken in its assessment methodology and my officials continue to engage bilaterally with the Commission on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900069#WRE03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Investigations","counter":270,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900069#WRE03200"},{"type":"question","counter":271,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[30709\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900069#WRE03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the expected timeframe for the acquisition of a sum relating to a case (details supplied).","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":272,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[30710\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900069#WRE03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the ownership of interest accumulating from the escrow account established from a judgment (details supplied).","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":273,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[30711\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900069#WRE03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the State has secured legal immunity in the operation of the escrow account arising from a case (details supplied).","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":274,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 to 106, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the appeal in the Apple State Aid case, the Government is committed to complying with the binding legal obligations the Commission&rsquo;s Final Decision places on Ireland.

The Fund is allocated annually to the universities, the institutes of technology, the colleges of education and a number of other higher education institutions.  The objective of the Fund is to provide financial assistance to full-time undergraduate or postgraduate students in need of such support.  The Fund is intended to support students whose participation in higher education would otherwise be at risk as a direct result of financial difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  The Fund is designed to support students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds with on-going needs for financial support and students with other circumstances giving rise to short or longer-term financial difficulties, including family responsibilities, bereavement, family difficulties, accidents or health problems.

This report is a study into the experiences of students with mental health difficulties in higher education in Ireland and a mapping of best practices in supporting these students.  The report found that the majority of HEIs have services supporting students with mental health difficulties and some institutions have dedicated services for students.  It also found that students were generally positive about their experience of these services.  Some key recommendations from the report were:<\/p>  <p>  - A whole of campus strategic response is required to meet the needs of students with mental health difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  - The promotion of mental health awareness should be as part of induction for students.<\/p>  <p>  - The provision of mental health awareness training at an institutional level for academic and all other staff including part-time\/adjunct staff.<\/p>  <p>  - A move towards a flexible approach to teaching across programmes to bring greater flexibility to learning and assessment to improve access for all students.<\/p>  <p>  Implementation of recommendations is being progressed by AHEAD and partners and a follow-on conference\/seminar is planned for later this year.<\/p>  <p>  Fund for Students with Disabilities <\/p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities allocates funding to further and higher education colleges for the provision of services and supports to full-time students with disabilities from PLC up to doctoral level.

We are grateful for the support and understanding of the EU institutions and of our partners.  At both political and official level we continue to work intensively to ensure that Ireland-specific issues are successfully resolved in the EU-UK negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  The importance of unity within the EU 27 has been strongly stated on many occasions, most recently at last week&rsquo;s meeting of the European Council.  We are absolutely committed to playing our part in ensuring a united approach.<\/p>  <p>  We have also made clear to EU partners, to third countries, and to business and civil society, that Ireland&rsquo;s place is at the heart of the European Union.  The Irish people are strongly committed to EU membership &ndash; in the most recent poll, 88% agreed that Ireland should remain a part of the EU. Our economic, social and political interests are best served by our continued membership of the European Union. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900071#WRG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Programmes","counter":379,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900071#WRG02300"},{"type":"question","counter":380,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[30581\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900071#WRG02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the areas within his Department which remain outstanding in respect of the confidence and supply agreement; the status of plans for the implementation of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":381,"content":"<p>One of the policy principles set out in the Confidence and Supply Arrangement is to strengthen and develop cross border bodies and services in Northern Ireland and implement the Fresh Start Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  All of the North South Bodies are continuing to operate effectively, making a considerable contribution towards economic growth right across the island and demonstrating what can be achieved when we pool our resources in key strategic areas.  For instance, Tourism Ireland and InterTradeIreland are playing continuing and central roles in supporting the all island economy.<\/p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland is driving record tourism numbers and spend to this island.  InterTradeIreland is building vital exporting capacity among our small and medium enterprises and assisting SMEs in navigating the challenges of Brexit through its new advisory service and carrying out important research into various trade scenarios.<\/p>  <p>  I am currently representing the Government at the ongoing talks in Belfast and am hopeful that there will shortly be agreement on the restoration of the devolved institutions.  This will allow meetings of the North South Ministerial Council to recommence next month to enable further important engagement on progressing all-island cooperation in general and in particular addressing the challenges of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Discussions on sectoral priorities and on new and expanded areas of cooperation have been taking place within the NSMC.  While there is always scope for exploring the expansion of areas of cooperation and of the work of the North South Bodies, in line with the Good Friday Agreement, such expansion must of course obtain the agreement of the Northern Ireland Assembly.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Government has in the Programme for Partnership Government committed to a number of actions to facilitate greater North-South cooperation.<\/p>  <p>  Full and timely implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements, including the 2015 Fresh Start Agreement, is a key priority for the Government, as reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The Agreements, and the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s approach to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.  The Government will continue to work tirelessly for the full implementation of the Agreements in both letter and spirit.  <\/p>  <p>  Despite the political challenges of recent months in Northern Ireland, there has been sustained progress with implementation of the Fresh Start Agreement, with each administration actively pursuing the necessary work to fulfil the respective commitments.  In order to have continued progress it is critically important to see devolved Government working effectively in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland.  As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government is determined to uphold its principles and protect its institutions.  Effective devolved Government, underpinned by a genuine spirit of partnership, is what the people of Northern Ireland voted for in 1998 and what they expect their politicians to deliver. <\/p>  <p>  The Fresh Start Agreement provided for the establishment of the Joint Agency Task Force on cross-border crime.  That Task Force was launched in Dublin in December 2015, and has quickly become fully operational, progressing its work to tackle cross-jurisdictional organised crime and bring to justice those involved in it. <\/p>  <p>  At the Plenary meeting of the NSMC on 18 November 2016 in Armagh, the NSMC considered an update by a group of Senior Officials from relevant Departments, North and South, on the progress being made on implementing the commitments set out in Section E of the Fresh Start Agreement, to provide support and funding for North-South infrastructure projects.  The review is ongoing and a further report will be presented at a future Plenary meeting.<\/p>  <p>  A key element of the Fresh Start Agreement relates to the ending of the legacy of paramilitarism.  On 13 September 2016, Minister Flanagan signed an international agreement with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to establish the Independent Reporting Commission (IRC).  The IRC will report annually on progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland.  Following the December review meeting, both Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive announced the appointees to the IRC.  The IRC Bill, which will establish the IRC in this jurisdiction, was published by the T&aacute;naiste and then Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald, on 7 June and it is intended that it will be brought forward by Minister Flanagan in the weeks ahead. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900071#WRG02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Undocumented Irish in the USA","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900071#WRG02600"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[30713\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900071#WRG02700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position regarding discussions with the US authorities on immigration reform; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":384,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[30714\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900071#WRG02800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to have further discussions with the US authorities at political and official level on the need to progress immigration reform in view of the concerns of many Irish citizens living in the United States of America who are anxious to have their status regularised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":385,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 143 together.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s objectives regarding our undocumented citizens in the United States remain constant, namely: to achieve relief for the undocumented and facilitate greater pathways for legal migration to the United States.  <\/p><p>In pursuit of these objectives the Government and Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic representatives in the US systematically avail of all opportunities to raise immigration, including the prospects for immigration reform, and the situation of the undocumented in the United States, with members of the Administration and Congressional representatives. <\/p><p>In mid-March, the former Taoiseach, Mr. Enda Kenny, TD, used the opportunity of his meetings with President Trump, Vice-President Pence, Speaker Ryan, and other senior US leaders during the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day engagements in Washington DC to raise immigration-related issues and to convey the continuing importance which we attach to them. <\/p><p>The Taoiseach spoke by phone to President Trump on the afternoon of Tuesday 27 June.

Full details are provided on the MABS website at www.mabs.ie, and the helpline is open 9 am to 8 pm, Monday to Friday. <\/p>  <p>  MABS will check that the person qualifies for Abhaile.  He or she is eligible if they are a homeowner, unable to pay their debts as they fall due, and at risk of losing their home due to mortgage arrears. <\/p>  <p>  MABS will also advise them on the help most suited to their individual needs and situation.  Where this includes the PIP Service, MABS will provide the eligible person (&lsquo;the borrower&rsquo;) with an Abhaile voucher which they can exchange for that advice and assistance.

I am advised that it is the PRA&rsquo;s view that this error rate is well within the acceptable range given the complexity of the project.  It should be noted that the Digital Mapping Project was much more than just a matter of transferring the registered land parcels from a paper map record to a digital map record.  Factors that contributed to the complexity of the challenges associated with the project included: moving all registrations, from the defunct County Series and Irish Grid map projections to the latest Irish Transverse Mercator map projection; development schemes mapped on the PRA paper based record found to be at variance with the more accurate &ldquo;As Built&rdquo; layout presented by Ordnance Survey Ireland; transferring registrations from Western seaboard counties, which were up until the Digital Mapping Project, predominantly mapped on 1\/10560 or 6&rdquo; Ordnance Survey mapping which had not benefited from any revisions for decades; deciphering map data on old paper maps, some of which were 100 years old; and deciphering map data on badly damaged paper maps.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that prior to the data capture element of the project the process was validated by eminent International Mapping\/Land Administration experts.<\/p>  <p>  I am assured by the PRA that it has in place robust structures whereby the registered owners of properties or their representatives can engage with the PRA in relation to matters pertaining to the mapped representation of the registration.  The PRA also has a longstanding and valued relationship with Solicitors, Surveyors, Engineers and Architects in all matters pertaining to property registration.  The PRA&rsquo;s experience has been such that many of the queries received, once investigated, do not indicate any registration error.  Many of the perceived errors do not emanate from the PRA, but in fact originate from inaccuracies in the application map lodged for registration.  It should be noted that the responsibility for the accuracy of the application map lodged rests with the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  There needs to be due recognition given to the fact that the PRA Digital Mapping Project resolved many thousands of pre-existing issues and anomalies that existed in the paper based map system.  Being proactive in the adoption of Ordnance Survey topographical detail, during digitisation, has absolved many property owners of the need to incur costs in an effort to perfect or amend the Land Register to reflect the actual position on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900072#WRH01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Deportation Orders Re-examination","counter":432,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900072#WRH01700"},{"type":"question","counter":433,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[30632\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900072#WRH01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 127 of 1 December 2016, 174 of 17 January 2017, 65 of 19 January 2017, 57 of 11 May 2017, 69 of 25 May 2017 and 849 of 20 June 2017, if this case can be re-examined; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":434,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned is the subject of a valid Deportation Order made on 20 June, 2002.

Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  A cornerstone of this commitment is the Government plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, the Government has provided funding for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.  In order to continue to ensure seamless ongoing recruitment it is expected that a new competition for trainee Garda will be announced shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900072#WRH02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":444,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900072#WRH02900"},{"type":"question","counter":445,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[30642\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900072#WRH03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of community garda&iacute; who were and are assigned to Malahide Garda station in each of the years 2014 to 2016 and to date in 2017, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":446,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[30643\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900072#WRH03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of community garda&iacute; who were and are assigned to Swords Garda station in each of the years 2014 to 2016 and to date in 2017, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":447,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[30644\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900072#WRH03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of community garda&iacute; who were and are assigned to Balbriggan Garda station in each of the years 2014 to 2016 and to date in 2017, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":448,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[30645\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900072#WRH03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of community garda&iacute; that were and are assigned to Lusk garda station in each of the years 2014 to 2016 and to date in 2017, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":449,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163 to 166, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division.<\/p><p>The Commissioner has advised that all Garda&iacute;, not simply designated Community Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises and, in that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that Malahide, Swords, Balbriggan and Lusk Garda stations form part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Division and as of the 31 May 2017, there were 664 Garda.  There are also 49 Garda Reserves and  40 civilians attached to the DMR North Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p><p>This plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that just under 1,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide 75 of whom have been assigned to the DMR North Division.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end -  an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; including Community Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division in the coming years. <\/p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.<\/p><p>For ease of reference, I have provided the detailed information requested in relation to the number Community Garda&iacute; assigned to Malahide, Swords, Balbriggan and Lusk Garda Stations from 2014 to 2016, as supplied by the Commissioner .

Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State, 2,622 through the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, 1,040 under the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focussed on resettling refugees from Lebanon (519 by the end of 2016 and the remainder in 2017)  and the balance through a variety of mechanisms.  Some elements of this intake, such as the relocation strand, come with a time limit of two years and other elements are not time limited.  <\/p>  <p>  As regards the resettlement strand of the Programme, Ireland had taken in 519 of the original commitment of 520 by the end of 2016, a year ahead of schedule.  Last year the Government doubled its commitment under resettlement to 1,040 and the number of persons who have arrived from Lebanon under refugee resettlement now stands at 785.  The remaining 255 persons to arrive under resettlement have been selected and assessed and are expected to arrive later in the year.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the relocation aspect of the IRPP, allocations under the relevant EU Council Decisions are composed of three elements:<\/p>  <p>  - an intake from Greece of 1,089 asylum seekers<\/p>  <p>  -  an intake from Italy of 623 asylum seekers and<\/p>  <p>  -  an allocation of 910 asylum seekers which has not yet been assigned to either Italy or Greece.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will meet in full its commitment to Greece.  459 of the allocation of 1,089 are already in the State and a further 357 have been assessed and are awaiting transportation.  A further mission to Athens this month interviewed 99 persons.  Missions to fill the remaining places under this strand of the Programme have been scheduled with the Greek authorities between now and September 2017.  However, Italy, unlike Greece, will  not permit security assessments to be undertaken by other States on its territory.  Accordingly, Ireland has been unable to undertake security assessments on its territory of the cohort eligible for relocation to Ireland.  It has therefore not been possible for Ireland to take asylum seekers from Italy.  However, Intensive efforts remain ongoing to try to resolve this impasse.  Contacts and meetings continue to this end, both bilaterally with Italian counterparts at official, diplomatic and Ministerial level, and at EU level, including through the European Commission.  <\/p>  <p>   In terms of the unallocated portion contained in the two EU Council Decisions referred to above, which in the case of Ireland amounts to \u00a0910 persons,  Ireland cannot access this component until a decision is taken at EU level to allocate these numbers as between Greece and Italy.\u00a0\u00a0It is understood that the European  Commission are examining allocating this \"unassigned\" portion and if they do Ireland will immediately work towards relocating them.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is doing everything it can to give effect to the EU relocation Decisions and what can unambiguously be said is that, should it be the case that despite all Ireland's efforts, the relocation mechanism does not permit Ireland to take in sufficient numbers of asylum seekers under relocation, then the Government commitment to take in 4,000 people remains and Ireland will take in these numbers through other mechanisms should this prove necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900072#WRH04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Deportation Orders","counter":453,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900072#WRH04100"},{"type":"question","counter":454,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[30668\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900072#WRH04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will review on humanitarian grounds the decision to deport in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":455,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned is the subject of a Deportation Order signed on 9 June 2017.

The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate setting.<\/p><p>Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held.  In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets.  The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment.

This is known as the three year cap.  In accordance with the legislation, a person&rsquo;s principal residence is assessed on the basis of its estimated market value less allowable deductions as set out in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009.  Under the Act, allowable deductions in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal residence are borrowings incurred specifically for the purchase, repair or improvement of the asset concerned to such an amount that has not been repaid.  The HSE must be satisfied that the purpose of incurring the borrowings was for the purchase, repair or improvement of the asset concerned.<\/p><p>The value of the allowable deduction in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal residence is the value of the outstanding borrowings concerned.  This amount can be deducted from the estimated market value of the property as part of the financial assessment.

The safety of all medicines, including vaccines, is an important matter and there are robust regulatory and monitoring systems in place at both EU and national level to ensure that the medicines we use are safe and effective.   <\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines that are licensed in Ireland.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, with healthcare professionals and patients encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.    <\/p>  <p>  In addition, pharmaceutical companies are obliged, as a condition of the authorisation to market a medicine, to submit reports of adverse reactions received directly, to the HPRA.  In accordance with its reporting obligations, the HPRA provides anonymised details of reports received to the EMA, the WHO and to the relevant pharmaceutical companies.  The fact that a suspected adverse reaction has been reported does not necessarily mean that the medicine has caused the observed effect, which may have also been caused by the disease being treated, a new disease the patient developed, or by another medicine that the patient is taking.  Further data are usually needed to complete the picture.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of monitoring the safety of medicines, new information on a possible risk is called a signal.  Signals may arise from various data sources, including spontaneous reports, clinical trials and epidemiological studies.  Once a signal has been identified, investigations are undertaken to consider the likelihood that a medicine may have caused or contributed to the effect, try to identify risk factors and estimate the frequency of occurrence.  Following the assessment, a decision on the most appropriate regulatory action is taken by the competent authorities.  The regulatory action is communicated to healthcare professionals, patients and the general public through established channels, and timelines reflect the degree of urgency.  <\/p>  <p>  The majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information (Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet).  Vaccination related events, occurring at the time of vaccine administration, such as syncope (faints) has been among the most commonly reported effects.  Other commonly reported symptoms include gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, headache, dizziness and injection site reactions.<\/p>  <p>  There is no indication or signal of a causal link between the symptoms suffered by the young women and administration of the HPV vaccine.  However, this does not mean that their symptoms do not have a physical basis and it is important that any conditions they may have are properly diagnosed and receive appropriate treatment.  The families of any girls suffering symptoms following HPV vaccination are advised to seek medical advice from their family doctor in the normal manner and be referred to consultants familiar with these syndromes for appropriate diagnosis and management.  <\/p>  <p>  The EMA completed a detailed scientific review in November 2015 of the evidence surrounding reports of two conditions: complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).  The Agency&rsquo;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use concurred that the available evidence does not support that CRPS and POTS are caused by HPV vaccines.  It therefore did not recommend any changes to the terms of licensing or the product information for these medicines.  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusions of the European Medicines Agency, that there is no change to the way HPV vaccines are used, or to amend the current product information.  This final outcome by the Commission applies in all members states.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services and the HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900075#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":595,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900075#WRL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":596,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[30726\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900075#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will arrange an early date for a spine operation for a person (details supplied) in view of the fact that their case is urgent; and if he will expedite the matter","asker":"1248","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":597,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

This approach to the reform of the CAP was one which is recognised as being the most suitable approach to take,\u00a0on the basis that\u00a0the best interests of farmers\u00a0were served by\u00a0allowing them the flexibility to\u00a0calibrate production to market demand without compromising\u00a0income from the Basic Payment Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The report referenced by the Deputy clearly emphasises the economic importance of the cattle sector within  EU agriculture and stresses the importance of further product differentiation at EU level, increased export opportunities as well as compensation for environment services to support extensification within the beef sector.  I agree with the general thrust of this and the work that I and my Department carry out in relation to the beef sector very much reflects these goals.  I have recently returned from successful trade missions to the USA and Mexico.  I have also hosted a number of high level visits from other countries outside of the EU including China and Vietnam.  These missions will serve to improve our existing levels of market access\u00a0and promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to compensation for environment services to support extensification the Rural Development Programme already provides significant supports which include a range of supports available to the Suckler\u00a0sector.\u00a0 From an environmental perspective GLAS provides support to all participating farmers including suckler farmers to farm in an environmentally sensitive manner.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of a voluntary coupled support specifically for suckler cows in disadvantaged areas raises a number of issues.  First, the funding of any supports from existing Pillar I funding would require a redistribution of existing payments within Pillar I to all farmers.  A further consideration would be the effect introducing supports for suckler cows in disadvantaged areas would have on the wider suckler cow sector especially those producers in non disadvantaged areas.  I am of course conscious of the unique challenges faced by all farmers regardless of sector, in disadvantaged areas.  However it should be noted that the report also states the benefits of not limiting such supports to land type.<\/p>  <p>  Another important factor to consider would be the impact that funding of voluntary coupled supports in Pillar II of the CAP would have on the various commitments already made across a range of schemes and supports provided for under the RDP.  Indeed through Pillar II of the CAP some &euro;300 million of funding over a six year period has been targeted at the Irish suckler herd through the Bovine Data Genomics Programme (BDGP).  In\u00a0response to significant demand, earlier this year I reopened the BDGP programme for new entrants.  This clearly reflects the success of the programme. <\/p>  <p>  Several other supports are in place for suckler farmers under the RDP, notably GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer groups.  I am of the view that the current range of supports available to suckler farmers is the most appropriate way to support the continued development of this sector at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900076#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","counter":670,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900076#WRM02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":669,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900076#WRM02300"},{"type":"question","counter":670,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[30551\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900076#WRM02400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the status of the broadband signal for persons (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":671,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[30590\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900076#WRM02500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when high speed broadband will be installed at the home of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":672,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 241 and 244 together.<\/p><p>The\u00a0Government's National Broadband Plan will provide high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.\u00a0\u00a0The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that to date approximately 1.4m or 61% of the 2.3m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second and this footprint is expanding.\u00a0<\/p><p>In\u00a0April,\u00a0eir\u00a0signed a\u00a0agreement with me committing them to follow through on\u00a0their commercial plans to provide new high speed broadband infrastructure to 300,000 premises in rural areas.\u00a0 Eir\u00a0has committed to doing this work over\u00a0a 90 week period with an average of 500 premises passed per day.\u00a0\u00a0A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website .\u00a0 The decision by eir to invest in infrastructure to deploy high speed broadband services to an additional 300,000 premises in rural Ireland was taken\u00a0by eir\u00a0on commercial grounds.

The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.\u00a0 The finalisation of the State Intervention Area for the procurement process is an important milestone as it means that bidders can\u00a0progress their business plans and the Department can move to the next stage of the procurement.\u00a0 The three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.\u00a0<\/p><p>The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers.\u00a0 The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP, once contracts are in place. <\/p><p>However, I am aware that the rate of demand for data services has increased\u00a0exponentially in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for\u00a0telecommunication operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. <\/p><p>The report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is available on both Departments' websites.\u00a0 In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.<\/p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I established an Implementation Group to\u00a0drive and monitor the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.\u00a0 I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13th June 2017, which is available on my Department's website\u00a0at <i>http:\/\/www.dccae.gov.ie\/documents\/Taskforce%20Q1%20Progress%20Report.pdf\u00a0<\/i>and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017.  The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in\u00a0lots\u00a0covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.<\/p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances. <\/p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900076#WRM02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Incentives","counter":673,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900076#WRM02700"},{"type":"question","counter":674,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[30561\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900076#WRM02800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to encourage persons to use solar panels on outbuildings (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":675,"content":"<p>The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.

Outside the main urban area counties, the rate of increases varies in line with market trends with the highest increases of 25% in Roscommon and Laois.

Additional income disregards for claimants with children were also introduced.  These changes mean that the Farm Assist means test has reverted to the position which applied prior to Budget 2012.500 additional places have also been provided for on the Rural Social Scheme in 2017.All of these measures are designed to support farm families.<\/p><p>Finally, Budget 2017 provided for significant changes for self-employed social insurance contributors.

One of the main principles of the Dignity at Work Policy, which was launched in 2015, is that every member of staff has a right to work in an environment free of any form of bullying, harassment, or sexual harassment.  Following its Launch in 2015 the Policy was circulated to and publicised for all staff members in my Department and is now included in the induction pack for all new personnel   . <\/p>  <p>  In relation to Civilian Employees in my Department the document &ldquo;A Positive Working Environment&rdquo; sets out the policy on harassment, sexual harassment and bullying for State industrial employees. The policy, agreed at National Joint Industrial Council for State Industrial Employees (JIC), is designed to ensure compliance with the codes of practice issued under various pieces of legislation. The policy applies to all State industrial employees including employees on contract. Experience has shown that it has been effective in dealing with issues in the workplace, particularly in resolving issues at local level in accordance with the agreed procedures under the policy. <\/p>  <p>  It is considered that these arrangements are sufficiently robust to deal with allegations of bullying and harassment in the civilian workplace. All civilian staff, as well as Employing Officers, are fully aware of their responsibilities in this area. On appointment all civilian employees are provided with a Civilian Employee Information Handbook. This Handbook deals with, among other things, Sexual Harassment, Bullying in the Workplace, Grievance Procedures and Dispute Resolution Procedures. Under each of these headings, the Department&rsquo;s policy and the procedures to be followed, should an employee wish to have a particular issue or incident dealt with or investigated, are set out. All Employing Officers are copied with the Handbook which is updated when required. <\/p>  <p>  A Positive Working Environment - the anti harassment, sexual harassment and bullying policy, is available to all Civilian Staff. An update of this\u00a0document, the Dignity at Work Policy is currently with the various Trade Unions (circulated at the Joint Industrial Council for State Industrial Employees) for their observations.<\/p>  <p>  A confidential Counselling support\u00a0service is also available for all civilian employees.<\/p>  <p>  A formal grievance procedure is also in place. This code covers all State industrial employees who come under the remit of the JIC, which operates under the aegis of the Workplace Relations Commission. This document is also readily available to all employees and sets out the procedures and options available should an employee wish to pursue a complaint or grievance.   <\/p>  <p>  The only State body currently under the aegis of the Department of Defence is the Army Pensions Board. The Army Pensions Board is staffed by a civil servant from the Department of Defence.<\/p>  <p>  In the past five years one case of alleged bullying and harassment has resulted in compensation being paid out to a civilian employee by the Department. The case was settled in 2015 and the terms of the settlement, including the amount of compensation, decreed that it was confidential to the parties involved.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the procedures in place within the Defence Forces to deal with bullying I would like to reiterate that it is Defence Forces policy that all personnel have a right to be treated with respect, equality and dignity and to carry out their duties free from any form of bullying, harassment or sexual harassment. While military life entails robust and effective military training, such training must, however, take place in a professional service environment that fully respects individual human dignity.  Bullying and harassment of any kind are wrong and are not tolerated within the Defence Forces. They are entirely unacceptable in themselves and wholly incompatible with a successful and modern organisation.     <\/p>  <p>  All known incidents of such behaviour are properly investigated bearing in mind the need for due process which requires fairness to all parties to the complaint. Through the induction process and general notifications, the non-tolerance of unacceptable behaviour is stressed to all members of the Defence Forces. The formal and informal procedures in force are there to encourage any individual who wishes to make a complaint. Procedures for dealing with complaints of Bullying, Harassment and Sexual Harassment are set out in Defence Forces Regulations. Complaints of unacceptable behaviour can be dealt with at different levels, either in an informal approach or formal manner. The overall aim is to ensure that the complaint is dealt with, in the first instance, at the lowest level possible. Informal complaints can be resolved directly by the complainant with the assistance of a third party if required. Such third party can include any member of the Defence Forces who has the trust and confidence of the complainant. Specially trained Designated Contact Persons (DCPs) are also available to assist complainants.<\/p>  <p>  The formal procedure requires that a complaint is made in writing. These are dealt with by the military chain of command either through the legal\/disciplinary process or by administrative action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017062900079#WRP03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"}]
