There are three anti-malarial drugs in use by the Irish Defence Forces, namely Lariam (mefloquine), Malarone and Doxycycline.

In the context of the Government&rsquo;s decision to introduce the Single Scheme, a stated primary objective is to help significantly reduce the cost of public service pensions in the longer-term through far-reaching transformation and reform of the public service pension system.  It provides for a new approach which modernises and standardises pension arrangements throughout the public service.  The terms and rules of the Single Scheme &ndash; which are fundamentally different to the superannuation arrangements of all public servants recruited before 1 January 2013 &ndash; make no provision for the concept or award of supplementary pensions for any new entrants joining any public service group on or after 1 January 2013.  This position has been confirmed to the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations.<\/p><p>However, the absence of any provision for the supplementary pension concept in the Single Scheme must be viewed in the overall context of the fundamental changes and reforms to the pension scheme terms of post-2013 new entrants.  Such reforms were decided by Government and the Oireachtas as necessary to support the long-term financial sustainability of the public service pension system.  In that context, there are many other established features of the pre-1 January 2013 public service occupational pension arrangements that have been discontinued, or that have been fundamentally changed, under the Single Scheme.<\/p><p>I should also mention that Single Scheme members in the Permanent Defence Force retain the minimum pension age of 50<b><\/b>to<b><\/b>reflect operational needs, as already applies to new entrant military personnel recruited since April 2004.  This compares with an effective raising of the minimum pension age, from 65 to 68 years, in the case of the mainstream &lsquo;standard accrual&rsquo; membership occupations in the Single Scheme.  Moreover, the 2012 Act does not alter military retirement ages for future or serving military personnel generally, or upper service limits where applicable &ndash; these will continue to be determined by the Minister for Defence, following consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform . <\/p><p>The 2015 White Paper on Defence and the earlier 3<sup>rd<\/sup>Report of the Independent Monitoring Group (IMG), reiterated the objective of ensuring an appropriate age profile for the Permanent Defence Force.  A key element in military life is the need for personnel to maintain a level of fitness for combat readiness.  This requirement must be balanced with the need to retain experience and expertise, particularly at managerial level in the Defence Forces.  These HR and manpower policy objectives are in turn supported by concepts such as fast accrual pension arrangements, earlier mandatory retirement ages and\/or minimum pension ages than the norm, upper service limits for certain ranks, and so on.<\/p><p>The 2015 White Paper on Defence sets the defence policy agenda for the following ten years.  One of the 88 actions that have been specifically identified as part of the work being carried out to implement the White Paper, is to conduct, in the medium term, a review of HR policies in relation to recruitment, training and education, performance management, reward systems, and retention and retirement policies alongside appropriate age profiles for personnel across the Defence Forces.  The question of the appropriate mandatory retirement ages for commissioned and enlisted ranks will be carefully considered by my Department in that context. <\/p><p>I am advised that a claim has been received from RACO seeking an increase in officer retirement ages.  That matter will be the subject of discussions between the Official Side and RACO in due course under the established machinery, the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for Permanent Defence Force.  In the meantime, there are no plans to remove mandatory retirement ages for military personnel who join the Permanent Defence Force on or after 1 January 2013, whether in enlisted or commissioned officer ranks.<\/p><p>There is no empirical evidence to support the theory or claim that the absence from the Single Scheme of provision for the concept or award of supplementary pensions will impact on retention levels among post-2013 new entrants to the Permanent Defence Force, whatever their rank.<\/p><p>Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, and the HR and manpower policy objectives outlined earlier, there is understandably a high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel compared to other occupations.  However, this is not new and pre-dates the introduction of the Single Scheme in 2013, notwithstanding the inclusion of supplementary pension arrangements in the occupational pension scheme terms of commissioned officers who joined the Permanent Defence Force from 6 April 1995 to 31 December 2012 and, indeed, enlisted personnel who did so in the period from 1 April 2004 to 31 December 2012.<\/p><p>In order to deal with the challenges associated with the turnover of personnel, a continuous yearly recruitment drive is operated by the Defence Forces and in 2017, it is planned to recruit 860 personnel across all services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100062#WRB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Properties","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100062#WRB00850"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[32181\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100062#WRB00900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he will engage with voluntary housing bodies such as an organisation (details supplied) to explore the potential of renovating existing buildings at Columb Barracks, Mullingar for housing accommodation purposes and also for community activities.","asker":"1250","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":51,"content":"<p>As I have previously informed the Deputy following the closure of Columb Barracks in 2012, my Department has explored a number of avenues to try and secure the long term future of the former barracks for the benefit of the local community.

While the vote does not give rise to fundamental strategic issues for Defence Forces operations or for Ireland&rsquo;s continuing engagement within the EU in the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), it is expected that Brexit will have an impact on future developments in the Defence sphere.<\/p><p>Structures have been put in place in the Department of Defence to address the potential challenges arising from Brexit including the assignment of responsibility to a senior official at Assistant Secretary General level in relation to Brexit related matters. The senior official is leading the Department&rsquo;s input to deliberations within the framework established across Government and is supported in their role by a number of branches in the Department. The senior official represents the Department on the Interdepartmental Group on EU-UK Affairs which is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and is engaged with the identification of key strategic, operational and policy issues arising from Brexit. In addition, the Management Board is acting as a clearing house for Brexit and maintains oversight on an ongoing basis. As the Deputy will also be aware, the Government has adopted a contingency framework to deal with all issues arising in respect of the UK vote to leave the EU. Accordingly, any issues arising, including those within the Defence area, whether bilateral, or in respect of developments in CSDP, or regarding our wider international multilateral defence engagements, will be also addressed within that framework.<\/p><p>  The formal EU-UK negotiations commenced last month. All potential consequences in the defence sphere, arising during these negotiations, will remain the subject of ongoing consideration by my Department throughout this process. <\/p><p>In respect of the border, the potential implications in this regard will emerge during the course of the negotiations. It is this Government&rsquo;s stated goal to try to ensure that the current on-island border arrangements are maintained to the greatest extent possible. Responsibility for the security aspect of border control rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate. Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to provide support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. The Defence Forces also provide support to the Revenue Commissioners on request. The Defence Forces at all times keep operational plans under constant review and there will continue to be ongoing close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters, including through regular coordination and liaison meetings. <\/p><p>  Similarly, in respect of fisheries protection and monitoring of Irish waters, the potential implications will emerge during the course of the negotiations.

The Prime Minister was especially welcome as my first international visitor and given the close and historical ties between our two countries. <\/p><p>  Our meeting was an opportunity to discuss our shared and common outlook on issues such as free trade, multilateralism and climate action. <\/p><p>We discussed the importance of the bilateral trade and investment relationship between our two countries.  Annual Trade between Ireland and Canada is valued at over &euro;2.75 billion whilst Canadian tourist traffic to Ireland has increased by 56% in three years, with close to 200,000 Canadians now visiting Ireland every year.  The Prime Minister and I agreed that there is considerable potential for further growing trade and economic links given increased direct air access, CETA and the strength of our respective economies.<\/p><p>We discussed the current state of play in relation to Brexit since the commencement of negotiations and I outlined Ireland's priorities in this regard.  The Prime Minister was interested in developments in Northern Ireland and I updated him on the current political situation there.  He reiterated to me the Canadian Government's continued support for the Northern Ireland peace process and offered any assistance that might be useful to drive progress. <\/p><p>On CETA, the Prime Minister and I discussed the benefits and opportunities from the agreement for both of our economies and progress towards the commencement of provisional application.  CETA is a progressive and comprehensive agreement which will remove over 99% of tariffs and will create sizeable new market access opportunities in many sectors for Irish firms. <\/p><p>We discussed Climate Change and reaffirmed our commitment to the implementation of the Paris Accord.  The Canadian Government is continuing its efforts to work with the US on Climate Change matters given that US withdrawal from the Paris Accord cannot proceed until 2020. <\/p><p>  In conclusion, the Prime Minister and I reaffirmed our commitment to working together across a range of common interests and I look forward to working to further strengthen the bilateral relations between Ireland and Canada in the time ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100065#WRE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unemployment Data","counter":108,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100065#WRE00550"},{"type":"question","counter":109,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[32012\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100065#WRE00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the unemployment blackspots nationwide according to the latest unemployment data in the Census 2016 Summary Results - Part 2, by county, in tabular form.","asker":"1221","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":110,"content":"<p>The Census of Population 2016  Summary Results &ndash; Part 2 published on 15 June, 2017 recorded 79 unemployment blackspots.

The relevant law in relation to receivership is largely made up of rules which the courts have developed by applying general contract law and equitable principles.  Receivers are appointed under a relevant security e.g. a mortgage or a charge which contains the contractual terms in relation to their appointment and their powers under the instrument.  Depending on the circumstances of the case, courts may also, on application from a secured creditor, exercise their discretionary powers to appoint a receiver.  Receivers can also be appointed under the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 in the case of mortgages created after 1 December 2009, and the Conveyancing Act 1881 for mortgages created prior to that date. <\/p>  <p>  Section 437 of the Companies Act 2014 confers statutory powers on receivers and is intended to alleviate many of the problems which may arise from poorly drafted debentures.  However, section 437(4) makes clear that these powers are limited by any provision in the instrument under which the receiver was appointed, again underlying the essentially contractual nature of receivership.<\/p>  <p>  A receiver has specific statutory duties under section 439 of the Companies Act 2014 which provides that: <\/p>  <p>(i) receivers must achieve the best price reasonably obtainable at the time of sale; and <\/p>  <p>(ii)\u00a0the receiver must not sell by private contract a non-cash asset of a company to a person who is or who, within three years prior to the date of appointment of the receiver, has been, an officer of the company unless the Receiver has given 14 days&rsquo; notice of his or her intention to do so to all creditors of the company who are known to him or her or who have been intimated to him or her. <\/p>  <p>  These statutory duties make it imperative that the receiver obtains expert legal and valuation advice in relation to the sale of property, consistent with the duty \"to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable\".  Breach of a receiver&rsquo;s statutory duties may result in the receiver being held personally liable for any loss incurred.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Section 444 of the Companies Act 2014 allows a liquidator, a creditor or a member of a company to apply to the High Court for an order to fix the amount to be paid to a receiver, notwithstanding that his or her remuneration has been fixed by the instrument appointing the receiver.  If the receiver has been paid previously in excess of the amount fixed by the court, the court order may extend to requiring him or her to account for the excess or such part of it that may be specified in the order. <\/p>  <p>  The Companies Act 2014 applies to receivers generally but my Department has no role in relation to the regulatory framework for receivers appointed by banks which are entities regulated by the Central Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100065#WRE05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement","counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100065#WRE05250"},{"type":"question","counter":178,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[32433\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100065#WRE05300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 6 of 29 June 2017, the source data that her answer was based on;

The terms of reference include the benchmarking of international awards for personal injury cases, analysing and reporting on international compensation levels and compensation mechanisms.  The PIC was established in January 2017 and is being chaired by former President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns.  The PIC is due to issue an interim report by the end of 2017 and is on target to achieve this.  The other 3 actions for completion by end-Q2 2017 have been addressed by the publication of the General Scheme of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Bill.

In this respect, it is important that individuals are correctly designated regarding their employment status so that those who ought to be designated as employees are not deprived of their employment rights.  This is particularly the case for vulnerable workers who may not feel in a position to object to certain arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has a well-resourced labour inspectorate, which forms part of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and there are existing mechanisms in place to determine the employment status of individuals or groups. <\/p>  <p>  WRC Inspections are undertaken on the basis of risk analysis which identifies certain sectors, as a result of complaints received and on a routine basis.  Where the WRC inspection service discover or issues are raised in relation to bogus self-employment or bogus sub-contracting, they are forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners and\/or the Department of Social Protection (Scope Section) for investigation either solely by the recipient, or jointly with the Workplace Relations Commission. <\/p>  <p>  In most cases it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed.  Where there is doubt in relation to the employment status of an individual the relevant Departments and Agencies will have regard to the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals.  This Code was drawn up and agreed in 2007 by the relevant Government Departments with ICTU and IBEC.<\/p>  <p>  Where an individual believes they are being deprived of employment rights applicable to employees they may refer a complaint to the WRC where the matter can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication leading to a decision that is enforceable through the District Court. WRC Inspectors can also be asked to investigate certain breaches.

Therefore it is not possible to separately identify the tax reliefs claimed by such companies.<\/p><p>One tax relief that may be of interest to companies providing FDI to Ireland is the Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP). However, it may or may not be utilised by FDI companies and therefore its cost cannot be directly linked to the cost of securing foreign direct investment jobs.<\/p><p>The Revenue Commissioners produce an annual report on the cost and uptake of SARP, which includes detail on its operation as well as an analysis of the number of jobs supported by the scheme. These reports are available at the following link: <\/p><p>SARP reduces the cost to employers of assigning key individuals in their companies from abroad to take up positions in the Irish based operations of the employer. In Budget 2017 SARP was extended until the end of 2020 in order to provide certainty for potential investors in Ireland following on from the UK vote to leave the European Union. The scheme gives qualifying key assignees that are appointed to roles in Ireland, an exemption from income tax on 30% of salary in excess of &euro;75,000 for a maximum of 5 years. However, USC and PRSI generally remain chargeable on all of the relevant income. <\/p><p>In order to qualify for SARP, an assignee must have been employed by the company in a country with which Ireland has a Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) or a Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) immediately prior to their assignment to Ireland.

The aim is to get the design of the initiative right and working in an effective manner. It is important that the underpinning scheme is made more effective, as until that has been achieved, extension of eligibility for it to other towns or cities would be largely meaningless.

It provides for tax relief by way of an income tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure. Qualifying work must cost a minimum of &euro;5,000 (including VAT). The maximum qualifying cost for the purpose of the incentive is (&euro;30,000 including VAT), which equates to a maximum tax credit of &euro;4,050. The tax credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is paid for. The Deputy may be aware that the incentive was extended for a further two years in the last Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100067#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":238,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100067#WRG01700"},{"type":"question","counter":239,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[32106\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100067#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated additional revenue that would be raised by increasing the bank levy by ten percentage points and by 10%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":240,"content":"<p>In Budget 2016, the Minister for Finance committed to extending the bank levy (a form of stamp duty paid by financial institutions) until 2021, subject to a review of the calculation methodology.

Section 32D and 32E of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended, provide that the Central Bank Commission may make regulations relating to the imposition of levies and fees on the financial services sector in respect of the recoupment of the costs of financial regulation. <\/p>  <p>  As it stands, the financial services industry currently funds 50% of the costs incurred by the Central Bank for financial regulation, with certain exceptions including the banks which had participated in the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (ELG) Scheme, namely AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB, which are required to fund 100% of the Central Bank's regulatory costs. Credit Unions currently contribute approximately 8% to the cost of their regulation.<\/p>  <p>  The current 50% funding arrangement translates into a corresponding reduction in the annual surplus remitted by the Central Bank to the Exchequer. The total cost of financial regulation in 2016 was approximately &euro;150 million; industry levies were &euro;79m and subvention was &euro;70 million. Therefore in the order of &euro;70 million of the Central Bank's 2016 surplus income was redirected to make up for the difference between the costs of regulation and the funding received from the financial services industry, which would otherwise have been surrendered to the Exchequer. <\/p>  <p>  However, following on from a joint Department\/Central Bank Public Consultation on funding the costs of financial regulation, the Minister for Finance approved an increase to 65% of the costs of financial regulation being borne by industry, with certain exceptions (for instance, the ELG banks and credit unions will maintain their existing funding arrangements, among other exemptions). This will be implemented in the 2017 industry funding levy regulations. The arguments in favour of a move to a funding model where industry bear a greater proportion of the costs of financial regulation were articulated in the public consultation paper.  These include, the scale of resources devoted to regulation, the escalating costs that are borne by the taxpayer, and the changing landscape of the industry where consumers are located both here and abroad. My Department and the Central Bank are in the process of finalising a joint Feedback Statement to the Public Consultation which will be published in Q3 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the 2017 industry funding levies will recoup 65% of the costs of financial regulation from industry (with certain sectoral exceptions).

One important part of the strategy is the ongoing Central Bank action to require banks to engage with their borrowers in mortgage difficulty and to formulate sustainable solutions to address cases of mortgage arrears.  Within the remit of the Central Bank&rsquo;s responsibilities for safeguarding stability and protecting consumers, its approach to mortgage arrears resolution is focused on ensuring the fair treatment of borrowers through a strong consumer protection framework and ensuring that lenders have appropriate arrears resolution strategies and operations in place.  <\/p>  <p>  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) is a key part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Framework in this regard.  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms with each borrower by reference to that borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner by reference to that borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Each regulated entity must consider the borrower&rsquo;s situation in the context of the solutions they provide, which may differ from firm to firm. The CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered.  Rather, the CCMA includes requirements to ensure that any alternative repayment arrangement agreed between a lender and borrower be appropriate and sustainable and based on a full assessment of the individual circumstances of that borrower.<\/p>  <p>  Under the CCMA, a lender must explore all of the options for alternative arrangements offered by that lender and such alternative repayment arrangements may include a split mortgage. The Central Bank has also published guidelines on Sustainable Mortgage Arrears Solutions which provides guidance to supervisors as to the important factors to consider when assessing if the restructures implemented are in fact sustainable solutions for resolving distressed mortgage cases. Information relating to a range of restructure arrangements is provided, including split mortgages.<\/p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy is aware, where it is not possible to agree sustainable solutions at a bilateral level, the personal insolvency framework has been significantly reformed over recent years to provide borrowers with more flexible and accessible statutory options to address unsustainable mortgage and other debts.  In particular, where it is appropriate in the circumstances of the individual case, the Courts can now confirm a PIA proposal to address an unsustainable primary home mortgage debt even though the proposal is opposed by the mortgage creditor, provided that the arrangement will enable the creditor to recover the debts due to the extent that the means of the debtor reasonably permits.  Therefore, the new insolvency framework now provides for a fairer balance between the legitimate interests of both creditors and insolvent debtors in the resolution of unsustainable mortgage debt situations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100067#WRG03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":253,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100067#WRG03200"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[32129\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100067#WRG03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to amend the qualifying rules for the fishers tax credit and the seafarers allowance in order that fishermen whose journey begins or ends within the State can avail of the relief; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":255,"content":"<p>Both the fishers tax credit and the seafarers allowance are already available to qualifying persons whose journeys either begin or end in the State.

The 2015 Act allows for the possibility of applying the vacant site levy to both brownfield (in-fill) and greenfield (new) development sites so long as they are located in designated areas in local authority development plans for the application of the levy. I understand that the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government proposes to encourage local authorities to apply the levy on as wide a basis as possible (brownfield and greenfield sites) in order to bring housing supply on stream earlier than would otherwise be the case.<\/p>  <p>  On considering the outcome of the public consultation and the enactment of the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, it was determined that no new tax intended to encourage the development of residentially zoned and serviced land would be introduced. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to a site valuation tax, the Deputy may wish to note that the 2012 report of the Inter-departmental Group on the Design of a Local Property Tax (the \"Thornhill Group\") comprehensively examined the basis of assessment for the Local Property Tax (LPT), including both the taxable value of the property option and a site value tax (SVT). The report favoured the use of market value of residential properties as the basis of assessment and this recommendation was accepted by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Thornhill Group concluded that the arguments for SVT were outweighed by the likely difficulties in ensuring acceptance by taxpayers, i.e., arriving at values that were evidence based, understandable and acceptable to the public in addition to complexities and uncertainties in the valuation effort necessary to put an SVT in place. In contrast, the Group considered that under a market value approach applied to housing, the market value of a residential property would be related to the characteristics of the building itself, the site on which it was located and the characteristics and amenities of the neighbourhood. There would be a relationship between the market value of a house and benefits to the owners in terms of enjoyment of the amenity value of the properties. <\/p>  <p>  At the request of the Minister for Finance, the operation of the LPT was reviewed in 2015 by Dr. Thornhill. A number of submissions to the review favoured changing the basis of determination of LPT liabilities to site value, floor area or variations thereof. Dr. Thornhill considered these but remained of the view that market value is the most appropriate and equitable basis on which to determine LPT liabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100068#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":270,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100068#WRH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":271,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[32223\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100068#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost of increasing the self-employed tax credit in circumstances (details supplied).","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":272,"content":"<p>I am informed by Revenue that the estimated first and full year cost to the Exchequer of increasing the Earned Income Credit (EIC) to levels proposed by the Deputy and tapering the increase by 5% per &euro;1,000 between &euro;80,000 and &euro;100,000, with no additional credit entitlement (above the current &euro;950) when income exceeds &euro;100,000, is outlined in the following table.<table><tr><th>EIC increase<\/th><th>First Year<br \/><br \/>&euro;m<\/th><th>Full Year<br \/><br \/>&euro;m<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>By &euro;250 to &euro;1,200<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>33<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>By &euro;350 to &euro;1,300<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>46<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>By &euro;450 to &euro;1,400<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>60<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>By &euro;550 to &euro;1,500<\/td><td>41<\/td><td>73<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>By &euro;700 to &euro;1,650<\/td><td>52<\/td><td>93<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The figures for the cost of the increase in EIC are based on the Revenue tax forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2014, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim.

Dr. Thornhill made a number of recommendations in his report on his review of the Local Property Tax. His central recommendation was for a revised system whereby a minimum level of LPT revenues in each local authority area would be determined by Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historic yield. This in turn would allow for the estimation of LPT rates for each local authority area and the application of these by taxpayers and Revenue. Local authorities could adjust this rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%.

Specific criteria were set down in respect of the areas which should be included within the remit of the Living City Initiative which were required to be taken into account by the relevant city councils when putting forward the proposed Special Regeneration Areas for each city. In particular, it was stated that the Special Regeneration Areas should be inner city areas which are largely comprised of dwellings built before 1915, where there is above average unemployment and which demonstrate clear evidence of neglect, dereliction and under-use. It was specified that areas which are generally regarded as affluent, have high occupancy rates and which do not require regeneration should not be included in the Special Regeneration Areas.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department reviewed the Living City Initiative in 2016 in consultation with the relevant councils and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. On foot of that review, Minister Noonan announced a number of changes to the scheme in Budget 2017 in order to make the initiative more attractive and effective. The principal change extended the residential element of the scheme to landlords, who are now able to claim the relief by way of accelerated capital allowances for the conversion and refurbishment of property, which was built prior to 1915, where such property is to be used for residential purposes. In addition, the requirement for a pre-1915 building to have been originally constructed for use as a dwelling in order to qualify for the residential element of the Initiative was removed. The floor area restriction for owner-occupiers has also been removed, while the minimum amount of capital expenditure required for eligibility for relief, under all elements of the scheme, was also amended and must now only exceed &euro;5,000.

Under section 18 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, rental income earned by companies and individuals from a property situated in the State is taxable under Case V of Schedule D of the TCA 1997. This basis of taxation makes no distinction between rental income from property let for residential occupation and property let for commercial occupation, or between rental income from private tenants and tenants in receipt of social housing supports. Therefore, landlord income tax returns are not remitted to Revenue in a format in which rental income from tenants who are eligible for rent supplement or the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) can be separately identified, and there is therefore no basis on which Revenue can cost the proposals as outlined by the Deputy. <\/p><p>The Deputy may be aware that there is already tax relief in place to support landlords in providing accommodation to tenants in receipt of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) or rent supplement. The relief was introduced in Finance Act 2015 in order to improve the stability of housing supply to tenants in receipt of these social housing supports. The relief allows a full 100% mortgage interest deduction against rental income (increased from 75% in 2016 and from 80% in 2017) where a landlord undertakes, for a period of at least three years, to provide accommodation to such tenants and registers such undertakings with the Residential Tenancies Board within certain time limits.

Section 1 of this Act makes a lessee (i.e. a tenant) the accountable person for the stamp duty charge and section 2 provides for a situation where there is more than a single accountable person by making each accountable person jointly and severally liable for the stamp duty charge.

It also included a rigorous programme of enforcement action, underpinned by legislative changes that have been introduced over a number of Finance Acts to strengthen Revenue&rsquo;s powers for dealing with this kind of fraud.  In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom undertook a joint initiative to find a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels, which was introduced in Ireland and the United Kingdom from the beginning of April 2015.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the industry view is that the measures implemented to date have been successful in significantly curtailing fuel fraud in Ireland.  This view is supported by a significant increase in tax revenues from road diesel over the past three years of the order of &euro;230m.  I am also advised that Revenue conducted a National Random Sampling Programme in January 2016, with a view to obtaining an updated picture of the extent of the fuel laundering problem.  The programme involved selecting a random sample comprising nearly one in every ten of the 2,500 holders of Auto Fuel Trader Licences (any trader that produces, sells, deals in, or keeps for sale or delivery road diesel is legally obliged to hold such a licence).  Road diesel samples were taken from all traders in the programme and tested for the presence of the new marker.  No evidence of the new marker was found in any of the samples tested.  The random sampling programme was repeated in January 2017 and, again, no evidence of the marker was found.  This provides very persuasive evidence that the strategy undertaken in recent years has been successful in addressing and significantly curtailing the laundering problem.  <\/p>  <p>  Action is taken against all aspects of the illegal tobacco trade and includes a range of measures to identify and target persons engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those involved.  Revenue&rsquo;s multifaceted strategy encompasses ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, extensive cooperation (including the development and sharing of intelligence) on a national, EU and international basis, use of analytics and detection technologies and optimising the deployment of resources.<\/p>  <p>  A combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the risk based screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages contribute to the effectiveness of Revenue&rsquo;s goal of intercepting the supply of illicit tobacco products.  Revenue also targets the illicit trade in tobacco at post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, and as in the case of fuel, action has been taken through Finance Acts over recent years to ensure that Revenue has the statutory powers necessary for undertaking its important work against the illegal tobacco trade.<\/p>  <p>  In assessing the overall effectiveness in tackling the illegal tobacco trade, a reliable measure is provided by the annual surveys of illegal tobacco products carried out by IPSOS\/MRBI  for Revenue and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Services Executive. The survey in 2016 found that 10% of cigarette packs encountered in the course of the project were illicit down from the levels of 15% and 13% found in 2011 and 2102 respectively.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue works closely with an An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against fuel and tobacco fraud, and the relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border enforcement groups, to target the organised crime groups responsible for a large proportion of this criminal activity.  This work is being supported and facilitated by the setting up in 2016, in the framework of &ldquo;A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan&rdquo;, of a Joint Agency Task Force, which includes Revenue as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their Northern Ireland counterparts.  Revenue also works in close cooperation with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat both the illicit fuel and tobacco trades.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work against fuel fraud and the illicit tobacco trade has achieved a considerable level of success, and I am assured that action in these areas will continue to be a high priority. In addition, I can say to the Deputy that I will give careful consideration to any further proposals for legislative change that may be brought forward by Revenue to enhance the capacity to deal effectively with fraud and criminality in these areas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100069#WRJ02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Regulation","counter":335,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100069#WRJ02600"},{"type":"question","counter":336,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[32584\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100069#WRJ02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the process in place to prevent a monopoly by one or two Irish banks in the retail banking sector.","asker":"1284","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":337,"content":"<p>The Programme for Partnership Government places consumers at the centre of the Government&rsquo;s banking sector policies by focusing on the strengthening of consumers&rsquo; rights and knowledge, and fostering greater competition in credit provision through supporting non-bank credit providers and reducing the State's ownership of the banking system.  <\/p>  <p>  Statutory bodies play an important role in achieving these Government objectives.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law in Ireland. Its mission is to make markets work better for consumers and businesses. A key aspect of consumer protection in relation to retail banking is ensuring that institutions are not abusing their market power and that competition is protected and enhanced in the long term interests of consumers.  In that context, the CCPC recently published an in depth review of the residential mortgage market and set out a number of short, medium and long term options which could allow for greater competition from new entrants in the mortgage market, and could also encourage lenders to compete more vigorously on price, quality and innovation. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, commercial banks are not the only option available to retail consumers. For example, the credit union sector offers sources of credit for the mutual benefit of its members at a fair and reasonable rate of interest.  <\/p>  <p>  The State is also promoting alternative 'non-bank' financing solutions in order to encourage competition in the banking sector. While this is initially focused on the SME sector, the increased competition will lead to improvements in the financial sector overall. In this regard, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is Ireland&rsquo;s National Promotional Institution for SMEs, with a strategic mission to deliver effective financial supports to Irish SMEs that address failures in the Irish credit market. <\/p>  <p>  The SBCI began lending in March 2015. To the end of March 2017, the SBCI has lent out &euro;657 million to nearly 15,300 SMEs supporting the employment of over 67,000 people. SMEs in all sectors of the Irish economy benefit from SBCI finance through has three bank and five non-bank on-lenders.  Most of the SMEs supported by the SBCI are based in all regions of the country, with 85% of them outside Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  The SBCI is working to develop a more diverse range of on-lenders and innovative products to meet the evolving requirements of the SME finance market and contribute to a sustainable and competitive economy. <\/p>  <p>  Moreover, the recent disposal by the State of 28.8% of its shareholding in AIB will not only help reduce our elevated national debt but, I believe, can also foster further competition in the Irish banking market, by removing any perception of State interference that might dissuade new entrants. This is a view that has also been highlighted by the CCPC in their recent &lsquo;Options for Ireland&rsquo;s Mortgage Market&rsquo; paper, in which they highlighted that the clear policy position as regards the sale of the State&rsquo;s shareholdings in AIB has, &ldquo;&hellip;also given a large degree of confidence to international investors and potential new entrants, who might otherwise have viewed State ownership as a real barrier to entry.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is also playing an important role in protecting consumers, as identified in the Bank&rsquo;s mission statement of &lsquo;Safeguard Stability, Protect Consumers&rsquo;.  Since the widespread reforms that took place following the financial crisis, Ireland is now widely recognised as having a well regulated financial services sector, an important pillar underpinning the soundness of the banking sector and which is necessary to foster greater competition. <\/p>  <p>  The Consumer Protection Directorate aims to deliver on its consumer protection mandate in the context of three important desired consumer protection outcomes:<\/p>  <p>  - a positive consumer-focused culture that is embedded and demonstrated within all firms;<\/p>  <p>  - a consumer protection framework that is fit for purpose and ensures that consumers&rsquo; best interests are protected; and <\/p>  <p>  - regulated firms that are fully compliant with their obligations and are treating their customers, existing and new, in a fair and transparent way. <\/p>  <p>  This framework puts the consumer at its centre, where the focus of firms must be on delivering positive consumer outcomes within a regulatory framework that is fit for purpose. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100069#WRJ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Data","counter":338,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100069#WRJ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":339,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[32585\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100069#WRJ03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the percentage of annual turnover nationally transacted by a bank (details supplied).","asker":"1284","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":340,"content":"<p>All information in relation to AIB's financial performance is contained within the bank's annual report.

The legislative provisions for HTB are set out in Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Those provisions include the following:<\/p>  <p>  - the obligation on contractors that receive a payment in respect of a claimant to &lsquo;treat the appropriate payment as a credit against the purchase price of the qualifying residence&rsquo; (section 16b);<\/p>  <p>  - the conditions to ensure that eligibility for the HTB refund is maintained for 5 years (section 17);<\/p>  <p>  - the obligation to repay a HTB payment to Revenue where a claimant or contractor (as appropriate) is unable to meet any of the HTB conditions, which include that the qualifying residence is to be purchased within 2 years (section 18); and<\/p>  <p>  - that Revenue can raise an assessment on a claimant or contractor (as appropriate) where a HTB payment is not repaid to Revenue (section 20).<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, there is an obligation on any qualifying contractor, in receipt of HTB payments to their bank account in respect of house purchases in the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019, to<\/p>  <p>  1. provide a house for the HTB claimant within 2 years, and <\/p>  <p>  2. give the HTB claimant credit for the value of the HTB payment received from Revenue as part of their deposit.  <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the safeguards in place to protect the Exchequer from contractors who fail to meet the conditions of the HTB incentive; In the first instance all qualifying contractors must hold a tax clearance certificate to certify that they are fully tax compliant, and they must also meet all of the requirements of Relevant Contracts Tax.  In addition, if a qualifying contractor is unable to provide a house for the HTB claimant, then he, she or it is required to refund the HTB payment received to Revenue.  If the payment is not refunded, Revenue can raise an assessment.  If the assessment is unpaid, the amount of the refund and any interest thereon constitutes a charge on the contractor&rsquo;s freehold or leasehold estate or interest in the land on which the qualifying residence was to be built and remains so until it is fully paid.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue provides a range of information about the operation of the HTB incentive on their website, including detailed applicant and contractor guides.  Furthermore, Revenue has been involved in discussions and meetings with various stakeholders about the operational procedures for HTB, including the Construction Industry Federation and the Law Society.  In these discussions, Revenue highlighted, in particular, the obligations on contractors to provide the first home for the HTB claimant within two years or that there would be a clawback of the HTB payments made.<\/p>  <p>  I am further advised that, as part of its overall administration of the HTB incentive, Revenue is operating risk based compliance checks to ensure that the qualifying conditions of the scheme are met by qualifying contractors and claimants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100070#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":351,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100070#WRK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":352,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[32651\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100070#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the level of expenditure by his Department or organisations under the aegis of his Department for each of the past five years on photography, advertising, communications advice, public relations, website development, media interview training and preparation;

The quantum of retirement benefits from all sources must be taken into account when calculating this &euro;20,000 limit. The applicable rates of tax, USC and PRSI are those applicable to any other pension payment. <\/p>  <p>  Full commutation is also permitted by Revenue on triviality grounds where, on retirement, the aggregate pension benefits payable to an employee under all schemes related to an employment do not exceed the value of &euro;330 per annum. Tax on the chargeable part of such payments is at a rate of 10%, under Schedule D Case IV.  <\/p>  <p>  Both of these options are only available at a point where an individual is entitled to draw down benefits from a scheme, i.e. where they reach the retirement age set out in the conditions of their scheme, or are entitled to access benefits for other reasons, such as serious ill health. <\/p>  <p>  Should an individual move their pension fund to another jurisdiction they may be subject to different draw down rules depending on the jurisdiction; however any transfer of pension funds offshore must be for bona fide reasons and must not contravene tax legislation or undermine pension tax policy.<\/p>  <p>  Moving pension funds off-shore in an effort to circumvent the requirements of Irish pension tax legislation may fall foul of the conditions under which a pension scheme was approved by the Revenue Commissioners as an exempt approved scheme or the conditions under which a Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) product received Revenue approval.  This could result in the withdrawal of the approval of an occupational pension scheme in accordance with the provisions of section 772(5) of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 or the withdrawal of the approval of the PRSA product under section 787K (3) and (4) TCA 1997. Any such withdrawal of approval could trigger significant tax liabilities on the sums moved off shore and the withdrawal or claw back of tax reliefs. Moreover, in such cases and depending on the circumstances and the motivation of the individual concerned, the possibility also arises that such transactions may also fall foul of the legislation designed to counter tax avoidance transactions.<\/p>  <p>  The essential feature of any pension policy is to provide income for an individual in retirement. The rationale for giving tax relief for contributions to various types of retirement products is to encourage savings over the long term so that individuals will have an income in old age.  There are a number of reasons why pre-retirement access to benefits from pension plans or schemes is not permitted, the principal one being that these arrangements are designed to be long term savings vehicles based on the principle that the benefits will be maintained to help fund an adequate income in retirement.<\/p>  <p>  Given that the correct treatment of a pension in situations such as this depends on the facts and circumstances of the case, if the Deputy has concerns regarding the fund of a particular individual it may be advisable to contact Revenue directly outlining the facts of the case to obtain a comprehensive answer on the available options.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100070#WRK02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sale of State Assets","counter":367,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100070#WRK02200"},{"type":"question","counter":368,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[33080\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100070#WRK02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to the recent sale of over 25% of the State's equity in a bank (details supplied), the estimated costs involved; and the costs by the individual service providers engaged.","asker":"1284","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":369,"content":"<p>The Deputy should be aware that in line with the State agreements with AIB, all fees incurred by the State in relation to an IPO transaction will be paid by the bank.<\/p><p>Following a successful transaction, fees are payable to the selling syndicate of investment banks and are proportionate to the value of the transaction.

The Mid-Year Expenditure Report (MYER), which is to be published in the coming weeks, will include a substantive overview of this process. Alongside the MYER, a series of papers will be published that will present the results of the analysis of the wide range of expenditure schemes and programmes that have been examined this year. This 2017 Review is the first in a three-year cycle of 'rolling', selective reviews that will examine all day-to-day Departmental spending by 2019. This reflects a change in approach from the 2011 and 2014 Comprehensive Reviews of Expenditure, which covered all Government expenditure in a single year.<\/p>  <p>  The Spending Review process operates within the wider budgetary architecture and the medium-term expenditure framework, which supports sustainable expenditure policy, anchored by reference to the fiscal rules. The major challenge addressed by the process is to prioritise between policy initiatives to ensure resources are allocated to areas where they can have the greatest impact, while respecting the necessary parameters set by the overall budgetary limits. <\/p>  <p>  The aim of the Spending Review process is not to reduce Departmental expenditure, but rather to examine existing spending within the overall budget constraints by reference to the principles of efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability and impact. The Deputy will appreciate that the systematic and detailed examination  of baseline expenditure using available evidence and data can help attenuate the tendency to otherwise focus only on the incremental increase in expenditure in the Estimates each year which constitutes only a small proportion of the totality of overall public spending.  The results of the Spending Review analysis will support budgetary decisions and facilitate the consideration of existing expenditure alongside budgetary proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100070#WRK03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Regulations","counter":376,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100070#WRK03100"},{"type":"question","counter":377,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[32444\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100070#WRK03200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the measures his Department has implemented to support SMEs in accessing the public procurement market; the steps that have been taken to allow Government bodies access procurement locally as promised in the programme for Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":378,"content":"<p>Public Procurement is governed by EU and National rules.

My Department invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling:<\/p><p>- 63% of students to attend mainstream schools<\/p><p>- 26% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and<\/p><p>- 11% to attend special schools.<\/p><p>Some students, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there.  This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream. <\/p><p>Enrolment in an ASD special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he\/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports. <\/p><p>Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that: <\/p><p>- S\/he has ASD <\/p><p>- S\/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.<\/p><p>The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.<\/p><p>The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned.  The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.\u00a0 <\/p><p>While it is not always possible to ensure that a special class placement will be available in the child&rsquo;s local school, the NCSE has informed my Department that, in general, they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand. <\/p><p>Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of special classes by over 100% from 548 in 2011 to 1,152 across the country now, of which 887 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes. <\/p><p>The NCSE intends to establish an additional 145 ASD Special Classes for the 2017\/18 school year increasing the number of ASD Special Classes to 1,032. <\/p><p>With regard to Co.

Laois to 19, of which, 16 are Primary ASD Special classes and 3 are Post Primary ASD Special classes. Of these, 5 Primary ASD Special classes and 1 Post Primary ASD Special class are in schools in the Portlaoise area. <\/p><p>The NCSE has informed my Department that they are satisfied that there will be sufficient special class placements available to meet demand in the Portlaoise area for the forthcoming school year.<\/p><p>My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities.\u00a0 <\/p><p>During the passage of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill in the Select Committee last week I indicated that I intend, at Report Stage, to include in this Bill a provision that will provide, based on reports and advice from the NCSE, the Minister will have the power to require a school to open a special class or increase the number of special classes in schools identified by the NCSE.

Where a parent feels that the school&rsquo;s board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, they should contact the Ombudsman for Children.<\/p><p>The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised with the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school&rsquo;s complaints procedures.<\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, on 5 December 2016, I published the General Scheme of an Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill 2016.  The Government have approved the draft outline of a new law, which will require every school to consult with parents and students, and publish and operate a Parent and Student Charter.  When enacted, every school will be required to consult with parents and students, and publish a Parent and Student Charter. <\/p><p>The General Scheme provides that a Parent and Student Charter will set out the service the school will provide, the standards that will be adhered to and the relationship the school will maintain with the students of the school and their parents.  The General Scheme also sets out a number of broad principles on which each Charter shall be based on. <\/p><p>These principles include:<\/p><p>- 1.  Consulting students and parents and encouraging their engagement and full participation in relation to school policies and plans;<\/p><p>- 2.  Providing students and parents with information, including accountability for provision and information on school performance;<\/p><p>- 3.  Inviting feedback, comment and observations from students and parents and developing a listening culture in the school;<\/p><p>- 4.  Ensuring courtesy, confidentiality and equality of esteem;<\/p><p>- 5.  Acknowledging gaps, deficiencies or room for improvement;<\/p><p>- 6.  Positively seeking to address parent and student concerns and electively providing redress as appropriate in order to obviate as far as possible the need for a parent or student to rely on grievance and complaint processes;<\/p><p>- 7.  Providing processes for grievance and complaint resolution, including mediation and remediation where appropriate, and<\/p><p>- 8.  Having procedures that include accounting for the outcome of a complaint, the reasons for the outcome, and the basis on which the outcome was determined by the school.<\/p><p>Under the draft legislation, I will have the power, as Minister, to publish statutory guidelines that a school will be required to follow in developing its parent and student charter.  These guidelines would be published after consultation with the main education partners, including bodies representing parents and students. <\/p><p>The Guidelines will set a national standard and will assist schools by effectively providing a template to be used by each school when preparing its charter for publication.\u00a0 It is expected that the charter guidelines when developed will cover in detail the following general elements of a Charter:<\/p><p>1.  How schools will engage with students and parents, collectively and individually<\/p><p>2.  How students and parents will be consulted and invited to participate meaningfully in matters relating to the student&rsquo;s experiences in the school<\/p><p>3.  How students and parents can be empowered by the provision of information<\/p><p>4.  How the school will be accountable to students and parents\u00a0<\/p><p>5.  How specific Information on school performance in teaching and learning will be provided.<\/p><p>6.  How feedback will be invited and how student and parent concerns will be identified<\/p><p>7.

Consultation with the Department of\u00a0Children and Youth Affairs and with Childcare Committees Ireland in relation to administering the surveys of pre-school parents is ongoing and it is anticipated that this phase will commence in the autumn when the survey arrangements have been finalised and tested. <\/p>  <p>  There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and the existing patrons\/landowners concerning the possible transfer of schools to accommodate this demonstrated demand for diversity. Each ETB will prepare a report for my Department outlining the levels of demand within their functional areas and the responses of the existing patrons as to how this might be accommodated through the reconfiguration of existing school provision.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In the subsequent and separate implementation phase, where the level of demand for multi-denominational schools is sufficient to justify transfer of a school from denominational to multi-denominational patronage, a process will commence to give effect to that. There will be a role for the existing patron\/landowner in consulting with local community and school interests, including parents and taking into account proposals from different prospective multi-denominational patrons.\u00a0 It is envisaged that transfers will largely be by way of voluntary transfer of live schools by existing patrons.<\/p>  <p>  This new process for supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families is based around principles of transparency and cooperation. Therefore, there will be a very substantial level of consultation of local communities in the process, both with the ETBs in the initial phase to establish evidence of demand by consulting pre-school parents and subsequently through the requirement for the existing patron to consult with local community and school interests in proposing to transfer patronage of an existing school to an alternative patron body. \u00a0In that process, the existing patron will also take into account proposals from all prospective multi-denominational patrons that wish to be considered.\u00a0In the final instance, an application for a formal transfer of patronage will have to be made by the existing patron under the Education Act 1998, which will require Ministerial approval.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge the voluntary nature of these transfers, given that the current patron is in most cases the owner of the land on which the school stands.\u00a0 My Department will develop protocols on patronage transfer with existing patrons to ensure that school and local communities and prospective patrons are fully consulted before a decision is made.\u00a0 I am confident that this process will respect the views of all parties - parents, local schools and communities and patrons.<\/p>  <p>  While these new structures are being introduced, my Department will continue to work with the main stakeholders to progress delivery of diversity in areas already identified, in 2017 and beyond.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to working constructively with all education stakeholders and patron bodies in this important endeavour and I would ask all parties to put aside sectional or self interest in pursuing the national objective of providing greater diversity of school provision in line with the choices of parents, families and school communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100073#WRN04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":524,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[32377\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100074#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the 16 areas still waiting for the implementation of the 2012 reconfiguration plan in respect of school patronage;

We believe that the lines of communication must be kept open and this includes through the accession process, which gives us at least some leverage with which to encourage Turkey to return to European values. <\/p>  <p>  On the other hand, I acknowledge that on 24 November 2016 the European Parliament passed a resolution calling for a temporary freeze of negotiations.  A further resolution reiterating this position was passed on 6 July.  It calls for the formal suspension of accession negotiations without delay.  Neither resolution is binding as decisions in relation to accession are a matter for the Council, but both reflect the serious concerns in relation to ongoing developments in Turkey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100076#WRQ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":614,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100076#WRQ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":615,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[32297\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100076#WRQ01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on the situation in South Sudan; the efforts being made by the Government and the EU to help bring an end to the conflict; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":616,"content":"<p>I remain seriously concerned about the situation in South Sudan, where fighting continues to drive displacement, acute hunger and grave human rights abuses.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the announcement of the National Dialogue in December 2016, fighting has increased in recent months.  The conflict itself has fragmented, increasingly on ethnic lines.  Ireland and our EU partners have repeatedly condemned the violence and I am especially concerned by recent reports of blockages to aid deliveries in the Equatoria region.<\/p>  <p>  To resolve the political crisis and ensure unhindered humanitarian access, sustained collective effort is required regionally and internationally, including by the UN, the African Union, and the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD).  I therefore welcome the recent meetings of the IGAD Heads of State and Council of Ministers which demonstrated renewed efforts to seek an inclusive political solution to the conflict. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland and our EU partners have maintained our focus on South Sudan.  At EU level, Council Conclusions adopted at the Foreign Affairs Council in December 2016 called on the South Sudanese leadership to uphold its duty to protect its citizens.  EU efforts to stem the flow of weapons and resources fuelling the conflict have included the imposition of an arms embargo and restrictive measures against individuals obstructing the peace process. <\/p>  <p>  We have repeatedly highlighted the gross violations of human rights occurring in South Sudan, including at the recent session of the UN Human Rights Council in March 2017.  At a Special Session of the Council in December 2016, Ireland supported the renewal of the mandate of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, and called for the maintenance of international support for the 2015 Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has provided almost &euro;48 million in humanitarian assistance for the South Sudan crisis since 2012, including assistance for South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.  So far this year, we have provided &euro;9.2 million.  Ireland is also providing support through core funding and other contributions to UN agencies and organizations, the Red Cross, and NGO pooled funds, all of which are providing assistance on the ground.

Rather the EU has proposed a number of ways to help Libya to manage and control the flow of migrants risking their lives, and it continues to seek solutions to prevent further loss of life and to improve conditions on the ground for migrants.<\/p>  <p>  The March European Council confirmed the EU&rsquo;s commitment to assist Libya as set out in February&rsquo;s Malta Declaration.  That commitment is broad-ranging, including capacity building, training, and the provision of equipment and support for the Libyan national coast guard and other agencies.  It also seeks to ensure that there are adequate reception capacities in Libya for migrants, including through working with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).<\/p>  <p>  In April, the EU approved a &euro;90 million programme to step up protection of migrants and to reinforce migration management in Libya.  A key objective is to provide multi-sectoral assistance and protection to migrants, refugees and host communities in different locations inside Libya, in particular inside detention centres, at disembarkation points and in urban settings.  This programme is being implemented through a number of international agencies including the UNHCR and UNICEF.  The &euro;90m is in addition to the &euro;120 million previously announced by the EU for migration-related support for Libya. <\/p>  <p>  Migration along the Central Mediterranean Route was discussed at the European Council in June, which made clear that continuing migratory flows leading to an ongoing loss of life remains an issue of urgent concern.  It agreed that the EU and its member states had to step up coordination and delivery on all the elements contained in the Malta Declaration, the Partnership Framework and the Joint Valletta Action Plan, underpinned by sufficient financial resources.  Training and equipping the Libyan Coast Guard is a key component of the EU approach and the Council agreed that it should be speeded up.  Cooperation with countries of origin and transit is to be reinforced in order to stem the migratory pressure on Libya&rsquo;s and other neighbouring countries' land borders.  The European Council underlined in this context the importance of supporting the G5 Sahel Joint force (recently established to address the threat of terrorism, as well as the serious challenges posed by transnational organized crime in the region which comprises Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger).  There, as elsewhere, the disruption of the business models of human smugglers and traffickers remains a key objective, including by better controlling the trade in equipment used by them.<\/p>  <p>  The EU will continue its active engagement with Libya to see what more can be done to address the difficulties migrants face there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100076#WRQ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":620,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100076#WRQ02300"},{"type":"question","counter":621,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[32299\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100076#WRQ02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on the situation in Venezuela; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":622,"content":"<p>I am deeply concerned by the deteriorating situation in Venezuela, and in particular by the recent violent attacks against the democratically elected National Assembly.<\/p>  <p>  While there have been long-running demonstrations in Venezuela, the past two months have seen almost daily mass-protests, resulting in dozens of deaths in clashes between security forces and opposition demonstrators.

A number of worrying developments suggest an increasingly restrictive attitude to those opposing or challenging the Government in any way.  Statements from the Bahraini Government on its commitment to safeguarding human rights enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution ring hollow when there are so many examples of violations of the most fundamental freedoms, including those of opinion and expression (which includes the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas), thought, conscience and religion, and movement.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland attaches a high priority to safeguarding human rights defenders such as the person referenced by the Deputy.

It has been a particular problem for Italy and Greece as the. EU countries where the majority of migrants arrive.  The EU has responded to the crisis by adopting a range of measures to deal with this mass movement of people.  These have included engaging with countries of origin and transit to address the root causes of migration including through the Migration Partnership Framework; agreeing a plan to relocate migrants from Italy and Greece across the Union; the launching of Operation Sophia to disrupt people smuggling in the Mediterranean; and substantial financial assistance to countries hosting large numbers of migrants.  EU Heads of State and Government concluded a landmark migration deal with Turkey in March 2016, which has resulted in a very substantial reduction in the number of migrants risking their lives at sea to enter the EU from Turkey.  In the past year the focus has shifted from Greece and Turkey to the so-called Central Mediterranean Route, with some 181,000 migrants crossing from Libya to Italy in 2016.  So far this year, over 85,000 people have made the journey, a 20% increase over the same period in 2016, according to figures from the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).  At least 2,150 others have died trying.  Most migrants are coming from sub-Saharan Africa.  According to UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the top two nationalities arriving in Italy by sea in 2016 were Nigerians (21%) and Eritreans (11%).  The June European Council discussed the migration crisis and agreed to provide more support for Italy, to improve its coordination efforts and try to end the tragic situation where so many people are losing their lives.<\/p><p>In recent weeks, the Italian government has expressed its strong concern at the increase in the numbers of migrants arriving in Italy which is placing increasing strain on reception facilities.  The Interior ministers of France, Germany and Italy along with the European Commissioner for Migration and Home Affairs, met in Paris on 2 July and agreed, <i>inter alia<\/i>, to enhance support to the Libyan coastguard by increasing training activities and providing additional financial support while at the same time ensuring close monitoring of activities and to provide additional support to the IOM and the UNHCR to enable facilities in Libya to reach international standards in terms of living conditions and human rights.  They also agreed to accelerate the EU Relocation scheme agreed in 2015.<\/p><p>Ireland is playing its part to help resolve the EU migration crisis.  As part of that response we have to date taken in 785 asylum seekers and refugees from Lebanon under a UN-led Resettlement Programme and 459 migrants from Greece under the EU Relocation mechanism agreed in 2015.  Efforts are ongoing with the Italian authorities to resolve the issue of the security screening of migrants which has prevented any relocations from Italy to Ireland to date.

","asker":"1217","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":653,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that the position regarding the determination of commercial rates under Irish law is that rates are essentially a charge on the occupation of property where the occupier is liable for payment unless expressly exempted under the terms of Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act (as amended).  Accordingly, rates are levied on a very wide range of commercial and industrial properties, including sites with or without buildings provided the property is capable of beneficial occupation.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, the exemptions from commercial rates generally include properties such as domestic premises and those used for public religious worship and certain premises used for education and for the purpose of caring for the sick, elderly, handicapped and disabled.<\/p><p>The basic premise under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 is that all interests including buildings and lands used or developed for any purpose (irrespective of whether such lands are surfaced) and any constructions affixed thereto are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the said Acts.<b><\/b>Specifically, Schedule 3 of the Valuation Act 2001 provides a list of relevant property for the purposes of valuation which includes &ldquo;lands used or developed for any purpose (irrespective of whether such lands are surfaced) and any constructions affixed thereto which pertain to that use or development.&rdquo;  This provision would cover certain yards without buildings and development sites which are in beneficial occupation and accordingly liable for commercial rates.<\/p><p>It is the function of the Commissioner of Valuation to determine whether properties are liable for or are exempt from rates.  The Commissioner is independent in the exercise of his functions under the Valuation Acts, 2001-2015 and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility and the statutes do not accord me any function in this regard.<\/p><p>Operationally, there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the amount of rates payable by a ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority.  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in carrying out his functions under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 and my Department has no role in this regard.  On the other hand, the annual setting of the ARV is a reserved function of the elected members of each Local Authority and the Commissioner of Valuation has no function in that regard.<\/p><p>The basis of rateable valuation for all property is &ldquo;net annual value&rdquo; and is set out in Part 11 of the Valuation Act, 2001.  Net annual value is the rental value for which one year with another, the building might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant of the property. <\/p><p>Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to the considerations relating to the possible introduction of a site-value tax, this question raises complex taxation policy issues, the determination of which would be a matter for Government as a whole.  There are varying points of view both nationally and internationally on this matter.  For instance, the 2009 Report of the Commission on Taxation did not make any recommendations for the adoption of a site-value tax in the course of its extensive examination of options for local government funding.  On the other hand, the National Competitiveness Council had a contrary view in 2015 when in a series of recommendations in the Council&rsquo;s assessment of competitiveness challenges facing the country, recommended the possible replacement of commercial rates with a new Site Valuation Tax that would also extend to unused development land, replacing the vacant sites tax.  These contrary viewpoints are illustrative of the complexity of the issues and the conflicting arguments for and against the introduction of a site valuation tax which the Government is keeping under review.  Of course tax policy is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.<\/p><p>The Deputy will note that one of the recommendations in the Commission on Taxation Report was that the implementation of a modern valuation base for the commercial rates system should be advanced as a matter of priority.  I wish to confirm that this recommendation is being addressed through the acceleration of the National Revaluation Programme currently underway under the direction of the Commissioner of Valuation.  As the Deputy will know, the programme has already been completed in six local authorities and another ten local authorities will have been revalued by September 2017.  I have been informed that the Commissioner intends to extend the programme to a further seven local authorities later this year and the final phase of the programme will commence in 2019.  The provision of a modern valuation base to underpin the setting and collection of commercial rates is a very welcome development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100077#WRR01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Commission","counter":654,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100077#WRR01100"},{"type":"question","counter":655,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[32336\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100077#WRR01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 will be fully commenced; his plans to implement it in various stages; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":656,"content":"<p>The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division.<\/p><p>I have been informed that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Louth Division on the 31 May 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 298 with 29 Garda Reserves and 25 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p><p>This plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that almost 1,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 59 of whom were assigned to the Louth Division.  I am also informed that a further four hundred Garda recruits are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Louth Division in the coming years. <\/p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.<\/p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out below the detailed information requested in relation to the number Garda&iacute; assigned to each District in Louth in each of the years 2013 to 2016 and as of 31 May 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, as supplied by the Commissioner. <\/p><p><b>LOUTH DIVISION STRENGTH

I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to pro-actively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime in this jurisdiction. <\/p><p>In 2015 the Commissioner, established a new national Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau which brought together the Organised Crime Unit and the Garda National Drug Unit so as to create a robust entity to effectively tackle drugs and organised crime as it currently exists in this country.  The Bureau leads out the policing strategy for tackling drugs supply and works closely with dedicated Divisional Drugs units and other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.  This approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p><p>This plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that almost 1,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed that a further four hundred Garda recruits are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility and activity in our communities.<\/p><p>As previously advised the Commissioner established the Bureau in 2015.

A key goal is to establish a model of through-care to parents returning to the community in partnership with Tusla and other community based organisations.  A number of significant objectives have been achieved so far; most notably enhanced staff training, delivery of the &lsquo;Parents Plus&rsquo; parenting programme on a pilot basis in Limerick Prison, the establishment of more family-friendly visits, and refurbishment of visit spaces. <\/p>  <p>  Following a period of consultation with a range of non-government organisations, the Irish Prison Service forged a partnership with the Childhood Development Initiative and the Parents Plus Charity to introduce a dedicated family and imprisonment programme on a pilot basis called 'Family Links' which commenced in Limerick Prison in September 2014 with the aim to improve the visiting experience for families, improve staff awareness of the effects of imprisonment on families, and to support the family unit with the introduction of a parenting programme. <\/p>  <p>  The Parents Plus Charity and Childhood Development Initiative have worked with the Irish Prison Service to tailor the &lsquo;Parents Plus&rsquo; parenting programme to meet the need of parents in prison.  Family Liaison Officers in Limerick Prison facilitate parenting skills course for prisoners, and &lsquo;Bedford Row&rsquo; charity works simultaneously to deliver the parenting programme in the community.  This programme has been successfully delivered to 24 prisoners.  An evaluation of the Family Links Programme in Limerick was launched by the T&aacute;naiste, Frances Fitzgerald TD on Monday 13th February 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Enhancements to visit facilities in a number of prisons is being gradually rolled out under the Small Works Scheme.   Funding was awarded to St. Vincent de Paul to extend their Visitor Centre facilities to Wheatfield Prison. The Irish Prison Service has allocated funding to appoint a Family Links Coordinator and to extend the Family Links model to Wheatfield Place of Detention and to Cork Prison in 2017, to include family related courses and programmes, staff training and support, community follow-up and partnership, communications and enhanced visiting facilities. <\/p>  <p>  All of our prisons facilitate visits on Saturdays to take account of the needs of families visiting persons in custody.

They return for lunch at 12 noon and cells are locked at 12.30 p.m.  Afternoon unlock commences at 2.15 p.m. and people in custody return to structured activities in schools, workshops and visits.  Evening tea is served from 4 p.m. and cells are locked from 4.30 p.m. to 5.20 p.m. when evening recreation commences until all cells are locked at 7.30 p.m.  <\/p>  <p>  I am further advised by the Irish Prison Service that it provides a wide range of rehabilitative programmes to persons in custody that include education, vocational training, healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  These programmes  offer purposeful activity to those in custody while serving their sentences and encourage them to lead law abiding lives on release.  These programmes are available in all prisons and all persons in custody are eligible to use the services.  <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the levels of access to services by prisoners is dependent on staffing levels on any particular day.  Prisons may experience staffing shortfalls on any given day for a number of reasons, including the number of escorts of prisoners to court or prisoners being admitted to hospital which requires staff to leave the prison.  On such occasions, prisons are now implementing Regime Management plans which help to ensure that access to services is maximised by directing resources at those prisoners wishing to avail of Work training and other regimes and through the implementation of a number of operational measures such as staggered feeding times for prisoners and rotational unlock of landings.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100079#WRT01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Data","counter":740,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100079#WRT01100"},{"type":"question","counter":741,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[32286\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100079#WRT01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of family visits requested in 2016; and the number of such visits refused in 2016.","asker":"1280","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":742,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the number of family visits for 2016 was in excess of 130,000 visits.<\/p>  <p>  There are two types of panel for each prisoner, namely a standard panel which predominantly features family and friends and a professional panel which features legal personnel and any other person providing a service.

Family Liaison Officers in Limerick Prison facilitate parenting skills course for prisoners, and &lsquo;Bedford Row&rsquo; charity works simultaneously to deliver the parenting programme in the community.

As a result, last year, the Government doubled its commitment under resettlement to 1,040.  The number of persons who have arrived from Lebanon under the UNHCR-led  resettlement programme now stands at 785.  The remaining 255 persons to arrive under resettlement have been selected and assessed and are expected to arrive later in the year, also from Lebanon.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the EU Relocation programme, 459 of our allocation of 1,089 from Greece are already in the State and a further 357 have been assessed and are awaiting transfer to Ireland.  A further mission to Athens this month assessed 101 persons.  Relocations from Italy have not been possible, to date, due to the refusal by the Italian authorities to allow other Member States, including Ireland, to conduct security assessments of candidates on its soil.  Bilateral discussions are continuing to try to resolve this impasse and the Commission has asked Italy to again examine the matter.  The Deputy should also be aware the actual numbers eligible for relocation from Italy and Greece are much lower than those originally envisaged under the two Council Decisions of September 2015 (160,000 people).  In its most recent publication on Relocation and Resettlement, published on 13 June, the Commission estimates some 39,000 people are eligible and registered for relocation in Italy and Greece, of which approximately 21,000 have been relocated to other Member States to date.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland agreed to take up to 20 unaccompanied minors (UAMs) under the relocation aspects of the IRPP.  Ireland's capacity to take UAMs is determined by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  Six UAMs (by the stricter Irish definition) have arrived in Ireland from Greece under the programme.  However, relatively few UAMs appear to be available within the cohort eligible for relocation and efforts continue to seek further transfers within this cohort.  All UAMs that have arrived to date are in the care of Tusla.<\/p>  <p>  In a further gesture of humanitarian assistance towards the most vulnerable caught up in the migration crisis and following a debate in the D&aacute;il, the Government also committed to taking up to 200 additional unaccompanied minors from France who were previously resident in the migrant camp at Calais.  On foot of the Government Decision, Tusla, The Child and Family Agency, which comes within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, launched the Calais Special Project (CSP).  This is being led operationally by their Separated Children Seeking Asylum team.  All of the unaccompanied minors that have been identified in cooperation with the French authorities as suitable for relocation to Ireland have been accepted into Ireland and provided with the appropriate supports.  I understand that 21 young persons have been relocated to this jurisdiction to date, 19 of whom are currently in the care of Tusla, and two of whom have been reunited with family members living in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that we are making progress to ensure many more people can come to Ireland under our resettlement and relocation programmes.  Our attention is focused on meeting these targets and the needs of those accepted under the programmes on arrival.  Significant resources are currently being invested in these humanitarian efforts through the various offices in my Department and in other Departments and agencies.  As a result we have established functioning mechanisms and associated expertise to deal with resettlement and relocation.  It is essential that we continue our efforts to complete the IRPP successfully before we look to apply the learning from this Programme to deliberations with regards to any future refugee intake.

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p><p>Last Thursday 6 July, a class of 198 Garda trainees attested as members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - the largest class to attest since the Garda College reopened in September 2014.  This brings the number of new recruits who have attested since the College reopened to almost 1,200, with another 400 scheduled to attest later this year.  This will bring Garda numbers to 13,500 by year-end once projected retirements are taken into account - an increase of 500 over last year.  This is real progress on reaching our target of 15,000 members by 2021.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.

The Ombudsman serves as an office of independent external review for serving members of the Defence Forces who must first exhaust existing internal grievance procedures before the Ombudsman can review or examine a case.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na I am advised that a new anti-bullying and harassment strategy is being developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021.  The policy is being developed to ensure that any Garda members and staff experiencing bullying and\/or harassment at work will receive the best possible organisational support in dealing with such issues. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of an external third party has proved to be beneficial in resolving these types of complaints on an ad-hoc basis within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and there would be merit in building external input into the system under development as a final resort for complainants alleging that they have been the victim of bullying or harassment.  The Defence Forces Ombudsman is one model.  It is a statutory body and legislation would most likely be required to replicate this system for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There are other models including the establishment  of a panel of experts.  In addition, of course it is the case at present that where an allegation of bullying or harassment would amount to a breach of discipline or a criminal office, a member may make a complaint to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  Any consideration of the introduction of a model similar to the Defence Forces Ombudsman would include a consideration as to whether to include provisions to determine and mediate grievance complaints made by members in respect of management decision that Garda&iacute; wish to appeal, as is the case with the Defence Forces Ombudsman.<\/p>  <p>  I have an open mind as to which model is most appropriate for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provided that whatever changes are made to the current arrangements deliver a system that has the confidence of all concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100081#WRV02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Station Refurbishment","counter":837,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100081#WRV02200"},{"type":"question","counter":838,"qnumday":334,"qnumall":"[33058\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100081#WRV02300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans regarding improvement works to be carried out at a Garda station (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":839,"content":"<p>The programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works (OPW), which has the responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation, and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.<\/p>  <p>  The refurbishment of Portlaoise Garda station is included in the Garda Capital Investment Programme 2016-2021, which is an ambitious 5- year Programme based on agreed priorities established by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that will benefit over thirty locations around the country.

Where a criminal offence such as assault, criminal damage or a public order offence is committed against a person based on their race, religion, colour, ethnicity, gender, disability or some other ground, the offence is prosecuted through the wider criminal law.  It is also accepted that such an offence is more serious on account of the hate or prejudice motivating the crime and Irish courts do consider evidence of a crime being motivated by hate or prejudice as an aggravating factor at sentencing.  <\/p>  <p>  With respect to legislation establishing hate crime as a specific and punishable crime, it is important that any legislation which is introduced will allow for effective prosecution of these type of offences.  I would also remind the Deputy of the second stage debate in October last year with respect to a Criminal Justice (Aggravation by Prejudice) Bill which was a Private Member's Bill introduced by Deputy O'Loughlin and Deputy Murphy O&rsquo;Mahony.  While there was support for the principle of the Bill, there were a number of concerns raised in respect of the approach proposed and the Deputies sponsoring the Bill undertook to further engage in respect of the proposals therein.

The Garda Racial Intercultural and Diversity Office (GRIDO) has responsibility for coordinating, monitoring and advising on all aspects of policing Ireland's diverse communities.  GRIDO monitors the reporting and recording of hate and racist crime on a continual basis.<\/p>  <p>  Garda Ethnic Liaison Officers (ELOs) are appointed to work with minority communities at local level throughout the country.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. <\/p><p>This plan is progressing apace.  I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that almost 1,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide,10, 25 and 15 of whom were assigned to the Cork North, Cork City and Cork West Divisions respectively.  I am also informed that a further four hundred Garda recruits are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

However, I want to assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the impact of crime on rural communities, including the serious damage done by organised gangs who target rural areas to engage in burglary and other property crime. <\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle organised crime gangs and other prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime.  This comprehensive operation is supported by the enhanced Government investment in Garda resources, including an additional allocation of &euro;88.5 million for overtime in 2017.  We have also invested heavily in the Garda fleet, with over 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015 and a provision of 46 million for new Garda vehicles under the Capital Plan 2016-2021.<\/p><p>The additional investments in policing make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting of burglaries and related crime via Operation Thor.  Under Operation Thor we have seen over 74,000 targeted checkpoints and  52,400 crime prevention patrols nationwide.  This concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 4,400 arrests and 4,900 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.  It is encouraging to note that since the launch of the Operation, the CSO burglary figures have shown a significant downward trend.  These show a<b><\/b>30% decrease in burglary for the twelve months of 2016 when compared to 2015, and this parallels the implementation of Operation Thor.<\/p><p>This Government has also made it a particular priority to strengthen our legislative provisions through the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015 which is targeted at repeat burglars who have previous convictions and who are charged with multiple offences of residential burglary.  This new legislation is now available to support the work which is being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Operation Thor.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities.  This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that. as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations.  There are a range of partnership initiatives which have been established between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and important rural-based organisations such as the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na Tire and other rural community organisations.  These include the well established Community Alert Programme, which receives annual funding from my Department, as well as the work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme.<\/p><p>Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  The Government is pursuing its plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits, up to 500 civilians and approximately 300 members of the Garda reserve.  These appointments will support the wide ranging reform plan which is in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and benefit policing services for all communities, whether in rural or urban areas.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100081#WRV03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":853,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100081#WRV03800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Landscape Strategy","counter":852,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100081#WRV03700"},{"type":"question","counter":853,"qnumday":339,"qnumall":"[32794\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100081#WRV03800","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when the national guidelines will be available to local authorities in respect of the renewal energy landscape character assessments; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":854,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[32798\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100081#WRV03900","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the reason the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport was not consulted when compiling and reviewing the renewal energy strategy landscape character assessment in respect of County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":855,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 339 and 340 together.<\/p><p>Arising from Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the European Landscape Convention I launched the <i>National Landscape Strategy for Ireland 2015-2025 <\/i>in May 2015.

It aims to address the deficits identified in a national needs assessment undertaken in 2005. Following the publication of the Policy, the National Development Committee for Children&rsquo;s Palliative Care (NDC)<b><\/b>was established by the HSE to oversee the implementation of its recommendations.  The Policy contains 31 recommendations under 19 headings and places significant emphasis on supporting families and health care professionals to care for children in their own homes.<\/p><p>The HSE National Standards for Bereavement Care following Pregnancy Loss and Perinatal Death were launched last year.  The Standards provide that clinical and counselling services should be in place to support women and their families in all pregnancy loss situations, from early pregnancy loss to perinatal death, as well as situations where there is a diagnosis of foetal anomaly that may be life limiting or fatal.  Each hospital will be required to have systems in place to ensure that bereavement care and end-of-life care for babies is central to the mission of the hospital and is organised around the needs of babies and their families.  The Standards will be implemented on a phased basis by a dedicated Bereavement Standards Implementation Group in association with the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme.<\/p><p>To support the implementation of the children's palliative care policy, a programme of care for children with life-limiting conditions has been established including the appointment of a Paediatric Consultant with a Special Interest in Palliative Care, based in Crumlin.  As well as supporting other paediatricians, the Consultant also provides clinical support and advice to maternity hospitals and neonatologists.  The programme also included the appointment of 10 Children&rsquo;s Outreach Nurses (CONs) whose role is to ensure that children being cared for at home by their families have access to co-ordinated and supportive services. The nurses liaise closely with statutory and voluntary service providers including local GPs, Public Health Nurses, Disability Services, the Jack and Jill Foundation and LauraLynn etc. A recent independent evaluation of the Children's Palliative Care Programme recommended that the children's outreach nursing service be strengthened, both to meet increased demand and to address geographical inequities in service provision and work has commenced on this. The Irish Hospice Foundation has also agreed to fund a second Consultant post for a one-year period after which the post will be funded by the HSE.<\/p><p>A national programme of structured continuing professional education on caring for children with life-limiting conditions has been developed in partnership with Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin. The programme has been delivered in locations around the country and is available to all health care staff. Integrated websites for parents and health care professionals has been developed through the All Island Institute for Hospice and Palliative Care.<\/p><p>The HSE continues to make progress on other recommendations including the development of the model of care, the development of a model for &lsquo;Hospice at Home&rsquo;, clinical and governance protocols, standards and pathways, and bereavement care. The HSE's Primary Care Division provides homecare packages to facilitate children with complex care needs to be cared for at home.<\/p><p>With regard to adult palliative care services the HSE in partnership with a number of voluntary organisations provides community palliative care (home care) in every county across the country.<\/p><p>For the first five months of this year 91.6% of accepted homecare referrals were seen within seven days. Specialist palliative care inpatient beds (IPU) are provided in 11 locations and 96.4% of accepted referrals were admitted within seven days.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.<\/p><p>The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<\/p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;<\/p><p>- Bed and board;<\/p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and<\/p><p>- Laundry service.<\/p><p>A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.<\/p><p>Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.<\/p><p>Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract. The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and the private or voluntary nursing home.<\/p><p>Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.<\/p><p>I have recently met with both Nursing Homes Ireland and Age Action to discuss this issue in detail.

Pregnancy counselling (other than that provided by doctors, nurses or social workers) will be taken into account in the context of this proposal.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the consultation process, I decided last month to proceed with the designation of two distinct professions under the Act, that of counsellor and psychotherapist.  Each will have its own register under one registration board.  This decision has now been communicated to the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, the relevant professional bodies and all the respondents to the public consultation process.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is now preparing the necessary regulations to designate the professions.  These regulations, when drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, will require the prior approval of this House and that of the Seanad.  These will be the first in a suite of regulations that will need to be made over a period of time.  It is hoped that the draft regulations will be ready for submission to the Oireachtas in the autumn.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to crisis pregnancy counselling, a primary concern of government is the protection of the public when availing of health or social care services.  A crisis pregnancy is perhaps one of the most stressful events in a woman&rsquo;s life and therefore places her in a very vulnerable position.  Positive Options, a crisis pregnancy service which is funded and overseen by the Health Service Executive, provides counselling in 50 locations nationwide and provides women with free, non-judgemental counselling. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware, however, that some other bodies providing counselling may not adhere to the same standards.  There have been media reports of such bodies providing information that is not truthful or objective and this is a cause of concern.  The Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act, 1995  defines the conditions under which information relating to abortion services lawfully available in another state might be made available in Ireland.  That Act provides that where information is provided that would assist a woman in obtaining a termination abroad, that information must be truthful and objective and that a breach of this provision would be an offence. If an individual considers that information provided under the Act is not truthful and objective the matter may be referred to an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is reviewing this legislation to establish if its provisions need to be strengthened and legal advice has been received.  One possibility would be to amend the 1995 Information Act, when counsellors are regulated under the 2005 Act, to prevent professionals who are not regulated by the State from providing crisis pregnancy counselling services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100089#WRDD03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service Staff","counter":1204,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100089#WRDD03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1205,"qnumday":458,"qnumall":"[32698\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100089#WRDD03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the ambulance service in County Kildare has a full complement of staff and no shifts are lost due to staffing issues.","asker":"1309","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1206,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100089#WRDD04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services Provision","counter":1207,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100089#WRDD04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1208,"qnumday":459,"qnumall":"[32702\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100089#WRDD04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of progress towards the roll-out of free general practitioners care for those between the ages of six and 11; if he is still committed to this policy; the position regarding the money allocated for this initiative in budget 2016; the use to which the money allocated for in 2016 and 2017 was put; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1209,"qnumday":460,"qnumall":"[32703\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100089#WRDD04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the cost of providing free GP care to all children between the ages of six and 11; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1210,"qnumday":461,"qnumall":"[32704\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100089#WRDD04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the estimated cost of providing free GP care to all children between 12 and 17 years of age; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1211,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 459 to 461, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government commits to extend in phases, and subject to negotiation with GPs, free GP care to all children under 18 years of age.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.<\/p><p>The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<\/p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;<\/p><p>- Bed and board;<\/p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and<\/p><p>- Laundry service.<\/p><p>A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice.  For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.<\/p><p>Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing.  In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income.  The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).  An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.<\/p><p>Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home.  This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged.  Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.  The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and the private or voluntary nursing home.<\/p><p>Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes.  The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.<\/p><p>I welcome the briefing paper prepared by Age Action which highlights this issue.  I have recently met with both Age Action and Nursing Homes Ireland to discuss this issue in detail.  In order to improve the transparency of these additional charges, I outlined that a schedule of charges should be provided to potential residents on enquiry to an individual nursing home, rather than at the point of admission.  Nursing Homes Ireland undertook to advise their members to do so.  I will also be meeting with both the National Treatment Purchase Fund and HIQA over the coming weeks to discuss this matter further.<\/p><p>I have asked the Interdepartmental\/Agency Working Group established to oversee the implementation of certain recommendations contained in the 2015 Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to also consider this matter and examine the options that might be available, as part of its ongoing work.<\/p><p>I am committed to ensuring that our older population are protected, that they get the care that they deserve, and that they have access to all of the information they need in order to be able to make an informed decision, especially at such a vulnerable stage in their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100094#WRJJ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Delays","counter":1394,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100094#WRJJ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1395,"qnumday":530,"qnumall":"[33000\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100094#WRJJ03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) has not been given a date for surgery and is facing severe waiting times; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1396,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

To fish for mussel seed, Irish-registered sea-fishing boats require an authorisation under section 13 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  Authorisations are only provided to those boats which are directly connected with a bottom grown mussel aquaculture operator who holds a mussel seed &ldquo;allocation&rdquo; for his or her aquaculture site or boats that are contracted to fish on behalf of same.  An allocation restricts the amount (tonnes) of mussel seed that may be relayed onto a given site.  Boats from Northern Ireland require equivalent licenses from DAERA NI to take part in the fishery and must meet corresponding regulatory requirements. <\/p>  <p>  On 27 October 2016, the Supreme Court issued a judgment in a case taken by a number of mussel seed fishermen (Barlow &amp;amp; ors -v- Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine &amp;amp; ors [2016] IESC 62, 27th October 2016).  In the judgment, the Supreme Court found that fishing by Northern Ireland boats within the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State under the Voisinage arrangements is not permitted by law.  The Voisinage Arrangements are long-standing reciprocal arrangements which allow fishing boats from Northern Ireland access to fish within the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State and vice versa.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Supreme Court upheld the High Court finding that the Voisinage Arrangements are not invalid but that, as it stands, there is insufficient provision for them in domestic law.  The Supreme Court in fact noted that the arrangements were a sensible recognition at official level of practice and tradition, where fishing boats traditionally fished neighbouring waters.  <\/p>  <p>  The application of the judgment is to all fishing by Northern Irish fishing boats in the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone relying on the Voisinage Arrangements.  Fishing activities that have a legal basis are not affected, such as those reliant on the access arrangements to Ireland's 6 to 12 nautical mile zone set out in Regulation (EU) No. 1380\/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council.<\/p>  <p>  The Government approved the publication of the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill to address issues raised by the Supreme Court judgment of 27 October 2016, in so far as it relates to access for NI vessels.  If enacted and commenced, the Bill will give the Voisinage Arrangements a proper legal footing.  The Bill was published in February 2017 and is available on the Oireachtas website.  The Bill has been debated in the Seanad and now is at Committee Stage there.  <\/p>  <p>  While the Bill proposes to restore access to Northern Ireland boats to fish, under the terms of the Voisinage Arrangements, boats that make use of this access are subject to the same rules and conditions that apply to Irish sea-fishing boats.  The Bill itself does not apply the specific conditions.  Therefore, other parallel associated measures will be required to ensure that rules and conditions in place for Irish sea-fishing boats are appropriately applied to Northern Ireland boats fishing under the Voisinage Arrangements.  <\/p>  <p>  The process of identifying which conditions may need to be applied is under way.  The conditions will include such restrictions as currently apply to Irish sea-fishing boats.  When the necessary measures have been identified, the most appropriate mechanisms for applying them to Northern Ireland boats will be determined.  The objective will be for these measures to come into effect at the same time as a commencement order for the Bill. <\/p>  <p>  Together, the Bill and the associated measures will re-establish the status quo for fishing access that existed under the Voisinage Arrangements before the Supreme Court's judgment on 27 October 2016.  The only difference will be that the Voisinage Arrangements will be provided for within a legislative framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100096#WRLL00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Control of Horses","counter":1466,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100096#WRLL00900"},{"type":"question","counter":1467,"qnumday":554,"qnumall":"[32235\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100096#WRLL01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the costs incurred by his Department over the past four years relating to the seizure of animals, specifically horses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1468,"content":"<p>The Control of Horses Act 1996 designates powers to local authorities enabling them to control stray and abandoned horses in this country.

The UK Government had been intimating this decision for some time now.  It is nonetheless unwelcome and unhelpful as it suggests a signal of the UK intent to take a hard line on fisheries in the context of Brexit.<\/p><p>There are no immediate direct impacts for the Irish fishing industry from this action as it will not take effect for two years.  Any longer term impacts will only become clear in the overall context of the Brexit negotiations.  It is the message of intent and the potential implications of that intent in the wider 12 to 200 mile zone that causes concern for the negotiations to come. <\/p><p>The Convention deals primarily with the right of a number of countries to fish in each other's 6 to 12 mile fishing zones based on historic fishing activity. Most of these rights were later incorporated into the Common Fisheries Policy.<\/p><p>Under the Convention, the Irish fishing fleet has access to parts of the UK 6-12 mile zone while the UK fleet has similar access to parts of the Irish zone. The Irish fleet is not significantly dependant on this limited access. We do however catch significant quantities of fish in UK waters outside of the 12 mile zone.<\/p><p>As Michel Barnier noted after the UK announcement, the decision to withdraw from the London Fisheries Convention will not trigger any immediate change and he is focused on prioritising the fisheries interests of the EU 27.<\/p><p>  This will not be a piecemeal negotiation with fisheries isolated from the wider negotiations on a post Brexit EU\/UK relationship. There is a long way to go yet and nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed. <\/p><p>  For this Government there are two clear objectives when it comes to fisheries and Brexit &ndash; the maintenance of our existing quota shares and our existing rights of access. These have, and will continue to be, my overriding priority. <\/p><p>In theory, the UK could indeed restrict access to their waters and or seek to gain larger quota shares at the expense of others.  However, that could only happen if the UK were content to ignore the potential repercussions that would certainly arise from the EU side.  <\/p><p>To achieve these objectives, we must have unity of purpose across the Member States directly concerned and across the fishing industry. Disunity will only strengthen those in the UK that seek to exclude all EU fleets.<\/p><p>I spoke with Secretary of State Michael Gove last week and stressed to him the importance of long established fishing patterns by the Irish fishing fleet and the importance of these being acknowledged and protected in the context of Brexit.  I have previously discussed fisheries issues amongst other matters with his predecessor as Secretary of State, Andrea Leadsom, on two separate occasions.  I have also discussed Fisheries, with a particular focus on the London Fishing Convention along with general access issues with Minister George Eustice during a meeting at the Luxembourg Agriculture Council on the 3<sup>rd<\/sup>of April.<\/p><p>I have had 3 separate meetings with Fisheries Commissioner Vella where I have discussed Ireland's concerns regarding Brexit as well as a number of key bilaterals with other Ministers. In addition, my officials are in constant contact with their counterparts in the European Commission and relevant Member States.<\/p><p>As the negotiations develop, unilateral sectoral announcements, like this one on the London Convention, will be dealt with, as this will be, within the Brexit negotiation process and there will be no room, or indeed intent, to address issues in isolation.<\/p><p>My Department and our associated agencies, BIM, the Marine Institute and Bord Bia are currently working closely together on all of the potential impacts of Brexit.  My Department has been preparing for Brexit for over 2 years.  Following the UK referendum in June 2016, I established a dedicated Brexit Co-ordination Unit. This Unit now forms part of a newly formed Brexit and International Trade Division. It comprises four staff working full-time on the co-ordination of Brexit issues, reporting to a full-time Head of Division at Principal Officer level, who in turn reports to an Assistant Secretary General deeply engaged in Brexit issues. Many staff throughout my Department are working on Brexit related issues. My Fisheries Division has four people preparing for the Brexit negotiations and the implications Brexit could have on the Irish seafood industry.  In overall terms, my Department is continuing to monitor the future workforce needs of both the Department and its agencies in relation to Brexit, and will be keeping resource allocations under close review as the negotiations proceed. <\/p><p>It is important to remember that the EU itself will continue, as will the Common Fisheries Policy once the UK has left. The process for reviewing and revising the CFP in preparation for a new Policy will commence around the same time and will be due for completion in 2022.  Ireland will again be a central player in that renegotiation.  <\/p><p>I am firmly of the view that now is not the time to commence our internal consideration of the review of the CFP.  We must concentrate all our efforts on the Brexit negotiations at this time and until Brexit is completed. The discussion on the post Brexit CFP will undoubtedly occur in earnest once the Brexit arrangements are clear.

I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers, including tillage farmers, to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance. I have met with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other access to finance issues relating to the agri-food sector. I have asked the banks to respond positively to the demand that has been demonstrated by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future. Implementation of this Scheme is subject to the provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1408\/2013 (de minimis aid in the agricultural production sector). Support provided under the de minimis regulation complies with State Aid rules in the agriculture sector and does not require prior approval by the EU Commission.<\/p>  <p>  As a further support to tillage farmers I also introduced the Tillage Investment Scheme under TAMS II which opened for online applications on the 8 March 2017. The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers. This Tillage Scheme is the latest of the Targeted Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020. The Scheme is co-funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). All applications must be made on-line, either by the farmer or by an adviser authorised to act on his or her behalf.  The closing date for applications under the first tranche of the new scheme was Friday 30 June 2017.  The second tranche is currently open. There was a significant level of interest in investments under this measure with a total number of 490 applications received in the first tranche. The GLAS scheme has seen a significant uptake, with measures such as green cover, minimum tillage and wild bird cover proving popular with the tillage sector.<\/p>  <p>  As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, up to &euro;1.187billion has been paid out under the Basic Payment Scheme to 124,222 farmers with payments ongoing.

We do, however, expect a proposal from the Commission before the end of the year for a similar multi-annual plan for demersal stocks in North Western Waters which will very much be of direct interest and with which we will be very actively engaged as a key player in those waters.<\/p><p>The general aims of the North Sea plan proposal are to aim to ensure that populations of harvested species are above levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield, move towards long-term multi-species management, the full implementation of the landing obligation and the regionalisation of technical measures. All of these aims are fully in line with the objectives and requirements of the Common Fisheries Policy (Regulation (EU) No 1380\/2013) which Ireland fully supports.<\/p><p>  In particular, Ireland is committed to the objective of achieving the Maximum Sustainable Yield exploitation rate (FMSY) for all stocks by 2020. The 2017 TAC and Quota regulation achieved tangible progress toward this goal of the CFP while also ensuring the economic viability of an industry that supports vital jobs of numerous coastal communities around Ireland. To give an example of the progress made, in the early 2000's, 94% if stocks were overfished while today more than half of the assessed stocks are managed sustainably. Ireland intends to continue to work with all stakeholders, Member States and the Commission to build upon this substantial and tangible progress to achieve the ambitious targets set out in the CFP.<\/p><p>The ongoing implementation of the landing obligation is also a key challenge and priority.  This is a radical change in the operation of our fisheries and one that I believe will bring many long term benefits.  It is, however, complex and there is intensive work ongoing with stakeholders and the Commission to try and ensure that we get it right.  Significant progress has been made to date with the roll out of the landing obligation.  From 2019, all stocks subject to catch limits must be landed and we are working hard with our industry and marine agencies as well as with other Member States on improving gear selectivity and other technical measures that aim to significantly reduce unwanted catches  <\/p><p>With regard to 'best available scientific advice', Ireland receives expert, impartial advice from the Marine Institute on all matters pertaining to the state of our stocks.  The majority of the Marine Institute advice for the TACs and quotas each year is formulated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) to which it is a very active contributor.  The Marine Institute also uses advice from the Commission's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT).  In a minority of cases, the Marine Institute may not agree with some aspects of these advices and may offer alternative advice with a clear rationale.  The Minister presents a Sustainability Impact Assessment on the TACs and quotas proposals each year in advance of the December Fisheries Council. This assessment is informed by the advice of the Marine Institute and a socio economic assessment by BIM and the views of stakeholders following a public consultation.  This work informs Ireland's position on any Commission proposal. <\/p><p>I look forward to engaging closely with the Deputy  and all interested stakeholders, both from industry and wider civic society, on the proposal for a multi annual plan for North Western waters when it is published, to ensure that we  have a plan fit for purpose that enhances the long terms sustainability of the stocks upon which our coastal communities depend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100096#WRLL04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Payments","counter":1495,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100097#WRMM00600"},{"type":"question","counter":1496,"qnumday":570,"qnumall":"[32324\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100097#WRMM00700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of a GLAS payment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1497,"content":"<p>The person named approved into GLAS 1 with a contract commencement date of 1 January 2016.<\/p><p>The person named has requested a reduction in\u00a0the length of\u00a0new hedgerow to be planted as set out in\u00a0his commitments in his original application.

This was\u00a0due to a combination of factors including increased global supply, the effects of the Russian ban on the import of EU agri-food products and reduced global demand, notably for dairy products in China.<\/p>  <p>  During that phase of downward price volatility, the EU Commission,  prompted by Ireland and other Member States,\u00a0responded to these difficulties through the deployment of support measures.  These measures included the extension and broadening of more &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; support measures such as intervention and aids to private storage, as well as more flexible, targeted, direct aid allocated to Member States to spend in accordance with their national circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland welcomed and used many of the options provided in the various packages.  These included the private storage of dairy products, the buying of skimmed milk powder (SMP) into intervention and\u00a0the payment of direct aid of &euro;26.4 million to dairy producers.  The advance payment of annual direct payments to all farmers was also\u00a0a welcome provision of cash flow for farmers at a difficult time.  In addition, a\u00a0Milk Production Reduction Scheme\u00a0allowed almost\u00a0 44,000 farmers across the EU (circa 4,000 from Ireland) to agree voluntarily to reduce their milk production.  These measures, taken as a whole\u00a0represented significant market stabilising efforts.<\/p>  <p>  Global supply and demand dynamics evolved more favourably as 2016 progressed with a\u00a0better \u00a0market environment emerging as a consequence.\u00a0 In spite of these signals of market recovery, the situation remains uncertain in particular product sectors, such as SMP.  The long-term fundamentals of the global dairy market are strong.  However it is necessary to be cognisant of the on-going challenge of price volatility, which will continue to be a feature of international markets.  The CAP's Common Market Organisation Regulation provides for\u00a0the full range of supports deployed in 2015 and early 2016.  Dairy processors also \u00a0have a significant role to play, with instruments such as fixed price and margin contracts a useful addition to the suite of public support measures\u00a0that can be deployed to\u00a0mitigate the impact of price volatility.<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to work with industry, with other member states and with the EU Institutions to consider how we can refine and improve mechanisms to help farmers to cope with downward price cycles when they arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100097#WRMM03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transfer of Entitlements","counter":1527,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100098#WRNN00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1528,"qnumday":581,"qnumall":"[32549\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100098#WRNN00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 581 of 23 May 2017, the progress to date in relation to a transfer (details supplied) in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1529,"content":"<p>As outlined to the Deputy in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 581 in May, this is a complex case involving a number of interested parties.

These examinations can include culturing of the suspect samples.<\/p>  <p>  In practice, it is not always necessary to proceed to the &ldquo;culture&rdquo; stage and, using figures from 2016, a histopathological examination in the laboratory was sufficient to confirm TB in 35% of lesions and the herdowner was informed that his herd remained restricted as required by the Directive.  In 15% of submissions, histopathological evidence was sufficient to determine that the suspect lesion clearly was not a tuberculous granuloma and, in these cases, the restriction was lifted and the herd was de-restricted (9-14 days after receipt of the sample in the laboratory).

Scientific and management assessments of each stock are carried out every year with IFI engaged in an extensive stock monitoring which feeds into the scientific committee's annual reviews.  <\/p><p>Over the last number of years officials from my Department and IFI have met with representatives of the draft net fishermen on a number of occasions to address their concerns.  <\/p><p>The annual Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Regulations, made under the Inland Fisheries Act 2010, provide for the management of Ireland's wild salmon and sea trout fisheries by IFI.  Specifically, the Regulations provide for the quotas of fish (surplus to the conservation limits) that can be harvested either commercially or by rod and line from those rivers identified in the Schedule to the Regulations.  These Regulations are revised each year taking account of advice from IFI, the Standing Scientific Committee and any submissions received during a 30 day statutory public consultation period.  <\/p><p>A copy of the draft regulations is made available on the Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.dccae.gov.ie<\/i>and is open for public inspection at the offices of the Department in Cavan and also at the offices of Inland Fisheries Ireland.\u00a0 Any person may submit observations on the draft regulations at any time during the period of 30 days which normally concludes in early December each year in preparation for the following season.  <\/p><p>Following scientific assessment and management advice taking into consideration any observations received, the surplus, if any, available in each river is established for the forthcoming fishing season so that it may be apportioned between anglers and commercial fishermen as regards rivers and estuaries where a commercial fishery exists.  <\/p><p>As each stock is assessed annually, the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order is enacted each year and sets out, in line with the conservation imperative, the maximum number of public draft net commercial licences that are available to fishermen, for the forthcoming season in each of the specific Fishery Districts where a commercial fishery exists.  <\/p><p>IFI manages salmon stocks diligently on the basis of the established &quot;precautionary principal&quot; and the basis of national management policy is to ensure that all activity, commercial and recreational, is\u00a0sustainable.  Commercial fisheries are only permitted on rivers where a sufficient surplus above that rivers conservation limit,\u00a0has been advised by the SSC and IFI to\u00a0support a sustainable\u00a0fishery.  In the case of estuaries, each of\u00a0the contributing rivers must be above their individual conservation limit\u00a0before a harvestable fishery\u00a0is permitted.  <\/p><p>Prior to the current formation of IFI there was provision in legislation for the appointment of a representative of the draft net commercial fishermen to the Board of each Regional Fisheries Board.  The Regional Boards had between 20 and 22 members. In 2010, all Regional Fisheries Boards and the Central Fisheries Board were abolished and IFI was formed with a Board of just 10 people, including one staff elected representative and the Chief Executive Officer.  The other 8 posts are filled by open competition through the Public Appointments Service in accordance with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Guidelines.  There are no specific constituencies for any of the posts.

The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that to date approximately 1.4m or 61% of the 2.3m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 megabits per second and this footprint is expanding.  <\/p><p>In\u00a0April,\u00a0eir\u00a0signed an\u00a0agreement with me committing them to follow through on\u00a0their commercial plans to provide new high speed broadband infrastructure to 300,000 premises in rural areas.  eir\u00a0has committed to doing this work over\u00a0a 90 week period with an average of 500 premises passed per day.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website at <i><\/i>.  <\/p><p>The focus of the agreement is the delivery by eir of its commitment to rollout a fibre high speed broadband network to over 300,000 premises.  The agreement includes\u00a0quarterly milestones to be achieved by eir, which are subject to formal evaluation by my Department.  My Department has concluded that eir met the milestone to pass 40,000 premises by the end of April of this year and initial indications are that eir has also met its Quarter 2 target.  A formal evaluation of eir's\u00a0Quarter 2 performance will be conducted by my Department shortly.  <\/p><p>The procurement process that is being managed by my Department to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State intervention area is progressing independently of the Commitment Agreement.  There is no provision in the agreement that would preclude rollout of a State subsidised network in the NBP intervention area being carried out in parallel with the eir rollout.  <\/p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.

This commitment to intervene will ensure that no part of Ireland, no household, no school, no business is left behind.  <\/p><p>This unequivocal commitment by Government to deliver the NBP has also served as a catalyst for industry in bringing forward investment in new infrastructure in towns, villages and rural areas of Ireland.  As of today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  This footprint is continuing to expand and it is expected to rise to 77% by the end of 2018.  For those areas that will not be covered by commercial operators the State has committed to intervene and subsidise a network build.  <\/p><p>In\u00a0April,\u00a0eir\u00a0signed a\u00a0agreement with me committing them to follow through on\u00a0their commercial plans to provide new high speed broadband infrastructure to 300,000 premises in rural areas.  eir\u00a0has committed to doing this work over\u00a0a 90 week period with an average of 500 premises passed per day.\u00a0\u00a0A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website .  The decision by eir to invest in infrastructure to deploy high speed broadband services to an additional 300,000 premises in rural Ireland was taken\u00a0by eir\u00a0on commercial grounds.  Neither I, nor my Department, have a statutory authority to direct eir in this regard.  <\/p><p>Quarterly updates on progress of the eir 300k rollout will be published on my Departments website.  The Q1 figures have been verified by my Department and the eir rollout\u00a0is in line with the Commitment Agreement.  <\/p><p>In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>.  This map finalises the\u00a0State Intervention Area for the procurement process and is an important milestone in the procurement process.  The Map\u00a0shows the extent of \u00a0the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services.  The Map, which is searchable by address or eircode, has been developed by my Department using\u00a0extensive information obtained from commercial operators and\u00a0will be updated to show quarterly progress of the eir rollout.  <\/p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have\u00a0indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,<\/p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require\u00a0State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process.<\/p><p>There are approximately 2.3m premises in Ireland, of which approximately 542,000 (23%) premises are located in the\u00a0Intervention area on the Map.  These premises will require State intervention and are the focus for the procurement process.  The remaining premises are located in the BLUE areas and will be\u00a0served by commercial operators.  Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE\u00a0or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at www.broadband.gov.ie.  The position in relation to the areas referred to by the Deputies is set out below.  <\/p><p>The map shows that 100% of the townland of Derryad, Co Longford \u00a0will be part of the State led Intervention under the NBP.  <\/p><p>There are c. 42,000 premises in County Cavan, of which c17,000 are located in the Amber area on the Map, and will benefit from the NBP&rsquo;s State Intervention.  The remaining c25,000 premises are located in the commercial BLUE area and\u00a0will be served by commercial operators.  This figure includes c7,000 premises that fall within eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and\u00a0end\u00a02018 (Light BLUE on map).  <\/p><p>There are\u00a0 c.33,000 premises In Co Monaghan, of which c16,000 premises will benefit from the NBP&rsquo;s State Intervention.  The remaining c17,000 premises are located in the commercial BLUE area and will be served by commercial operators.  This figure includes c 4,000 premises that fall within eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and\u00a0end\u00a02018 (Light BLUE on map).  <\/p><p>In relation to Co Kerry there are c89,000 premises of which c29,000 premises will benefit from the NBP's State Intervention.  The remaining c60,000 premises are located in the commercial BLUE area and will be served by commercial operators.  This figure includes c24,000 premises that fall within eir's plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and end of 2018 (Light BLUE on map).  <\/p><p>There are \u00a0c133,000 premises in Co Galway of which\u00a0c27,000 fall within eir's plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and the end of 2018 (Light BLUE on map).  <\/p><p>In the case of Co Mayo there are c83,000 premises of which c16,000 premises fall within eir's plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and the end of 2018 (Light BLUE on map).  <\/p><p>A\u00a0full set of county statistics are available at<i><\/i><i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>.  <\/p><p>Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at\u00a0<i><\/i>.<\/p><p>The procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State Intervention area is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.  <\/p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  <\/p><p>The rate of demand for data services has increased\u00a0exponentially in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for\u00a0telecommunication operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force\u00a0to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State Intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is available on both Departments' websites.<\/p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.  <\/p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I established an Implementation Group\u00a0to drive and monitor the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.  I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13th June 2017, which is available on my Department's website at <i><\/i>and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017.  <\/p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.  <\/p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in\u00a0lots\u00a0covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.  <\/p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.  <\/p><p>This comprehensive package of initiatives which I\u00a0have developed and continue to manage\u00a0will assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100100#WRPP02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fisheries Protection","counter":1626,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100100#WRPP02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1627,"qnumday":616,"qnumall":"[32391\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100100#WRPP02300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the conservation limits for each wild Atlantic salmon for each river in the south east river basin, as of January 2017; the rivers which have an identifiable surplus of wild Atlantic salmon over the conservation limit; the rivers which are not meeting the conservation limit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1628,"qnumday":617,"qnumall":"[32392\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100100#WRPP02400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the rivers in the south east river basin which are open for salmon and sea trout fishing by means of draft and snap net harvesting as of January 2017; the rivers in the south east river basin which are open for salmon fishing by means of angling harvest; the rivers in the south east river basin which are open for salmon fishing by means of angling, catch and release; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1629,"qnumday":620,"qnumall":"[32396\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100100#WRPP02500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the methodology employed to measure the conservation limits for wild Atlantic salmon on each river in the south east river basin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1630,"qnumday":621,"qnumall":"[32397\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100100#WRPP02600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the types of fish counters for wild Atlantic salmon on each river in the south east river basin; the accuracy of each fish counter; the locations in which fish counters are present; if they are fully operational; the way in which salmon are counted on rivers that may have no operational fish counter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1631,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 616, 617, 620 and 621 together.  <\/p>  <p>  Following the advice of the Standing Scientific Committee for Salmon and the recommendation of management in IFI, the rivers in the South East can be divided into three distinct categories. <\/p>  <p>  The first category is rivers that are open with a surplus of salmon that can be harvested.  There are no salmon Rivers in the Wexford or Waterford Fishery Districts that fall into this category.  In the Lismore District the Blackwater, Glenshelane and Finisk are the only open rivers with a quota for harvest.  The Blackwater is the only river with a commercial quota which is shared with the rod and line quota the full surplus that is available is 5,670 salmon.  There was a 5% reserve established which was not allocated. Of the remainder 29%, or\u00a01,562, was allocated to the commercial sector and 71%, or 3,824, to the rod and line. (Angling sector).  <\/p>  <p>  The second category is rivers that are open on a catch and release basis where no harvest of fish is permitted.  There are no such rivers in the Wexford Fishery District. In the Waterford District there is the Barrow, Nore, Suir and Pollmounty.  There is the River Bride in the Lismore District.  As a consequence of these rivers being catch and release no commercial quota exists.  <\/p>  <p>  The third category is rivers that have poor salmon runs and are closed to salmon fishing.  These are, in the Wexford District, the Avoca, the Owenavorragh and the Slaney, in the Waterford District, the Owenduff, the Mahon; the Tay, the Colligan and the Corrack and in the Lismore District the Lickey, the Tourig and the Womanagh.  <\/p>  <p>  The conservation limit can be defined as the spawning stock level that produces long term average maximum sustainable yield as derived from the adult to adult stock and recruitment relationship.  This is generally termed a biological reference point and establishes the specific abundance of fish required to maintain a healthy and sustainable salmon population in a particular river system.  The conservation limit is calculated similarly for all of Ireland's 147 salmon rivers and estuaries based on the wetted area, latitude and other river-specific factors such as the relative proportion of one sea winter grilse salmon (1SW) and multi-sea winter (MSW) salmon in the population, the average weight of these salmon, proportions of male and female salmon and average numbers of eggs per female fish.  Comprehensive and extensive step-by-step information on how conservation limits are calculated are contained in the annual Standing Scientific Committee on Salmon (SSCS) report which is attached.  <\/p>  <p>  IFI&rsquo;s fish counter programme operates forty one counters at thirty six counting sites throughout the country.  Two types of counters are used to record fish numbers, Vaki counters and Logie counters.  All Logie counter sites incorporate video verification in addition to the standard counter device. <\/p>  <p>  In the South East River Basin District, there is one counter operating on the River Slaney.  The counter on the Slaney is a Logie fish counter which is a tube fish pass configuration with video recording for verification.  The location of the counter at Clohamon weir is approximately 30 miles from where the Slaney enters the sea through Wexford Harbour.  The counter provides only a partial count of fish passing up the river as fish can traverse the weir in flood conditions.  <\/p>  <p>  The counter is both efficient and accurate in terms of the fish that actually move upstream or downstream through the tube, but a significant proportion of the run by-passes the counter at other points on the weir.  To enable an accurate estimate of the number of fish that pass up the river a scientific method of tagging fish and assessing the proportion of these fish that are detected through the counter was undertaken.  This enabled IFI to estimate the percentage of fish that (a) travel over the weir and (b) go through the counter and enables the scientists gauge the fish run in the river.  <\/p>  <p>  The in-stream structure housing the counter was severely damaged in flooding in January 2016 and IFI assessed all options for relocating the counter.  However, an alternative site would require planning so in the interim the existing tube counter was repaired in November 2016 to ensure no further data was lost.  The counter has been operational since.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100100#WRPP02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1314"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inland Fisheries Ireland Investigations","counter":1632,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100100#WRPP02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1633,"qnumday":618,"qnumall":"[32393\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100100#WRPP03000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of times since January 2017 Inland Fisheries Ireland has inspected a privately operated tailrace at Clohamon on the river Slaney; the number of salmon removed from this tailrace during these inspections; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1634,"content":"<p>Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) staff inspects the area in question on a regular basis as part of fishery protection patrols on the River Slaney.

The award of 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band will provide stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in\u00a0lots\u00a0covering 9 urban and rural regions across Ireland.<\/p><p>Commercial investment by mobile operators has resulted in improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction in 2012. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  However, as mobile services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets and the capacity of the network, as well as by and proximity to mobile telephone antennas.<\/p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.<\/p><p>With regard to broadband services, the\u00a0Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) will provide high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that to date approximately 1.4 million or 61% of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second and this footprint is expanding.<\/p><p>In\u00a0April,\u00a0eir\u00a0signed an\u00a0agreement with me committing them to follow through on\u00a0their commercial plans to provide new high speed broadband infrastructure to 300,000 premises in rural areas.  eir\u00a0has committed to doing this work over\u00a0a 90 week period with an average of 500 premises passed per day.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website <i>www.dccae.gov.ie<\/i>.  The decision by eir to invest in infrastructure to deploy high speed broadband services to an additional 300,000 premises in rural Ireland was taken\u00a0by eir\u00a0on commercial grounds. Neither I nor the Department have a statutory authority to direct eir in this regard.<\/p><p>Quarterly updates on progress of the eir 300,000 roll-out will be published on the Departments website.  The Q1 figures have been verified by my Department and the eir roll-out\u00a0is in line with the Commitment Agreement.<\/p><p>In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>.  This map finalises the\u00a0State Intervention Area for the procurement process and is an important milestone in the procurement process.  The Map\u00a0shows the extent of \u00a0the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services.<\/p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have\u00a0indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,<\/p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require\u00a0State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process.<\/p><p>There are 126 premises in the townland of Dunloe Upper, of which 28 premises will benefit from the NBP's State Intervention.  The remaining 98 premises are located in the commercial BLUE area and will be served by commercial operators.  This figure includes 68 premises that fall within eir's plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and end 2018 (Light BLUE on map).  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE\u00a0or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100101#WRQQ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Management Regulations","counter":1651,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100101#WRQQ00900"},{"type":"question","counter":1652,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[32627\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100101#WRQQ01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will provide a list of waste management services providers by county, in tabular form; if each service provider provides a brown bin service to all customers; and if not, the date by which this service will be in place.","asker":"1239","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1653,"qnumday":635,"qnumall":"[32633\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100101#WRQQ01100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the counties that have implemented in full Part II of the European Union (Household Food Waste and Bio-Waste) Regulations 2015, in tabular form.","asker":"1239","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1654,"qnumday":636,"qnumall":"[32634\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100101#WRQQ01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if all households situated in population agglomerations of 1,500 persons are provided with a separate collection service for food waste from households; and if this collection takes place at least as often as the residual waste collection service as required by the European Union (Household Food Waste and Bio-Waste) Regulations 2015.","asker":"1239","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1655,"qnumday":637,"qnumall":"[32635\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100101#WRQQ01300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the local authority areas that have an authorised facility for the purposes of the authorised treatment process for household food waste as required by the European Union (Household Food Waste and Bio-Waste) Regulations 2015, in tabular form.","asker":"1239","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1656,"qnumday":638,"qnumall":"[32636\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100101#WRQQ01400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if food waste arising on producers' premised source is segregated and kept separate from non-biodegradable materials, other waste and contaminants and collected by an authorised waste collector in all local authority areas as required by the European Union (Household Food Waste and Bio-Waste) Regulations 2015; and if not, the local authority areas in which this requirement is not in place.","asker":"1239","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1657,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 629 and 635 to 638, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>In line with the objectives of the national waste policy,\u00a0<i>A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland<\/i>, in terms of maximising the resource potential and minimising the disposal of our waste, the European Union (Household Food Waste and Bio-waste) Regulations 2015 are designed to promote the segregation and recovery of household food waste.

It makes absolute sense that we protect those resources through effective, proportionate and consistent systems of compliance and regulatory enforcement.  Effective enforcement of waste legislation is vital for the credibility of our systems of waste management.<\/p><p>My role, as Minister, is to provide the legislative and policy framework under which both local authority and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforcement action against illegal waste activity is initiated.  Notwithstanding this fact, I have made &euro;9.9 million available from the Environment Fund this year to support:<\/p><p>- The recruitment and continued employment of a network of local authority waste enforcement officers under the Local Authority Enforcement Measures Scheme (&euro;7.4 million);<\/p><p>- The work of the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) (&euro;1 million);<\/p><p>- An anti-dumping initiative to support local authorities in targeting high risk or problem areas, developing appropriate enforcement responses and carrying out clean-up operations (&euro;1.3 million);<\/p><p>- Individual Local Authority waste enforcement actions against suspected large scale illegal waste operators (&euro;200,000).<\/p><p>This investment is critical in tackling issues such as illegal dumping in local communities and in providing an enhanced response on the ground to other infractions of the waste code.  In that regard, my Department has continued to fund waste enforcement staff under the Local Authority Enforcement Measures Scheme and details of the grant allocated to each Local Authority under this scheme is detailed in the following table. <table><tr><th>Local Authority<\/th><th>Allocation &euro;<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Local Authority Enforcement Measures Scheme<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council<\/td><td>165,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan County Council<\/td><td>278,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare County Council<\/td><td>403,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City Council<\/td><td>180,700<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork County Council<\/td><td>455,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council<\/td><td>982,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal County Council<\/td><td>202,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council<\/td><td>480,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council<\/td><td>220,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway County Council<\/td><td>72,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway City Council<\/td><td>50,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council<\/td><td>68,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council<\/td><td>121,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council<\/td><td>153,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois County Council<\/td><td>164,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim County Council<\/td><td>74,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council<\/td><td>377,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford County Council<\/td><td>200,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth County Council<\/td><td>130,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council<\/td><td>156,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath County Council<\/td><td>259,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council<\/td><td>219,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council<\/td><td>295,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon County Council<\/td><td>136,373<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council<\/td><td>176,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council<\/td><td>130,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary County Council<\/td><td>211,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford County Council<\/td><td>303,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath County Council<\/td><td>175,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford County Council<\/td><td>236,885<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow County Council<\/td><td>360,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Enforcement Grant:<\/td><td>7,431,958<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>In addition to this scheme, my Department provides funding of &euro;1 million to support the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) which were established in 2015 on foot of a review of the respective regulatory and enforcement roles of the EPA and local authorities.  The review recommended the establishment of three regional lead authorities\u00a0 to drive improved performance, increased coordination and greater consistency in waste enforcement.  Cork County Council, Dublin City Council and Leitrim &amp;amp; Donegal County Councils (in a combined bid) were selected as the new Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities for the Southern, Eastern and Midlands, and Connacht \/Ulster Regions respectively.<\/p><p>In recognition of the impact of illegal dumping on communities across the country, in March of this year, I launched the 2017 Anti-Dumping Initiative.  The aim of this initiative is to provide funding for projects tackling illegal dumping including the provision of support for the clean-up, monitoring and surveillance of dumping blackspots.  Funding is contingent on enforcement actions being taken by local authorities with respect to each site identified and on foot of the very positive response to this initiative the scheme has been extended with total funding of &euro;1.3 million now being allocated.<\/p><p>Further funds have also been made available to assist local authorities in pursuing specific large scale and significant waste enforcement actions.  This has resulted in the detection and cessation of significant illegal waste activity with important prosecutions being taken through the Courts.  Approximately &euro;200,000 has been allocated to support local authorities in this regard to date in 2017 and the provision of further financial assistance will continue to be considered on a case by case basis as the need arises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100101#WRQQ02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1669,"content":"<p>Question No. 634 answered with Question No. 631.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1670,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 635 to 638, inclusive, answered with Question No. 629.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Advertising Expenditure","counter":1671,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100101#WRQQ03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1672,"qnumday":639,"qnumall":"[32647\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100101#WRQQ03400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the level of expenditure by his Department or organisations under the aegis of his Department for each of the past five years on photography, advertising, communications advice, public relations, website development, media interview training and preparation; the events, campaigns or policies to which this expenditure related; the company or person to which such payments were made, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1673,"content":"<p>My Departmental remit includes complex policy areas, oversight of State regulation and service provision across key strategic services such as energy and public service broadcasting, and regulation of sectors such as mining and hydrocarbon exploration.

2017.<\/p>  <p>  The Paris Agreement, which entered into force in November 2016, aims to limit global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with an ambition of 1.5 degrees Celsius.  The Agreement is designed to meet this objective through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by all parties to the agreement.  In this regard, the European Union submitted an NDC committing to a reduction of at least 40% in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, which will be met through reductions of 43% in the Emission Trading System (ETS) and 30% in the non-ETS sector compared with 2005 levels. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will contribute to the Paris Agreement via the NDC tabled by the EU on behalf of its Member States.  The specific details of Ireland's contribution to the overall 30% reduction in the non-ETS sector, as well as the contributions to be made by other Member States, is currently being negotiated between the EU and its Member States in the context of the European Commission's Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) Proposal which was published in July 2016.  Targets have been proposed for Member States based on GDP per capita and the cost-effectiveness of domestic emissions reductions within individual Member States, with the starting point based on average emissions over the period 2016 to 2018.  In the case of Ireland a target of 39% has been proposed, which has been adjusted downwards to 30% to reflect the cost-effectiveness of measures within the Irish economy.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission proposal recognises different Member States' circumstances and the need to provide flexibility to reduce emissions as cost-effectively as possible in the context of the overall EU target.  Ireland has been actively engaged in negotiations in the Council of Ministers, and is working to ensure that these core principles are maintained in the final outcome to the negotiations.  At the Environment Council meeting of Monday 19 June, my EU counterparts and I reviewed progress to date and emphasised the need to prioritise a successful conclusion to these negotiations which retains a high environmental ambition for the EU, but provides each Member State the capacity to contribute to that ambition in a cost-effective and fair manner.<\/p>  <p>  The incoming Estonian Presidency has indicated a desire to reach agreement\u00a0in the Council, allowing negotiations with the European Parliament to commence during its term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100101#WRQQ03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Disposal Charges","counter":1678,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100102#WRRR00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1679,"qnumday":641,"qnumall":"[32671\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100102#WRRR00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the charging mechanism waste collectors are allowed to charge households; if waste collectors can now impose pay by weight schemes on persons who have not been paying in this manner up to now; if waste collectors can only introduce such a scheme for these customers from September 2017; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that persons who have not paid by weight up to now are being charged in such a manner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1680,"content":"<p>The charges applied by waste management companies are matters for those companies and their customers, subject to compliance with all applicable environmental and other relevant legislation, including contract and consumer legislation.<\/p>  <p>  In the interest of encouraging further waste prevention, the Government has decided that flat-rate fees for kerbside household waste collection will be phased out over the period autumn 2017 to autumn 2018 as customers contracts come up for renewal, when the necessary regulatory steps are in place. <\/p>  <p>  As has been long-standing practice, a collection service provider\u00a0may amend a pricing structure or a contract at any time, as long as the amendments are in accordance with all relevant legislation, including contract and consumer legislation.

EirGrid has been successful in accessing significant financial support for major strategic projects from EU sources and will continue to explore such options.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the North South Interconnector Project,\u00a0EirGrid successfully applied to the European Commission for grant aid to support the planning process.  The grants were received under the Trans-European Networks for Energy (TEN-E) scheme.  They were provided to part fund the initial feasibility studies and studies required to support the application for planning consent.<\/p>  <p>  ESB, in their role as Transmission Asset Owner in Ireland, must fund the construction of the section of the Interconnector located in Ireland.

As well as being supported by a range of technical, economic and environmental inputs, the National Mitigation Plan has also been informed by the submissions received during a public consultation\u00a0that took place in\u00a0March and April 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I invited the Climate Change\u00a0Advisory Council, following my publication of the draft National Mitigation Plan, to engage directly with me and with other relevant Government Ministers with a view to providing its recommendations to feed into the preparation of the final Plan.  All input received from the Advisory Council has being considered in finalising the National Mitigation Plan.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm that the Government has, at its meeting on 27 June 2017,\u00a0approved the National Mitigation Plan for publication.  I am looking forward\u00a0to publishing the Plan and formally laying it before each House of the Oireachtas very shortly.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to setting out the full range of measures that the Government has already implemented, or is considering, to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions, the Plan will include over 100 individual actions to be implemented across Government in order to advance the national transition agenda.  These actions are the individual building blocks that will enable the Government and wider society to implement deeper reductions in emissions in the years ahead.  This will be an ongoing process aimed at incremental and permanent decarbonisation.<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 Act provides that relevant Ministers deliver an Annual Transition Statement to each House.  The first such Statement was delivered last December and I intend that the 2017 Statement be delivered shortly following the presentation of Budget 2018.  I also intend that the Annual Transition Statement will incorporate an annual progress report on the implementation of the National Mitigation Plan.

Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is available on my\u00a0Department's websites.<\/p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.<\/p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I established an Implementation Group\u00a0to drive and monitor the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.\u00a0 I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13 June 2017, which is available on my Department's website at <i>www.dccae.gov.ie\/documents\/Taskforce%20Q1%20Progress%20Report.pdf\u00a0<\/i>and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017. <\/p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas. The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty. Spectrum was also awarded in\u00a0lots\u00a0covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.<\/p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.<\/p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100103#WRSS00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1717,"qnumday":657,"qnumall":"[33051\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100103#WRSS00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when a person (details supplied) can expect to receive a broadband upgrade in view of the fact that the quality of service and the current connections speeds are not fit for purpose; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1718,"qnumday":658,"qnumall":"[33052\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100103#WRSS00700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when a person (details supplied) can expect to receive a broadband upgrade, in view of the fact that the quality of service and the current connections speeds are not fit for purpose; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1719,"qnumday":659,"qnumall":"[33053\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100103#WRSS00800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when a person (details supplied) can expect to receive a broadband upgrade in view of the fact that the quality of service and the current connections speeds are not fit for purpose; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1720,"qnumday":660,"qnumall":"[33054\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100103#WRSS00900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when persons (details supplied) can expect to receive a broadband upgrade, in view of the fact that the quality of service and the current connections speeds are not fit for purpose; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1721,"qnumday":661,"qnumall":"[33055\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100103#WRSS01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when persons (details supplied) can expect to receive a broadband upgrade, in view of the fact that the quality of service and the current connections speeds are not fit for purpose; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1722,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[33056\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100103#WRSS01100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when persons (details supplied) can expect to receive a broadband upgrade, in view of the fact that the quality of service and the current connections speeds are not fit for purpose; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1723,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 657 to 662, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to deliver high speed broadband services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland.

The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.<\/p><p>The rate of demand for data services has increased\u00a0exponentially in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for\u00a0telecommunication operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force. In July 2016,  I established the Task Force\u00a0to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is available on my Department's website.<\/p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.<\/p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I established an Implementation Group\u00a0to drive and monitor the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.\u00a0 I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13 June 2017, which is available on my Department's website at<i>www.dccae.gov.ie\/documents\/Taskforce%20Q1%20Progress%20Report.pdf<\/i>and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017. <\/p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in\u00a0lots\u00a0covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.<\/p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.<\/p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100103#WRSS01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Transfrontier Shipments Office","counter":1724,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100103#WRSS01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1725,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[33072\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100103#WRSS01900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position regarding the National Trans Frontier Shipments Office investigation regarding a shipment that was part returned to a port of origin here from Holland in 2017 (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1726,"content":"<p>On foot of the repatriation of a number of containers from Rotterdam,\u00a0the National Transfrontier Shipments Office (NTFSO) instructed the waste broker who organised these exports to arrange for each shipping container to be returned to the waste facility from where it originated and has carried out inspections of these facilities.

The combined efforts of Government, the tourism agencies and the industry are proving very successful and it is very satisfying to see the growth in tourist numbers, revenue and jobs that have come about over the last few years as a result.<\/p>  <p>  Whilst I\u00a0was\u00a0disappointed to hear of the views\u00a0referred to by the Deputy, the fact is that the vast majority of visitors to this country do not share those views.  The very positive results of F&aacute;ilte Ireland's Overseas Holidaymakers' Attitudes Survey 2016 affirm this.\u00a0 According to this broad survey of holidaymakers, overall satisfaction ratings are very positive.\u00a0 Almost two-thirds of respondents felt their expectations of an Irish holiday had been met, whereas a further one-third stated that their Irish holiday had exceeded their expectations.\u00a0 With specific regard to our value for money ratings, just short of two-thirds of overseas visitors surveyed said they had found 'good' or 'very good' value here.   <\/p>  <p>  Assisted by a range of Government measures to enhance tourism competitiveness, such as the lower VAT rate and the zero-rating of the Air Travel Tax, combined with strong annual Exchequer investment in the sector through the tourism agencies, we have worked hard to regain our reputation internationally as a good quality, good value holiday destination.\u00a0\u00a0Key public investments, like the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and Dublin &ndash; A Breath of Fresh Air, are also assisting competitiveness by providing a better tourism experience for visitors.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the remarks certainly reinforce the importance of safeguarding this reputation and the critical need to maintain our competitiveness and value for money.  I am concerned that rising accommodation prices - in Dublin or elsewhere - risk damaging the gains we have made in recent years to the long-term detriment of our tourist industry and the overall economy.\u00a0 This is exacerbated by recent currency movements, particularly Sterling versus the Euro, that further threaten our competitiveness in key markets.\u00a0 I would, therefore, urge the industry not to be complacent and to keep\u00a0a sharp focus on pricing, value for money and overall competitiveness.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that Tourism Ireland, in devising its marketing campaigns, are conscious that\u00a0competitiveness and the value for money message are more important than ever this year, particularly in Britian.  It is also undertaking an expanded partnership programme with airlines, ferry operators and tour operators, communicating a strong price-led message to drive home value for money.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Having restored Ireland's competitiveness and regained trust internationally as a good value destination, the challenge now is to continue to offer quality, good value, memorable hospitality to our tourists.

It is currently estimated that when the scheme is initially introduced approximately 16,000 children aged between 6 months and 3 years of age will benefit from targeted subsidies within the ACS.<\/p>  <p>  Of the total number of children who benefit from targeted subsidies within the ACS, it is estimated that approximately 21% will benefit from the maximum subsidy rates available within the scheme, which will be awarded to families with net incomes below &euro;22,700 per annum.  The maximum subsidy rates will vary by the age of the child, and will range from &euro;5.11 per hour for children less than 1 year old to &euro;3.76 per hour for school-age children.  The maximum subsidy available for any child under the scheme will be &euro;5.11 per hour.

Raising the level of the universal subsidy would therefore not create any incentive for a parent to switch from receiving a targeted subsidy to receiving a universal subsidy.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing the universal subsidy-rate (as well as the resulting increase in targeted subsidy-rates described above) would, however, lead to a likely increase in the demand for childcare, because it would reduce the net fees paid by parents.

This is an extremely complex and ambitious project because of all that is involved &ndash; legislation, new business processes, data protection and building a new ICT system.  It requires integration of data from the Department of Social Protection and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners so that the ICTsystem can calculate every family&rsquo;s net income and ACS subsidy.  We are all keen to see the new system introduced as soon as possible, but the sheer complexity of the project means that it will take some time.  I do not want to introduce the new scheme before all elements &ndash; legislation, ICT and business systems &ndash; are fully in place and rigourously tested.<\/p>  <p>  However, I do not want to delay the benefit of higher childcare subsidies for families.  For that reason, major improvements in childcare subsidies will come into effect this September, within the framework of the existing childcare schemes and utilising the additional funding secured in Budget 2017 to honour the Government&rsquo;s commitment to deliver more affordable childcare to families.<\/p>  <p>  The improvements this September will include increases of up to 50% in targeted childcare subsidy rates, improving access for parents in lower income families by significantly reducing the co-payment required.  In addition, the new universal childcare subsidy for children aged from six months up to entry to the ECCE Programme will be available from September, in line with the announcement I made following the Government&rsquo;s Budget decision in October 2016.  This non-means tested subsidy is available to tens of thousands of children and is worth as much as &euro;1,040 per year towards the cost of childcare for the families of children of this age cohort. <\/p>  <p>  The level of universal subsidy available this September is the same as that proposed for the ACS subsidy, i.e. a maximum subsidy of &euro;20 per week for full-time childcare, with the subsidy for part-time childcare reduced pro rata.  The levels of targeted subsidy available this September, while not identical to the subsidy-rates that are proposed for the ACS, will be broadly similar to those rates, with some families receiving slightly more and some slightly less than they will receive when the ACS is introduced.  These differences are inevitable given the structure of the existing childcare schemes, which involve only a limited number of subsidy-bands, whereas the ACS will allow a smooth taper to be applied to subsidy-rates.  <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the new measures commencing this September will honour the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering more affordable childcare to families. The majority of the &euro;19 million additional funding provided in Budget 2017 is being directed towards these changes and will deliver significant reductions in childcare bills for tens of thousands of families.  A portion of this funding was allocated to the development of the ACS and continues to be used for this purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100106#WRVV01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Childcare Subvention Programme","counter":1853,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100106#WRVV01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1854,"qnumday":706,"qnumall":"[32200\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100106#WRVV01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of families that are expected to avail of each band of subsidy under the affordable child care measures that is being introduced in September 2017.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1855,"content":"<p>Given the considerable increase in subsidies, particularly through the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCS) taking effect from September 2017, it is difficult to provide accurate estimates around uptake of the schemes.<\/p><p>However, looking at 16\/17 figures may provide a broad indication of likely levels of uptake for the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme.

The service is delivered by two companies, Seetec and Turas Nua.<\/p><p>The JobPath service commenced operations in mid-2015 with and reached full State-wide delivery of service in July 2016 with 105,000 Jobseekers having commenced with the service by the end of June 2017.  Of these, some 71,000 had started their engagement with the JobPath service by the end of 2016 with a further 34,000 customers having started their engagement with the service in the first 6 months of 2017.<\/p><p>Of the 105,000 customers who started with the JobPath service since its inception in July 2015, approximately 22,000 cases of customer non-engagement have arisen. Failure of a jobseeker to engage, without good cause, with the Department&rsquo;s employment services can have consequences for the jobseeker&rsquo;s payments.  However it is important to note that the rules and processes for the application of a reduced rate of payment are the same across all of the Department&rsquo;s employment services whether they are delivered directly by the Department&rsquo;s own Intreo service or through its contracted services. <\/p><p>The process with regards to such decisions includes written\/verbal warnings and an opportunity for the jobseeker to re-engage with the services prior to the application of a reduced payment rate. Where it is decided that a penalty rate is to be applied such a decision can only be made by departmental official (not contractor&rsquo;s staff).<\/p><p>The majority of the 22,000 customers referenced above will have subsequently re-engaged with the service and after the completion of the processes outlined, reduced payment rate has only been applied in approximately 5,000 cases.<\/p><p>In relation to the number of participants to find full time employment, it is important to note that jobseekers may be supported through the service for up to 30 months - under the service jobseekers have access to a personal adviser (PA) who works with them over two phases.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to the two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months.<\/p><p>It will therefore take time to accumulate a sufficient number of clients (who have completed their engagement period with the service) for complete and robust outcome data to be available.  With this in mind, it is intended that an econometric evaluation of the service will commence at the end of 2017.  The Department has however commenced publishing cohort reports on the performance of the service, with the most recent report, which provides details of the performance outcomes for two jobseeker cohorts - Q3 and Q4 2015, having been published on the Department&rsquo;s website in May 2017.  The report is available at: <i>www.welfare.ie\/en\/Pages\/JobPath.aspx<\/i>.  The next cohort performance report will be published on the departments web site later this month.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100107#WRWW02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Benefit Data","counter":1908,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100107#WRWW02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1909,"qnumday":724,"qnumall":"[32064\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100107#WRWW02800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons waiting for payment of maternity benefit, by county and region, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1910,"content":"<p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Maternity benefit is a payment for employed and self-employed pregnant women who satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions on their own insurance record.<\/font>The benefit is payable for 26 weeks at a rate of &euro;235 per week with possible increases for adult and child dependents.<\/p><p>An online claim facility provides customers with a convenient and effective method of submitting a maternity benefit claim and will facilitate the speedy determination of entitlement. <\/p><p>Processing of maternity benefit claims is up to date and there are no claims awaiting payment where the mother has commenced her maternity leave.

In addition, it may be more advantageous for people who have an underlying entitlement to a reduced weekly rate of State pension (contributory) to apply for the State pension (non-contributory) as the weekly rate of the latter pension may be higher. <\/p><p>The State pension (non-contributory payment) is a means tested payment and the weekly rate payable is dependent on the means of each claimant.

There is no exhaustive list of all expenses allowed in self-employed cases, since expenses vary with the nature and extent of the self-employment. <\/p><p>However, the following are the main allowable expenses in most instances, as set out in the means guidelines available on the Departmental website, <i>www.welfare.ie\/en\/Pages\/Means-Assessment.aspx<\/i>:<\/p><p>-  Materials (supplies costs) <\/p><p>-  Motor running costs (portion applicable to business)<\/p><p>-  Depreciation of machinery or equipment<\/p><p>-  Insurance relating to the business<\/p><p>-  Telephone (portion applicable to business)<\/p><p>-  Lighting and Heating (for business and not domestic use) <\/p><p>-  Advertising<\/p><p>-  Bank Charges<\/p><p>-  Stationery<\/p><p>-  Labour Costs<\/p><p>-  Any other costs associated with running the business. <\/p><p>These arrangements apply to all self-employed claimants for the State pension (non-contributory) as well as other means tested welfare schemes. The rules applying to the State pension (non-contributory) do not prohibit individuals engaging in any form of self-employment; it is the means available from the net profit from such self-employment (after allowing expenses) which determines the rate of pension payable, if any. <\/p><p>It should also be noted that the first &euro;30 per week means (from any source including self-employment) is disregarded for State pension non-contributory purposes (this amount is doubled in the case of a couple). <\/p><p>Furthermore, a farmer in receipt of the State Pension (non-contributory) can also benefit from the disregard that exists for certain farm payments administered by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, such as the Agri-Environment Options Scheme.

If they have no entitlement to a State Pension (Contributory or Non Contributory) then the pension element of the contributions paid by both employed and self-employed contributors may be refunded.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement. Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.<\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach for new pensioners from 2020. The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person. Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year. This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation. An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100107#WRWW03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals","counter":1923,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100107#WRWW03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1924,"qnumday":729,"qnumall":"[32120\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100107#WRWW04000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will expedite an appeal by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1220","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1925,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 31<sup>st<\/sup>May 2017.

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided a significant annual saving and allowed my Department to protect other core social welfare payments such as the State pension. <\/p>  <p>  The number of bereavement grant claims in 2013 was 23,716, and this represented an increase of approximately 4% on 2012.  Based on a similar yearly increase each year since 2013, it is estimated that the number of bereavement grant claims that might arise in 2018, were the scheme to be re-introduced, would be in the region of 28,858, and this number would likely increase in future years.

These include weekly paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  Under the SWA scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with funeral and burial expenses.

Control and anti-fraud measures are set out in the Department&rsquo;s Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2018 and are designed to prevent, deter and detect fraud and to ensure effective oversight of schemes and recovery of any sums overpaid.  The annual control implementation report 2016 and target statement for 2017 is published on the Department&rsquo;s website &ndash; <i>www.welfare.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>My Department plans to carry out 950,000 entitlement reviews, inspections and investigations over the course of 2017.  The objective is to ensure that each claimant is receiving their full entitlements and that any wrongful claiming is identified.  The Deputy will be aware that this work identified some &euro;41 million in fraud overpayments in 2016.  <\/p><p>Work will also continue on a number of measures to prevent fraud from entering the social welfare system.  The continued roll-out of the Public Services Card has considerably reduced the potential for identity fraud.  The use of data analytics software and techniques, improved data-matching capacity and data-sharing arrangements, both internally and with the Revenue Commissioners and with other state agencies, has greatly improved early detection of earnings from sources not reported by claimants to the Department.  <\/p><p>A new debt management system became operational at the end of 2014 and has supported the roll-out of improved debt management capacity and the recovery of overpayments.  Staff who are engaged in claim reviews and investigations receive training to identify instances of fraudulent claiming.  Overall, my Department continues to improve its technical ability to identify risks, to ensure cross-referencing of information held in respect of claimants, to reinforce its fraud prevention work and to use the statutory powers granted to it by the Oireachtas.  <\/p><p>Members of the public also play an important role in supporting anti-fraud activities.  In the first six months of this year, the Department has received some 11,000 reports from concerned members of the public.

We are extremely sorry for any worry or concern this may cause to parents\/guardians of children with additional care needs. At present it is taking 20 weeks on average to finalise an application. Applications are processed in date of receipt order.  There are a number of factors that have contributed to the extended time required to process claims;  <\/p>  <p>  First, there is a significant increase in the volume of applications being received.  The numbers applying for DCA have increased significantly since 2009, when the Department took over administration of the scheme from the HSE.  The year on year increase in volumes over recent years has consistently been in the 15-20% range due to an increase in population and more awareness of the scheme.  Over 1,000 claims were received in May, along with a further 700 in June; whereas the average would have been 400 per month a few years ago. <\/p>  <p>  Secondly, following a High Court ruling in 2016, there is now a need for the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors to provide the deciding officer with a more detailed opinion on the child&rsquo;s eligibility for the scheme and for the deciding officer in turn to provide more detailed reasons for their decision when communicating this to the customer.  These factors have resulted in the time taken to finalise applications increasing significantly and as a result the numbers being processed have reduced and the timescale to finalise each application has increased<\/p>  <p>  Corrective actions are being taken, with additional deciding officers assigned to work on the scheme. Once these deciding officers become fully operational, the increase in claim processing capacity should allow for an improvement in processing times.<\/p>  <p>  An application for DCA in respect of this child was received in the Department on the 22nd February 2017.  While it is not feasible to provide an exact date of when a particular application will be finalised, the applications currently being finalised were received in early February 2017.

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  The changes introduced in 2011 were on foot of a Government commitment included in the National Recovery Plan published in 2010, and in the subsequent Memorandum of Understanding with the EU\/ECB\/IMF<\/p>  <p>  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the specific compulsory retirement age and minimum pension age provisions which affect individual public servants will reflect their particular employment sector and time of original recruitment.  However, I understand that such public servants will, generally, be paid a public service pension upon reaching their respective retirement age, whether or not they have reached the age which applies for the State pension.  Any question regarding the retirement age of public servants, and their public service pension arrangements, including such arrangements for those who retire before reaching State pension age, are a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform.<\/p>  <p>  In a general context whether someone will qualify for a State pension at age 66, or for an alternative social protection payment aged 65, will depend on a number of factors, including their personal circumstances.  In particular, it will depend upon whether their PRSI contributions were at the full rate - which provides for State pension coverage - or at a modified (reduced) rate which does not, and which would often be associated with public servants.<\/p>  <p>  There are specific measures which apply to someone claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  <\/p>  <p>  At present, entitlement to the State pension (contributory) is determined by means of a &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life.  The yearly average test has been in existence since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced. Payment rates are banded. For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 or more contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20-29 will qualify for a pension at the 85% rate. <\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person. Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation. <\/p>  <p>  Following completion of the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in the coming months, a refined proposal will be developed.  My Department will conduct a period of consultation with relevant stakeholders including interest groups, representative bodies and the Oireachtas.  Following the consultation period, I will submit a proposal to Government seeking approval of the new approach. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100109#WRYY02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1999,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100109#WRYY02800"},{"type":"question","counter":2000,"qnumday":756,"qnumall":"[32657\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100109#WRYY02900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the level of expenditure by her Department or organisations under the aegis of her Department for each of the past five years on photography, advertising, communications advice, public relations, website development, media interview training and preparation; the events, campaigns or policies to which this expenditure related; the company or person to which such payments were made, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2001,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy is currently being collated and will be provided shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100109#WRYY03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals","counter":2002,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100109#WRYY03100"},{"type":"question","counter":2003,"qnumday":757,"qnumall":"[32720\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100109#WRYY03200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will schedule an oral hearing for a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2004,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who has decided to hold an oral hearing in this case on 18 July 2017.

There are a number of factors that have contributed to the extended time required to process claims;  <\/p>  <p>  First, there is a significant increase in the volume of applications being received.  The numbers applying for DCA have increased significantly since 2009, when the Department took over administration of the scheme from the HSE.  The year on year increase in volumes over recent years has consistently been in the 15-20% range due to an increase in population and more awareness of the scheme.  Over 1,000 claims were received in May, along with a further 700 in June; whereas the average would have been 400 per month a few years ago. <\/p>  <p>  Secondly, following a High Court ruling in 2016, there is now a need for the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors to provide the deciding officer with a more detailed opinion on the child&rsquo;s eligibility for the scheme and for the deciding officer in turn to provide more detailed reasons for their decision when communicating this to the customer.  These factors have resulted in the time taken to finalise applications increasing significantly and as a result the numbers being processed have reduced and the timescale to finalise each application has increased<\/p>  <p>  Corrective actions are being taken, with additional deciding officers assigned to work on the scheme.  Once these deciding officers become fully operational, the increase in claim processing capacity should allow for an improvement in processing times.<\/p>  <p>  An application for DCA was received from this lady on the 8th of March 2017.  The application will be considered by a Deciding Officer and the decision notified to her as soon as possible. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100109#WRYY03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Overpayments","counter":2012,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100109#WRYY04000"},{"type":"question","counter":2013,"qnumday":761,"qnumall":"[32838\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100109#WRYY04100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if the arrangements in relation to collecting money in respect of alleged overpayments to a person (details supplied) will be re-examined in view of the fact that a freedom of information request is currently in the system from the person concerned and that the matter will be dealt with by the person as urgently as possible once this information has been made available; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2014,"content":"<p>In response to information received by my Department, an investigation of payments to the person concerned was undertaken by the Special Investigations Unit.

The new governance model referred to in the Report comprises of eight regions, with eight CIS companies and eight MABS companies.  Acceptance of the restructuring group&rsquo;s recommendation and CIB&rsquo;s decision to move forward with this model was entered in the Register of CIB Board decisions.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to change the governance arrangements of CIS and MABS companies has been taken by the statutory Board of CIB after a lengthy period of consultation and detailed consideration of the options and views put forward at all stages.  I am confident that the membership of the Board of CIB, which comprises of experienced and competent individuals,  representative of a broad spectrum of interests and which includes representatives of the Citizens Information Service and Money Advice and Budgeting Service, has made this important decision in the best interests of the citizens of Ireland, whom the Board serves.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100110#WRZZ03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":2050,"qnumday":776,"qnumall":"[32943\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100110#WRZZ03500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of times the citizens information board met between November 2014 and October 2016; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2051,"content":"<p>The legislative provisions governing membership of the Citizens Information Board (CIB) are contained in the Comhairle Act 2000, the Citizens Information Act 2007 and the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011.

In November 2014, the Board of the Citizens Information Board decided to restructure the local CIS and MABS networks.  In October 2016, the Board decided that the new structure should be regionally based.  In February 2017, the Board adopted a recommendation that the current structure of ninety three individual local companies would be changed to a sixteen regional company model, comprising eight CIS and eight MABS companies.  As a statutory body, the Board has the sole right to make decisions on its day to day operations as it sees fit.  It would not be lawful or appropriate for me, as Minister, to seek to intervene in such a decision taken by the Board.  <\/p>  <p>  The aim of the change is to improve the effectiveness of the control environment, financial management, and governance of CIS and MABS service networks.  I know that CIB has not taken this operational decision lightly.  It follows almost five years of analysis and consideration of options and extensive consultation with all stakeholders.  <\/p>  <p>  The reorganisation process is expected to take up to two years to complete.  An implementation group has been established by CIB to assist with this process, membership of which will evolve in line with specific expertise requirements as the project progresses.  CIB has held a number of regional consultations on implementation of the new structure during the month of May, attended by 350 representatives of boards, management, staff and volunteers of local services.  Following on from these sessions, CIB in recent days has issued a questionnaire to all board members, staff, managers and volunteers across CIS and MABS companies to capture further views and feedback, particularly from those who, for one reason or another, could not attend the sessions held in May.  Consultation is continuing, with CIB planning to hold further focus group meetings over the summer period. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of a recent procurement exercise, CIB is expected to shortly appoint an independent external provider to undertake a full Cost Benefit Analysis on the new regional model. <\/p>  <p>  CIB is seeking to implement the Board&rsquo;s decision in a consultative way and is making genuine efforts to allay concerns of staff  and boards of local services in relation to the operation of the new structure.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100111#WRAAA00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Operation","counter":2059,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100111#WRAAA00500"},{"type":"question","counter":2060,"qnumday":779,"qnumall":"[32955\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100111#WRAAA00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the details of the new amended rules in respect of community employment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2061,"content":"<p>Following the publication of my Department&rsquo;s Report - <i>An Analysis of the Community Employment Programme &ndash; <\/i>earlier in the year, the Government approved a number of changes to the terms and conditions around participation on Community Employment (CE).

The increased rent limits introduced by the Government last year, together with the additional discretion available to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limit where necessary, are allowing HAP households to find suitable accommodation and willing landlords.  On average in 2017, 333 additional tenancies are being supported by HAP each week, with just over 24,000 households\u00a0currently having their housing needs met under the scheme, and some 18,000 separate landlords and agents currently in receipt of monthly HAP payments. <\/p><p>Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis.  Additional discretion of up to 50% above rent limits is available to assist in housing homeless households in the Dublin Region.  The additional discretion available to homeless households recognises the difficulty this cohort of households face in sourcing and securing properties in a highly competitive rental market.\u00a0<\/p><p>At the end of Q1 2017, 14.4% of the total number of households across the country being supported by HAP were benefiting from the additional flexibility that was provided to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limits.  When\u00a0homeless households in the Dublin area are excluded from this, 9.6% of all households being supported were benefiting from the additional flexibility.\u00a0 In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 14.3% above rent limits provided.  The following table shows the percentage of households in each of 4 Dublin local authorities (excluding homeless households)\u00a0and the two Cork local authorities areas being supported by HAP which were benefiting from the additional flexibility, and the average percentage rate of discretion in excess of the maximum rent limits utilised by the six local authorities for those households.\u00a0<table><tr><th>Local Authority<\/th><th>Percentage of HAP Households Benefiting From\u00a0 Discretion<\/th><th>Average Rate of Discretion being provided (% increase beyond Rent limits)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City Council<\/td><td>28.5% <\/td><td>12.7% <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork County Council<\/td><td>6.6% <\/td><td>15.4% <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council*<\/td><td>1.2% <\/td><td>14.6% <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council*<\/td><td>54.5% <\/td><td>18.6% <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council*<\/td><td>6.8% <\/td><td>10.5% <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council*<\/td><td>0.5% <\/td><td>15.0% <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>*Excluding use of specific discretion for Homeless households<\/p><p>The local authority must make a decision on what level of support to provide based on the tenant&rsquo;s current position and the needs of a household, as well as the market rents in that\u00a0local\u00a0area.\u00a0 I am currently satisfied that the maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are sufficient to meet the demand of the rental market in these areas and, accordingly, the question of increasing the HAP\u00a0limits does not arise. <\/p><p>The Government has provided &euro;152.7 million\u00a0to fund\u00a0the cost of HAP in 2017,\u00a0and I am satisfied that\u00a0there are sufficient resources in place to meet this\u00a0demand.

","asker":"1347","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":2129,"content":"<p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a flexible and immediate housing support that is now available to all eligible households throughout the State.  The increased rent limits introduced by the Government  last year, together with the additional discretion available to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limit where necessary, are allowing \u00a0HAP households to find suitable accommodation and willing landlords.  On average in 2017, 333 additional tenancies are being supported by HAP each week, with just over 24,000 households currently having their housing needs met via HAP and some 18,000 separate landlords and agents currently in receipt of monthly HAP payments.  Particular additional targeted supports are available to homeless households in the Dublin and Cork City regions to assist them in finding accommodation in the private rental market, with the support of HAP.<\/p>  <p>  HAP supported tenancies are agreed between the landlord and the tenant; the local authority is not a party to the tenancy and has no role in its agreement.  There is no limitation placed by the scheme on the length of tenancy that can be supported by HAP.  However, as with other private rental tenancies, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended), governs the relationship between landlord and tenant and the length of the tenancy is a matter that must be agreed between the landlord and tenant in that context.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy for the Rental Sector, published in December 2016, recognises that high and rapidly rising rents is the most significant and immediate threat to the accommodation security of many households. \u00a0For this reason the Government introduced the Rent Predictability Measure and established the system of Rent Pressure Zones to moderate the rise in rents in the parts of the country where rents are highest and rising. \u00a0In these areas, for a period of three years, rents\u00a0may only rise by a maximum of 4% annually. \u00a0The practical effect of the measure is that for the next three years, rents, for more than 186,000 households, who currently rent their homes in these areas, will be lower than they would have been if market rents had continued to apply.  Rents paid under the HAP scheme are subject to the same measure.<\/p>  <p>  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, which introduced the Rent Predictability Measure with effect from 24 December 2016, also gives effect to other actions to address tenants&rsquo; security:<\/p>  <p>  - The abolition of a landlord&rsquo;s right, during the first 6 months of a further Part 4 tenancy, to end that tenancy for no stated ground;<\/p>  <p>  - The extension of the term of Part 4 tenancies from 4 to 6 years;<\/p>  <p>  - Where a landlord proposes to sell 10 or more units within a single development at the same time, the sale will be subject to the existing tenants remaining in situ, other than in exceptional circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has initiated a review of the Rent Predictability Measure.  At this stage, the measure has been in place for 6 months and data from the Residential Tenancies Board&rsquo;s Rent Index Report for Quarter 1 2017 is also available. \u00a0Using this latest data, it will be possible to ascertain the effectiveness of the Rent Predictability Measure and whether any changes need to be made.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the HAP scheme is generally working well but I will keep its operation under on-going review, including considering its effectiveness \u00a0as a social housing support, and the impact of the Rent Predictability Measure on Social \u00a0Housing Supports, including HAP, as part of the current review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100112#WRBBB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2130,"content":"<p>Question No. 802 answered with Question No. 789.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Assistance Scheme","counter":2131,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100112#WRBBB02600"},{"type":"question","counter":2132,"qnumday":803,"qnumall":"[32360\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100112#WRBBB02700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the status of the ringfenced funding of &euro;10 million in 2016 under the CAS, specifically for the provision of accommodation for persons with disabilities transitioning from congregated settings as mentioned on page 55 of Rebuilding Ireland; the areas in which this funding was utilised; and the number of housing units delivered.","asker":"1215","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":2133,"content":"<p>Ring-fenced funding of &euro;10 million was made available in 2016 under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) to support the provision of accommodation for persons with disabilities transitioning from congregated settings.

The Defence Forces provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or emergency situation in its aid to the civil authority role. <\/p>  <p>  At National level, representation on the Government task force on emergency planning, by both the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency and that the command structure within the Defence Forces is compatible with the requirements in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Major emergency plans have been developed by local and regional authorities and these plans identify the procedures for requesting assistance from the Defence Forces.   <\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces retain a wide range of specialist skills which can be deployed in such circumstances, including for a natural disaster or terrorist incidents.  The operations directorate in Defence Forces Headquarters manages the necessary cross-service coordination in responding to both emergency and security issues.  These arrangements have proved effective in all emergencies encountered to date.<\/p>  <p>  Primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

These activities assist in detecting and preventing emergency situations throughout Ireland&rsquo;s maritime jurisdiction. <\/p>  <p>  The role of the Air Corps includes the provision of an emergency inter-hospital Air Ambulance service in support of the HSE.

Within the Defence Forces, both the Ordnance Corps and the Army Ranger Wing specialise in providing an immediate response to emergency incidents that might require their highly specialised capabilities.  The role of the Defence Forces in these situations is dependent on the nature of the incident and the type of assistance requested. <\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that the Defence Forces keep their operational plans and response capabilities for dealing with a wide range of threats under constant review.

The acquisition of new equipment and equipment upgrades for the Defence Forces remains a clear focus for me, and the White Paper on Defence recognises that there are several new and or enhanced platforms to be procured.  Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning priorities planning process. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, Budget 2017 secured a capital spending allocation of &euro;74 million, representing an increase of &euro;7 million on the 2017 Defence allocation contained in the 2016-21 capital investment programme.  This investment will aim to ensure that the Defence Forces have the equipment and infrastructure to deliver on all their roles as set out in the White Paper.   <\/p>  <p>  The Army will continue to retain all-arms conventional military capabilities, and the principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas.  There is focus on the essential force protection provided by armoured vehicles, and in this regard a maintenance and upgrade programme has commenced for the current fleet of 80 armoured personnel carriers which will seek to ensure viability of the fleet out to 2030.  A small number of armoured logistical and utility vehicles are also being procured for force protection.  Modern secure communications are essential for overseas missions and in that regard Defence Force personnel are suitably equipped with required communications and global positioning systems equipment. <\/p>  <p>  The White Paper provides that the Air Corps will see the Cessna fleet replaced with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance tasks.  The tender competition for the procurement of the three new aircraft is underway.   <\/p>  <p>  The two CASA 235s maritime patrol aircraft are due for replacement in 2019.  The CASAs will be replaced with consideration of their replacement with larger more capable aircraft to enhance maritime surveillance and to provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to training aircraft, a decision was made in 2016 to replace a PC-9M aircraft which was written off following a fatal crash in 2009.  The replacement PC-9M aircraft from Pilatus Aircraft in Switzerland arrived in Casement Aerodrome last week, bringing the fleet up to eight.  This acquisition will assist in a required increase in pilot training in the Air Corps.   <\/p>  <p>  As stated in the White Paper, should additional funding beyond that required to maintain existing Air Corps&rsquo; capabilities become available, the development of a radar surveillance capability is a priority for the Air Corps.  Funding for this is not provided in the current resource envelope and any future decisions in this regard will be in the context of the ongoing security environment and any associated developments. <\/p>  <p>  The current Naval Service Ship replacement programme has already seen the replacement of three Naval Service vessels.  The White Paper underpins the ongoing replacement of the Naval Service fleet.  An agreement was reached in June 2016 for the provision of an additional ship for the Naval Service to be built to the same specifications as the three newest vessels.  This ship is scheduled for delivery next year.  Future Naval Service capabilities are being planned as part of the White Paper project planning process which will determine the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s maritime capability requirements.  The White Paper also recognises the requirement to maintain and upgrade vessels having regard to emerging operational requirements and changes in technology, including communications equipment and technology and this is an ongoing process.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current provisions, together with the courses of action in the White Paper, will continue to ensure that the Defence Forces is suitably equipped, in line with international best practice, to fulfil all roles assigned by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100115#WREEE02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2253,"content":"<p>Question No. 848 answered with Question No. 66.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Training","counter":2254,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100115#WREEE02300"},{"type":"question","counter":2255,"qnumday":849,"qnumall":"[32984\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017071100115#WREEE02400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the extent to which annual training is available to and has been availed of by all members of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps in line with best practice internationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":2256,"content":"<p>The primary function of training and education in the Defence Forces is to develop and maintain the capabilities necessary to enable it to fulfil the roles laid down by Government. <\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces conduct training and education under four broad categories namely; leadership, skills, career and collective training.  Leadership training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensure that personnel are prepared for exercising command authority across the full range of military functions both at home and overseas in international operations.  Skills training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensure that its personnel have the requisite individual, specialist, and crew skills.
