Lending institutions in Ireland, including those in which the State has a significant shareholding, are independent commercial entities.  I have no statutory role in regard to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate changes or to the mortgage interest rates charged.  It is a commercial matter for each institution concerned.  It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the detailed position or manner in which individual banks choose to put forward mortgage propositions to potential customers or how that relates to existing customers.<\/p>  <p>  That said, the issue of regulation of interest rates remains a policy area under active review and this has been the subject of recent correspondence between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  The current position is that the Central Bank does not have new proposals for the additional regulation of interest rates.  The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations.  It has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by financial institutions, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears.<\/p>  <p>  As I stated in previous parliamentary questions, a previous deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank previously stated that it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis.  Such control would strongly discourage new entrants.  In this regard, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services.  In this regard, there has been some movement on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggests that the market may well be entering a new and more competitive phase. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100003#A00600","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1427877000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response, which is quite similar in nature to the response given on the Minister's behalf by the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, last night during the Private Members' debate.  The problem I have with the response is that the Minister did exert pressure on the banks back in 2011, in a very public way, when there was an ECB rate reduction and the pillar banks did not initially pass that reduction on to customers.  The pillar banks were called before the Economic Management Council and the Minister and the then Minister of State, former Deputy Brian Hayes, made strong comments and at least one of the banks subsequently passed on that rate reduction to customers.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is not just the prudential supervisor of the banks and the regulator.  It is also the consumer watchdog.  Take Bank of Ireland as an example.  Last November, it told the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform that its cost of funds is 1.15%.  Its standard variable rate for existing customers is 4.5%.  That is extortion by any measure.  That level of a margin being applied on a particular group of customers is unfair.  There has been some downward movement on variable rates, but a number of the banks excluded their existing customers from benefiting from that reduction.  This is unfair and should be addressed.  They have given the reduced rate to new customers, but not to existing customers who form part of the 300,000 customers affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100003#A00700","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1427877000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The views the Deputy is expressing are shared widely by Members on all sides.

Tackling mortgage arrears is a priority for the Government.  A whole-of-government approach has been adopted in addressing this issue, with a view to maximising the level of loan restructuring arrangements and minimising the number of home repossessions.  Initiatives such as the reform of personal insolvency legislation, the establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, the introduction of a mortgage arrears information and advice helpline and the availability of mortgage-to-rent schemes ensure that borrowers are assisted in dealing with their arrears.<\/p><p>In March 2013 the mortgage arrears resolution targets, MART, framework was introduced.  This sets out demanding quantitative targets for mortgage arrears resolution at six Irish mortgage lenders which account for 90% of the mortgages in Ireland.  The six lenders - AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB, Ulster Bank, ACC Bank and KBC Bank - are required to meet targets at quarterly intervals.  In addition, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, sets out requirements for mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residences.  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lenders and that long-term resolutions are sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.  Under the CCMA, a lender may only commence legal proceedings for repossession after it has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower or his or her nominated representative, and where specific timeframes have been adhered to, or where the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.  It is clear that the Government has put in place a number of initiatives to assist homeowners in difficulty, including reform of personal insolvency legislation, the provision of independent advice to those dealing with debt issues and, as already stated, the introduction of MART targets and the revision of the CCMA.<\/p><p>The most recent ISI results show an increasing take-up of its services, albeit from a low base.  For quarter 4 of 2014, the ISI reported that it was dealing with debt of &euro;1.5 billion and that the number of personal insolvency arrangements approved in quarter 4 had increased by 148% over that for quarter 3.  The ISI also report that 75% of proposals are supported by creditors.  The decision in 2014 to waive fees for the insolvency service, coupled with a targeted awareness-raising campaign, is likely to lead to greater engagement with the office.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>My Department and the Central Bank monitor the situation in regard to mortgage arrears on an ongoing basis.

In addition, the number of borrowers reaching agreements with their banks to restructure their mortgages is increasing, with almost 115,000 mortgages classified as restructured at end December 2014.  It is also encouraging to note that approximately 85% of these restructured accounts are deemed to be meeting the terms of their current restructure arrangement.<\/p><p>This is, however, an area which remains under continuous review.

This demonstrates that the reduction in the bankruptcy term is having a positive impact as a mechanism of last resort in dealing with distressed debt situations.  However, more time is needed to assess the effectiveness of this measure.  Recently, there have been calls in the media to reduce the bankruptcy term down to one year, with the rationalisation that this will allow entrepreneurs to regularise their debt situation quickly with a view to facilitating them in establishing a new business.  Alternatively, it is suggested that reducing the bankruptcy term will enable individuals to write down debt without having to leave their family home.<br\/><br\/>Bankruptcy is a big step for borrowers and one that may not deliver the desired result of retaining the family home.

On a general level, regulated lenders are required, in their interaction with their customers, to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of their customers.  Utilising the mortgage arrears resolution process, there is a requirement on the lender to assess each case of mortgage difficulty on its own merits and also to proactively work with the borrower in order to address a case of genuine mortgage difficulty.<\/p>  <p>  If a borrower is dissatisfied with the decision of the lender in this area, the appeals framework as set out in the CCMA will be available.  Also, where appropriate, independent financial advice will be available to the borrower under the protocol for independent advice to borrowers availing of long-term mortgage forbearance.<\/p><p>Specific provisions in the CCMA, which are designed to protect borrowers in genuine mortgage difficulty, include that except in the very limited circumstance set out in the CCMA, a lender must not require a borrower, as part of an alternative repayment arrangement, to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another mortgage type; and lenders are restricted from imposing charges and-or surcharge interest on arrears arising on a relevant mortgage in arrears unless the borrower is not co-operating.  While it is unfortunate that there are cases of mortgage difficulty and that this gives rise to certain difficulties and costs for the parties involved, it is nevertheless a very welcome development that many parties are in a position to agree and put in place sustainable alternative arrangements in order to address such a difficulty.  The latest data from the Central Bank and my Department indicate that an increasing number of mortgage restructures are being put in place in order to deal with mortgage difficulty with almost 115,000 principal dwelling house, PDH, accounts being classified as restructured at the end of December.  It is also encouraging to note that 85% of such accounts are deemed to meet the terms of their current restructure arrangement.  I would encourage lenders and borrowers in difficulty to continue to build on this and to reach acceptable and sustainable solutions to mortgage difficulty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100005#C01000","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427878800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I hope the Minister will agree that the answer which was scripted is boilerplate stuff and does not address the question I raised, which relates to the fact that the majority of restructures increase the level of profitability to the bank from the restructures, although not in all cases.

Assessment of compliance with the rules of the preventive arm is based on two pillars, the annual improvement in the structural balance and the expenditure benchmark.  The expenditure benchmark links growth in expenditure to the potential growth rate of the economy.  Additional expenditure above the benchmark has to be paid for through the introduction of new discretionary revenue measures.  The benchmark also contains a feature that is designed to assist with achieving the minimum annual structural improvement of more than 0.5% of GDP.<\/p>  <p>  I have raised on a number of occasions, including at the recent Eurogroup meeting, the use of outdated estimates of growth in the calculation of the expenditure benchmark.  At the moment, the reference rate used in the calculation of the expenditure benchmark is based on a ten-year average of potential growth that is updated every three years.  The reference rate to apply for 2014 to 2016 was calculated in 2013 when both the outturn and outlook for our economy's growth potential was considerably weaker.  The use of such outdated estimates could lead to inappropriate fiscal decisions being made.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of my interventions at political level, my officials have been in discussions at a technical level with the European Commission and other member states.  The aim of technical discussions has been to ensure that the methodology for calculating potential output and its implementation in the context of EU fiscal rules is applied in a manner that produces credible results that underpin the operation of a sound set of rules.  The focus of our discussions has been two pronged; first, to improve how estimates of potential GDP are calculated for Ireland by using more appropriate population projections and, second, to apply the calculations in a more logical fashion so that the fiscal policy consistent with the rules is set based on latest available information regarding both the outturn and prospects for the Irish economy.<\/p>  <p>  Discussions are progressing well but final decisions at a technical level must be endorsed at the relevant committees.  While I do not want to prejudice the ongoing discussions, I welcome the strong engagement of the Commission on this issue.  Finally, I emphasise that I support the revised fiscal rules.  What I seek from the Commission and colleagues from other European states is a more sensible application of the rules for all member states as this will enhance the credibility of fiscal policy decision making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100006#D01000","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1427878800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>If it were not so serious one would laugh.

It is not only the rules that must be considered as other issues must be taken into account such as the calculation of structural deficits and structural surpluses that will cause problems in the future.  There is suspicion that this is happening as a result of it being an election year, that the Government has implemented all of the austerity rules and policies but given the impending election and the fact that it has committed to reducing the income tax rate for top earners, under the current rules the expenditure benchmark would not allow that to happen, and that the measure is very much geared towards election commitments.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister said the matter must be agreed by committees in Europe.

The issue is that when rules are applied to give bizarre or peculiar results, the application of the rules needs to be examined.  For example, technical people in the European Commission looking at migration patterns from 2008 for three years or so, when migration was very strong, came to the conclusion that the Irish population would decline by a million by 2030 and built expenditure loans around that.  That is nonsense; it is not going to happen and it is quite clear that population trends now negate that.  Some kind of theoretical, bizarre interpretation of economic data cannot be the base for applying the rules.  The second issue is that as a general expenditure rule, sovereigns should keep their increase in expenditure below their net growth rates.  That gave another bizarre result for us because of the averaging over ten years.  There is an argument that for 2016 we must keep our expenditure increase below 0.6% on the basis that the growth average is 0.6%.

In total, 345 samples of petrol from filling stations and other sources have been referred to the State Laboratory.  The scientific analysis required is complex and time-consuming, and the State Laboratory has conducted an extensive series of tests and re-tests on the samples.

In recent years this has obviously been very different for Irish banks compared with their counterparts in other European countries.  Funding models also differ between Ireland and other countries.

The roadmap set out a comprehensive package of measures designed to reposition Ireland to reap the benefits of sustainable foreign direct investment in a changing international tax landscape.<\/p><p>The knowledge development box, KDB, which the Deputy has asked about, was one of the measures announced in the roadmap.  The knowledge development box is not intended to be a replacement for the so-called &quot;double Irish&quot;, which was never part of the Irish tax offering, and it was just one example of the many international tax planning arrangements designed by tax and legal advisers to take advantage of mismatches between the tax rules in two or more countries.  However, the reality is that the &quot;double Irish&quot; was damaging Ireland's reputation.  For that reason, I introduced a change to Ireland's corporate tax residence rules in budget 2015.  I view the knowledge development box as a potentially positive measure for Ireland.  It is recognised internationally that investment and growth in OECD economies is increasingly driven by knowledge-based investment, which is related to research and development and intellectual property.  Putting in place an attractive tax offering for developing and commercially exploiting intellectual property is therefore important to encourage companies to develop their knowledge-based capital in Ireland and for our continued success in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland.<\/p><p>A public consultation to gather views on how the knowledge development box should operate was launched on 14 January and will remain open until 8 April.

It is the responsibility of the lender's arrears support unit to carry out certain functions under the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  For example, the lender must pass the completed standard financial statement to its arrears support unit immediately on receipt and provide a copy of the standard financial statement to the borrower; a completed standard financial statement must be assessed in a timely manner by the lender's arrears support unit; a lender's arrears support unit must formally review the borrower's case, including the standard financial statement, immediately where a borrower ceases to adhere to the terms of an alternative repayment arrangement; and a lender must allow the borrower a reasonable period of time to consider submitting an appeal to the appeals board, which must be at least 20 business days from the date of notification of the decision of the lender's arrears support unit.<\/p>  <p>  The code of conduct on mortgage arrears also requires that each branch or office in the case of a lender who does not operate a branch network must have at least one person with specific responsibility for dealing with arrears and pre-arrears cases and for liaising with the lender's dedicated arrears support unit in respect of these cases.  Therefore, while the code of conduct on mortgage arrears requires that a lender's arrears support unit, as opposed to the branch, is charged with managing cases under the mortgage arrears resolution process, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears does not preclude a borrower from liaising with the lender's arrears support unit through the branch staff member with specific responsibility for dealing with arrears and pre-arrears cases and for liaising with the lender's dedicated arrears support unit in respect of these cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100009#G01600","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1427881200,"counter":97,"content":"<p>While I realise the Government has introduced initiatives which should help borrowers in their negotiations with lenders, the reality is a little more difficult for the lender.

I do not have a major problem with the definition of &quot;medical assessor&quot; but my problem is that this change will facilitate the use of employment agencies instead of hiring medical practitioners directly.  On Committee Stage, I reflected the practice in Britain when agency staff were introduced and the health service went outside public practice.  A standard was set for medical assessors to achieve reductions in payments.  A report in <i>The Guardian<\/i>about this, which I quoted, stated that this led to the death of a number of people because they were assessed as being fit for work when they were not.  That put stress and pressure on them and forced them back into work when they were not ready.  It needs to be ensured that what was done in Britain will not be replicated here.  The Minister of State gave us an assurance that this is not the intention but, in the past, the Minister for Social Protection has sought support, for instance, for the re-employment of social welfare inspectors in the social welfare appeals office.  We did not oppose that because the intention was good, which was to address a huge backlog of cases, and it was timebound.  However, it involved a contract directly between the Department and the individuals in question for 11 months.  That led to a reduction in waiting times.  Nobody wants to exacerbate the current situation.  There are not enough medical assessors and there is a significant delay in social welfare payments dependent on medical assessment.<\/p><p>It is difficult to figure out why hiring someone through an employment agency rather than through a recruitment drive or via direct contracts with the Department would be better.  It will result in an increased cost to the Exchequer because normally employment agencies charge a premium of between 15% and 20% on top of the remuneration of the staff they provide.  If the salary is &euro;100,000 a year, this means it will cost the State &euro;120,000 a year.  I am concerned that the Department is going down this route, especially since most medical professionals can access the Internet to find work through agencies.  In addition, quite a number of doctors who are the basic equivalent of a medical assessor leave the country every year.  I may be wrong but this is an attractive job in that people can take up contracts for a short duration while backlogs are addressed.<\/p><p>In the long term, we have an ageing population.  This will result in increased demand for assessments under the carer's allowance scheme, for instance.  People who apply to care for elderly relatives will have to go through this process because an assessment must be made that the relative is in need of full-time care.  Given advances in medical technology, people are living longer with complicated disabilities where previously they would only have survived for a few years.  This is resulting in more medical intervention at an earlier stage and, therefore, the State is incurring increased social welfare payments on medical grounds, which will continue to increase in the future.  There has been a significant jump in recent years as people who cannot afford the care required have become aware of the payments that are available and how to access them.<\/p><p>Nobody denies the need for medical assessors and, therefore, my proposal is to delete the reference to employment agencies because my problem is that we will impose an additional cost on the Exchequer.  We should support the other amendments to ensure people are not put under undue stress because of delays in processing applications for disability allowance, invalidity pension, domiciliary care allowance and so on.<\/p><p>The other issue with bringing in agency staff is they will have to be trained to be medical assessors but they could disappear in the morning, although no more so than somebody employed directly.  However, usually somebody who goes to the trouble of being employed directly has a little loyalty.<\/p><p>At the moment we have a significant problem with medical assessments, which has not arisen of late but has been there for a while.  On appeal over 50% of those assessments are overturned.  They are not all due to a bad assessment.  Many are due to additional medical documentation.  However, it is still a high number, which means that work must be done to ensure staff, whether the current medical assessors or ones employed in future through this contract system, are fully aware of everything required, take their job as seriously as they can and give it as much care as they can.  The medical assessors cannot do that if they are under pressure to move things along as quickly as possible.  That is the pressure they are under because the in-pile on their desks is getting bigger and bigger.  They need help, but the employment agency part is a bad move.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100011#J01100","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427882400,"counter":118,"content":"<p>We discussed this on Committee Stage and I have submitted another amendment, which attempts to take on board some of the defence the Government side gave when it came to the concerns that were raised by us at that stage.  The Government said that there is, or can be, difficulty in getting qualified people to be medical assessors on a permanent, full-time basis, and for that reason they needed the option of getting people from employment agencies.  Taking the Government in good faith in that regard, I have put forward an amendment that allows the Government that option, but only after the option of directly engaging people on a full-time, permanent basis has been exhausted.  That is a fair compromise because it is not ideal that we should have agency people coming in.  It can be more costly and is more haphazard because people are going in and out and not developing the necessary expertise.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue I will raise in regard to some of the other amendments I have tabled is that we need some discussion about the medical qualifications of these assessors.  Are they specialists?  Are they people who have specialised, expert knowledge in the particular areas they are supposed to be dealing with?  I suspect they are not.  As we will discuss later, even worse is the fact that we often have unqualified, non-medical people as deciding officers, second-guessing qualified medical practitioners who give diagnoses on the care and support needs of people with disabilities, which is totally unacceptable.  We will come to that in a minute.<\/p>  <p>  At the very least, if the Government is saying that it is forced, in a non-ideal situation, to take agency people on for this staff sometimes, then it should only be as a last resort when the possibility of getting full-time, permanent and appropriately qualified people to make these medical assessments has been exhausted.  Let us not forget, these applicants are very vulnerable, disabled people with real needs, who should be our absolute priority in this regard, never mind the need to have decently paid, proper jobs, for people performing this important task.  My amendment is a fair attempt to deal with the Government's difficulty in getting medical assessors while prioritising the objective of getting full-time, permanent, directly employed people wherever possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100012#K00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1427882400,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I certainly agree with the thinking behind these amendments.  We are all dealing, day in, day out, with constituents who are suffering because of inordinate delays in medical assessments.

I presume the money is available to do that, but it cannot get people to apply for the jobs.  I do not for one minute doubt the Minister of State's bona fides, but I find that difficult to understand because, as has been said, people who qualify as doctors are leaving the country looking for employment.  It is not as if we are confined to Ireland when we are seeking to recruit these people.  We have the whole world from which to recruit.<\/p>  <p>  As has been said, and for all the reasons stated, it would be preferable to recruit people directly to work full time in these jobs if possible.  Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendment seems to be a reasonable compromise.  My understanding is that the Department wants to recruit permanent people, it cannot get them so it proposes therefore to fill the gap by resorting to people from agencies.  If that is the situation, then amendment No. 4 is only putting into legislative form what is happening in practice already.

Everybody in the House realises that while we have quite a young population at present, we face very large challenges in the future, and it will have to be reviewed by future Governments as time goes on.  As the make-up of the population changes there will be demands not only on social protection but also on health and other services.  It will have to be constantly kept under review.  The medical assessors will operate as they do at present.  The Deputy can correct me if I am wrong, but his concern is that when they were introduced in England they were paid on a results basis according to the number of people they knocked off the system.  I reassure the Deputy that this is not my intention, nor that of the T&aacute;naiste.  Our intention is to have a more practical operational mechanism in the Department.  As I outlined earlier, we will recruit more permanent people.  The intention is not to do as the Deputy outlined, which is payment based on results, whereby medical assessors would be paid on the basis of the number of people to whom they disallow benefit.  This is certainly not my intention, and I would view it as being quite serious if this operational procedure was introduced in the Department.  I would not be at all happy with such a mechanism with regard to dealing with people in a respectful and dignified manner.  I give the House this commitment.<\/p>  <p>  I know what Deputy Boyd Barrett is trying to do, but we are trying to have flexibility.  Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 tabled by Deputy Boyd Barrett and Joan Collins would significantly restrict the circumstances in which medical assessors would be engaged through agency arrangements.

We are actively engaging; four new doctors have been recruited and will start on 27 April if they take up the positions, and the indications at the moment are that they will.  We will hold another similar competition.   On Committee Stage, Deputy Collins asked about their salary.  Everyone in the House is on a respectable salary; I can certainly live on it, as can anyone else in the House.  There are restrictions in the way the Deputies have formatted the proposals.  We will hold a competition to recruit more doctors for the panel.  On any one day we have between 17 and 19 doctors available for medical assessments, and we want to ensure we have efficiencies.  We will deal with the backlog that Deputy O'Dea spoke about in a Private Members' debate.  I have a strong commitment to this.

The framing of this whole legislation, not just this section or this part of the Bill, is about tightening up and providing the legislative back-up to say \"No\" as the first response.  If it is not the case that it will place a bigger onus on the applicant who is seeking to get resources or supports, and if our anxieties and concerns that this is the inclination of the Department and the Government are misplaced, the Minister of State should have no reason to refuse our amendments.  If the intention of the Bill is to provide support to anybody who is entitled to that support, as it should be, there is absolutely no reason for the Minister of State not to accept these amendments.  The only reason to refuse to accept them would be a desire to retain a provision that will make it easier to say \"No\" without good cause.  I hope that is not the case, but some of us on this side of the House suspect that it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100013#L01800","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427883600,"counter":144,"content":"<p>We are dealing with this section again.  We all feel we are expressing the negativity of this section when we say that the inclusion of the word \"not\" is negative law-making.  This has quite clearly been outlined by the Free Legal Advice Centres, which have major concerns about this section.  We are questioning why the Department and the Minister of State want to change the current legislation in this way.  Given that it has worked effectively up to now with no negative content in it, why do the Department and the Minister of State specifically want to change it now?<\/p>  <p>  When we debated this matter on Committee Stage last week, I tabled an amendment which would have provided that a person would not be regarded as requiring full-time care unless \"the nature and extent of the person&rsquo;s incapacity has been certified in the prescribed manner by a medical practitioner including the person's own General Practitioner\".  I intended that this certification would determine the eligibility of the person's application on medical grounds.  The Minister of State suggested that the amendment tabled by Deputy Boyd Barrett and I last week was too broad because it would affect the means testing of the whole application.  That is why I have tabled a similar amendment that refers specifically to the \"person&rsquo;s eligibility on the medical grounds eligibility of the application\".  I think it is a very practical amendment to the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I will conclude by reiterating that I want to know why this section of the Bill is necessary.  There is concern on the Opposition benches that it is being introduced to tighten up the process that has to be followed by vulnerable people when they are looking for grants and benefits and to put the onus on such people to prove they have illnesses that are so bad that they require carers to assist them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100014#M00200","speaker":"1193"},{"type":"speech","time":1427883600,"counter":145,"content":"<p>These amendments relate to the obstacles that have to be overcome by a person in order to qualify for and receive carer's allowance or carer's benefit.  Every Deputy in the House will know from his or her experience in his or her constituency that people do not apply for carer's allowance lightly.  I accept that some people do not meet the criteria.  People do not apply for it lightly.  Deputies will also be aware that in practice, it is extremely difficult to get carer's allowance.  That is not to say that many people who apply for it do not ultimately get it.  As the Minister of State told us on Committee Stage, the figures with regard to people qualifying may have improved.  The number of hoops through which applicants now have to jump to get carer's allowance is not measured.  It is probably not possible to measure it.<\/p>  <p>  On Committee Stage, I instanced cases in which people who were extremely ill - in some cases, they died before a final decision was made - were refused carer's allowance in the first instance because they were deemed not to be sick enough.  In fact, it was brought to my attention this morning that an unfortunate constituent of mine, in respect of whom I have been making representations for carer's allowance, is being removed from a funeral home this evening.  I was told initially that he was not sick enough.  That was a couple of months ago.  The man died yesterday.  It is difficult.  People who are ultimately determined to have been entitled to carer's allowance all the time, having gone through the appeals system and the review, etc., are experiencing inordinate delays and terrible stress as they wait for the their applications to be finalised.  I could also mention the stress on their family members who have to support them in the meantime.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation governing carer's allowance that is on the Statute Book at the moment - the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 - is pretty neutral.  Obviously, it puts the onus on applicants to apply and produce certain documentation with regard to medical conditions in order to satisfy the Department that the person being cared for fulfils the requisite criteria.  It is now proposed that our legislation will, for the first time in history, put the burden of proof very firmly on the unfortunate applicant.  I suggest we should stand back from all the technicalities and look at the effect of this proposal.  I suggest it can only make it more difficult for somebody to qualify for carer's allowance.  To look at it the other way around, it can only make it easier for the Department to say \"No\".  That is the net effect.  It cannot have any other possible effect.  If one looks at the way this Bill is written, one will see it provides that a person will \"not\" qualify \"unless\" he or she meets certain conditions.  The onus is firmly on the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said something I found quite extraordinary during the Committee Stage debate.  He said \"it has always been the case that the onus has been on the claimant\", but I believe that if one examines the wording of the 2005 Act, one will see that this has patently not been the case.  He suggested that the provisions of this Bill will retrospectively justify what has always been the reality and what has been happening all the time.  That is tantamount to saying that the Department has been misapplying the original legislation all the time, and that an amendment must be passed to retrospectively justify that misapplication.  It is difficult to get carer's allowance.  It is difficult for the unfortunate ill people who are waiting for the money to come through.  It causes great stress to such people because they feel they are a burden on their relatives.  In my experience, it causes enormous financial stress for the relatives in many cases.  The last thing we want is legislation that makes it more difficult to qualify, or easier for the Department to say \"No\".  I earnestly entreat the Minister of State, even if he makes no other amendments to this legislation, to withdraw this section of it or to adopt the wording of the amendments as outlined.  As I have said, it is difficult enough already.  There is no point in making it any more difficult.  Only the vulnerable will suffer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100014#M00300","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1427883600,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Like the other Deputies who have spoken, I find this change in the legislation odd because it is changing the presumption.  As the Free Legal Advice Centres have indicated in their submission, this is negative legislation.  I would like to remind people of exactly what is provided for in the relevant legislation at present.<\/p><p>In respect of carer's allowance, section 179(4) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 states, &quot;For the purposes of <i>subsection (1)<\/i>, a relevant person shall be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention where&quot;.  The new provision states, &quot;For the purposes of the definition of &lsquo;relevant person&rsquo; in this Chapter, a person shall not be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention&quot;.  The use of &quot;not&quot; puts a different emphasis on the criteria or the burden of proof that someone who is applying for carer&rsquo;s allowance needs to achieve.  It is difficult, as other Deputies have said, to get carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Some of this is due to complications such as not providing enough documentation.  Some of it is due to incomplete medical assessments.  Now, an additional hurdle is being put in place.  The Minister of State might claim this is not the case as it is just a different way of drafting it.  We are supposed to be promoting plain English and ensuring legislation is accessible.  Once one starts writing in the negative, it makes it more convoluted and difficult to understand where someone qualifies or does not.  As a rule, legislation should not be written in the negative but this is what this provision does.<br\/><br\/>In its submission to the legislation, FLAC, the Free Legal Advice Centres, and the Community Law and Mediation group also made this point.  It stated:<blockquote>In practice, the proposed amendments to carer&rsquo;s payments will allow decision-makers to adopt a presumptive position; that is, it will be presumed that a person is ineligible for a payment, &ldquo;unless&rdquo; it can be proven otherwise.  This is an unacceptable shift in the burden of proof that falls to a prospective claimant; it is negative law-making.  Referring to the existing definition, the conditions for receipt of the relevant payments are clear, a person must need full-time care and the applicant must prove this need exists.  When determining a person&rsquo;s eligibility decision-makers must make a reasoned finding from a position of neutrality and objectivity.  The amendments if passed will have the effect of placing a greater burden of proof on the applicant, as the decision-maker will be considering the evidence from the perspective that the applicant is ineligible in the first instance.<br \/><br \/>We are in no doubt that this will have the effect of increasing the number of legitimate claims that are rejected, and this will in turn lead to a corresponding increase in the number of appeals that will be submitted to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  Notably, according to the Social Welfare Appeals Office report 2013, an average of 58% of those appealing decisions in respect of carers payments were successful.  Lengthy appeal processing time for carer&rsquo;s allowance, benefit and respite care grant currently stand at 22.6, 20.1 and 19.1 weeks respectively as of January 2015.  The proposed amendment could increase the rate of appeal and cause further delays in processing appeals also resulting in undue hardship and distress for claimants who are entitled to these payments.<br \/><br \/>We recommend that section 3 ... is deleted as it does not present as having a purpose other than to make it more difficult for carers to access income supports since it does not alter the actual conditions for eligibility other than introducing a presumption that claimants are ineligible unless they can prove otherwise.  If passed, prospective claimants will be presumed to be ineligible for a payment unless they can prove otherwise.  This constitutes an unacceptable shift in the burden of proof placed on an applicant.<\/blockquote>We should not be changing legislation unless there is a purpose to doing so.

The figures do not bear out Deputy O&rsquo;Dea&rsquo;s assertion the Department is operating the scheme in a different fashion.<\/p>  <p>  There appears to be a misconception that section 4 is in some way shifting the burden of proof from the Department to the claimant and that a negative presumption is being introduced that a person is not entitled to the allowance.  I am aware that Deputy O&rsquo;Dea made such a comment on Committee Stage and FLAC has also stated this.  There is no such negative presumption being introduced.  It is always the case that the onus is on the claimant, whether for carer&rsquo;s allowance or any other social welfare payment, to provide the necessary information in support of his or her application to prove eligibility.  There is no change in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O&rsquo;Dea has also argued that he not seen the word &ldquo;unless&rdquo; used in such legislative measures.  The use of the unless clause is already found throughout the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 such as in sections 40, 44 and 45 for illness benefit, sections 62 and 67 for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, section 141 for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and section 128 for widow&rsquo;s pension.<\/p>  <p>  Deciding officers make no presumption as to the eligibility or otherwise of any claimant for any scheme.  Each claim is made on merit and the information available to the deciding officer and in accordance with the statutory conditions for eligibility set out in the relevant legislation.  The current legislative provision for the carer&rsquo;s scheme states a relevant person shall be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention where he or she requires continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions or continual supervision in order to avoid danger to himself or herself.  The legal advice I have received indicates that this provision could be read as meaning a relevant person, as defined under section 179(4) of the principal Act, could be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention in other circumstances.  In other words, the current definition is not an exhaustive one and, in essence, it is ambiguous.<\/p>  <p>  For the avoidance of doubt, section 4 of Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015 provides that a person will only be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention of the purpose of the carer&rsquo;s scheme where he or she requires continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions or continual supervision in order to avoid danger to himself or herself.  In other words, the person will not be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention unless he or she satisfies those conditions.<\/p>  <p>  These changes bring the legislation into line with how these schemes are actually operating since their inception.

I did not say that.  I said I am aware it appears in various aspects of social welfare legislation but I also said it was new in respect of applying for carer's allowance.  I said it is a reversal of the words of the 2005 Act which cover carer's allowance.<\/p>  <p>  We can argue about numbers and the numbers qualifying have increased.  The number of people qualifying for carer's allowance may have increased but the obstacles they must undergo to get it have also increased quite appreciably.  It is a pretty devastating indictment of the system that more than 50% of people who were initially refused carer's allowance, in the main because they were deemed to be medically ineligible, ultimately qualify when they go through either a review or the appeals process.  That takes months and sometimes up to a year and a half.  I have known cases that took two years from beginning to end.  That means that people who were entitled to this State benefit under the laws of the State were messed around and delayed for up to two years before they got their benefit.  This is a travesty in respect of some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in this country.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State says there is no change in the legislation even though the legislation we are debating today differs from the initial qualifying legislation.  The Minister says this makes no difference.  The 2005 Act sets out when a person is entitled to carer's allowance.  This legislation is saying they are not entitled to carer's allowance unless certain conditions are met.  Any lawyer from one end of the country to the other will readily conclude that this is a very definitive shift in the burden of proof.  It places the burden of proof firmly on the shoulders of the applicant.  FLAC has indicated that and its views have been set out in this House.  FLAC did not give that opinion lightly.  It has access to the best legal advice possible in this area.  I have the greatest respect for officials in the Department but if it comes to a legal dispute and the officials are on one side and FLAC is on the other, I know which side I would be on.<\/p>  <p>  If, as the Minister of State says, this makes no change, why write it in?  What are we doing?  We ask questions every day and we will be asking them shortly about promised legislation that has yet to appear.  What are we doing putting clauses in legislation that are not needed and that by the Government's own admission make no difference?  This can only tighten up the provisions relating to carer's allowance.  We should remember that this is a means-tested payment.

We have all seen, in practice, what is going on.  The Government needs to get its head around what is going on and the actual intention of this legislation.  When one looks at this issue in the round one begins to wonder if the thought process behind this Bill is to shave a particular budget to cover the cost of the back-to-work family dividend.  Whether or not this is the overall thinking behind this Bill, people who are vulnerable and disabled, who are entitled to care or support, are being refused it because of the default position of &quot;if we can refuse them, we will refuse them.&quot;  The people in FLAC are very reasonable.  Under the principal Act, the term &quot;relevant people&quot; is defined as follows:<blockquote>(4) For the purposes of <i>subsection (1)<\/i>, a relevant person shall be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention where&mdash; <br \/><br \/>(<i>a<\/i>) the person has such a disability that he or she requires from another person&mdash; (i) continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions, or <br \/><br \/>(ii) continual supervision in order to avoid danger to himself or herself, (<i>b<\/i>) the person has such a disability that he or she is likely to require full-time care and attention for at least 12 consecutive months, and <br \/><br \/>(<i>c<\/i>) the nature and extent of the person&rsquo;s disability has been certified in the prescribed manner by a registered medical practitioner.<\/blockquote>That is positive.  To get support a person needs only to meet those criteria and the medical practitioner's certification of eligibility is taken as fact.  However, this legislation as drafted seeks to tighten up this provision in line with the practice over the past few years of deciding officers second-guessing doctors.  Unqualified, non-medical people are second-guessing the diagnoses of general practitioners and medical professionals in order to deny people supports to which they are entitled.  <\/p><p>Interestingly, our amendments, which seek to provide that a general practitioner's diagnosis be accepted, have been ruled out of order.  They were also ruled out of order on Committee Stage.  When we asked on Committee Stage why they had been ruled out of order we were told it was because they would result in a charge on the Exchequer.  What does this mean?  It means that budgetary constraints are overriding medical diagnoses.  That is clearly apparent.  The fear of the Department is that if the word of GPs in regard to whether a person needs care or support is accepted this will impact on its budget.  This is not the basis on which care and supports should be provided.  It should be the case that where a doctor certifies that a person requires care or support that support is provided.  This legislation provides that somebody else, who is not a doctor or a qualified professional, can disagree with the GP and not provide the support.  Applications are being delayed in the hope that some of the applicants will go away out of frustration, which many of them do.  This is what this legislation seeks to do.  There is no doubt about that.  <\/p><p>I propose to press this amendment because too many people are suffering unnecessarily as a result of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100017#P00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"vote","time":1427885700,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 37; N\u00edl, 62.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett and Willie O'Dea; N\u00edl, Deputies Emmet Stagg and Paul Kehoe.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100018#Q00100","aye":["1066","1003","1190","1071","1193","1057","1083","1192","1107","1022","1047","1050","1108","960","1049","983","1040","962","999","1008","1017","1090","993","981","992","1183","1177","1054","1028","1059","1001","953","1178","970","1080","1065","956"],"nay":["1062","974","1079","989","1029","1030","1042","975","1031","1041","1087","1099","1006","991","986","994","1046","968","1075","1007","1011","1103","957","1078","1014","1085","951","1076","1089","973","1033","1012","1098","1072","1021","1110","1053","982","996","1180","1194","1000","997","1082","977","1038","1056","1045","1058","971","1061","1063","964","947","952","1074","1013","961","978","1010","1095","1024"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427885700,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Leaders' Questions","time":1427886000,"counter":159,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100019#R00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1427886000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Tomorrow morning thousands of workers from Dunnes Stores will go on strike across the country.  They do not want to do this but they are being forced.  This reflects a broader casualisation of the workforce, a regressive trend towards lower pay and less security of hours.  The strike tomorrow is essentially about low-hour contracts that have become the norm in certain sectors of the economy.  It is about a simple abuse of power that a major employer is exercising over thousands of employees.  I do not say that lightly.<\/p>  <p>  Some 76% of the company's workforce is now working so-called part-time flexible hours.  Some 70% of those in that workforce are women.  The employees face uncertainty each week.  They experience a fundamental lack of security and cannot plan their lives.  There is no decency at the heart of the relationship between this employer and the workers.<\/p>  <p>  I have met some of the workers.  What was most disquieting was their fear that they could be punished by their employer simply for meeting me.  That was said.  It is like going back to the 19th century.  We are to celebrate the centenary of the Rising next year.  The Government's programme in this regard was launched yesterday.  I asked myself the basic question as to whether employee rights are going backwards in certain sectors.  Employees cannot obtain mortgages and cannot even get car loans.  Worst of all, the system is used to control workers.  They are threatened with a reduction in hours if they are not on-side and do not play ball.  Sick pay is orchestrated and is almost non-existent.  There is limited holiday pay, and so on.<\/p>  <p>  All the workers are seeking are banded-hour contracts, which Marks &amp;amp; Spencer, Tesco, SuperValu and Penneys have all given.  It is very regrettable and shameful that an Irish employer does not see fit to give them.<\/p>  <p>  Most people in this House, including me, support basic decency.  I have a basic question for the Taoiseach: does he support the Dunnes Stores workers who are going on strike tomorrow?  I ask him to say he does and to articulate clearly a loud message that should be articulated by everybody in this House: we will not tolerate this abuse of power over employees.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach introduce a fair working hours Act to stop this abuse of workers?  The existing legislative safeguards are no longer adequate to stop what is going on.  It must stop, and the message must be sent out that if the current practices continue there will be legislative response to ensure they do not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100019#R00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1427886000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>On the occasion of the launch by the Government of the Low Pay Commission, which is being handled by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, its Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, and specifically the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, I had a brief meeting with the representative from Mandate Trade Union, who explained to me the position of the workers in Dunnes Stores.  I support certainty and the right of people to know from their employer what hours they are expected to work each week, in so far as that is possible.  Deputy Martin is aware that the Low Pay Commission has already started its process of meetings.  It will report in July and the Government will act in response to that.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, is dealing with the question of zero-our contracts.  Deputy Martin mentioned a fair working hours Act.  I will wait to see the response and proposals of the Minister of State.  It is not for me, in the position I occupy, to say whether the strike should take place.  This is not the first time these kinds of circumstances have arisen.  As the Deputy pointed out, other stores have had to deal with this matter.  They dealt with it clearly in the interest of their workers, with a view to their having clarity and confidence in respect of their working futures.  I am clear that the workers in Dunnes Stores deserve no less.  They need to be told by their employers what the week and month ahead hold and, in so far as possible, what the time ahead holds.  I hope the mechanisms that have been in place for quite some time apply here so people will not have to go on strike.  I hope the employers in this case can understand the consequences of not providing clarity to the thousands of loyal workers who provide services to those who shop in the stores daily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100019#R00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1427886000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>The reason I ask the Taoiseach to say he supports the Dunnes Stores workers unequivocally is because I genuinely believe a message must go out to the employer in this instance.  As a former Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I know all the usual processes and mechanisms.  Dunnes Stores has refused to engage with the Labour Relations Commission or Labour Court, or to adopt its recommendations.  It has refused flatly to engage with the workforce representatives, as recommended by the Labour Court.  There comes a time when everybody should stand up for basic decency in terms of that relationship.  The experience of the workers demonstrates excessive abuse of power over the workforce.  As legislators, we cannot stand over what is going on.  Everybody has been rostered for Thursday, deliberately.  Even those who might have hospital appointments have been rostered, deliberately, to put them behind the eight ball, so to speak, or put them under pressure such that if they do not turn up there may be consequences for them.  That is what is being said on the ground to the workers.  It is intolerable and unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  With the greatest of respect to the Low Pay Commission, I do not believe it will deal with this.  I have not read any proposals from the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, that will apply to this issue right now.  The most powerful message that could go out would be a message from the Taoiseach stating he supports the Dunnes Stores workers and that the management should do what others have done, that is, apply the very basics.  The requests were quite minimal.  No one is looking for an earth-shattering change, just very basic rules so workers can at least plan their lives with some degree of dignity and decency.  There is an absence of dignity and decency at the heart of how Dunnes Stores is treating its workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100019#R00400","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1427886000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Let me be clear.

I hope the strike does not go ahead.  I support the workers in their right to have clarity about their working lives.  Therefore, the message to the employers is that this can be sorted out.

They were introduced to the Members of the Oireachtas by Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who has first-hand knowledge of this ailment due to a family connection.  The speakers for this sector included a person who has been afflicted with Alzheimer's disease and is going through the ordeal while trying to live as fully as possible, and a carer who is looking after his mother on a full-time basis.  A contribution was also made by a GP with expert knowledge of the medical condition.<\/p>  <p>  The Alzheimer's group is promoting the national dementia strategy, which was launched by the Government in December.  This is aimed at meeting the needs of the approximately 48,000 people who are currently living with dementia.  A rapidly growing number are afflicted by this debilitating disease and this will continue into the future.  The national strategy is a first step, but real progress will require strategic financial investment, naturally, and a new social and community approach to dementia.  The priority actions in the strategy have the potential, if implemented, to significantly improve the rates of diagnosis of the early stages, to improve people's journey through life and also to improve the health and social care system for these people.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach prioritise the national dementia strategy, as diagnosis and referral to the appropriate services need to be vastly improved?  Will he provide adequate home care packages for the many thousands of people who urgently require these to enable them to live in their communities?

Everybody in the House knows families or people whose loved ones or family members are so afflicted, and I know many myself.<\/p>  <p>  We waited ten years for a strategy on dementia to be produced.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, brought that forward after extensive consultation and published it before Christmas, and she also put together both an oversight committee and an implementation group to see that it happens.  One of the action groups, Genio, has a number of projects in locations around the country, one of them here in Dublin.  Atlantic Philanthropies was so taken by the quality of the strategy produced by the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, that it has contributed very substantially to this.  Between it and the State, I believe over &euro;27 million is being allocated for services and support for people who suffer from dementia in all its forms.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter of concern to families.  The vocabulary changes automatically once a diagnosis is made but, in so far as the Government is concerned, we recognise this is an issue and the Minister of State has produced the strategy after the country had waited ten years for it.

We are now focused on implementing that strategy.  Obviously, in respect of the budget for 2016, as the figures come in for the improving economy, this is a matter of social importance and personal importance.

The purpose of the legislation is to amend section 26 of the Water Services Act 2013.  People will be aware of controversy in recent days when local authorities informed their tenants and the public that they had submitted their tenants' details directly to Irish Water.  Their action was provided for in section 26 of the Water Services Act 2013, and my argument is not with the local authorities, who were complying with their legal responsibilities under the Act.  I have no quibble with the Data Protection Commissioner, who does not have much of a role in this issue.  While the Data Protection Commissioner must be consulted, the commissioner must accept what is in the legislation.  However, the legislation is unfair and bad and the only way to deal with it is to amend it.  That is why I have brought forward the Bill to amend the Water Services Act 2013.<\/p><p>The Bill is couched in technical terms and refers to a &quot;subsidiary&quot;, which means Irish Water, which is a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is in the legislation.  We are asking that, in future, transfers of information about tenants to Irish Water under section 26 happen only with the written consent of the person involved and any information given to date without such consent be destroyed, subject to the verification of the Data Protection Commissioner.  We had such a situation last year when Irish Water sought PPS numbers.  Fortunately, light prevailed and people felt it was not right to give PPS numbers to what was allegedly an independent, commercial semi-State organisation.  Subsequently, a programme was put in place to delete the information Irish Water had received on individuals, subject to oversight by the Data Protection Commissioner.  This process has not been completed, but should be, and the same should happen with the information local authorities have already handed over.<\/p><p>Given that there is no reason to believe, or evidence to suggest, that the level of registration by local authority tenants is any higher or lower than the rest of the community, it was unfair to single out this group.  Irish Water has confirmed that it had most of the information regarding people whose details it received from local authorities.  As the Taoiseach keeps saying, 1.2 million people have registered with Irish Water.  I registered for the conservation grant.  Does this mean I consent to pay my bill?  Nobody should confuse the two issues.  Given that most of those people had registered for the conservation grant and submitted their details, there was no reason for the local authorities to hand over the details to Irish Water.<\/p><p>Section 26 of the Water Services Act 2013 also gives Irish Water authority to seek information from the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA, the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister for Social Protection and any other person the Minister prescribes as a designated person.  We all know this will include the voluntary and social housing agencies, and it could include many more.  There is power in the legislation to allow Irish Water to obtain information from the Department of Social Protection such as people's payments, the number of children in the house, their dates of birth and PPS numbers.  Irish Water will be able to obtain information from the Revenue Commissioners such as whether a person is tax compliant, and maybe a person will have to have a tax clearance certificate before receiving his or her water conservation grant.  Although we have not heard it yet, I know how the system operates and the Government will put in this little twist.  Revenue will probably have to approve the issue of the conservation grants.<\/p><p>Irish Water should not receive preferential treatment as a semi-State company.  Bus &Eacute;ireann, the ESB and CIE would not be entitled to this information.  They are bona fide commercial semi-State bodies and if Irish Water is one of them, it should not receive this information.  The fact we have provided for this proves that Irish Water is not a commercial, stand-alone semi-State organisation that can stand on its own without all the legal infrastructure that would not be available to back up a normal semi-State company.  It is further proof of the unsustainability and fiasco that is Irish Water.  I ask that the Bill be given a reading today in order that it can proceed through the Oireachtas in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100024#W01900","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1427889000,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100024#W02000","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1427889000,"counter":310,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100024#W02100","speaker":"975"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427889000,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1427889000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100024#W02300","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1427889000,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100024#W02400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427889000,"counter":314,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"EU Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters: Motion","time":1427889000,"counter":315,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100024#W02600"},{"type":"speech","time":1427889000,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion under Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to take part in the adoption and application of the following proposed measure:Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing certain acts in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters,a copy of which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 23rd December, 2014.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100024#W02700","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427889000,"counter":317,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427889000,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 2.10 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1427889600,"counter":319,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100025#Y00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1427889600,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A, and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Michael McCarthy - progress on the Autism Bill 2012; (2) Deputies Catherine Byrne, Eric Byrne and Joan Collins - the decision by Pobal to cease funding for two VEC sports centres in Inchicore and Crumlin; (3) Deputy Jack Wall - the provision of a ketogenic diet for a 12 year old boy in need of such treatment; (4) Deputy Anthony Lawlor - the availability of regorafenib through the HSE for the treatment of cancer patients; (5) Deputy Lucinda Creighton - the need to secure the future of the school completion programme and oversee its expansion by ring-fencing funding for the years to come; (6) Deputy Brendan Griffin - the need to upgrade the N22 Kerry-Cork road; (7) Deputy Brian Stanley - staffing levels in accident and emergency units and staffing in maternity units, particularly in Portlaoise hospital; (8) Deputy Pearse Doherty - the need for an amendment to the Health Services (Amendment) Regulations 1971 to facilitate the rewording of the term \"mental handicap\"; (9) Deputy Dan Neville - the need for regulation of counselling and psychotherapy; (10) Deputy Joe Costello - the awarding of share rights in Aer Lingus to a departing senior official in the company; (11) Deputy Paul J.

A condition of their introduction was that they had to open their doors in the evening for community use, particularly for football and dancing clubs, martial arts, arts and crafts and active retirement groups.  This meant that people in the community who could not avail of the facilities during the daytime found that these centres could be part and parcel of what they did in the evening, and they have become a great asset to community groups.  People can stay local and get involved in activities locally without having to journey elsewhere to participate.<\/p><p>Over the past few weeks, Pobal has withdrawn funding from these centres, which means they will only be able to open between 9.30 a.m. and 4 p.m. to facilitate the students in the colleges in Inchicore and Crumlin.  While that is welcome, a commitment was given when these sports halls were opened that people in the community would have access to them in the evenings, and this change is hugely disappointing.  I requested confirmation of the commitment to community access from the Minister of State in writing and I received a letter from him yesterday.  I understand that the Department felt the proposal made by the groups running the centres was not adequate and did not contain sufficient detail.  All is not lost; there is a window of opportunity.  The Minister of State stated in his letter:<blockquote>I want to assure you that the Department is committed to securing the community use of these facilities and will continue to work with the CDETB to enable this outcome.  The contract with the CDETB was extended to the end of June [I welcome that], which will enable work to continue with the ETB to address matters concerning the Department, with the aim of allowing longer terms of operation of the contract and to ensure viability for the services to continue in the community.<\/blockquote>I welcome the final line in the letter, which is important.

Is this money from the European Social Fund, which finds its way into the system where Pobal intervenes?  What is the difficulty being experienced?  Public meetings have been demanded.  I have received text messages from roller skaters who are worried that they will be unable to roller skate any more, while other community groups are being called to meetings by councillors from DCC.

This matter involves substantial funding.  A sum of &euro;600,000 will be paid over three years.  In many ways, Pobal is a gatekeeper, and we have to make sure this money is spent correctly.  The provision of such funding over a three-year contract is a fantastic asset to local communities.  This is the first time this contract has come up for renewal, while approximately 140 contracts come up for renewal on a regular basis.  Pobal, therefore, acts as the gatekeeper to make sure the criteria attaching to the funding are met.  There will be no reduction in funding.  The money is available and we want to spend it, but we want to make sure that happens in the best interest of the communities and, therefore, the criteria must be met.  For example, there must be transparency in how the money is spent and in respect of community access to the facilities, which are jointly managed by DCC and the ETB.<\/p>  <p>  The four of us were members of Dublin City Council and I worked with Deputies Eric Byrne and Catherine Byrne on the provision of both these centres, because I was chairman of the VEC when these developments were proposed.

It is &euro;650,000.<\/p>  <p>  I am a little cautious about streamlining.  It is the flexibility of the community service programme that makes it work well.  There is flexibility in the services where numbers of groups come together but there is one overall manager.  In this case, the CDETB has taken on the administration of it.  The way this is managed varies across the country.  Sometimes when one streamlines something, one loses the benefit.  There is often one community group that manages it for five or six other groups, like the hub of a wheel.  There is a flexibility within the service.

Deputy Healy-Rae tabled his topical debate at the same time as me and he is also very anxious about it.<\/p>  <p>  I have two documents in my hand.  One is the policy of the Department of Social Protection regarding post offices.  It wants the majority of its transactions, bar 3%, done by electronic payment by 2015.  The Taoiseach told Deputy Fleming and myself recently that this is not happening at all.  He said so many post offices were closed under Fianna F&aacute;il, while only 20 closed on his watch.  That is not the real issue.  The real issue is that the Department wants to have most of its business done by electronic means by 2015.  That is only a few people out in the sticks who do not have broadband or anything else.  There is a cat-and-mouse game going on here.  I want the Minister of State to be honest and tell us what he is going to do about it.<\/p>  <p>  We have nothing without post offices in rural Ireland.  They are the last bastion.  We have already lost the Garda stations and schools, and the post offices are vital.  The post offices could do business through e-transactions if someone funded them.  They have submitted proposals to the Department to be funded to do e-transactions.  They could replace banks and other services that have been taken away from rural Ireland.  It could do a great deal for tourism and the development of the rural economy.  The former Minister, Mary Hanafin, in fairness to her, in the last Fianna F&aacute;il Government ring-fenced social welfare payments.  If this had not happened, the post offices would have been closed long ago.  There would have been mass closures.  The Taoiseach can play games all he likes but he is not telling the truth.  He is telling the truth when he says that only 20 have closed, but if this policy is accepted, the game is over for post offices in rural Ireland.  We want to get the ball on the pitch here.

This time last year, before the local elections, the then Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, made an announcement that there was a whole-of-government approach to the future of post offices.  In February this year, some nine or ten months later, it was announced there would be a review.  What was said previously was only to get the Government over the local and European elections.<\/p>  <p>  Whatever the election cycle, a letter has been issued from the Department of Social Protection to pensioners advising them or encouraging those who have been receiving payments for a long number of years to have their money paid by direct debit into the bank rather than through the post office.  This is in direct contradiction of what the Taoiseach stated in the D&aacute;il, what the Government has said and what the Minister has said to me on numerous occasions in the House.  How come a Department sanctioned this letter, which is in total contradiction of what has been said by Ministers and the Taoiseach in the House?  If the Department continues to pursue this policy, it will mean all the post offices in the country will close.  The Department should examine how An Post needs to change to ensure the transaction can take place in post offices in the same way as it can in banks.  It should be borne in mind that if the Minister for Social Protection continues to send letters to social welfare recipients encouraging them to use banks, it will be the end of the post office network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100027#AA00100","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speech","time":1427890800,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I have been provided with a script but I will not use it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100027#AA00200","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1427890800,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100027#AA00300","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1427890800,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I was as surprised as the Deputies to see copies of the letter.

Progress has been made and good work has been done by the group.  There is good, open and honest conversation.  I cannot say what the outcomes will be at this early stage because a report will issue shortly on the actions of the group.

It is important to point out that while the script states this was a trial, as far as I am concerned every Department must be on the same wavelength as the interdepartmental decision to ensure the long-term sustainability and viability of post offices.  As I stated several weeks ago, and Deputy Moynihan was in the Chamber when I did so, Friday at the post office on Tory Island is the only day when people meet, and the post office in any rural area provides an opportunity for people to meet.  The Government is working towards this.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputies have raised important issues.  I have taken this matter seriously.  It has been raised at the working group and is being taken seriously at that level.

Perhaps banking in post offices is an option.  We can be critical of what happened with these letters, but they did not suggest that people change from post offices.  It was not mandatory or prescriptive, but it is information in black and white and I accept this.  It is important the issue has been raised at this juncture with regard to the working group.

The Health Act 1970 acknowledges the moral imperative of the health services to make arrangements for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people suffering from prescribed diseases and disabilities of a long-term nature, in effect establishing the HSE administered long-term illness scheme.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that this scheme is of monumental benefit to the thousands of people who depend on it to cover the costs, which would otherwise be onerous, associated with treating their individual medical conditions.  However, one aspect of the terminology used in the existing legislation that specifies the qualifying conditions for accession to the long-term illness scheme is contentious, perturbing and for many people stigmatic.  The legislation in question is the Health Services (Amendment) Regulations 1971, which prescribe diseases and conditions for the purposes of section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970.  The regulations list serious and often life-limiting conditions, including phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus; haemophilia and cerebral palsy.<\/p> <p> One condition stipulated in the regulations, but which I have yet to mention, stands out for many people.  Under the regulations, \"mental handicap\" is the tag used to encapsulate conditions such as Down's syndrome and global developmental delay.  This archaic, offensive and hurtful label has caused untold emotional suffering to those affected by these conditions and their families for many years.  It is a tag that has no place in the world in which we now live.  I raised this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, earlier this month.  I asked her in a parliamentary question whether her attention had been drawn to the offensive nature of this terminology and whether had she any plans to review and amend the secondary legislation by which this term is shamefully legitimised.  Even though I comprehensively illustrated the derogatory and insidious nature of the label, together with the negative connotations with which it has become associated, she unfortunately responded by telling me she had no plans to amend the terminology used to denote the conditions covered by the long-term illness scheme.<\/p> <p> As I was not satisfied with the response I received, I chose to highlight this issue again by asking a question that was referred to the HSE for direct response.  In its reply, the HSE professed that with regards to the long-term illness scheme, it no longer employs the term \"mental handicap\", which dates back to the 1970s.  It said that it opts to use what it described as \"the correct term\" of \"intellectual disability\" instead.  The HSE also gave me a commitment that it would review the wording of the long-term illness scheme on its website to reflect this development.  I think we were all delighted to hear of the HSE's decision to drop a label which can only be described as a sordid and unmissed relic of the past.  While the simple and sensible action taken by the HSE might involve no more than the rewording of existing HSE documents, the importance and significance of this move should not be overlooked.  It was a momentous victory for disability rights advocates throughout Ireland, for those who rightly refuse to be ill-defined by their disabilities and for those who dedicate their lives to challenging the perceptions and preconceived judgments of others regarding intellectual disability.<\/p> <p> I call on the Minister to amend the Health Services (Amendment) Regulations 1971 so that this obsolete, draconian and deeply insensitive term can finally be removed from Irish statutes once and for all.  This would end the shameful practices of the past, which merely served to stigmatise and marginalise further those who suffer from intellectual disabilities.  It would afford them the fairness, dignity and respect they thoroughly deserve.  These are our children, friends and loved ones.  We should cherish them equally and we should amend the regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100027#AA02100","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427891400,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I have continually spoken about the use of inappropriate language and highlighted the need to change our language when the circumstances are correct.  I will continue to do so long after my career in politics ends.  Therefore, I agree with everything the Deputy has said.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Services (Amendment) Regulations 1971 use the term \"mental handicap\".  This old-fashioned term is no longer in general usage.  It is not an appropriate term to be used nowadays as it offends many people.  The contemporary term used in this country now, including by the Department of Health and the HSE, is \"intellectual disability\".  As the Deputy has rightly said, this term is far more significant than anything that he and I, and maybe others in this House, might find when we look through Acts that were commenced over 30 years ago.  Indeed, he will appreciate that these regulations were made over four decades ago - in September 1971 - by the then Minister for Health, Erskine Childers, who later became President of Ireland.  While it might seem baffling now, it appears that the use of the term \"mental handicap\" was considered appropriate at that time.  I understand that the representative body, Inclusion Ireland, used to be named the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland.  I recall the change of name, which happened relatively recently.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe a person like Erskine Childers would have meant to cause any offence in the making of regulations in 1971, which is a long time ago.  Some Deputies in this House were not even born at that stage.  With the passage of years, the language used from previous times can appear offensive and inappropriate, even if it was not so in those days.  As I have said, \"intellectual disability\" is the commonly used term in this country now.  I agree with the Deputy's view on the term \"mental handicap\", which is completely old-fashioned and offends many people, especially self-advocates.  As the Deputy may be aware, there are other terms used to describe \"intellectual disability\".  However, \"intellectual disability\" is the most commonly used term internationally and is widely used in medical and teaching circles in Ireland.  For example, there is a nursing degree in intellectual disability nursing.  There is also a National Institute for Intellectual Disability.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health used to have separate units for mental handicap and physical disabilities, but they were merged over ten years ago.  Now that the Department adopts a non-diagnosis-specific approach to disabilities, its policies apply to people with all disabilities.  It uses the definition of \"disability\" set out in the Disability Act 2005, which is a far more relevant Act than the 1970 Act.  The 2005 Act describes disability in terms of its effects on the individual, rather than in terms of particular types of disability.  The national disability strategy and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities take the same approach.<\/p>  <p>  I agree that the terminology used in the 1971 regulations is old-fashioned and offends many people.  I think it would be best for acceptable contemporary terminology to be substituted for old-fashioned language when legislation is being revised.  I am about to run out of time.  We might be able to deal with this matter further in the supplementary part of this debate.  I remind the Deputy that a far more impactful Bill, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013, will come before an Oireachtas committee in May.  If I were asked to prioritise legislation, I would say that the Bill in question will have a far more profound effect on our lives as we age.  I refer to the lives of those who were born with a disability and those who will acquire a disability during our lifetimes.  The Bill in question will change fundamentally how we think and amend all the relevant legislation that has gone before it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100028#BB00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1427891400,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I am well aware of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 and the delays with it.

I would say out of respect that I know the Minister of State did not mean that.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013 will have major effects.  There are family members out there who have told me they were in tears as they filled in the form for long-term illness care because they had to label their child with \"mental handicap\".  Other people told me they decided not to avail of the scheme because they refused to have their child labelled with \"mental handicap\".<\/p>  <p>  This is not the Ireland of 1971; it is the Ireland of today.  The Minister of State's remarks suggested that the use of this term was confined to the time of Erskine Childers.  If she visits the HSE website today, she will see the list of conditions that have to be fulfilled by people in order to qualify for the long-term illness scheme.  Those conditions include \"mental handicap\".

People deemed eligible for civil legal aid have a waiting time for a full appointment with a solicitor of between six and 18 months.  In my experience of people attending my constituency office, many women experiencing domestic violence are those seeking legal aid.  For a person charged under criminal legislation, all he or she has to prove to receive legal aid is that they qualify financially.  However, for many women and children suffering physical and emotional abuse, they do not get this Rolls Royce treatment.<\/p><p>Both civil and criminal legal aid are provided by the State.  This should be with a level of equality and fairness across the board.  The High Court determined several years ago that people should not wait longer than three months.  Unfortunately, this is now got around by the Legal Aid Board, itself under workload pressure, by offering what is known as a triage appointment.  This is a preliminary meeting best described as an introductory meeting.  It does not assist the applicant for legal aid in any way.  It is merely a lip-service appointment.  The delays in terms of getting legal representation will still be the same at between six and 18 months.  Some women seeking legal aid are dismissed by being told to just get a barring order.  Not everybody is in a position to bring an application for a barring order.  The reasons for this differ from social or family pressures, as well as not actually being able to face having their spouse barred and issues around children being aware of what is going on.  The only option for people living in the misery of marriage break-up who cannot afford to deal with matters privately is to seek representation from the legal aid board.<\/p><p>To put the delays in context, a person may wait for up to 18 months just for a first appointment.  If, following on from that, a legal process has to be started, that will take a further year to 18 months.  During that time, women are in many cases condemned to live under the one roof while domestic violence is ongoing.  It can be very frustrating and even a dangerous time as relationships continue to deteriorate.  In many cases, women are seeking legal aid as they are in an abusive and violent relationship.<\/p><p>The delays in the District Court in Dolphin House are particularly bad.

I am definitely aware of cases where there is undue delay in the provision of legal services to victims of domestic violence by the Legal Aid Board.  I must emphasise the issue of domestic violence.  SAFE Ireland published a report on Monday that stated that the legal system in Ireland often regards domestic violence as a nuisance rather than a crime.  If a criminal turns up at court, they will immediately have access to a junior or senior counsel if they do not have the ability to pay.  I can assure the Minister of State that many women who have presented to me in my constituency office have not received immediate legal aid or junior or senior counsel.  In many cases, rape, assault and battery within a relationship are not being treated as criminal offences.  Even when the garda&iacute; call to some homes where domestic violence has taken place, it is dismissed and rubbished and the woman is told to get over it or that it is not that bad.<\/p>  <p>  I urge the Minister of State to look at the report and recommendations of SAFE Ireland.  I can assure him that I have met mothers who have been beaten and raped.  I know one woman who was slashed across her face, and received something like 50 to 60 stitches, in front of her young son.  This is not acceptable.  It is clear that not only do delays need to be addressed, the system needs to offer real support to women suffering domestic violence.  The CEO of SAFE Ireland, Sharon O' Halloran, said that women are being worn down by the system rather than supported by it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100030#DD00200","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1427892600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I again thank the Deputy for raising this incredibly important matter.

Following approval of the general scheme by the Government, it will be forwarded to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence for pre-legislative scrutiny.

When this issue was raised by the National Women's Council of Ireland at a conference in 2012, female members of the Labour Party called on the Council not to oppose the cuts on the basis that the Minister would keep her word and they would not be implemented in 2015 if affordable child care provision had not been put in place by then.<\/p><p>It is outrageous that the Minister is proceeding with this.<\/p> <p> We know that 63% of lone parents live in deprivation, we know we have the highest child care costs in Europe, and we are still proceeding with this.

Almost 53% of lone parents are in the workplace and these are the people affected by these cuts.<\/p> <p> I said this already and it should go on the record again.  The Minister absolutely agreed with the figures provided by SPARC, the lone parents group, that there would be a 20% loss in earnings with this, even with the one-parent family payment.  The Government is taking money out of their pockets while at the same time giving about &euro;30 back to them, and that will be gone in about two years' time.<\/p> <p> The Government should hold its head in shame.

Like Deputy Joan Collins, I was tempted to vote against the Bill, but because of the improvements contained therein, I do not propose to vote against it.  However, I deeply regret the Government's decision to proceed with the change in the one-parent family payment, despite promises to the contrary by the Minister.  The reason for the change advanced by the Government is to incentivise lone parents to go out to work.  This must be the first time in the history of the universe when people were supposed to be incentivised by being made worse off.<\/p><p>A lone parent who is not working and does not want to, or perhaps cannot, engage with the workplace, for whatever reason, is not affected by this legislation.  It is only working parents who will be adversely affected and they will be pretty dramatically affected.  The figures produced by SPARC that incorporate the improvements brought about by the family dividend clearly show that those people, who are already in very low-income occupations and who are scraping from one end of the week to the other to survive, will lose a substantial chunk of their income.<\/p><p>For example, yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>contained a feature about a woman.  She allowed her photograph to be taken, and her name and address to be used.  She is a lone parent working part time and getting &euro;94 per week.  Because she has a child who will be over seven on the relevant date in May, with that &euro;94 over five days, she will not be entitled to jobseeker's allowance and therefore she will have to give up her job.  Obviously she cannot live on &euro;94 per week, albeit she is getting &euro;50 a week in maintenance from her husband.  She will have to give up her job.  The net result will be that whereas her full income at present is &euro;361 a week, that will drop to &euro;267 per week next month because of the changes the Government has introduced.  That is a quarter of her income.  There are people in this House who might feel it if they lost a quarter of their income, but for someone on &euro;361 a week to lose a quarter of her income is pretty devastating.<\/p><p>I spoke to two single parents who came to see me over the weekend.  I know both their families.  They are both working part-time and they will both lose 20% to 25% of their income in May directly as a result the changes.  While it is all very well for the Department of Social Protection to suggest they get more hours and qualify for family income supplement, in the real world sometimes these people cannot get more hours.  A person cannot demand more hours from an employer.  In many cases they would not be able to do more hours because of their child-minding responsibilities.<\/p><p>What is happening to lone working parents is a travesty and is a denial of justice.  The T&aacute;naiste gave a very firm commitment on the floor of this House that that change would not be triggered until we had a Scandinavian-type system of child care.  As we clearly do not have that, the T&aacute;naiste is going back on a promise she made in good faith and which we certainly accepted in good faith here in the D&aacute;il.  That is very regrettable.  Even at this late stage I appeal to the Minister of State, who is a very sympathetic individual, understands these things and is dealing with these sorts of people as much as I am, to prevail on the T&aacute;naiste to postpone that change.  It is not too late.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100032#FF00200","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1427893500,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Like the other Deputies, I believe the Bill is in the main positive, but it represents a missed opportunity to address a problem that is now quantified regarding working single parents.  Some years ago when the announcement was made that changes were to come into effect as of July 2015, we did not have exact figures for how many people would be affected and to what degree.  Those who opposed it understood at the time the effects on working lone parents and those who were in education.  In particular we were not persuaded at the time by the Minister, who is still Minister but is now also T&aacute;naiste, when she promised that changes to the one-parent family payment would not proceed unless we had a Scandinavian model of child care.<\/p>  <p>  That was pie in the sky and is still pie in the sky because Ireland is recognised as having one of the highest, if not the highest, child care costs of any country in the world, which makes it difficult for anyone in work.  To date, with their one-parent family payment they have been able to subsidise going back to work and now in many instances they will be penalised.<\/p>  <p>  Those on this side of the House and certain Government backbenchers have raised with the Minister of State and the T&aacute;naiste the question of the effects on those in receipt of SUSI grants.  The answer we have been given to date is that there are ongoing negotiations and discussions between the two Departments.  Those discussions only seem to have been triggered since Christmas when the figures started to emerge.  However, they should have been triggered two years ago when this legislation was put forward first.  We still do not have a positive outcome on that.<\/p>  <p>  The only social welfare legislation on the schedule for this year is the next social welfare Bill which will come into being in October or November, which means there is a potential that a number of lone parents who are in education and in receipt of SUSI grants will be substantially affected.  It is not contained in this Bill; that is the problem.<\/p>  <p>  We have highlighted concerns over the Bill and the Minister of State has answered them.  In the main this is a positive Bill and is to be welcomed.  It is often very difficult to vote against a social welfare Bill which is not cutting people's payments.  All it is doing is tinkering around with a system and in some cases giving money.  In this case there is a dividend and that is welcome.  It is an approach that is to be welcomed in some ways because it is making work pay, but in other ways it should be addressing funding.<\/p>  <p>  I have another problem with social welfare legislation, which is not the fault of the Minister of State or his officials.  I can take all the time in the world to prepare amendments, whether they are positive or negative from a Government point of view, but I cannot put them forward and we cannot debate them on Report Stage or even on Committee Stage unless the Chair on Committee Stage allows us leniency and we have managed that.  It is difficult for us.  When the Minister of State reports back to the T&aacute;naiste, I ask him to reflect that the Convention on the Constitution made a proposal to address that aspect in the Constitution which prevents me and others in the House from putting together amendments that are likely to be a charge on the Exchequer or on the people.<\/p><p>Ultimately, I cannot force the Government to accept my amendments.  I can table all the amendments I want, be they good, bad or indifferent, but it is up to the Government to argue against them or, if they are off the wall, ridicule them.  However, if I table positive amendments, as I have done in the past, they should be taken on board or, at least, amended.  What is happening makes the Opposition's job of recommending changes difficult.  It probably makes the job of the Minister of State difficult because he does not get to answer the key concerns we raise unless the Chairman allows a loose debate on them on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> I will not oppose this legislation but I believe it is a missed opportunity.  I ask that the Minister for Social Protection come to the House at the earliest opportunity before July to explain what has been done to address the substantial shortfall for working parents who will be affected by the change to the one-parent family payment that comes into effect this year.  I refer in particular to those who are stuck working for five days per week but not working 19 hours, which would qualify them for family income supplement, for instance, and also to those in education who are affected by how the legislation is now framed.  It means they will have substantially less money.  The amount of money is substantial when one has very little.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100032#FF00300","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427894100,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I have certainly had to think long and hard about my attitude to the final vote on this Bill, and I had to consult colleagues.  This is because a trick is being played with this Bill.  The trick is to smuggle in a very regressive measure under the cover of one that is marginally progressive.  I find that sort of politics quite dishonest.  It is a way of trying to blackmail the Opposition into endorsing legislation that is regressive.<\/p>  <p>  Much of the debate on this Bill has focused, for important and entirely legitimate reasons, on the issue of lone parents and the impact of changes already made, but not dealt with in this legislation.  I am referring to the phasing out of the one-parent family payment for families when their children reach the age of seven.  That was a the regressive move.  As has been said, we were promised this would not be implemented until we had Scandinavian-style child care but we have not got that.  The Government has broken the promise.  Instead of giving what it promised, it has offered the sop of the back-to-work family dividend, essentially under pressure owing to agitation by lone parents, advocate groups such as SPARK and its supporters in this House.  In so far as the Government has been forced to introduce the dividend, lone parents who are not working will be able to move on to the transitional payment and, therefore, not lose out.  However, as has been pointed out at length, those who are working will lose out, even with the back-to-work family dividend.  That loss will become increasingly worse over a number of years.  On the other hand, it is better than nothing for those who will benefit from the concession the Government made under pressure.  While much of the debate has focused on that, what was smuggled in under the radar was not really spotted by me and most other Deputies until we read the detail of the legislation on Committee Stage.  We saw in various sections of the legislation that the Government is giving a little with one hand but taking away with the other.  The taking away is in the form of the tightening of the eligibility criteria for carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant.<\/p>  <p>  These issues are every bit as serious and important as those concerning lone parents.  This is a real sleight of hand by the Government.  We have debated this extensively through the amendments we tabled on Committee Stage, in addition to those we tabled on Report Stage this morning.  The Government has not given any justification for the changes included in this Bill in respect of the criteria, the definition of a \"relevant person\" who would be entitled to carer's benefit, or the criteria for eligibility in that regard.  We just got bluster.  The reason for this is to cover up the fact that the Minister of State, his officials and everybody knows that this is a tightening up.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said something to the effect that the previous legislation was ambiguous.  If I am correct, that was the justification.  The Minister of State said this Bill is doing away with ambiguity.  I would prefer the ambiguous version because it offers more latitude and support to the applicant for the carer's allowance, or carer support, than the tightened-up version.  The existing legislation states a relevant person shall be regarded as requiring full-time care where they meet the criteria.  This Bill states a relevant person \"shall not\" be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention unless certain criteria are met.  That is a clear shift in the presumption of entitlement.  It absolutely clear that it is a shift.  It makes it easier for deciding officers to say \"No\".  That is essentially giving legislative support to deciding officers who were wrongly refusing applicants.  When they refuse people, they are inflicting suffering on a very significant cohort who do not need further suffering on top of the disabilities, illnesses and infirmities that lead them to apply for carer supports in the first place.  It is just not fair.  Needless suffering is being experienced.  We should be moving in the opposite direction, as alluded to in the amendments that Deputy Collins and I tabled.  These amendments would simply require the acceptance of the word of a general practitioner.<\/p>  <p>  I will make a point I did not have time to make earlier.  When we discussed this on Committee Stage, I asked why we should not simply accept the word of the general practitioner or professionally qualified medical practitioner when testifying to medical eligibility for a carer's payment.  The response we got from a committee member on the Government side was that it would put too much pressure on general practitioners.  We also heard the excuse that it would make the general practitioner judge, jury and executioner in the determination of eligibility.  I would much rather a general practitioner, who is medically qualified to decide whether somebody needs carer support, to be judge, jury and executioner than somebody who is not medically qualified and for whom a significant pressure is the budgetary constraint.  I am not merely speculating that budgetary constraints are an influence on deciding officers; we know this because amendments to address this were ruled out of order on Committee Stage because they would represent a potential charge on the Exchequer.  Why would they be a potential charge on the Exchequer?  If somebody meets the medical eligibility criteria for a benefit, he is entitled to it.  If the Government were honest in this legislation, it would actually say the relevant person shall not be entitled to a benefit unless he or she fits the medical criteria, \"subject to budgetary constraints\".  Of course, it would not say \"subject to budgetary constraints\" because that would completely undermine the principle of the measure, which is supposed to be a support for people who need it.<\/p><p>The Department could not possibly admit that in legislation but it is absolutely clear that this is what was driving the thinking.  The idea is that the Government cannot open the floodgates, as the Department would see it, because it would impact on budgets and would bring a charge on the Exchequer.  The Government does not admit that this is what is driving the tightening up of the criteria in the legislation.  It is dishonest legislation.<\/p> <p> One of the implications was explicitly stated at the committee.  Certainly, from talking to some of the Deputies afterwards - I am not referring to the Minister of State, but other Deputies - there was a belief that general practitioners are willy-nilly signing letters stating that someone needs supports or is permanently disabled or whatever, when that is not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100033#GG00200","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427894700,"counter":392,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.

That is the point I am making.  The implication is that doctors are lying and writing false testimonies on a large scale.  I do not believe that for a minute.  Even if there are a small number of abuses, the idea that the Government would frame the legislation on the presumption that large numbers of GPs are lying is rubbish.  It is an absolutely unacceptable way to frame legislation, particularly when the alternative is to depend on deciding officers who are not medically qualified.  I believe that, by and large, when GPs say someone needs support, they need it.  That should be enough.<\/p>  <p>  Having thought it over and in view of what is going on here, I believe we have no choice but to vote against the Bill.  I have no wish to vote against the back-to-work family dividend, not because it is sufficient compensation for the axing of the one-parent family payment for children over the age of seven years - it is not - but because it is a marginal improvement on the decision made in 2012.  It should not be lumped in with a regressive move which will tighten the eligibility criteria for carers and for a significant cohort of others on an ongoing basis for years to come, including people who are vulnerable, disabled and infirm.  These people need support.  They should not have extra unnecessary hoops put in front of them to claim their entitlements.  These two things should not be lumped together.<\/p>  <p>  I want to make it absolutely clear in saying I am voting against the Bill that I am against it on the basis of what the Government is doing around the eligibility criteria for carers.  If the Government were cognisant of this, it could easily introduce amendments in the Seanad that would separate out the two issues.  That would allow us not to oppose the parts of the Bill that will improve the situation for lone parents without forcing us simultaneously to endorse something that will disimprove the situation for vulnerable, ill, disabled and infirm people.  The Government should not ask us to lump those two things together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100034#HH00500","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1427894700,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I too and the other Deputies of the Anti-Austerity Alliance will not be supporting this Bill because of several measures.  As the previous speaker said, this is an attack on the requirement for getting full-time care by taking it out of the hands of a GP and giving it to the opinions of a deciding officer and medical staff.  There is a system like this in Britain operated by Atos Healthcare which is routinely used to refuse people full-time care.  To me, that is what is going on here and I believe the Bill should be opposed for that reason.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe people should be fooled by a back-to-work family dividend of &euro;29 per week as some kind of gesture towards the furore and outrage we have seen over the Government's cuts to lone-parent supports.  The back-to-work family dividend facilitates the Government in its philosophy, according to which being a lone parent is a lifestyle choice, such people are lazy and they need to be activated back to work.  That is absolutely outrageous given that over 50% of lone parents are in the workforce in any case.  What the Government is doing will make it more difficult for them.<\/p>  <p>  The back-to-work family dividend in the Bill is one of the Labour Party's key measures in the legislation.  It is supposed to make going back to work pay for families.  However, in effect, it will not do that.  The amount of money being given is &euro;29.80 per week per child.  Does the Minister of State know of any child who can be minded for &euro;29.80 per week?  It is absolutely ridiculous.  In a report carried out recently, we learned that the average cost of child care nationally was &euro;659 per month.  We know that in Dublin and other cities it is much higher, depending on the age of the child.  The dividend will cover &euro;119.20.  How is anyone meant to make up the shortfall?<\/p>  <p>  It is called the back-to-work dividend but the question is: back to what work?  The only jobs available are low-paid or seasonal, as we are finding out and as we will find out with the case of the Dunnes Stores workers tomorrow, many of whom are women workers and many of whom may be lone parents or parents trying to keep their families afloat.  The work is contractual, seasonal and is almost moving to zero-hours contracts.  These are the types of jobs the Government is promoting.  Most of these jobs are low-paid and precarious.  Why should the Government subsidise employers who are not paying people enough to enable them to afford child care?  This is another subsidy by the taxpayer for these employers.<\/p>  <p>  This is a sop that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, is bringing in because she has been under relentless criticism from every agency that deals with children, including Barnardos and the One Parent Exchange and Network.  All the various bodies have reacted with outrage.  Let us be honest.  This is an attack on women yet again because 90% of one-parent families are headed by women.  It is a continuation of the attack on the most vulnerable, who are not in a position to organise in the same way as, for example, a trade union or public sector workers.  They do not have the same collective organisations.  Women especially have been hit by austerity and this is another social welfare attack on them, having already faced major cuts in child benefit.<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to Opposition Members to oppose this Bill because it facilitates all the cuts the Government has brought in, especially to lone parents.  We should not facilitate the Government in the argument that people need to be incentivised to go back to work.  People need proper child care.  Most lone parents work.  This shows they would like to work and want to be part of the workforce, but it is being made especially difficult for women.  We have already heard from speaker after speaker about the lies of the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, who promised this would not be brought in until we had the Scandinavian model of child care.  We have no such thing.<\/p>  <p>  I agree it is a sneaky attack on the Department qualification for full-time care.  This is something that often happens in this type of legislation.  Something that can seem rather nuanced can turn out to be very serious for many people.  The Anti-Austerity Alliance will oppose the Bill.  Moreover, we urge people to organise and put serious pressure on the Minister of State and the Labour Party in particular, because this represents another betrayal of women, low-paid workers and people on social welfare.  We should apply pressure to get those in government to repeal all the attacks they have made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100034#HH00600","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1427894700,"counter":397,"content":"<p>Have I a time limit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100034#HH00700","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1427894700,"counter":398,"content":"<p>There are no time limits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100034#HH00800","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1427894700,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I will be brief.

There are three aspect to the amendment.  First, clamping should not be used to get a person to pay a debt, second, clamping companies should be regulated, and third, the odious practice of clamping people at hospitals should be banned.  Clamping was allegedly introduced for traffic management purposes, to facilitate the free flow of traffic, etc.  However, private companies of various shades are using clamping for profiteering in the most despicable manner at the expense of people who are in very vulnerable situations.<\/p><p>People who frequently need to visit hospitals are especially in fear.  People whose appointments overrun in a crowded waiting room and cannot walk back to the car park in time are clamped.  I was clamped as I dropped a specimen in to Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown as I spoke to a doctor at the door.  Even the doctor, who was a member of the board, could not get the clamper to remove the clamp or see any sense.  Clamping is being abused.  Many of the clamping companies offer piece work and encourage the clampers to clamp as many people as possible for bonuses, which is why they operate as they do.  The Minister must agree that clamping has no place in hospitals, where people are in vulnerable and difficult situations and do not need the extra stress.<\/p><p>There is a widespread and despicable practice whereby private estate management companies are using clamping as a way of getting management fee arrears from their members.  People come out of their houses and find their cars clamped, although they are parked in parking spaces which they are legally entitled to use and which do not block anyone's access or egress.  In many cases, they must pay up to &euro;150.  This has happened in Applewood estate in Swords, the Phoenix Park Racecourse in Dublin 15, my area, Ongar, Archers Wood and many other estates.  The Government should send a message to private management companies.  There can be many reasons people do not pay estate management fees, and this is not a justifiable way of getting them to pay arrears.<\/p><p>I am very familiar with estate management companies, which have been a scourge throughout Dublin West and in many other recently developed areas.  Estate management companies were imposed in multi-unit estates.  Obviously, an apartment block needs a collective structure for insurance, a sinking fund etc.  However, most of the management companies apply to people who have their own houses, with front and back entrances and no need for a management company.  Former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, recognised this in the D&aacute;il in 2006 and sent a circular to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government indicating that the practice should not apply to houses in the future.  The problem is that there are many estates that were built in the limbo period during which planning permission was given and which have been left with these private management companies.<\/p><p>I live in an estate where we do not have clamping or parking issues.  We have a management company as a legacy issue, although, with advice from Fingal County Council, we have taken a democratic decision, in conjunction with the council, that the houses should be released from it.  However, tens of thousands of people throughout the country are legitimately withholding fees because they do not agree they should have to pay them.  They are being charged fees of &euro;200 to &euro;300 for the maintenance of a sprig or a bush in front of their houses, which they are well capable of maintaining themselves.<\/p><p>In Tyrellstown, people are paying insurance on a car parking space.  These are totally unjustifiable management company structures.  Clampers are being used by the directors of these companies.  I have sympathy with some of these directors who are ordinary residents and who have been put in the odious position of having to take over the management company because they live in an apartment block and the management structure was not working for them given the level of arrears and non-payment of fees.  Residents on one estate are going to court because it is totally unjustifiable to live in a house, maintain and insure it and then have to pay a management fee.  In Ongar, Clonsilla, Dublin 15 and in other areas, people are waking up and finding that they have been clamped because they have not paid the management fee.  This is effective because the payment of the fees seems to increase when this happens, but is it right?  This is extortion in a sense with people having to pay an unjust fee.  They try to sort the management fee out legitimately by dealing with issues in their management company or they may be in arrears because they have lost their job and they cannot afford to pay the fee anymore, which has been the case during the recession.  We should ban clamping for that purpose on behalf of those people.<\/p> <p> Legislation needs to be introduced to deal with management companies and to ensure houses can be released from their control in a fair and workable way.  The legal advice is that this can be done and the Government needs to deal with this problem because it has left many people on newly developed estates in a difficult position having to pay unjust fees to management companies while getting clamped in the process.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  This major issue was raised by a host of Members on Committee Stage.  It will also be an election issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100038#MM00900","speaker":"1195","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427897100,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I support the amendments.  I raised the issue of clamping on hospital grounds earlier, particularly Blanchardstown hospital where I have witnessed this many times.  People who had to rush into the accident and emergency department come out afterwards to discover their car clamped.  Patients and visitors who are detained for different reasons when they go into the hospital are also being clamped.  It is despicable that a person can come out of a hospital to find their car clamped having being delayed through no fault of their own.  I have always said another mechanism can be used to deal with that.  When this issue was raised on Committee Stage, the Minister said he was not in favour of this but there are ways of addressing this issue.  Barriers could be used in order that people can at least access their cars and get in and out of the car park.  To be clamped and have to pay a fine having visited someone who is sick or having to go in sick as a patient is a big issue.<\/p>  <p>  It is common practice for management companies to use clamping to put pressure on people to pay management fees and I am aware of this happening in many areas, including Lanesborough, Hampton Wood and so on.  This practice should not be allowed.  More rules are needed to regulate management companies.  We need to examine how they do this.  I would much prefer if we went down the road of having local authorities manage all these estates instead of having myriad management companies with different rules.  I welcome the Minister's move to bring fines on public and private roads into line.  That is welcome because the cost of unlocking clamped cars varies significantly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100039#NN00200","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1427897100,"counter":459,"content":"<p>We had a discussion on these issues on Committee Stage.  I wish we were discussing parking in its totality and, as a subset, where clamping fits into it but that is not what the Bill is about and I understand that.  The amendments are an attempt to moderate the actions taken in extreme cases in the context of clamping.<\/p>  <p>  Many traditional housing estates, which do not contain an apartment, are run by management companies.  Sometimes, the developer has a proxy vote giving him a majority.  The management company then determines that people must pay clamping fees because a majority vote decides on such initiatives to recoup management fees.  This does not dovetail well with the Multi-Unit Development Act 2011.  Typically, people are stressed in terms of paying a mortgage and they make a decision on whether to pay the management fee or the mortgage to keep the roof over their heads.  In most cases, they are not trying to avoid paying the fee but they simply do not have the money to pay it.  I have had people in my clinics in tears over this.  Their car has been immobilised for days and they have been unable to go to work.  In addition, workers making deliveries and visitors to residents have also been clamped.  It is a blunt instrument.  These cars are not causing an obstruction on the public road and this clamping policy is a means of collecting the management fee.<\/p>  <p>  I fully appreciate that in the case of an apartment, a management company arrangement will always be needed given there will be shared spaces that require to be managed.  However, in the early part of the first decade of the new millennium, the establishment of management companies was routine, whether the development was full of apartments or traditional housing.  There needs to be an understanding of what is going on.  Clamping is not appropriate as a sanction.  Other measures such as the simple contract debt sanction could be pursued without adopting this approach.  No court would impose the sanction the clampers can impose.  People can run up debts of between &euro;300 and &euro;400 in a week because they do not have the money to release the clamp.  It is unfair to treat citizens in that way.  An amount is charged per night until the clamping fine is paid and it is a blunt instrument.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies Ellis, Coppinger and I particularly focused on Blanchardstown hospital in the context of clamping fines because that is the hospital about which we receive most complaints.  These complaints are ongoing.  Clamping is in place 24-7 and does not stop at 5 p.m.  People run in and out of the hospital to put money in the machine only to find they have been clamped.  I have dealt with cases of families who were visiting relatives in the final days of their lives.  That last thing on their minds was to worry about the car being clamped but they came out of the hospital to find it had been, which is inappropriate.  They were parked in a designated parking space and, for example, they were not in a disabled space or obstructing traffic.  I have no problem with parking charges given, as the Minister said on Committee Stage, we cannot have a scenario where people use hospital car parks such as the one in St. James's Hospital inappropriately.  I get that as part of an overall policy but where somebody is trying to have tests done or is visiting a patient who is seriously ill, the use of clamping as a means of sanction is highly inappropriate.<\/p><p>It is not necessary.  The only ones gaining from it are the clamping companies.  It is not as if the hospital is gaining from it.  I hope the Minister will accept these amendments.  It is not a question of throwing out an entire policy or legislation, it is about at least taking out some of the worst excesses.<\/p> <p> It is interesting to see how Government policy on some issues does not dovetail with other areas of policy.  There is a plan for the renewal of rural Ireland.  One of the initiatives concerns parking in towns.  At the same time, there are towns where part of the reason people will not go near them is the risk of being clamped.  Being clamped once is enough to put them off ever coming back.  It has a dramatic impact and there are a myriad of arrangements in many towns.  It is not just the local authorities, it may be two or three different companies, some of which use clamping as the main sanction.  One also finds it at railway stations.  This happens when people do not expect it.  For example, I was at the railway station in Leixlip where people came to park and get the train to Croke Park on a Sunday or bank holiday Monday.  Yes, there are signs, but most people would not expect to come back and have to pay &euro;140 to undo the clamp.  This must be better thought out.  It is not about modifying the legislation for the clampers, it is about looking at parking policy in its totality and the impact it has on other things.  For example, we want to discourage people coming all the way into town when there is a big match on.  We want them, for example, to come as far as train stations on the periphery and get the train in.  This legislation does not achieve that because of the way it is imposed.  There are many different issues, but the most offensive situations are in housing estates, where management companies are using this as a sanction when there is no need to do so, and most offensive of all, in hospitals, which is unfair on people when they are at their lowest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100039#NN00300","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427897700,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I will begin where Deputy Murphy finished.  She urged that this Bill be focused on parking policy.  She correctly said this Bill does not take the approach of dealing with parking policy.  It deals with the regulation of clamping, which is something that has not happened before in such a strong and national manner as this Bill proposes.  I will use the Deputy's example of clamping on large match days or around sporting events to show why we are not dealing with parking policy itself.  If we were to take the approach in this Bill of trying to regulate parking policy, this Bill would have to deal with the specifics of events like that.<\/p>  <p>  Do we believe there are any circumstances in which clamping is allowed?  I do.  I believe there are other circumstances in which clamping should not be allowed and other sanctions or criteria should be used to deal with illegal parking.  The reason this Bill does not get into the realm of trying to dictate parking policy is precisely that there are so many different situations and so many needs all over the country regarding parking, which could have the potential for clamping.  If I were looking to do that, I would then be dealing with charges from members of the Opposition that I am trying to take power away from the people who best know how that power should be wielded, namely, local authorities or statutory bodies which look after property they own.  If I were looking to deal with parking policy, the claim would be made against me that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and myself were removing power from local authorities, for example.  Local authorities are the bodies best placed to develop policy for their areas.  It is because of the different nuances and local needs to which parking policy must respond that this Bill looks at the regulation of the activity of clamping, while recognising the right of other parties, such as statutory bodies and local authorities, to determine what is the best policy for parking in their areas, and charging the National Transport Authority with playing a role in the regulation of clamping that takes place as a consequence of the failure of motorists or clampers to take cognisance of the parking policy in that area.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments proposed by Deputies Coppinger, Murphy and Higgins seek to make it an offence to clamp a vehicle for the purposes of recovering an unpaid debt or charge and within multi-unit developments to make it an offence under the Multi-Units Development Act 2011 for an owners' management company to clamp a car unless it is operating as a clamping operator under the terms of this Bill.  They also seek to prohibit the clamping of vehicles in residential developments other than to facilitate the free flow of traffic and the clamping of vehicles in hospital and health facilities that belong to patients or people visiting patients.  As I said on different stages of the Bill, and a moment ago, this Bill is not about parking policy itself, for the reasons I have outlined.  It is not about where clamping should or should not be carried out, whether on the public road, in hospital car parks, in residential areas, or anywhere else.  This decision was made from the outset of the Bill.  This Bill seeks to deal with the activity of clamping if used as a means of parking control.  For this reason, it is beyond the scope of this Bill to legislate for practices within the property management sector.  In the case of hospitals and health facilities, while I would prefer clamping not be used and that alternative means of parking control were used, I must also accept that it is the right of the individuals and organisations running those hospitals to decide how they deal with parking needs on their own property.  Deputy Coppinger used the example of James Connolly Hospital, with which I am familiar.  It is adjacent to the National Sports Campus and other areas of employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100040#OO00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1427897700,"counter":462,"content":"<p>No, it is not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100040#OO00300","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1427897700,"counter":463,"content":"<p>It is beside the National Sports Campus, it is right beside it.  Let us tease this out because we have gone through it on Committee Stage already.  Am I to say there are no circumstances at all in which clamping should be allowed within a hospital?  There could be circumstances in which clamping is allowed in the hospital.  The board of management or the people running a hospital might decide that if clamping is not used, it might deprive patients or staff of their ability to use the facilities that are there.  The fact that I accept that there are some circumstances in which a hospital might decide that clamping is used or should be used is another reason I have decided from the outset that this Bill should not deal with the regulation of parking policy itself.  Instead, it should deal with the circumstances in which clamping takes place and, through the National Transport Authority, set out a framework within which the rights and responsibilities of both people who are clamped and the people who do the clamping are clearly laid out and processes are in place to allow appeal either to the clamper or to the person who is clamped in areas in which a car is clamped for the infringement of parking policy.<\/p><p>For those reasons, I cannot accept these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100040#OO00400","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427898300,"counter":465,"content":"<p>The Minister is looking at clamping purely from a Dublin City Council perspective because it is the only local authority that operates clamping.  All the others are private clampers.  Clamping has been outlawed in England, Scotland and Wales and the world has not fallen in on top of them.  In fact, they regulate parking in a coherent way, which is clear if one visits any of those three places.  The Minister talked about Blanchardstown hospital.  For the life of me I cannot figure out how the Minister can stand up here and make that silly argument about parking there and going up to the National Sports Campus.  Blanchardstown it is not an area I know extraordinarily well, but I do know it.  The Blanchardstown Centre has thousands of free car parking spaces with buses coming in and out of it.  Why would one park in the hospital grounds?  I cannot see any logic in what the Minister is talking about in that regard.  It just does not stack up.<\/p>  <p>  There is a need for a parking policy that is coherent.  The lack of such a policy is having a negative impact on businesses in town centres and villages by virtue of the fact that it is difficult to figure out exactly what the regime is.  In my area of Celbridge there are four different arrangements.  There is the local authority and three different companies which charge three different amounts.  What is the public supposed to think?  Is it supposed to read the bylaws and every sign before parking their car?  That is the kind of thing that puts people off.  They come back and find they have to pay between &euro;80 and &euro;120.

His predecessor, Deputy Leo Varadkar, should be well aware that this is a major issue not only in his own constituency but in Kildare, parts of Dublin City and many other areas.<\/p>  <p>  Connolly hospital has been raised by a number of Deputies as being a particular offender, with no mercy shown to those who are clamped.  It was laughable when the Minister said that was because the hospital is adjacent to the National Sports Campus, where my sister works.  It has hundreds of acres and there is no pressure on parking there.  It is clear there is not a need for this.  Other issues can be considered to regulate parking without resorting to clamping.  Other hospitals do not use clamping.  They have looked at underground car parks, barriers or whatever.  It has been pointed out by Dublin City Council that these workers have to clamp or else they are not paid properly.  Dublin City Council set a target of &euro;60,000 for clampers.  Some of the companies are unlimited companies in the Isle of Man and would surely have to be properly regulated, submitting financial accounts and so on.  Unfortunately our amendments were ruled out on that issue.  In a number of these companies the workers literally have to clamp cars - otherwise, they will not be paid - so there is no rhyme or reason other than profiteering.  It is disappointing that the Minister has done nothing about parking at hospitals, but it is also poor form, because the previous Government should have dealt with management companies and regulated to allow houses to be released, which is the main problem.

That is what the Bill allows.  Deputy Catherine Murphy offered mild praise here, but it is the first time this sector has been examined properly through primary legislation.

It is not just the private management companies, although I would have liked the Minister to take much stronger action against them earlier on.  I think Dublin City Council is the only local authority that uses clamping.  An article in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>stated that Dublin City Council set a target of 60,000 vehicles for clampers so the company doing the clamping is actually setting a target.  If 60,000 vehicles are clamped in Dublin that year, the company offered to pay staff a bonus of &euro;2,000 each.  If the overall target was not met, only individual clampers who managed to clamp 2,800 vehicles per year would be rewarded.  The Minister can see the aim is not to manage traffic but to clamp people at all costs.  This is a private company operating on behalf of a local authority - a statutory agency.  Clampers can apparently leave a ten-hour shift after 8.5 hours if they have clamped 21 vehicles.  In a letter to staff, the company's management while working for a public body said that the council was not happy with the number of clampings in 2012 and that the company was expected to deliver approximately 60,000 clampings in 2012 but only delivered 54,000.<\/p><p>This shows how public bodies are subcontracting to private companies, some of which do not file accounts and operate offshore.  They are also putting huge pressure on staff to clamp.  We have all had the experience of being clamped after being one minute or two minutes late.  We know that Merrion Square, which is right behind us, is a hotspot.  It is purely for this reason and not to regulate traffic flow.  That was the reason I asked the Minister to extend it to public bodies who use clampers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100044#SS00900","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1427899500,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I followed up on the matter to which Deputies referred on previous Stages of the Bill in respect of the nature of the arrangement organisations such as Dublin City Council might have with private clamping organisations.

That is the information I have received from the council which I accept.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the specific point the Deputy put to me, I accept the merit of some of the concerns she raises.  However, some of the issues she raises are dealt with in section 14 which deals with maximum clamp release charges and vehicle relocation charges on private land by the NTA.  Section 14 gives the NTA the power to deal with matters like clamp release charges and relocation fees.  If such charges are not created by the NTA, the Bill will put in place a default setting relating to fees.  The fee in non-statutory clamping places will be &euro;100 with a maximum relocation charge of &euro;50.  We are looking to put in place maximum charges for those kinds of activities if the NTA does not implement a code of practice.

While I do believe the legislative flexibility exists to deal with the issue to which the Deputy refers, I know, based on my own experience as a local representative, that changes to any particular area of parking law or policy has consequences for adjoining areas.  For this reason I am of the view that changes in one area should always be made in the context of the effect of the decision in that regard on surrounding communities.  That being said, local authorities would be aware of this.  In regard to my commitment to contact the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government about this matter, I have done so.  The Deputy will receive a copy of that communication imminently, if she has not done so already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015040100045#TT01400","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427900100,"counter":512,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427900100,"counter":513,"content":"<p>Bill, as amended, received for final consideration and passed.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427900100,"counter":514,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 7.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
