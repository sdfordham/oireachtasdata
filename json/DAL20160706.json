It is a great honour to be elected to this House at any time.  It is a great honour to serve in the House and it has been a great honour to serve for many years, as you know, a Cheann Comhairle, along with your good self and many others.  I hope I have learnt some things along the way.  I hope I am still learning.  It is no harm to learn a little bit as one goes along.<\/p>  <p>  We live in very interesting times and we have to adapt, as I have said previously.  We have to be cautious as to how we deal with the situations that arise to a greater extent than we ever did previously.  We also need to encourage the new Members of the House to be able to stand up and speak in the House on their own behalf and on behalf of their constituents, to do so fearlessly and to have the confidence to do it and to know they have a job to do, a role to fill and words to say.<\/p><p> We all need to develop a greater recognition and respect for the words we say always in the House but, more especially, to each other.  The way in which we address each other in the House can be reflected in the way the public regards us and examine our performance.  At a time when politics and public life is challenged, it is important we look at ourselves in this self critical way to try to ensure that what we do does not reflect badly on the House and those we represent, but contributes to the Order of Business in the way the Ceann Comhairle would like us to proceed at all times.<\/p> <p> I do not know what the outcome will be.  I would be greatly honoured to be allowed to fill the role.  I do not know how people will vote.  There is no restriction on anybody voting for me who wishes to vote for me.

I have learned, over time, that one should never become bitter in politics.  It is very important.  It leaves a lasting taste not only in the minds of the people in the House, but in the minds of people outside the House who watch, absorb and take it on board.  We should also try to remember that, whatever we do, we should never take somebody's character, either inside or outside the House.  The pressures of politics are urgent, pressing and constant.  There is always a tendency to use that extra pressure to make a point.  We should avoid making personal points, and I hope I have succeeded in doing so.

Deputy Crowe hails form Rathfarnham, but has lived for many years with his wife, Pamela, in Tallaght, and for many years represented the area as a member of South Dublin County Council.  When the peace process was initiated, Deputy Crowe headed the Sinn F&eacute;in delegation to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in Dublin Castle.<\/p><p>He also represented our party in the multi-party negotiations that led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.  He is very experienced and he made a huge contribution to crafting these events and agreements which are now part of our history.  Deputy Crowe has served as a party spokesperson on foreign affairs for a number of years and has contributed positively to numerous D&aacute;il committees, particularly the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p> Teachta Durkan talked about never taking away anyone's character.

I have no doubt that he will act at all times in an impartial and fair manner to everyone's benefit.

I fully appreciate that the business of the D&aacute;il should be carried out in a dignified manner and, if I am elected, I will do my utmost to fulfil that role, with the co-operation of Deputies, and to work closely with the Ceann Comhairle.  I pledge, if elected, to be fair, understanding, balanced and accessible to all Deputies.  I will take an open-door approach, mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; i nGaeilge.

The situation is truly scandalous and is unacceptable, particularly for children who are waiting far too long to get to see a consultant in the three children's hospitals, especially in Crumlin and in Temple Street.<\/p>  <p>  One can trace it back to the decision of the then Minister, now Senator James Reilly, in 2011 to mothball and destroy the work of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  Prior to that, the average waiting times for elective patients was approximately two and a half months for those waiting for elective treatments.  Senator Reilly changed the system - it is all documented - and it has been all downhill since with dramatic increases in waiting times and in the waiting lists.  For example, we now have 415,000 people waiting for outpatient appointments and 62,000 people waiting longer than one year.  We have in excess of 75,000 people waiting for inpatient treatment in hospitals.  Some 4,500 children are waiting for appointments in the three children's hospitals, 2,000 of whom are waiting for more than a year.  One would think that when it comes to children, we should be moving might and main to eradicate or shorten dramatically those waiting times, particularly in terms of those waiting longer than a year.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government talks about progress and sustaining progress made.  I would suggest that the Taoiseach should take out the language of sustaining progress because no progress has been made over recent years in terms of waiting lists and, in fact, the situation has become dramatically worse.  The waiting lists are now up 45% in two years.  It is a sad indictment of what has been going on over the past two to three years in terms of policy initiative and a lack of basic urgency in dealing with this crisis.  Patients, in particular children, should not have to wait that long to get to see a consultant.<\/p>  <p>  There is a commitment, involving &euro;15 million, to re-establish the treatment purchase fund.  The &euro;15 million will not be enough.  There is a wider commitment of &euro;35 million, or &euro;50 million overall, in terms of waiting lists.  Will the Taoiseach outline to the House the plans to reconstruct and re-establish the treatment purchase fund back to the model that was in existence before Senator James Reilly mothballed it in order that it would be effective and have the capacity to deliver the results?<\/p><p>Does the Taoiseach accept these waiting times are absolutely unacceptable for the patients concerned?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600008#Z00400","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I accept that any waiting list is never satisfactory because the patient must wait.  As Deputy Martin pointed out, the programme for Government emphasises the need for a sustained commitment to improve waiting lists for patients, with a particular focus on those who have had to wait longest.  The Department of Health will engage with the National Treatment Purchase Fund to deliver on that &euro;15 million funding for an initiative targeted at those waiting the longest, with the continuing investment of &euro;50 million per year to deal with waiting lists.  I understand the Department is currently engaged with the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the Health Service Executive, HSE, is planning a dedicated waiting list initiative to be rolled out later this year.<\/p>  <p>  The issue for patients is how long they must wait.  Improving waiting times for scheduled or planned care for patients is absolutely key.  The action taken by the previous Minister resulted in improvements.  In 2015, some &euro;51 million in additional funding was provided to address maximum waiting times of 18 months by 30 June and 15 months by year-end for inpatient, day and outpatient cases.  The end of 2015 demonstrated a 95% achievement for inpatient and day case waiting lists and a 93% improvement for outpatient waiting lists against the 15 months maximum wait times.  This year, the HSE service plan undertakes to maintain the 2015 levels of service in respect of scheduled care.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, the HSE's scheduled care governance group is focusing on a number of key areas, including ensuring that the chronological scheduling of cases is adhered to, putting in place validation procedures to ensure patients are available for treatment when they are deemed to be for treatment and relocating high-volume low-complexity surgeries to smaller hospitals.  Many consultants have said to me they could do more work if some procedures of lower complexity were shifted to smaller hospitals.  The group is also focusing on designating an improvement lead for each hospital group to provide support in meeting the national targets both for appointments and treatments.<\/p>  <p>  There is an extra &euro;800 million in the health system because the state of the economy has improved and that, in turn, will lead to improvements in a number of sectors.  That money was not available before to deal with these very necessary cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600009#AA00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>That is not actually the case; the former Minister, Senator James Reilly, changed the policy.  He got rid of the treatment purchase fund, which was a singular, dedicated and focused approach to dealing with waiting times.  He blew it and got it terribly wrong.  Another Minister, Deputy Varadkar, came after him and demonstrated no urgency at all on this.  There are 5,000 patients waiting in Beaumont, meaning the numbers are up 57% on January this year.  The Government must have a real check on reality and not quote the kind of figures I mentioned.  The former Minister, Senator James Reilly, created a new target of 12 months - plucked from thin air - and up to then the target was six months for adults and three months for children.  The former Minister, Deputy Varadkar, put it at 15 months.  The Government could then judge against new targets that it created.<\/p>  <p>  This is an urgent issue for the number of people who are waiting for procedures.  In Crumlin's children's hospital, 2,000 children have been waiting for more than a year for an outpatient appointment.  That is not good enough.  We should immediately tackle that with a sense of urgency followed by real money now and not later in the year.  We must get to the bottom of it.

It has obliged him at every turn, or every U-turn, because the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has done a U-turn on every issue, from saying it would not support Fine Gael in government to water charges, bin charges, NAMA, the national monument on Moore Street, rent certainty and, just last night, banded hours contracts.  None of this is in the common good.  None of it is in the national interest.  It is motivated by the Fianna F&aacute;il leadership's desire to keep Fine Gael in government until it decides to pull the plug at the point most advantageous to itself and its ambition to form a government.  There is no other reason for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party's behaviour.  It is all about political power.  It is not about new politics.  It is nothing but the same old story.<\/p>  <p>  The commission on water charges is clearly only a committee to provide the Government and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party with a fig leaf on water charges as part of this partnership Government.  Joe O'Toole put it well when he said: \"People voted a certain way, Leinster House is not prepared that particular nettle, so we have to find a solution that will have enough sugar on it to make the medicine go down easily.\"  However, Leinster House has not been allowed to deal with this issue.  The public has rejected water charges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600010#BB00200","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797700,"counter":32,"content":"<p>It is Leinster House now, is it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600010#BB00300","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797700,"counter":33,"content":"<p>They should be scrapped and dealt with here in the D&aacute;il, democratically and decisively.

This will entail a 26-year contract with private providers, at the end of which the networks will be privately owned.  The reasons publicly given for the decision were that this would be cheaper than direct State funding and would be off balance sheet so as to free up capital spending elsewhere.  We have poor broadband in this country, particularly in rural areas, because of the decision by Fianna F&aacute;il to privatise Eircom in the biggest economic mistake this country made until Fianna F&aacute;il's even more disastrous mistake in giving the blanket bank guarantee in 2008.  This Government is about to repeat that mistake.  Just as the State was ultimately required to buy back the West Link toll bridge for &euro;600 million, ensuring that the private company, National Toll Roads, received a staggering &euro;1.15 billion return on its investment of &euro;35 million to build the bridge, as estimated by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, we will ultimately have to reacquire the broadband infrastructure in exactly the same way.<\/p><p>Fine Gael agreed with the Labour Party that vital infrastructure networks, such as the electricity and gas distribution networks, should be kept in public ownership.  We came to that agreement over the past five years, albeit after a battle, but now that understanding of the importance of the distribution systems for a vital resource seems to be gone.<\/p> <p> As the Taoiseach knows, the previous Government had two options when we decided this last December.  One was the model he decided on yesterday, the so-called gap funding model, or a full concession model whereby the asset, after the 25 years, came back into public ownership.  Will the Taoiseach accept that yesterday's decision is short termism and not in the public interest?  Will he agree that all relevant documentation and all the advice given to Government on this matter should be laid before this House in order that we can make a collective determination before this matter is finalised?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600011#CC01100","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467798600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>We do not intend to repeat what happened with Eircom.

What is involved is extending broadband for the last mile to many businesses and houses in areas throughout the country that are deemed not to be commercially viable.  It is an extension of the existing system.  It is not a national publicly owned entity like the Eircom network.  That is the first point.<\/p>  <p>  The second point is that a choice has to be made.  If we leave a situation where the State takes over the assets after 25 years, there is no incentive on whatever company or companies that own that system, from the tenth or 15th year onwards, to upgrade it, keep it in good shape and have it ready for handing over to the State.  Why would they?<\/p>  <p>  The intention is to be able to provide more than 750,000 individual premises with high quality, high speed broadband.

That is a choice that has to be made, and the Government made its choice clearly, but I repeat that this is not a national publicly owned entity.  This is an extension of privately owned facilities, and for that reason, the Government came down on the side of the gap funding model proposed by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources which will result, by independent regulation, in premises and businesses having access to that during and after the 25-year period but also to allow for the saving of serious sums of money that can be spent on other facilities people need throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600012#DD00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1467798600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Nobody would dispute for a second the essential nature of rolling out broadband.

I wish it was not a true story but it is.  Two sisters were both pregnant and happily looking forward to the birth of their children.  Tragically, towards the end of the first sister's uneventful pregnancy, the baby died in the womb.  She was medically assisted in delivering him, the family buried him and mourned him.  The second sister received a diagnosis that the foetus she was carrying had a condition of fatal foetal abnormality incompatible with life.  She wrote to me in the days that followed:<\/p><blockquote>I do not want to terminate my baby&rsquo;s life but he does not have one.  A heartbeat does not equate to an independent life for my boy, it only confirms a short few hours of pain for him and a lifetime of it for us.  I have watched what my sister went through, the amount of support she was offered and the support she will require over the coming months.  I feel so angry that this support is not available to me.  I have also watched my parents anguish, particularly my mother&rsquo;s, as they take note of all this and know that their other daughter has this ahead of her without that much needed support, hundreds of miles away from family and friends.  The dignity shown to the tiny corpse of my nephew in the hospital, in the mortuary and on his first and final journey home will not be extended to my son as he will have to be locked in the boot of the car on a ferry journey back across the Irish Sea or his ashes delivered by a courier weeks later, along with Amazon and eBay purchases.<\/blockquote><p>This is the Taoiseach's Ireland.  These events happened in the weeks after he last voted down our fatal foetal abnormalities Bill.  In anybody's book it is cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.  The Government has appeared in front of international human rights bodies on four occasions since and has been instructed to deal with these matters but the Taoiseach has done nothing.  In the case taken by Amanda Mellet, UN human rights experts stated that not only did Ireland violate her human rights, but the lack of action aggravated her suffering.  The Taoiseach comes to the House and speaks about a citizens' assembly reporting to an Oireachtas committee, which means that it will be at least 2018 before any proposals will be before the people to remedy this, condemning hundreds of others to the torture which was experienced by Amanda Mellet.

I get similar communications from women all over the country.  This is our Ireland.  It is an Ireland that is subject to a constitution, which is voted on by the people.  In the 1980s that vote was taken by the people and the interpretation of its meaning was made by the Supreme Court.  This impacts on people&rsquo;s lives.  I want to try to change that and in order to do that I have to build consensus, understanding and information for people who will have to vote if that be so to change the Constitution one way or the other.<\/p>  <p>  It is not a case of me as a citizen standing here, blocking anything.  We have put into the programme for Government a process which can be gone through rationally and in a common sense way, taking into account the changing attitudes and the sensitivities of so many people.  The Deputy may not appreciate that.  I understand her point of view.  She has been very forthright about it.  She has stated her views here very cogently on many occasions.  Unfortunately for her, she cannot change the Constitution unless she has the opportunity to cast her vote along with the citizens.  For that reason the process I have set out is one that will return here to the legislators elected by the people to cast their vote in a free way, according to their consciences.  If that recommendation is for a referendum to deal with the eighth amendment in whatever form then so be it, that vote will take place and that is the only way it can be changed.  While the Attorney General, as I told Deputy Howlin yesterday, is the only legal adviser to the Government under the Constitution, I accept that.  It is of course the Supreme Court at the end of the day which interprets what the Constitution means.  I have included as a central part of the programme for Government the citizens' assembly and a reflection in the first instance on the eighth amendment, taking into account many of the stories the Deputy has outlined and reference back to the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  While Deputy Daly has been forthright here, according to the medical assessments of what is contained in Deputy Wallace&rsquo;s Bill it will not be touched by any medic in the country.  This Bill is not good for women: it is bad for women.  It is inadequate and that means that it does not answer the question the good lady asked in her letter to the Deputy.  I have set out a process by which collectively we can reflect on this and eventually the people might be asked to make a decision.  That is the only way the Deputy&rsquo;s Constitution can be amended or changed.  I do share Deputy Daly&rsquo;s view that the services surrounding these events and instances should be improved.  We want to make arrangements that it be so.  The central issue is that if a child is born for whatever short length of time Article 40.3.3o kicks in and that is the challenge.  That is what needs to be talked about and understood.  That is why those at the top of the medical profession say that while Deputy Wallace might have the principle right in the Bill, the substance and the way it is phrased are grossly and wholly inadequate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600014#FF00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1467799500,"counter":89,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach does not stand here as a private citizen but as the leader of a country that has been found to violate the human rights of women.  When we did try to put to the House the proposal that there would be a repeal of the amendment to the Constitution to provide for abortion in this and other circumstances, the Taoiseach and his Government stood in its way.  He has used his position to block progress on this.  The arrogance of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, and several of his colleagues, who would presume to anticipate how the courts would deal with this matter, is absolutely breathtaking.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s use of the Attorney General as a block is in and of itself unconstitutional in my opinion.  The Government proposes laws, the D&aacute;il passes laws and the courts interpret laws.  Why can the Taoiseach not allow the courts of our country adjudicate on this?  We have not seen the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice but from the titbits we get, and the Taoiseach seems to have reiterated it, her advice seems to rest on the mistaken premise that Article 40.3.3o deals only with cases where there is a risk to the life of the mother.<\/p><p>That is not true.

My Bill centres on reducing the period before which one can apply for a divorce from four years out of the preceding five, to two years out of the preceding three.<\/p><p>Last month marked the 20th anniversary of the Family Law (Divorce) Act being signed into law.  We need to re-examine this law.  I believe in marriage and the constitutional protection given to it, but I do not believe in causing people unnecessary emotional and financial distress.<\/p><p>The four-year gap between separation and divorce has unfortunately proven to be cumbersome and draconian.  Protracted matrimonial litigation has dire consequences on the family unit as a whole, especially on children.  We have a duty to treat separated couples more humanely, less judgmentally and with compassion.  As a family lawyer for two decades and as a mediator, I have witnessed how the 1996 Family Law (Divorce) Act functions.  I have witnessed at first hand the consequences of couples waiting four years to issue divorce proceedings, even when those proceedings are uncontested.<\/p><p>Marital breakdown is a tortuous, complex and all-encompassing process.  The purpose of the Bill is to strike a balance between affording marriage the protection it deserves and showing fairness to separating couples.<\/p> <p> Currently, a separating couple is required to wait four years before they can issue divorce proceedings.  The Bill proposes a reduction in this timeframe to two years.  If the Bill is passed, a referendum on the proposed two-year rule will be required.  I believe that two years is sufficient time for a couple to come to terms with the fact that their marriage is over.  It gives the couple time to go through the five stages of grief that Elisabeth K&uuml;bler-Ross delineated, including denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.  It allows them sufficient time to adjust, to seek personal counselling and-or family therapy, to obtain independent legal advice and to inform themselves of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation.<\/p> <p> This Bill, if passed, will give people options.  They will be able to bypass the legal separation process and obtain a divorce after two years living separate and apart or obtain a legal separation by deed or a judicial separation and never seek a divorce.<\/p> <p> I have spent a long time reflecting on the needs of separating couples.  I believe this Bill is reasonable and fair.  Marriages break down, unfortunately, for all sorts of reasons.  We should no longer make finalising the break-up period too long, expensive and emotionally distressing.  In my experience, people have a greater sense of stability and certainty post-divorce when they are no longer embroiled in high conflict litigation and they have clarity and finality.  This is particularly true for the children of these marriages.  <\/p> <p> I believe this Bill represents an Ireland that is more compassionate and inclusive than the Ireland for which the four-year rule was written over two decades ago.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600018#KK01100","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467802500,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600019#LL00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1467802500,"counter":158,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600019#LL00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1467802500,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Cuireadh agus aonta&iacute;odh an cheist.\r\n\r\nQuestion put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1467802500,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600019#LL00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1467802500,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Tairgim: &quot;Go dt&oacute;gfar an Bille in am Comhalta&iacute; Pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideacha.&quot;<\/p><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600019#LL00600","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1467802500,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Cuireadh agus aonta&iacute;odh an cheist.\r\n\r\nQuestion put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions","time":1467802500,"counter":163,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600019#LL00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","time":1467802500,"counter":164,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600019#LL00900"},{"type":"question","time":1467802500,"counter":165,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[18143\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600019#LL01000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"to report on his recent contacts with the Government of the United States of America; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1330","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1467802500,"counter":166,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[18070\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600019#LL01100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"to report on his meeting with the Vice President of the United States of America, Mr. Joe Biden; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1281","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1467802500,"counter":167,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[19090\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600019#LL01200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the discussions he had with the American Vice President, Mr. Joe Biden, during his visit here in relation to progressing the proposed Cork to Boston Norwegian flight route.

I have also already reported to the House on my visit to Washington in May for events to commemorate the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising.<\/p>  <p>  On Tuesday, 21 June, I met with US Vice President Joe Biden in Government Buildings.

We had a cordial and productive discussion on a range of issues of mutual interest to our two nations, including the strong bilateral economic and trade relationship between Ireland and the United States.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, I recalled that I had raised the issue of the licensing of Norwegian Air International with President Obama and Vice President Biden when we met in March.  I welcomed the subsequent progress that the US authorities have made with their tentative decision on 15 April to grant a foreign air carrier permit to Norwegian Air International.  I emphasised to the vice president that we look forward to this decision being confirmed as soon as possible so that Norwegian Air International can launch new services between the US and Ireland, including a route from Cork.  The Vice President expressed his hope that the issue could be resolved as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Vice President and I also discussed a range of international and European matters, including the British referendum on EU membership, which was due later that week, and the Northern Ireland peace process.  We also discussed the issue of US immigration reform.<\/p>  <p>  The Vice President commended the Irish Government on its ongoing advocacy for immigration reform and expressed his dissatisfaction with the lack of progress on the issue in the United States.  Deputies will be aware of the latest disappointing development where the US Supreme Court is evenly split on President Obama's executive action, so the lower court decision blocking President Obama's executive action remains in place.<\/p>  <p>  During our meeting, we spoke about the recent mass shooting in Orlando.  I had previously written to President Obama to convey the condolences of the Government and the Irish people following this atrocity and I took the opportunity to express our condolences in person to the Vice President.<\/p>  <p>  Our meeting concluded with us looking forward to the remainder of the Vice President's visit, which included a meeting the following morning with President Higgins.  Reflecting the Vice President's interest in exploring his Irish heritage, the programme included events in counties Mayo and Louth as well as in Dublin.  The Vice President was also accompanied by a number of close family members.  Before his departure for Washington on Sunday, 26 June, I hosted a lunch at Farmleigh House for the Vice President and his family, which was also attended by Government Ministers, the Ceann Comhairle, representatives of the main Opposition parties, business representatives, the State agencies and Irish American interests.<\/p>  <p>  The Vice President's visit was a great success and, I believe, has contributed to further strengthening the deep friendship between Ireland and the United States.<\/p><p>Before his departure for Washington on Sunday 26 June, I hosted a lunch at Farmleigh House for the Vice President and his family, which was also attended by other Government Ministers, the Ceann Comhairle, representatives of the main Opposition parties, business representatives, the State Agencies and Irish-American interests.

Like the Taoiseach and others here, I have met many who have travelled back home to their ancestral home place.  It is always emotional and that was very obvious in the way Joe Biden and his family were met, not least in the Taoiseach's county of Mayo.  Along with Deputy Munster, I attended the event in Carlingford in County Louth and the farewell luncheon in Farmleigh House.  I thank the Taoiseach for the invitation to that event.  Vice President Biden was entirely at home in the beautiful Cooley Peninsula, particularly in the lovely village of Carlingford looking out across the lough towards the Mourne Mountains with Slieve Foy at our back.<\/p>  <p>  I am also pleased that the Taoiseach had the opportunity to discuss immigration reform.  Vice President Biden is a long-standing supporter of the peace process, so it was good that the Taoiseach was able to talk to him about that as well.  I know that Vice President Biden is very conscious of the difficulties faced by the 50,000 undocumented Irish citizens in the US.  <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach alluded to talking about other international issues.  He may know that, unusually, the US Administration has strongly criticised Israeli plans to illegally build hundreds of new homes in existing Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem.  The US State Department has described this as the latest step in a systematic process of land seizures and the UN Secretary General has said that he is deeply disappointed.  Half a million Israeli settlers have been living in more than 100 illegal settlements since the 1967 occupation.  Did the Taoiseach raise this issue with Vice President Biden?  Clearly, it is a good thing that the US Government is criticising this action.  I think our Government can give a lead.  The Taoiseach knows about the programme for Government commitment to recognise the state of Palestine and that in 2014, the Oireachtas voted in support of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.

What interests those who are trying to promote the region as a tourist destination is the footfall that would result from this connectivity.

I asked the Taoiseach whether he would be willing to go back to President Obama, because I understand that the US authorities will sit on this until after the election, so it will be towards the end of the year before they make any decision.  That is a lot of time and a lot of lost opportunities for the southern region.  It is not just a Cork issue.  I think the Taoiseach is aware that it has a knock-on effect on his constituency and the airport in Knock.  Indeed, I think it will have an impact on the entire country and our economy.

It is fair to say that in Cork city and county there is a strong mood for connectivity and flights connecting ourselves with Boston and New York at a later point.  Cork city and county also form an area with a strong tradition when it comes to standing up for and respecting workers' rights.  The issue of workers' rights is in the mix of the debate about these flights.  We have had reports that Norwegian Air is talking about using agency workers who would be sourced from outside the US and the EU, perhaps with cabin crew and pilots taken on from south-east Asia.  There has been talk of wages being paid of $500 a month, and with the race to the bottom, that is something that would concern people.  In this country, the Irish Airline Pilots Association, IALPA, has raised those concerns and in the US they have been raised by various trade unions and members of Vice President Biden's party, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.  I am interested in information and an update on flights and connectivity.  I am also wondering if the Vice President, whose Department of Transportation is looking into this, has any further update or information about the workers' rights issue here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600021#NN00200","speaker":"1281"},{"type":"speech","time":1467803400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I extended an invitation to Vice President Biden to come here quite a number of years ago and I was very glad that during his last year in office he was able to come to Ireland on a semi-formal visit.  I agree with Deputy Adams that he was really pleased to explore the roots of his forefathers in Carlingford and Ballina, County Mayo.  I found Vice President Biden to be really interested in people, his Irishness and his roots.  He was accompanied by his sister, daughter, sister-in-law, grandchildren and other members of his family.  He was making a real effort to have them understand the extent of the connections between Ireland and the United States.  His visit was an outstanding success.<\/p>  <p>  While we did not discuss the question of Israel with him, the acquisition of further lands by Israel for the purpose of building apartments or houses is one I deplore.  It is of great concern to the general, fragile efforts being made to bring about a two-state solution.  This will not help the situation.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is working on the question of Palestine, having moved some way in this direction, and there are still some matters to be considered.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Daly raised the question of Cork Airport and Norwegian Air, as did Deputy Barry.  Deputy Martin has also raised it on many occasions.  When I raised it with President Obama in the White House, while it is not directly within his remit, he was very supportive of the matter being dealt with quickly.  Shortly after that came the approval of a foreign air licence to Norwegian Air International from the secretary for aviation.  That was on the basis of it being compliant with the open skies agreement with the EU.  The matters Deputy Barry raised in respect of the employment of pilots have all been sorted out.<\/p><p>Vice President Biden was well aware of this and gave his support strongly for a quick conclusion.  It should be noted that, were this to be in operation now, Norwegian Air International would do for long-haul flights what Ryanair has done for short-haul flights, which would increase footfall through to the country generally in huge numbers either way across the Atlantic.  As I understand it, it is fully compliant with the European Union open skies policy and is backed by the European Commission.  This is not an administrative hold-up.  There were quite a number of objections from unions in the United States, which feared the employment of pilots from the Far East.  As I understand it, that matter has been resolved.  I hope this can become a reality quite quickly.<\/p> <p> Deputy Daly asked me to confirm that I would go back to speak to President Obama.  We can communicate with him anyway.  We will certainly do that because the Vice President undertook, after I spoke to him in Government Buildings, to speak to President Obama about this.  Obviously, we have given a report of the discussion that we had on that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600021#NN00300","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","time":1467803700,"counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600022#OO00150"},{"type":"question","time":1467803700,"counter":178,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[18144\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600022#OO00200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"to report on the recent meetings of the European Council that he has attended; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1330","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1467803700,"counter":179,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[19355\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600022#OO00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"his contribution at the European Council meeting on 28 June 2016 following the Brexit referendum result; and the response from member states to same.","asker":"1224","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1467803700,"counter":180,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[19375\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600022#OO00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"to report on the European Council meeting; and his agenda for European Council discussions in terms of the Government's strategy for dealing with the vote to exit the European Union by the electorate of the United Kingdom.","asker":"1353","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1467803700,"counter":181,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[19475\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600022#OO00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"to report on the two-day summit he attended in Brussels following the result of the referendum in the United Kingdom.","asker":"1254","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1467803700,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  I attended the European Council on 28 June and the informal meeting of 27 Heads of State and Government on 29 June.  The focus of both meetings was on the outcome of the UK referendum which took place on 23 June.  The European Council also considered, relatively briefly, a number of other issues, including migration, the Single Market, investment, economic and monetary union, taxation, agriculture, Libya, the EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy, EU-NATO co-operation, and the association agreement with Ukraine.  In an exchange on trade, I stressed that the Commission should continue to work towards agreeing the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, deal with the United States.  The British Prime Minister, David Cameron, attended the meeting on Tuesday, where all member states expressed regret at the outcome of the referendum but respect for the democratic decision of the UK electorate.<\/p>  <p>  At the meeting of the 27 leaders, it was agreed that there could be no negotiations until Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union was triggered, and that, while this will not happen immediately, it should take place as soon as possible.  The negotiations are likely to take at least two years and, in the meantime, the UK remains a full member of the Union.<\/p>  <p>  On the separate question of the future relationship between the UK and the EU, the UK side has yet to clarify what it wants.  There will be many complex and technical issues to consider.

The 27 leaders clarified that the European Council would direct the process, but the Commission and the European Parliament will also play important roles.<\/p>  <p>  At the meeting, I spoke about our long history with the UK, including the Northern Ireland peace process and our common entry to the EU in 1973.

Everybody is now well aware of the real risks to the well-being of our people as a result of the Brexit vote.  Yesterday, in his post-Council statement, the Taoiseach acknowledged that too lengthy a gap in the process of negotiation might prolong uncertainty, with negative consequences for businesses and consumer confidence.  Yesterday he spoke of the need for exploratory work to begin with the British Government.  The Taoiseach stated last week that the British Prime Minister wanted early bilateral engagements at senior official level and he went on to state that senior British officials met officials from the Department of the Taoiseach.  Can we get some sense of what issues were discussed, what progress, if any, was made, and when the next meetings will occur?  Could the Taoiseach also clarify the status of these engagements?<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has stated that he wants the Government represented at any EU-British negotiations in order to protect the interests of this State.  What has been the response to that?  Has the Taoiseach put that issue, and how has the EU - and, for that matter, the British Government - responded?  The Taoiseach rehearsed the issues which he quite rightly brought up at the Council meeting.  Can he give us some sense of how his concerns have been responded to?<\/p>  <p>  I will go back, if I may, to this issue of a national forum.  The Taoiseach stated it had merit and that it was a good idea.  Three of the Opposition leaders here have supported the proposition.  Will the Taoiseach meet these three leaders and others, if they want to be there, to discuss how we can advance this idea?  I also would argue strongly for, and welcome, an all-island framework and a whole-of-Government contingency framework as described by the Taoiseach.  That is appropriate because a partitionist approach to the development of strategy and policy in negotiation structures would put at risk, in particular, the gains that have been made for citizens since the Good Friday Agreement was achieved.<\/p>  <p>  I want to raise one specific issue.  There is an ongoing effort to achieve the building of the Narrow Water bridge project.  I recently visited the site with the Northern Minister for Finance.  Brexit strengthens the argument for proceeding with the project with all speed.  It does not weaken the argument.  A report was noted at the North-South ministerial meeting, but this is a project to enhance the tourist and economic potential of the Border region - both sides of the Border.  I ask the Taoiseach if he would be prepared to take an initiative on that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600022#OO00700","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1467803700,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Yesterday, the Taoiseach mentioned, both in his speech and in his reply, that the Council would lead the negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600022#OO00800","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1467803700,"counter":185,"content":"<p>The European Council will oversee the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600022#OO00900","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1467803700,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I put it to the Taoiseach that there is a view abroad that not only should the Council lead the process but it should appoint the negotiators on behalf of the Council to engage with the British Government on negotiating the Brexit situation, both the exiting process and the parallel process of building a new relationship with the United Kingdom.  Ideally, such a relationship would be something along the lines of the European Economic Area, particularly in view of the deal that was done for Norway, because Britain's access to the Single Market would benefit immeasurably the island of Ireland.  Anything short of that will cause difficulties.  These are issues for the incoming British Prime Minister, because they will have to swallow hard in the end of the day if the four pillars are to be observed in facilitating access to the Single Market.  This is important, because there has been some disquiet about the performance of the President of the European Commission, Mr. Juncker, and some of his commentary.<\/p>  <p>  In the immediate aftermath of the result, we needed cool heads.  First, one should always accept the democratic wishes of a people.  Whether one likes it or not and whether one agrees or disagrees, there should be respect for the will of the people as articulated in the ballot box.  That is the starting point in such a situation.  We all have made our contributions in terms of how it all happened, but the key point is that this is the starting point.  The Commission has, to a certain extent, compromised itself even before we start.  There has been a sense of getting even, or \"Let us move on quickly and move them on.\"  That kind of approach is not sane or sensible in the longer term.<\/p>  <p>  Looking at the longer term with regard to European Union coherence, the bottom line is that there needs to be a positive and constructive trading relationship with the United Kingdom.  Over time, that relationship needs to be built on proper values such as human rights.  Governments and democracies change, and therefore one must create a framework that can be adaptable over time to a changing political situation in the United Kingdom, which can certainly happen.<\/p><p> In terms of these negotiations, will the Taoiseach indicate if he has sought for Ireland to be represented on a negotiating team, given our unique and special trading, economic and social relationship with the UK?  We have a case to make that we should be on a negotiating team or have a representative on that team.  We have a unique contribution to make to the all-island dimension.  Europe has been an important backdrop to peace in Northern Ireland, including the PEACE fund and the other various funding mechanisms.  At this stage we should be working on a process that might seek to retain European Union supports for PEACE fund initiatives, reconciliation within the North and North-South engagement, interaction and projects.  We should put that proposition to the European Union, notwithstanding the UK wanting to exit.<\/p> <p> We should also put the proposition that there is a special issue with Northern Ireland.  I do not know how the United Kingdom would react to this but we should push the idea that under the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, the consent of the people in Northern Ireland is explicitly called for in terms of a united Ireland and the future of Northern Ireland.  Now, against the will of a majority of people in Northern Ireland, it will be taken out of the European Union.  There is an issue in terms of the future of Northern Ireland and the island of Ireland that is worth pursuing with the European Union.  It relates to the island economy and its political dispensation, and it is not something that can be glossed over as this issue unfolds.  The more people begin to realise the impact of Brexit - it is becoming more immediate by the day with real and hard impact on the streets and farms - the more people may begin to consider this in a different way, both within the North and across the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p> Is the Taoiseach's team in the Department looking at creating new structures for civil society dialogue, which has been underdeveloped in the North?  The parties were not enthusiastic about the civil society dialogue element of the Good Friday Agreement and it has been allowed to wither.  It never got off the ground.  Even politicians have said to us over the years that it is not something they want to entertain.  They were not too enthusiastic about it, truth be told.  Now, it is to be regretted, and I urge the Taoiseach to develop mechanisms for a robust civil society dialogue involving trade unions, farmers and business elements, as well as people in general.  We should get a dialogue going both North and South about the Brexit issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600022#OO01000","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467804300,"counter":188,"content":"<p>In the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, the Taoiseach provided a useful briefing for all leaders in Government Buildings.  Both the verbal and written presentation set out the strategic issues that needed to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  What is less clear to me since is the end game.  What is Ireland's objective, now we have had a chance for reflection?<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach stated yesterday that senior officials from the United Kingdom engaged with senior officials from the Irish Government in recent days.  What exactly was the framework in which that engagement happened?  Did the Irish team specify the desired outcome of the new position and whether the United Kingdom and Ireland could work in common effort to achieve those objectives?<\/p>  <p>  What is the Taoiseach's view on the timing of the invocation of Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty?  As Deputy Martin stated, there are various signals coming from leaders in Europe and those we look to for leadership.  In short, the attitude of European Commission President Juncker is, \"Here's your hat, what's your hurry?\"  The attitude of my socialist colleague, Mr. Martin Schulz, in the European Parliament was not an awful lot better, initially at least.  There was a little more measured response from President Tusk.  We need a specific attitude from Ireland as the strategic issues are so important for this country and the people of this entire island.  We must know what our objective will be and how we will work towards it.  From an Irish perspective, when would be the optimal invocation of Article 50?  This is entirely a matter for the United Kingdom but we should have a view with respect to our interaction with good friends in the United Kingdom as to when Article 50 should be invoked.<\/p>  <p>  As I indicated yesterday, should we in the interim work on a bilateral strategy between Ireland and the UK before we engage in a trilateral way between Ireland, the UK and the European Union to see what is the best common outcome for the people of Britain and Ireland?  I have not got external legal advice on this matter but my reading of Article 50 is that the framework for negotiations will be set by the Council.  It indicates the negotiations will be conducted by the Union and I am not sure what that means.  It has been said it is overseen by the Council but who does the negotiations?  Is that clear yet?  What inputs can we have as of right into those negotiations because our strategic interest is so much greater than virtually everybody else's, aside from the United Kingdom itself?<\/p>  <p>  The interim arrangements were touched on again by Deputy Martin.  The negotiations are ongoing on planning the expenditure of the INTERREG moneys that we negotiated in government.  I negotiated the PEACE IV moneys as there was no great enthusiasm from the British to have a new programme.  During the negotiations for the multi-annual financial framework, Britain wanted to reduce expenditure and did not want to be seen to advocate additional expenditure in any area.  The Taoiseach did much work on this and he knows the British attitude was that while they would not obstruct work on PEACE IV, they would not be overt advocates for it.  What is the state of the projects now?  Deputy Adams would be familiar with many of them.  It was expected they would be funded over the next seven years, but will that now happen?  Is there any interim arrangement or is it all on hold until the Brexit negotiations conclude?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600023#PP00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1467804300,"counter":189,"content":"<p>The 15 minutes allocated for this block of questions has elapsed.

Was there any serious discussion at the European Council about why people took the Brexit decision and how the EU should respond?  It seems there is an increasing mood across Europe against the EU.  There is an article in <i>The Daily Telegraph<\/i>, for example, suggesting a tsunami of referendums that might take place across Europe, as there is potential for 33 referendums to be called by different states.  Not all the people calling for those referendums are right wing and racist - far from it - and in one poll, nearly half of voters in eight big European states wanted to be able to vote on whether they should be a member of the European Union.  In France, for example, there is a major strike ongoing against French and EU austerity, emanating from the EU neoliberal agenda.  A poll indicates 38% of people in France had a favourable attitude to the EU and 62% had a negative attitude.<\/p><p>President Tusk, in writing about Brexit's outcome, indicates that it is clear that too many people in Europe are unhappy with the current state of affairs, on the national or European level, and they &quot;expect us to do better&quot;.<\/p><p>There must be more serious discussion among the ruling elite in Europe as to why the fifth largest economy in the world has taken this decision.<\/p> <p> Was there any discussion about the growing militarisation in Europe?  The image we had of the EU in this Chamber is of a benevolent and progressive institution, but the image many people on the ground have is of an increasingly undemocratic institution, which is racist in the way that it is disgracefully corralled.  The poorest people in the world, who are trying to escape war and poverty, much of the war generated by the EU, and trying to reach freedom, are being penned in in Turkey by the deal the EU has done.  It congratulated itself on that deal, saying it has made its borders secure, by keeping out some of the poorest people in the world.  It is an incredible state of affairs.<\/p> <p> Finally, in respect of events in Britain, does the Taoiseach have a response to the Chilcot report?  The Chilcot report has been released in the last hour and it essentially finds that the British Government of the time, and Tony Blair in particular, chose to join the invasion of Iraq before all other peaceful options had been exhausted.  It is now becoming crystal clear how the British Civil Service and the British Government duped others into believing there was a serious threat, regarding weapons of mass destruction and 45 minutes.  I read an article and the EU summit agreed with that decision.  This was two days after millions of ordinary people across Europe marched against the threat of war.  We had one of the biggest marches in this country on that issue.  Two days after that, the EU met in Brussels and agreed a resolution that expressly approved that war - it approved it as a last resort, but nonetheless it approved it - and condemned Saddam Hussein, etc.  The impression is being given that the EU is a wonderful institution, which is neutral, benevolent, or whatever.<\/p> <p> I made this point yesterday and I wonder if the Taoiseach would agree that actually there have been some very good developments in Britain since the Brexit result.  David Cameron is gone, Boris Johnson is gone, and Nigel Farage is gone.  Within the British Labour Party we have a battle for the leadership of the party, with the Blairite pro-war people who duped everybody and who have blood on their hands trying to oust Jeremy Corbyn.  I am hoping the Taoiseach will send a message of support to Jeremy Corbyn following the Chilcot report for being on the right side of history on that occasion, because I think he should be sent that message.  There will be a battle, but I think the membership will win and there could be a left-wing trend in the British Labour Party.  There will be a general election and possibly a left Labour Party, so it is not all bad, actually.  In terms of ordinary people across Europe, the people who feel the effects of the decisions of the elite and the austerity that is imposed, it could be a beacon for others to follow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600023#PP00600","speaker":"1254","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467804900,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Deputy Adams raised the leaders meeting.

That is an issue.<\/p><p>Deputy Martin mentioned the oversight of this by the European Council.  There are three institutions, as Deputies are aware: the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council.  Obviously the Parliament has grown in importance over the past number of years.  The theory here was that the European Commission has always had the expertise in and the experience of dealing with negotiations from countries that wanted to join the European Union.  Equally, that experience is there in this first instance in which a country wishes to leave the European Union, but there was a very strong feeling around the table that it is the European Council, that is, the elected Heads of State or Government, that should oversee this politically.  It is a matter for the European Council to give a mandate to the Commission in the nature of any negotiations to be conducted.  I would assume - I would make this case very strongly, because we are the country that is most affected by the Brexit decision - that we would be in there at those negotiations as part of the European Council oversight of the work being done by the Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600024#QQ00600","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1467804900,"counter":199,"content":"<p>Does that mean as part of the 27?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600024#QQ00700","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1467804900,"counter":200,"content":"<p>It is not finalised yet, but it is the European Council, that is, the leaders of the different countries, that will oversee the political process here, so we will have to see to it that this is not left just to the Commission, which has the expertise.

From our point of view, it would be very important that, as Ireland is at the apex of the journey towards the UK and the EU, we are central to these negotiations and we will have to put a facility in place for that.<\/p><p>We mentioned the PEACE funds.  We are co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  I like to think that, irrespective of what negotiations take place, the European Union itself is a peace process, which was founded after the Second World War, as Deputies are aware, but it is very important to understand that leaders are well aware of the importance of the peace process and they are well aware of the importance of the moneys put up by Europe for PEACE IV, negotiated by Deputy Howlin, and the<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>INTERREG funds that were put in place during our own EU Presidency.  I would like to think that, because of its importance, we would be able to keep those funds in place.<\/p><p>Deputy Martin mentioned a civil society dialogue.  I think some form of that is necessary.  That is what I had in mind about having conversations, North and South.<\/p><p>As I said, I do not have a mandate to negotiate for Northern Ireland but I have a duty and a responsibility to understand the common challenges that our people face.  If we are to be in a negotiating situation it is important to know this.  <\/p> <p> If and when Britain removes itself from the European Council, whoever the Taoiseach is at the time will be the only representative of the British Isles at the European Council table.  It is important that we understand the many challenges we will face.  We want Britain to have access to the Single Market but in so doing we also want it to accept the four fundamental principles of the European Union and that will be a challenge for whoever is elected as the new Prime Minister.  If they decide that they want to limit immigration and migration it will be very strongly resisted by the European Council, where freedom of movement is a fundamental principle.  We do not know who will be elected but Theresa May or whoever it is will have to set out their stall.<\/p> <p> People asked about the triggering of Article 50.  Nothing can happen until that happens.  I have said that I think it important that the new Prime Minister be elected first, and that will happen by 9 September.  He or she should then have some time to reflect on their strategies, objectives and intentions.  What does Britain want?  Does it want a mechanism like Norway?  Does it want a mechanism like Switzerland, or Canada, or Singapore?  Maybe it wants something new, something British.  From our point of view, the common travel area, the Border, the peace process and access to our trading links are all important so the nearer Britain is to the Single Market, the better for us.

Second, as I made clear publicly over the weekend and in the early part of this week, I am putting equal focus in my Department on the 23 unions that are inside the Lansdowne Road agreement while putting due focus on those three representative bodies who are outside it.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the other points the Deputy put to me, pay issues for public servants are currently determined within the constraints set by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Acts 2009 to 2015, while the industrial relations environment is managed under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2013-2018.  The programme for Government contains a strong commitment to the Lansdowne Road agreement and gives a framework for the next few years for the Government's proposals for ongoing public service reform as well as setting out an agreed pathway to pay restoration for public servants that is affordable to taxpayers, at a cost of &euro;844 million over three years.<\/p>  <p>  As I have always said, I believe this agreement offers the best framework for reconciling the wage needs of those who provide our public services with the broader needs of those who depend upon the delivery of public services.<\/p>  <p>  This agreement is now in operation for the vast majority of public servants.  Over 280,000 public servants are inside the Lansdowne Road agreement.  A point I have made, and I made it again to Deputy Cullinane, is that we need to put equal focus on those public servants who are inside the agreement and the 23 unions that voted for it.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has to, and will, respect and keep faith with the decisions of the vast majority of public servants to come within the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The benefits of and the protections afforded by the agreement will therefore apply to those people who are inside the framework.  Those not represented by a body that is inside the agreement will have the relevant provisions of the FEMPI Act apply to them, and will not benefit from the protections and benefits afforded by the agreement, including incremental progression, inclusion of the supervision and substitution allowance in the salary scale of teachers, and the protections negotiated in 2010 regarding compulsory redundancies.<\/p>  <p>  The Government does not want to be in dispute with any group of people working for it.  The recent decisions by the AGSI and the Teachers' Union of Ireland are clear examples of the progress that has been made in bringing more associations within the Lansdowne Road agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The agreement is also flexible enough to allow for the concerns of recent recruits to the public service to be addressed in a negotiated way.  I confirm to the House that in that context, officials of my Department and the Department of Education and Skills agreed yesterday with the INTO and the TUI, both unions inside the agreement, to have engagement later this month to begin to fully scope out the issues involving pay arrangements for newly qualified teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600026#SS01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1467806100,"counter":231,"content":"<p>The Minister said he had no intention of punishing those public sector workers who are outside the terms of the Lansdowne Road agreement, but then went on to set out exactly how he will punish them.

Has the Minister taken legal advice in this regard and, if so, what did it state?  By any measure, the State is no longer in an emergency situation.  For that reason, does the Minister accept that there is a very strong case for accelerating the restoration of public sector pay, particularly for low-paid workers, many of whom still qualify for family income supplement, and pensioners? <\/p>  <p>  I refer to new recruits.  Does the Minister accept the urgency of the situation?  Many young teachers are heading off to places such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi to try to get some money together in order that they can live in Dublin, in particular.  This is a wholly unsatisfactory situation.  Teachers, nurses and garda&iacute; are affected.

The Minister is maintaining that in the new agreement.  The reason the ASTI and others have not signed up to the agreement is that they are not willing any longer to go into the staff room and look young teachers in the eye when some people are earning higher pay and others are not.  The media is very fond of saying that the unions sold out young teachers.  Here is a union taking a stand against selling out young teachers and they are being blackguarded as a result.

I, too, am acutely aware of the flooding that happened throughout the country last winter.  I will cut to the chase.  The total funding available to the Office of Public Works for its overall flood risk management programme in 2016 is &euro;80.746 million.  This amount includes expenditure on capital flood relief works, drainage maintenance activities, the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme, purchase of plant and equipment, hydrometric and hydrological investigation and monitoring, and the general administration costs for operating the entire programme.<\/p><p>Of the total allocation, &euro;52.561 million has been provided in 2016 for expenditure on flood relief capital works. This amount provides for the preparation and design of flood relief schemes, the construction of flood relief works, the payment of compensation costs arising from these works and the carrying out of minor coastal and non-coastal works by local authorities with funding provided by the OPW under the minor works scheme.  It also provides for the carrying out of CFRAM studies.  The 2016 allocation includes a deferred surrender or capital carryover of &euro;7 million from the 2015 allocation.<\/p><p>The expenditure to date by the Office of Public Works in 2016 on the flood risk management programme has been &euro;23.223 million.  Good progress is being made on the implementation of all of the main elements of the programme.  In relation to the capital works element of the programme in particular, major schemes in Ennis, Waterford and the River Wad in Dublin will be completed this year.  Works are continuing on the major schemes in Bray, on the River Dodder in Dublin and on the quays in Dublin.  The Deputy will be pleased to know that works have now commenced on the River Clare scheme in Claregalway, contracts have been signed for Skibbereen and Bandon and the contractors are mobilising.  The schemes at Templemore, Foynes and Dunkellin, again in Galway, are expected to commence construction in 2016.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.<\/i><\/p><p>Another 21 schemes will continue to be advanced through design and planning stages.<\/p><p>Smaller-scale flood relief works continue to be funded in 2016 through the OPW's minor works scheme, which puts local authorities in funds to carry out more localised flood mitigation measures.  Expenditure of &euro;2.5 million to &euro;3 million is anticipated on this scheme in 2016.  Approximately 30 projects have been approved for funding to date in 2016, which brings the total number approved since 2009 when the scheme was introduced to 544, with total expenditure of &euro;30 million approximately.<\/p><p>Good progress continues to be made this year also on the implementation of the CFRAM programme.  The programme involves the production of predictive flood mapping for 300 areas of significant flood risk, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans for those areas.<\/p><p>The draft flood mapping is now being finalised, work on the development of preliminary options to address flood risk is under way, leading to the development of integrated flood risk management plans containing specific measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified.  The draft plans are scheduled to be made available for public consultation from mid-2016.  Following the public consultation process, the finalised plans will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost-effective manner.<\/p><p>The Government recently announced increased levels of investment in the area of flood relief as part of the overall capital investment plan 2016-2021 and this investment programme will allow for consideration of measures arising from the flood risk management plans.<\/p><p>Arising out of the particular difficulties experienced last winter by home owners along the Shannon, the Government decided on 5 January 2016 to establish the Shannon flood State agency co-ordination working group to enhance ongoing co-operation across all of the State agencies involved with the River Shannon.  The group has met on three occasions to date and has conducted an audit of the roles and responsibilities of State agency organisations and has published its Shannon flood risk work programme for 2016.  This work programme, which is available on the OPW website, sets out co-ordinated actions and activities for the Shannon catchment.  The group has engaged in a programme of public consultation and has held a series of open days on its work programme.  It is also considering, in co-operation with the Attorney General's office, the development of appropriate guidance that will set out more clearly the rights and responsibilities of non-statutory bodies in relation to watercourses.<\/p><p>An interdepartmental flood policy co-ordination group, established to support the OPW&rsquo;s CFRAM programme, was reconvened in July 2015.  This group is looking at a range of policy issues, including insurance, community resilience, individual property protection, a national flood forecasting and warning service, a review of the planning and development guidelines and, if necessary, voluntary home relocation to ensure that policies that can benefit communities and individuals directly - to be prepared and respond to or live with flood risk - are fully and carefully considered.  The report of the group will be finalised for submission to Government shortly, in conjunction with the completion of the draft flood risk management plans. <\/p><p>I think it is clear from the foregoing that a very considerable amount of work is under way by the OPW to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the problem of flooding and flood risk nationally.  It will take time for all of these measures to have effect, but it is important that the right solutions are found and put in place that will provide a lasting protection to those communities affected by flooding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600031#XX01200","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1467809100,"counter":363,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's public servants have provided him with a lot of information.

I give the Minister of State a good example.  As he knows, there was severe flooding during that period in south Mayo, from Cong, The Neale and right across towards Claremorris.

In other areas in Mayo and Galway similar minor works applications have been made continuously since 2015 and that is replicated across the country.  However, local authorities could be submitting more of these applications.  Funding is there for works that happened last year and up to &euro;500,000 can be provided if they meet the criteria.<\/p>  <p>  Our major projects are taking far too long to bring through the process so we can get construction on site.

The issue relates to the purchase of a site for a national school in County Cork, Rochestown Educate Together national school.  It is a relatively new school that was set up in 2013.  It is a fabulous school under the leadership of Dr. Alan Sheehan.  Having visited the school on a number of occasions, I can say that there is a palpable sense of enthusiasm within the school.  They are passionate about education, but they are facing serious accommodation difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  Since the school was established three years ago, staff and students have been accommodated in temporary accommodation in the grounds of Douglas Hall soccer club.  They are grateful for that and it has worked reasonably well since then.  However, the reality is that the school is growing rapidly and for the forthcoming school year, 2016-17, it expects to have in the region of 140 pupils attending the school so it will have to split across two campuses, Garryduff in Rochestown and the existing site.  Clearly, that presents practical difficulties for parents and staff but they will get over them.  The prize they are awaiting is confirmation that a site has been purchased for the permanent school building.  <\/p>  <p>  I am hoping the Minister can shed some light on this issue today.  At the end of 2015, the school was included in an announcement by the former Minister as going to construction in 2017.  It is now July 2016 and there is still no confirmation of a site being bought so that deadline is looming large on the horizon.  I hope the Minister can provide some clarity on that issue.  <\/p>  <p>  I know from communicating with NAMA that a site of over 20 acres in the heart of Douglas is being sold by a receiver appointed by NAMA.  I understand that this site is \"sale agreed\" with the Department of Education and Skills possibly with a view to accommodating Rochestown Educate Together national school and the new second level Educate Together school which is due to open in temporary accommodation this September.  The Department will not confirm that and has informed the school that the site is not being purchased with a view to accommodating the school.  I hope the Minister can provide some clarity on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I observed a Topical Issue debate last night where the Minister of State with responsibility for training and skills responded to another Deputy about a school.  The Minister of State said the existing contractual commitments for 2016 now fully account for the funding that was allocated for 2016 under the previous Government and implied that no new commitments would be made in terms of school buildings as in contracts signed.<\/p><p>Will the Minister confirm if that is the case?  Does it also relate to entering into a contractual commitment to buy sites?  Will the Minister confirm if the Department is in a position to do that because the contracts are with the Department for the site in question, which is in the heart of Douglas and which the Department says it is not buying with a view to accommodating this particular school.  It is sale agreed.  The Department is doing work in terms of land surveying and geotesting on that site.  I hope the Minister can provide clarity for the teachers, staff and parents so they can at least see a pathway to the acquisition of a site and the building of a permanent school building.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600034#AAA01800","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467811500,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McGrath for raising the matter.  I share his enthusiasm for the development of this school under Dr. Alan Sheehan.  There is no doubt it is a very popular school.  It opened in 2013 and is in temporary accommodation.  The last Minister for Education and Skills included it in the current six-year construction plan announced in November 2015.  It was designated to go to construction in 2017 but a permanent site is required to accommodate this new school building.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the then Minister for Education and Skills signed a memorandum of understanding between my Department and the County and City Managers Association in 2012.  This memorandum of understanding fosters increased levels of co-operation and formalises the local authorities' part in identifying and securing sites for educational use.  In this context, my Department has been working closely with Cork County Council towards acquiring a permanent site to meet the needs of the new primary school.  A number of potentially suitable sites were identified and were comprehensively technically assessed.  Specific aspects relating to the development of some of the sites under consideration required significant investigation.  In addition, the plans for infrastructure to access the Douglas area were also under review and clarifications about access to some sites have been required.  The Department has examined several options, none of which provided a straightforward solution.  The process has involved considerable discussions with relevant vendors and the local authority on the options considered.  I can confirm that, subsequent to the analysis which has been carried out, a site option has been identified and it is being actively progressed.  Given the commercial sensitivities associated with land acquisitions generally, I am not in a position to comment further at this time.  I assure the Deputy that the acquisition of a suitable site for the school is very active on the programme of site acquisitions.  My officials are aware of the limitations of the current temporary accommodation and every effort is being made to secure a suitable permanent site for the school as expeditiously as possible.  Officials from my Department will be in contact with the relevant school authorities once the site acquisition process has been completed.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy raised a couple of other issues.  On the issue of sites, the budget for school construction to which the Deputy and the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, referred is separate from the budget for site acquisitions.  The fact that the projects fully absorb our capacity for 2016 does not impinge on our capacity to conclude site deals.  I am not in a position to enter into commentary on any specific site.  For good, historical reasons there is a commercial sensitivity and until a deal is finalised it is not helpful to speculate on any individual site.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600035#BBB00200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1467811500,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

Hopefully, if I am joining the dots correctly, the site in question is the one currently at contract stage with the Department of Education and Skills though I understand the Minister is not in a position to confirm that.  I welcome the fact the Department is in a position generally to enter into contractual commitments to purchase land with a view to accommodating schools and that the exhaustion of public funds in terms of commitments for school building does not apply to the acquisition of land.  That is welcome.<\/p>  <p>  There is an urgency about this.  The school is moving to a split campus situation for the forthcoming school year, 2016-2017.  There will be sufficient capacity across those two sites for one further school year - the 2017-2018 school year - but that is it then.  At that point it will be in serious trouble.  It is taking in two junior infant classes every year and there is growing demand for places at the school.  It is in an area of very large population growth.  There are a lot of young families in the Rochestown-Douglas area and there is a demand for this school.  I ask the Minister to take a personal interest in this case to ensure the file does not gather dust, that the site is actually purchased and the next steps are then taken to move this through the process because when it comes to preliminary design, planning applications, tendering and so forth, to have this school going to construction next year is a challenge.  I hope it can be co-located with the second level Educate Together school for the south suburbs area of Cork city which is opening in temporary accommodation at Nagle Community College this coming September.

It employs almost 16,000 people directly.  The number of passengers using the airport reached 25 million in 2015 and in the first five months of 2016 these numbers increased by 14% in a year-on-year comparison.  Mr. Kevin Toland, the CEO of DAA, whom I met at his briefing last week, stated that the development of the new north runway will support around 1,200 extra jobs and ultimately create another 30,000 jobs.  While this further growth and economic impact of Dublin airport is strongly welcomed it is imperative we do not lose sight of the responsibilities of the Dublin Airport Authority to the residents and locality surrounding the airport which is impacted by noise pollution and pollution to the environment.  Over the years I have made representations to the DAA on very early take off and high noise levels over Clonshaugh, Coolock and Artane, generally when the wind is coming from the east.  Recently I made a number of representations to the chief executive, Kevin Toland, and his staff on behalf of residents from the Offington area, the Howth peninsula and Sutton due to their complaints about take offs from 4.55 a.m.  In the late 1980s the 10R-28L runway was built without any planning conditions, no environmental impact study or night flight restrictions.  At the time the St. Margaret's community council battled against Aer Rianta for appropriate insulation against noise pollution for the homes affected.  The insulation scheme which was implemented at the time is apparently the one now being offered to those affected by the north runway without any review of whether it is still an appropriate level of insulation.  Will the Minister confirm this?  What research has the DAA carried out to show it is a proper level of insulation?  The new north runway is not expected to have night flights though the DAA is saying it will fight that planning condition, meaning that the old 10R-28L runway will have night flights.  Residents affected, who I represent, recognise the importance of the growth of the airport, particularly in the light of Brexit.  They are simply asking to be treated fairly, with great consideration and the same treatment as those affected by the new north runway, given that the international legislative environment was very different 25 years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600035#BBB00600","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1467811500,"counter":422,"content":"<p>There are two issues here, both connected.  The first is the old runway at Dublin Airport.  Residents within the contours of the old runway are concerned that increased flights, emissions and traffic will compound the problems they already experience.  As Deputy Broughan said, they feel hard done by that the original runway was not subject to the same planning conditions or environmental impact study requirements.<\/p><p>They are worried that the mitigation measures that will be available to those coming within the contours of the new runway may be superior to the protection that they get or do not get, as the case may be.<\/p> <p> There is a second issue which is of critical importance, and that is the new runway itself.  We must register that this application is being made now almost ten years after the permission was given in a completely different type of world that we live in.  Even then, with lesser criteria on noise and environmental protection than we have now, the condition applied was that the DAA should not loosen up on its restrictions on night flights.  Anybody who went to the briefing last week will be aware that the DAA is explicit in its intention to break that condition that was applied years ago when conditions were less stringent than they are now and that is completely unacceptable to the local communities in the area.<\/p> <p> There is a significant issue that the current proposal is to insulate homes that would experience noise levels of 63 dB or above, but night noise levels of 40 dB to 55 dB are known to have adverse health effects according to the World Health Organization, WHO.  It is a little annoying that the WHO changed its recommendation on night noise maximums in 2009, two years after the planning permission was granted at a level of 63 dB.  We cannot have that.  With the current knowledge, we cannot ignore the health and safety impacts on residents in that community.

I met the DAA last week on the same day as it was making the presentation in Buswells, and I put some of those points to them to take away.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, DAA has a statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop Dublin Airport, including the provision of infrastructure necessary to meet existing and future demand, such as the north runway project.  The DAA was granted planning permission in 2007 for a second parallel runway and the necessary lands have been preserved for such a project since the 1960s.  However, due to the downturn in the economy, the project was not progressed.  Given the significant increase in passenger numbers at Dublin Airport in recent years and the projected traffic growth in future years, it is clear that a second parallel runway is needed.<\/p>  <p>  Against this background, the DAA announced its decision to proceed with the development of the north runway project in April 2016.  The DAA expects construction to commence in early 2017 with the runway operational by 2020.  The planning permission granted for the second parallel runway in 2007 had 31 conditions attached and is valid for ten years.  I should point out that planning matters are the responsibility of the relevant local authority, Fingal County Council in the case of Dublin Airport, or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as appropriate.  Two of the conditions relating to noise operating restrictions are of particular concern to DAA in that they would result, DAA states, in operations across the entire airport being restricted during the night, between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m., to limit noise impacts on the surrounding area.  The constraints are such that flights at the airport in the peak hour between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. would have to be cut back by approximately one third.  Over the last number of months, DAA has been examining the scope of a further environmental impact statement, EIS, for the purpose of seeking a review of the operating restrictions foreseen for Dublin Airport under the existing planning permission for the north runway.  I understand that a public consultation has now commenced to explain why changes are being sought to the two planning conditions and to provide an opportunity for stakeholders to contribute to the content of and the approach to be adopted in the EIS process.  Regarding the issue of noise, EU Regulation 598\/14 relating to the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at EU airports entered into force last month.  This regulation sets out the process to be followed when deciding on noise-related operating restrictions and involves consideration of all potential aircraft noise mitigation measures.  The regulation provides for consultation with interested parties, including local residents living in the vicinity of the airport.  The new noise regulation presents an opportunity to establish a modern, cohesive and measured approach to the management of noise at Irish airports which is capable of delivering the best outcome for all stakeholders.  With a view to ensuring the most effective implementation of the new noise regulation in Ireland, my Department is currently working on the detailed technical arrangements to be set down in regulations that I intend to make in this regard as soon as possible.  Finally, I met with senior officials of DAA last week to discuss a number of issues, one of which was the north runway project.  The DAA advised that it is very conscious of balancing the national needs in delivering an essential piece of infrastructure while minimising impacts on local communities.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, DAA briefed me on its engagement with residents on the project and outlined the various strands of work underway on the project, which include the discharging of pre-commencement planning conditions relating to noise mitigation measures, such as the voluntary insulation and house buyout scheme which will be available to residents whose houses are most impacted.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, they spoke about the substantial public consultation and communications programme they have commenced which will continue as the north runway project develops.  I understand that these information sessions will provide relevant and accessible information to stakeholders about the planning permission that has been granted, what will be built, when it will be built, how it will be built and how any issues will be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600036#CCC00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1467812100,"counter":425,"content":"<p>The Minister referred to EU Regulation 598\/14, some new legislation he would be bringing in, detailed technology arrangements etc.  Does the Government intend to introduce a general noise Bill?

That morning glut is all about aircraft going out and come back in time for a second leg.<\/p>  <p>  The profits of airlines are of a lesser concern to the well-being of the local community.  It is unacceptable that those conditions would be breached and that we would not have a cost-benefit analysis on this proposal.  Such an analysis needs to be done holistically.  I hope the Minister takes those points into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600036#CCC00400","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1467812100,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies again for bringing this to my attention.

It is an issue on which I have campaigned for a number of years so I hope we can work together on it.<\/p>  <p>  This issue is addressed to the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and I refer to the crisis in University Hospital Limerick, as over the past seven days the number of people on trolleys has consistently been the highest in the State.  Today there are 30 people on trolleys, yesterday and the day before it there were 40 people on trolleys, while on 1 July there were 30 people on trolleys.  Will the Minister of State relay the following questions to the Minister?  What steps does he intend to take in dealing with the issue?  When does he expect the new accident and emergency department at the hospital to be fully operational?  A press release in August 2015 from Professor Colette Cowan, the chief executive officer of the hospital group, stated that the new facility would be delivered in the first quarter of 2017 rather than the previously revised date of December 2016.  In response to a question at the regional health forum meeting in June 2015, Professor Cowan indicated that capital funding is approved and in place and the group was working towards the completion of an accident and emergency department by the end of 2016.  However, at a briefing by Professor Cowan in May this year that I attended, she stated the expected completion date is now March 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the ongoing crisis and the fact that University Hospital Limerick has the distinction of having the highest number of sick and ill patients on trolleys, when will the new accident and emergency department be in operation?  Will the Minister of State give an assurance today on the floor of the House that the opening will bring an end to the trolley crisis, as people are on trolleys instead of beds in University Hospital Limerick?  I refer specifically to an opening date rather than completion date, as there is a massive difference in the terms.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Minister of State know the additional bed capacity requirements to enable the new accident and emergency department to function without the chronic overcrowding that exists now?  This crisis will only be resolved when more beds are delivered.  We are dealing with people and not just figures, and unfortunately many of them are waiting for hours and, in some cases, days for care.  Many of them are elderly.  We must resolve the crisis as quickly as possible and I ask for urgent action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600037#DDD00200","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1467812700,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I am taking this Topical Issue matter on behalf of the Minister.  I welcome this chance to update the House on the current position on the accident and emergency department at University Hospital Limerick.  Pressure on accident and emergency departments throughout the country has been rising as the population is both growing and ageing.  Accident and emergency department attendances have been significantly higher this year, and the HSE has reported an average increase in accident and emergency department attendances of nearly 6% compared with the same period last year.  The accident and emergency department in University Hospital Limerick is one of the busiest in the country, with more than 60,000 attendances annually.  Of those presenting, the proportion of patients requiring admission has also increased.<\/p>  <p>  I completely accept that delays at accident and emergency departments are upsetting and distressing for patients and families.  It has long been recognised and accepted that the current accident and emergency department at University Hospital Limerick is not fit for purpose.  A new state-of-the-art accident and emergency department, which will triple the size of the current department, is being fitted out and is scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2017.  Once built, the experience of accident and emergency department patients will improve immeasurably in terms of comfort, privacy and dignity.  Pending completion of the new accident and emergency department, the university hospitals group is following the system-wide escalation framework agreed by the national accident and emergency department task force and issued to hospital groups in December 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Actions being taken to relieve the pressure on University Hospital Limerick accident and emergency department include the transfer of suitable patients from the hospital to model 2 hospitals in the region, including Ennis, Nenagh, St John's and Croom.  Also, and where appropriate, patients are being transferred to community care settings.  I know that staff in the hospital are working very closely with community intervention teams to provide antibiotics and other basic care in a patient's home or care facility.  This will, it is hoped, facilitate hospital avoidance as well as early discharge.  With such a system, people might be able to go home rather than stay in hospital.  In addition, extra ward rounds are being conducted and elective surgery is being kept under review.  Extra ward rounds are being done in order that people may be discharged more quickly.<\/p>  <p>  The hospital is also communicating with local GPs to ensure patients are referred to the accident and emergency department only where necessary and encouraging appropriate use of local injury units.  In the mid-west, there are now three local injuries units in St. John's, Ennis and Nenagh.  These units are equipped to see patients with minor injuries and play a significant role in diverting patients from the accident and emergency department.  In 2015, over 30% of unscheduled care patients were seen in one of these units.  An awareness programme to inform the public of the range of services provided by these units was launched in autumn 2015.<\/p>  <p>  I fully acknowledge the difficulties the current surge in accident and emergency department activity is causing for patients and their families.  It is also important that I acknowledge that the staff are doing their utmost to provide safe and quality care in very challenging circumstances.  I assure the Deputy that addressing accident and emergency department overcrowding is and will remain a priority for this Government.  In that regard I am confident that the issue in University Hospital Limerick will be significantly improved in 2017 with the opening of the new accident and emergency department.  I do not have a date for the opening but I will ask the Minister to revert to the Deputy on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600037#DDD00300","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1467812700,"counter":434,"content":"<p>It is difficult to respond as the Minister is not here, but I hope the Minister of State will relay my comments to him.

The amalgamation caused the crisis and the Minister of State mentioned the hospitals at Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's.  Closing the accident and emergency departments in those facilities caused the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Is the expected opening in March 2017?  If the date has been decided, has the Minister drawn up plans to incorporate existing accident and emergency staff into the new department?  In that context has the Minister spoken to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, the Irish Medical Organisation and other relevant unions and representative associations who will be involved in amalgamating the staff?<\/p>  <p>  If the new unit is established, what new skills will be required?  How is the recruitment drive for the accident and emergency department proceeding?  In the framework of the hospital's operational plan for 2016, it states that the hospital will need to reduce total staff numbers in 2016 to achieve financial targets contained within the acute hospital division operational plan.<\/p>  <p>  Is there any plan to reform and invest in modern diagnostic services, such as X-ray scanners, ultrasounds, etc. that will allow faster turnaround of patients?

I also acknowledge, as the Minister has done in his reply, that the other hospitals in the region are helping out at a critical time when patients' needs are rising, people are getting older and more people are attending the emergency department.  It is imperative that we inform people that where there are other facilities within a county, people should also use those.  They might be only step-down facilities and there might be units that are not fully equipped to deal with emergencies, so only those cases that need to go to the emergency department should go there.

St. Mary's in Drumcar is run by the St. John of God's order and for many years there has been an excellent relationship between the staff and the order and, indeed, the users.  However, as Drumcar moves into a transition phase, going from a congregated setting to different alternative living for those who will become their former residents, its budget is still very significant.  I understand it is around &euro;24 million per year.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State can imagine my concerns when in the last few weeks I have had a number of constituents ringing me, all of them regretfully in tears and very upset, looking for an increased level of care in terms of the respite their family members need.  Their family members, in each case, have an intellectual disability.  One of them occupies a respite bed in St. Mary's in Drumcar for three weeks and then on the fourth week of the month they are forced to leave that respite bed in the proper place and to go to a private nursing home, notwithstanding the excellence of care there.  It is inappropriate and unacceptable to the family and, indeed, to the person who is in that bed, because they leave their familiar surroundings and they are put into an entirely inappropriate place with people who are much older than them.  Some of those people are in their 90s, while the person I am talking about is in their 40s.  When the person's mother is on the phone and she is crying and upset, one says this is not good enough.  That is followed by another mother, who is concerned about a family member whom she looks after at home.  Every three months the family member gets excellent respite in St. Mary's, Drumcar, but it keeps being cancelled.  It was cancelled the week before last and I rang up and asked what was happening with this person, then it was cancelled again last week.  People who are getting older are unable to continue without the reasonable respite that Drumcar has always offered them.  That is another case.<\/p>  <p>  I also have another member of a different family who has an adult with intellectual disabilities and is unable to get an appropriate and proper medical appointment and assessment for them due to behavioural issues which arise in terms of their disability and their inability to communicate.  In fact, there are many difficulties in the house because the person with disabilities has increasing anxieties and concerns and needs to be properly looked after.  All of them have been brought to the attention of Drumcar and to the attention of the HSE.  To date, they remain unresolved.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State look at the issue, not just the cases of the people who have come to me, but the wider issue of the emerging needs in our communities?  As the institutions close, continuing professional respite and help for these people must be available.  It is very important to families who look after their loved ones.  I am talking about people in their 60s, 70s and 80s who are looking after their children as they grow older, still with concern for them.  They love and care for their families and they just feel the State is neglecting them in this hour of need.<\/p>  <p>  When one contrasts the tremendous work of the staff and the community of St. John of God's with the scandal of the under-the-table payments to senior executives that were announced recently, it is absolutely unacceptable that this can happen.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State will intervene immediately and urgently, so that the care these people need comes first and always first.  These people must be looked after and I look forward to the Minister of State's response and, indeed, his actions.  I know they will be appropriate, but it is unacceptable that the scandal of payments under the counter would continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600038#EEE00300","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1467813300,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Fergus O'Dowd for raising this important issue.  I commend him for his work as a strong advocate for people with disabilities in the County Louth area and particularly in relation to this issue of St. Mary's in Drumcar and the PEER project, which I am also working on.<\/p>  <p>  I will outline my position on services for people with disabilities who need residential supports from the health service.  This Government - I emphasise it is a partnership Government - is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide them with greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  I am acutely aware of the changing needs of people with disabilities and understand that many people require additional or alternative services.  That is key.  The approach I am pursuing is to move away from the old institution model to one of community-based, person-centred services.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, defined as a setting where ten or more people with a disability are living, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.<\/p>  <p>  This work is already under way and the number in congregated settings has dropped from over 4,000 in 2008, to under 2,800 today.  Capital funding of &euro;20 million from the Department of Health is being made available to the HSE in 2016 to move people out of congregated settings.  That funding was announced two weeks ago.  The funding will be used to facilitate the relocation of some 165 people currently living in 14 institutions around the country to suitable accommodation.  St. Mary's, Drumcar, is one of these institutions and St. John of God's is committed to moving 20 residents from St. Mary's into community settings this year.  That means 20 people are being dealt with immediately.<\/p>  <p>  I accept the point Deputy Fergus O'Dowd has made that St. Mary's, Drumcar, is a significant provider of disability services in the Dublin north-east area and is part of St. John of God's services, funded by the HSE under section 38 of the Health Act.  In 2010 the St. John of God's north-east services amalgamated their adult and children's respite, thereby reducing the capacity of respite provision in St. Mary's, Drumcar.  The respite provision is now three weeks for adults and one week for children.  There is currently a waiting list of 40 to 43 clients who have been identified as needing community residential placement due to elderly, frail parents caring for adult clients with an intellectual disability.  All of these clients - people with disabilities and mental health issues - have been mapped onto a national housing strategy in partnership with Louth County Council.  Capacity to respond to residential and respite emergencies is identified and managed on a geographical basis.  This is done in consultation with service providers and taking cognisance of the policy in moving people out of congregated settings.<\/p>  <p>  The emerging residential need in the absence of residential development funding over the past number of years is acknowledged by the HSE and myself as a challenge for all services providing support to clients with a disability.  Recognising this, I recently announced an additional &euro;31 million in funding for people with disabilities, of which &euro;3 million is earmarked for new initiatives, including the anticipated cost of a number of emergency residential placements arising this year.  In this regard, the HSE will continue to reform service delivery models to maximise the use of existing resources and develop sustainable models of service provision with positive outcomes for service users, delivering the best value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600038#EEE00400","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1467813900,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's statement and I again acknowledge his commitment, as well as the extra funding.  Drumcar is not doing what the HSE and the parents wish it to do and that is why the intervention of the Department is essential.  The HSE has assured me there is adequate funding to provide respite needs, which are required by two of the families to which I have referred.  It is not acceptable that an adult can be in a bed for three weeks and is need of respite care for another week but is sent into a private nursing home.  It is totally inappropriate and it is equally inappropriate that a person under 18 then takes that service.  Extra respite facilities need to be opened in Drumcar.<\/p>  <p>  The person in the HSE who deals with this is actually on holiday at the moment but I spoke to them about this earlier and they said they were prepared to initiate any funding that might be available.  I cannot speak for this person but I can speak for the families.  They are deeply concerned and deeply distressed.  I acknowledge that the Minister's brief is to move people out of Drumcar and into community settings but these people are already in the community.  They are not getting the service they received for many years.  One mother said to me that the respite care she had been receiving for her son for 40 years was no longer available to her.  The mother who rang me about this said she was at her wits' end and could not cope with looking after her adult child at home for three months with promises of respite care having been broken not once, but twice.  I urge the Minister to ensure the promise is not broken a third time.

That is vital for parity of esteem, fairness and equity.  In particular, the motion calls on the Minister to ensure that services provided by the telecom sector can be delivered in rural Ireland, and where there is a doubt over delivery by the telecom sector, provide assurance that those homes, schools or businesses will get an affordable high speed broadband connection and can be included as part of the State intervention if necessary.  That is very important if we are to thrive as a nation and develop not only our agriculture industry but the many cottage industries and businesses that want to locate in rural Ireland but cannot do so at present.  One of the main factors people coming here to take up jobs or those wanting to advertise jobs take into account is the area of broadband provision.  It is about high speed connectivity but it is unfair and wrong that people living in towns and regions in rural Ireland, down to the parishes and the streets, and farmers in rural Ireland have one hand tied behind their backs, and sometimes two, because of the lack of a broadband service.  That is deplorable and it is time we dealt with this once and for all.  We should grasp the nettle and ensure that every house, school and business that needs it has broadband.  I say that from the bottom of my heart, and I know that every TD in the Rural Independent Group is of the same view.  The Minister understands the problem because he too serves a rural constituency.  Those who will speak in the debate this evening, be they from town or city, understand that there are problems with broadband provision, and all we seek is parity of esteem.  We are not asking for favouritism or special treatment but parity of esteem with our colleagues, brothers and sisters throughout the Twenty-six Counties.<\/p><p>People doing their examinations and those trying to complete CAO forms are at a terrible disadvantage.  I am aware of a case involving a person who had passed the examination to get into the Army some years ago but who for health reasons could not be accepted.

Half way through the online interview the system crashed, and that person was denied the right to continue.  She had failed her examination as far as the authorities were concerned.  That is not right.<\/p><p>Farmers trying to complete application forms or draw down details of grant payments are at a disadvantage.  If they are 30 seconds late submitting their applications they are excluded from that process.  It is very important that we have broadband in place.<\/p><p>Business people are affected also.  I am a business man who, but for the private providers, would be out of business.  I set up a business in 1982 but everything changed with the onset of broadband.  Everything has to be on the button and done in minutes.  When we first got the fax machine we thought it was a wonderful tool but everything has progressed at a fast pace.  It is wonderful, but there is no parity of esteem.  We have had roll-out after roll-out of broadband services.  I sat behind the Minister when he was a backbencher from 2007 to 2011, and it was nothing but roll-outs.  We had them in the previous Government, but they all came to nothing in terms of the person who cannot use it.  That is the bottom line.  We are depending on the Minister and his officials to do something about that.  <\/p><p>We are having this debate now, and I see an amendment has been tabled about the privatisation aspect.  I do not care who delivers the service as long as somebody delivers it.  It has to be delivered.  It is like milk, butter or bread.  People cannot live on the wind and without broadband they are at a distinct disadvantage.  I dislike comparing this with food when many people are starving but it is as important as everyday kitchen essentials.  We need broadband connectivity to the household for people from the cradle to the grave.<\/p><p>Doctors surgeries in rural Ireland are affected also.  We have a doctor in our group who I am sure will relate to that.  They cannot practise unless they have a high-speed broadband connection to transfer information to consultants back and forth.  I refer to vital information on X-rays and so on.  It is basic information if one is living in a city but for those who do not, it is different, although there are black spots in cities as well.  It is vital that we have that service.<\/p><p>There are 42,207 premises in Tipperary which need to be covered by interventions under the national broadband plan.  That is an enormous number.  I do not wish to be parochial about this but I speak as a Tipperary TD.  Until yesterday, 49% of those premises were not covered by the NBP intervention area, with the remaining 51% to be covered by commercial operators.  I had them on to me all week, and I know the Minister met them yesterday.  They were on to me again all day today.  Those people must be saluted and supported.  They cannot be pushed overboard and told their services are no longer required because they have been the lifeline for the countryside, and they must be brought in to whatever is going on.  I know there is a tender process taking place but I do not want to see big conglomerates involved.  According to the newspapers last night the number was whittled down to three.  We have to have respect for those providers who took risks, put their hands in their pockets, put up temporary masts and did everything they could.  My colleague, Deputy Michael Collins, had a meeting in west Cork last Saturday morning with a group of private people who are waiting to put their hands in their pockets to pay for this because it is valuable and vital.  We must not allow those people to be disenfranchised.<\/p><p>The figures I gave the Minister demonstrate the extent of the broadband crisis, particularly in a rural county like Tipperary which has 3,167 townlands and where services need to be expanded and upgraded.  I saw on the six o'clock news last night a report about a family from Clerihan, a village only three miles from Clonmel, which is a town of 20,000 people.  We are fortunate with all the industry we have in the area through foreign direct investment and otherwise.  Clerihan is three miles out the road from Clonmel.  I canvassed there during the election but I nearly had to leave because people are so frustrated.  Some of them relocated back from England and elsewhere.  They want to work from home and set up small indigenous businesses.  They are the people we need to drive the recovery and if they cannot do that without a proper broadband service it is a sad day for Ireland as a whole, especially now following Brexit.  We need to be up and at it.  We have to compete with the best in Europe and in the world.  I will hand over to Deputy Michael Lowry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600040#GGG00600","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1467814200,"counter":450,"content":"<p>Deputy Lowry is sharing six minutes with Deputy Noel Grealish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600040#GGG00700","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1467814200,"counter":451,"content":"<p>In 2015, leading figures in the world of telecommunications stated that anything below 25 MB could no longer be defined as broadband.\u00a0 As we are all aware, the European Commission has set 30 MB as the basic speed needed for a viable service.  In 2016, several reports highlight the fact that only one third of Irish premises are consistently reaching speeds of 15 MB and above.  The remaining two thirds of premises are enduring speeds of less than 15 MB, with a majority of premises in rural areas suffering Internet speeds of less than 4 MB and as low as 1 MB.<\/p>  <p>  Broadband speeds in rural Ireland are way below the European Commission viable service measure of 30 MB.  According to international standards, we should not even define rural speeds of 1 MB to 4 MB as broadband.  By these standards, rural Internet access speeds in Ireland should be labelled as \"low\" band and, in many instances, \"no\" band.  Rural citizens are suffering glorified dial-up Internet access, with far reaching and negative consequences for rural homes, business and education, as well as aspects of social and cultural life in rural areas.<\/p><p>In my county of Tipperary it is estimated that there are 41,000 properties without broadband, 8,000 of which are businesses of varying sizes, each attempting to compete in a wider marketplace.  Large towns such as Clonmel, Thurles, Nenagh, Tipperary and Templemore are well served by commercial operators.  Other smaller towns and villages throughout County Tipperary require immediate intervention by the Government.  No business in today&rsquo;s world can expand and develop without fast, reliable, high speed broadband.  It is a basic ingredient needed to progress.  What is the use of developing other infrastructure outside main towns and cities when a fast, effective and reliable broadband system is absent?  Poor broadband is a destructive obstacle to rural business growth and, consequently, to rural job creation and employment.<\/p> <p> The digital divide that exists between rural and urban business impacts upon the delivery and development of education in rural settings.  Rural primary and secondary schools have invested in the latest tablets, laptops and interactive whiteboards.  To maximise the educational potential of these IT resources, teachers and pupils need decent broadband facilities.  How can rural pupils compete with their urban and international peers if they do not have the same opportunities to develop their digital literacy skills?  This is a pressing and current form of disadvantage in education which must be addressed as a matter of priority.  The landscape of third level education in particular has been reshaped and has evolved in response to demands for e-learning course platforms and facilities.  Given the poor standard of broadband speeds, if a person wants to pursue third level education or other online educational opportunities, he or she is at a major disadvantage if he or she lives in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p> Inadequate broadband must be recognised as another significant factor prompting rural dwellers to flee their locality in favour of greater prospects in urban areas and elsewhere.  Rural dwellers can rightfully feel abandoned and unable to compete, despite their professional capabilities, as they watch urban-based establishments continue to thrive in the unfair, two-tier system that currently exists.  Ireland and rural Ireland needs to be able to compete in the global economy now.  A five-year timeline or greater is too long and too late.  We can no longer permit ambiguity and hesitation around the national broadband plan.  We need confirmation that it will be implemented with certainty.  Therefore, I would ask if the State could fast-track further the necessary capital funding to expedite the promised roll-out schedule which would grant an earlier delivery date of rural broadband to the majority neglected homes and businesses.  It must be remembered that broadband is a basic and essential utility.<\/p> <p> Broadband has become, and remains, the single most essential feature of the 21st century for home life, business life and educational development.  Businesses and educational institutions, whatever their size, remain the very lifeblood of every economy.  If entrepreneurship, small and medium enterprises and the necessary digital skills are to be encouraged to thrive in rural Ireland, access to broadband is essential if we are to work, grow and compete fairly in a national and global economy.<\/p> <p> I am encouraged by the Minister's particular interest and commitment and by the fact he has taken the initiative to make this issue a top priority in his Department.  Consumer price can be protected through regulation in the chosen ownership model.  I would ask the Minister to roll out the scheme as a matter of urgency and without further delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600040#GGG00800","speaker":"1240","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467814800,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Naughten, on his appointment.  I know he will do an excellent job and that he will not be found wanting in his delivery of broadband.  I also congratulate Deputy Hildegarde Naughton on her appointment as Chair of the Committee on Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources.  She will be busy.  It is good to have in the House today the two most important people with regard to broadband provision.  I am sure any pilot project that will be rolled out will be done in the west.  I compliment the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Humphreys, on the presentation she gave recently regarding the proposal to roll out broadband in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister, Deputy Naughten, is aware, there is a massive digital divide between rural and urban areas in the State.  On the one hand, broadband connection speeds of up to 1,000 Mb per second are being offered by some commercial companies in cities.  However, in rural areas people are struggling in many cases to get speeds of even 1 Mb, which is not much better than the old dial-up connection when the Internet was in its relative infancy.  People are suffering daily as a result.  Consider the difficulties of trying to operate a business without a reliable broadband service in this day and age which requires daily connectivity to customers and suppliers.  It cannot be done.<\/p>  <p>  A proper Internet connection has also long since gone from being an enjoyable pastime for rural households to being vital to them.  One of the biggest problems faced by many rural areas over a number of decades is a growing sense of isolation.  Their sense of community, in many cases, has been gradually eroded by a combination of factors, including a loss of local jobs to bigger companies, usually located in urban areas, emigration of huge numbers of the younger generation, and closures of post offices, shops and Garda stations.  That sense of isolation will continue to grow at pace in areas which do not have a high speed broadband connection or even a broadband connection of any kind.<\/p>  <p>  While connection speeds continue to grow in the larger urban areas, it is not just a question of creating new employment opportunities.  It is increasingly about people being forced out of their home areas because they cannot make a living without reliable and fast Internet access.  Even farming is becoming an occupation that cannot function without broadband.  More and more forms have to be filled in online.<\/p>  <p>  My home county of Galway is a good example of the level of connectivity that exists in rural areas compared with larger urban areas.  Of more than 133,000 premises, including residential and commercial, 62,000 require State intervention to bring them an Internet service.  This is in a county that is home to the third largest city in the country where commercial companies will meet the majority of the demand for broadband connections.  Almost all that huge number of homes and businesses expected to be covered by State intervention under the national broadband plan will be located in rural areas of the county.<\/p>  <p>  Figures provided recently by the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, indicate that more than 56,000 premises in Galway currently have no access to high speed broadband and another 62,500 premises do not have broadband of a sufficient standard.  If one removes the figure of 40,000 homes and businesses in Galway city, one is left with the stark reality that less than 13% of those outside the main urban area are without broadband.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the commitment of the Minister to rectify this situation and his intention to bring high speed broadband to every home in the country.  I understand that rolling out such an extensive plan will take time, but I know the Minister will push for it.  I know too that the committee will not be left standing either and will support him in his endeavours.  I urge him, however, to proceed at the fastest possible pace before even more rural communities have the life squeezed out of them.  For the rural communities to survive and thrive in today's world, broadband access is as vital to them as the massive programme of rural electrification was back in the middle of the last century.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke earlier about broadband speeds in the context of a rural-urban digital divide.  Ireland is the only country in Europe where average Internet connection speeds have fallen since last year, which is a matter of serious concern.  The latest state of the Internet report just published by Akamai indicates a 14% decline, to an average of 14.4 Mb per second, in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015.  The remaining countries on the Continent all enjoyed double digit gains over the same year according to this respected American based global Internet service provider.  Norway, for example, increased its average speed by 68% over the same period, and 26 countries saw yearly gains of at least 25%.  Ireland is now ranked 15th in Europe, although our average Internet connection speed is still ahead of Germany and France.  At the start of 2015, Ireland ranked best in Europe and second in the whole world in terms of average connection speeds, at 17.4 Mb.  This followed a huge improvement in speeds over 2014, but we are slipping back now at such a startling rate that it is a matter of serious concern.  The slide down the index will have to be stopped as we strive to give all the people in the State a fighting chance to make a living and to live their lives where they want by arming them with high speed Internet connection, which is a basic necessity in this day and age.<\/p><p> I know the Minister and the Department will do this.  I was impressed with the presentation he gave us.  There will be many obstacles in his way.  Some local authorities will be proactive while some will not.  The Minister should work with local authorities where they are doing work in towns and villages, and he should work with Irish Water when it is laying pipes and constructing drainage schemes.  It is important that these bodies work with the Department to ensure the infrastructure is installed at the same time to provide the service and they are not digging the streets twice.<\/p> <p> I wish the Minister all the best in his position and I wish the same to the Acting Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600041#HHH00200","speaker":"1313","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467815400,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I thank the Rural Alliance for tabling this motion.  Delivering high speed broadband to every home, business and school in Ireland is a personal promise from me and my top priority as the responsible Minister.  Like all Deputies, I have been frustrated with the lack of progress in this area for the past few years, and so too have hundreds of thousands of people throughout Ireland, including our constituents, the people who elected us to deliver.  Yesterday was an important day, a milestone in a project which I believe, in its scale and significance, matches rural electrification.  The process is finally moving and is on time.<\/p>  <p>  The motion, tabled by the Rural Alliance, is timely.  I promise the Deputies that every home and business in Ireland will have high speed broadband.  The roll-out will start in every county in the first year of the programme, and the last homes and businesses will be connected within three to five years.  No one will be left behind.<\/p>  <p>  Turning now to the amendments put forward by Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in, let me be clear that both procurement models will deliver the same service to consumers for the next 25 years.  People in rural Ireland will not see any difference in terms of the type, timeliness and cost of services they receive.  The Government will exercise the same control over the network for the full 25 years under both models.  The network will, as Fianna F&aacute;iI asks, ensure the future needs of homes and businesses are met.  The only tangible differences are in the cost to the taxpayer and the time it will take to get contracts in place.<\/p>  <p>  On cost, the full concession model, which Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in want, would cost between 50% and 70% more than the gap funding model.  The full cost of the project would be likely to go on the Government&rsquo;s balance sheet, and the commercial sector input would also be regarded as Government debt.  The impact of this on the general Government deficit would be approximately &euro;1 billion more than the gap funding model.  This would also reduce the available capital spend by up to &euro;600 million over the next six years.<\/p>  <p>  On timing, the full concession model would take at the very least six months more to negotiate with bidders, a delay the people in need of broadband cannot afford.  Ten weeks ago, a delay of six months to the procurement process was announced.  Are we really saying to the people that we want them to endure another six-month delay?  We want to encourage investment in rural Ireland and that means avoiding delays that are within our control.<\/p>  <p>  As both models will deliver the same thing, the benefit of State ownership is a notional benefit at the end of the contract.  My questions to Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in are these.  What projects are they prepared to forgo to pursue a State-owned model?  From which projects will they cut &euro;600 million?  Do we close long-stay homes for older people that are not up to the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, standards?  Are they comfortable returning to their constituencies tomorrow to tell the families and business people of rural Ireland that they are proposing further preventable delays in delivering their vital broadband service?  Can they really look them in the eye and tell them that in a world that is more connected than ever, they will continue to lose out?  I certainly will not be going to the Connacht final this weekend to tell my constituents that they will have to wait at least six months longer because certain Deputies in this House want the State to own and control the network in 2043, that is, 27 years away.  The Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson in the Seanad, Senator Terry Leyden, while expressing concerns earlier today said that he would not impede me and told me to get on with it.<\/p>  <p>  People in rural Ireland are already frustrated and angry about the delay in delivering services to them.  I am not prepared to put other urgent capital investment priorities in schools, local and regional roads, flood relief and primary care residential centres in jeopardy by opting for an ownership model that will give the same outcome at a significantly higher cost.  The telecoms industry has invested strongly to deliver high speed broadband to approximately 1.2 million premises in towns and villages throughout Ireland, and this investment is ongoing.  It is covering homes and businesses in towns such as Tipperary, Clonmel, Tralee, Cahersiveen, Killarney, Cooraclare, Barna, Inchydoney and Kilrush, to name only a few.  Industry had previously promised to deliver to 1.6 million premises.  The Department has been closely monitoring these developments.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, I announced that the Department has identified up to 170,000 premises which had been expected to get services from the telecoms sector and which will not now get those services.  We are working to identify these premises in order that we can include them in the State intervention programme.  This will ensure no premises, no matter how isolated, will be left behind.<\/p>  <p>  Effective regulation, such as a universal service obligation, can deal with many of the concerns that could arise in 2043.  I am already considering what regulatory safeguards we could introduce to ensure quality services continue to be delivered over the coming years and after 2043 when the contract or contracts expire.<\/p>  <p>  I was amazed this morning to hear Deputy Howlin extolling the virtues of public ownership.  As a member of the previous Government he could have made a decision on ownership last December if he was so keen on the full concession model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600042#JJJ00200","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1467815400,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600042#JJJ00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1467815400,"counter":457,"content":"<p>He consented to the privatisation of almost 300 Coillte telecommunications masts last year, which would have an impact on mobile phone coverage throughout the country.

The speeds we have set out in the procurement process are minimum speeds and not &ldquo;up to&rdquo; speeds.  I will in the coming days lay a statutory instrument before the House which will transpose key aspects of the European cost of broadband directive.  It will deal with infrastructure sharing by utility network operators and timelines for processing permissions to install telecoms infrastructure along public roads in line with the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment.  I intend to follow this with measures to ensure all new-build premises have ducting installed for the purposes of installing telecom lines.  This will add to existing legislation in this area since 2002.<\/p>  <p>  I believe there is unanimous support in this House for the speedy and efficient delivery of the national broadband plan.  I would like to put firmly on the record of the House, the progress that has been made.

The Department continues to monitor deployment by the telecoms industry and I am now moving to include another 170,000 premises in the intervention area.<\/p>  <p>  The gap funding ownership model will deliver the same network and services that would be delivered under a full concession model for consumers over the next 25 years.

The Minister will note recent figures released by the IDA indicating that it is missing its own targets on investment in areas outside Dublin and Cork.  That means rural Ireland is missing out.  Leaving aside companies such as Google, people trying to set up or maintain small businesses are at a distinct disadvantage.  When I talk about infrastructure I include areas such as access to reliable power, clean water and high speed broadband.<\/p><p>Access to high speed broadband is a problem for over 30% of the population.  When one compares Ireland to other highly developed countries in Europe, we are lagging behind countries such as Latvia, Hungary and Poland.  Iceland has a 95% broadband penetration rate. <\/p> <p> In 2012 the Government task force highlighted all of these issues, as well as the importance of high speed broadband for economic growth, jobs, boosting small and medium enterprises, schools being able to access online tools and combatting rural isolation.  Only a few years after Independence, the State embarked on a major challenge with regard to rural electrification, and the roll-out of broadband is equivalent to that.  It was only in 2003 that the last two areas in the country were connected to electricity mains, in Inishturk and Inishturbot.  There is a five year roll-out plan for broadband to every house and business in the country.  It is just as important as rural electrification.

It is a pity that he did not have a more appropriate speech at Cabinet.  It seems that he is a ram in the D&aacute;il and a lamb at Cabinet.  Unfortunately, he lost the battle.  <\/p><p>Over the past two days he has delivered a forceful presentation on what has been achieved.  On a number of occasions, he has identified that his personal opinion and wish would have been to retain the network in the State ownership.  He went on to give a standard finance line, that is, to ask from where the money would come and the projects we do not want to see happen.  <\/p><p>It is a standard line.  I was a backbencher on the other side of the House when the same line came from the Department of Finance.  It would ask what schools, roads or sewerage schemes we did not want to build.  It provides a toolbox of excuses, and it is incumbent on the Minister of the day to fight on behalf of his Department and the interests that fall within his remit.  Sadly, the Minister lost the battle.  He could have told the Department of Finance and the Minister concerned that the economy is growing and there will be an extra &euro;1 billion in revenue available to the State for the budget this year.  He could have rolled the &euro;600 million to which he referred over six years, which would be 10% of the additional moneys available this year and probably a lesser percentage if the growth projections remain on target for the next five or six years.<\/p><p>The Minister could have told them to look at the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and consider it as a commercial investment, in terms of the part that would be commercial.  As the Minister knows, whatever contractor ultimately wins the battle will have to go to the marketplace for finance.  It is very possible that the winner could eventually be funded through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund because it has the capacity to invest in commercial entities.  The back-end of this contract will be commercial because the gap in the middle is being filled by the State. <\/p><p>It is very possible that the State will provide money through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to the ultimate contractor.  The Minister will fill the gap in funding and the project will reside in the hands of a multinational that will have the capacity before the ending of the contract to flip the assets and make significant profits for the company concerned.  <\/p><p>I speak with some knowledge of and interest in this area.  In the past, my party took a decision which at the time seemed like the correct one.  All of the discussion and political consensus in the House and in Europe at the time was that it was in the best interests of the State to sell Eircom.  We were told the return to the State would build more schools, water and sewerage schemes and public housing.  As a result of that decision, which was taken in good faith by all concerned at the time, there were significant delays in the roll-out of broadband which has put us well behind the European average in terms of the penetration of broadband. <\/p><p>That happened because we did not have the capacity to control access to and investment in the network.  The vulture funds that played fast and loose with the asset that is now Eir's asset in order to make a profit for themselves in the short-term jockeying of resources left Ireland, in particular the parts the Minister and I know best, those areas we seek to represent, in a difficult position.<\/p><p>Many speakers will catalogue the various enterprises that have failed to get appropriate speeds in order to be able to carry out their business.  There are personal stories of homes where junior certificate, leaving certificate or college students are failing to get access broadband to prepare reports, interface with universities and submit dissertations on time.  We all deal with these issues in our constituency offices on a daily basis.  We can say or do little other than to point out that Eir is a private company and, sadly, we have no more control over it. <\/p><p>I have been in the House for 13 or 14 years - the time flies.  Sadly, on far too many occasions decisions are taken here that focus on the electoral cycle.  Decisions are made to build schools before the next election cycle so that people can get a bunch of votes.  That kind of planning should be consigned to history.  We should look to a much greater extent to the future and put in place the kind of foundations that will build upon future necessities.<\/p><p>The spine that will be delivered in the network has major potential not just to deliver broadband to homes, but to provide the backbone for future generations of mobile phone technology.  There is little doubt that Ireland has the capacity to be a mobile island in terms of the roll-out of various pilot projects by many social media organisations, all of which are now delivered in a mobile environment.  We should be doing everything we possibly can to attract more activity into that space. <\/p><p>Handing this network to an environment that will ultimately fall into the control of private operators will not encourage that kind of investment and will have significant negative long-term consequences for the State.

Unfortunately, the record has not been good to date.  I wish to take issue with one comment the Minister made, namely, that we are on time.  We are patently not on time.  I appreciate that the Minister was not in government in 2011, but the previous Government committed to 90% coverage by 2015.<\/p>  <p>  In 2012 a task force was established under the then Minister, Pat Rabbitte, which committed to 100% coverage by 2020.  These are noble goals and lofty aspirations, but unfortunately we are nowhere near them.  We currently rank 42 in the global rankings for high speed broadband and in terms of international competitiveness, attracting foreign direct investment and supporting our own people, we are well down the league table.<\/p>  <p>  I could quote statistics, but can speak more powerfully from personal experience.  I live in Sallins, a town in the commuter belt of North Kildare, in an estate in a very urban area about five minutes walk from the nearest train station.  On a good day I get perhaps 30 Mb per second, which is not a bad speed, but according to the US authorities it is barely broadband.  In fact, under 25 Mb per second is now considered to be narrow band according to US metrics.  If I drive a few miles down the road towards Dublin to places like Kilteel or Eadestown on the Kildare-Dublin border, I find I cannot get broadband at all.  These places are less than 18 km from Dublin city centre.<\/p>  <p>  I have much sympathy for my colleagues in the west and other rural areas, but even in the greater Dublin area and hinterlands of the city there are places which have no broadband.  In villages and towns like those in which I live, we might get 30 Mb on a good day.  Many areas of the countryside cannot access any broadband.  It is a major issue.  Deputy Dooley has highlighted many reasons this issue is important, including educational, commercial and competitiveness considerations.  That highlights the stark reality of the situation. <\/p><p> I welcome the national broadband plan, which we have been hearing about for five years at this stage.  It is very well and good, but I would like to see it accelerated.  There are also many things we could do as the framework is already there.  I have worked with operators in Kildare and elsewhere to roll out broadband.  Drawing from personal experience, I know that a number of obstacles exist, such as planning and technical anomalies that hold up progress.  Even without the broadband plan, the tender and the significant investment and work programme that lie ahead, we could ensure progress is made today or tomorrow to strip away some of the impediments that exist.  There are widely varying local development plans and contribution schemes.  In some cases local authorities put exemption zones in place, and there are other anomalies.  Any provider seeking to implement a wide programme faces multiple planning authorities with multiple approaches.  The lack of a streamlined approach is a barrier to progress.<\/p> <p> State subvention is required in areas where provision is not commercially viable, but once some of the barriers are removed the cost comes down and the commercial reality comes to the fore in many areas.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to transposing the EU directive.  The target was 1 July.  There are many common-sense ideas in it in terms of making the plan work and taking State infrastructure that is already in place and making it available.  The directive is useful in that it refers to infrastructure in State ownership and the commissioning of public buildings.  Another difficulty that arises is access.  One could ask whom a provider in the market talks to if he or she wants to access a council building, a Garda station or a Coillte site.  There is a lack of communications, understanding or responsibility in some State agencies.  I put that to the Minister as an issue that must be addressed if the broadband plan is to work.  We can transpose the directive, which is welcome and needed and is full of common sense, but we must go a little further and put a plan in place to manage the process.<\/p> <p> Deputy Grealish referred to double-digging.  Very few things get people&rsquo;s back up more than a road being dug up again and again.  There is a reference to ducting being provided in all new roads projects.  However, I wish to add a caveat in that regard.  The State can put ducting underground, but the issue that arises is how an operator would gain access to it, and, if it leases it, what the price would be.  In some cases providers have told me it is cheaper for them to get a licence to dig up the road and lay their own cable, even if that is a foot away from the cable that was put in by the State.  That is a bizarre situation.  The State should acquire a fair market rent for the infrastructure but it should not be the case that providers have to dig up the road a second time just to make the process work for them.<\/p> <p> Broadband is badly needed, and these are a couple of suggestions that could transform the market overnight.  The national broadband plan is a lofty ideal.  It is badly needed in many areas where it might be non-competitive and non-commercial, but there are quick fixes we could put in place in the morning.  Such changes should be implemented immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600043#KKK00400","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467816600,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate.  I commend those who have tabled the motion before the House, thereby allowing D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to discuss this very important issue.<\/p>  <p>  There have been two major infrastructure projects in this country &ndash; the ESB from the 1930s to the 1950s, and the installation of a telephone system decades later.  Now we are rolling out broadband.  A two-tier society is developing whereby there are those with access to broadband and those without.  We have catalogued many companies, individuals and families who have made decisions to move to rural areas because of access to broadband due to the potential for improved quality of life and the ability to deal with work commitments.  Nearly all Members who serve rural communities are aware of the situation.  Agriculture is our greatest indigenous industry and it is very much regulated.  The sector provides a fantastic product and now it is very much dependent on access to online services for record keeping and other purposes.  There is a major vacuum in broadband services.<\/p>  <p>  Some of those involved in the telecommunications industry made a presentation to Oireachtas Members in the AV room last week.  A range of issues were raised, including mobile phone coverage.  Deputy Dooley and I were members of a committee in the previous D&aacute;il and industry representatives came before it as well.  The fulfilment of the terms of reference in terms of the licence they have leaves much to be desired.  The areas with poor mobile phone coverage 20 years ago are the same ones that lack coverage today.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has outlined the first steps towards providing a broadband connection for each and every citizen.  There are great fears, especially in rural communities, in spite of the great plans.  One initiative was announced between the ESB and Vodafone to share their networks and bring broadband to provincial towns, but it only brought broadband to areas that were commercially viable.  The biggest issue is that between 30% and 40% of the land mass of the State has a difficulty with broadband reception.  Many of the private sector initiatives around the country, such as for wireless broadband services, are hit and miss.  We cannot get broadband in rural communities and we are disadvantaged because of that.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister was a member of the same committee of which I was a member in the previous D&aacute;il.  I congratulate him and wish him well in the role, because it is very challenging.  The previous two Ministers were from Dublin and, while they had the full facts in front of them, perhaps they did not appreciate the seriousness of the situation.  I take it that, coming from the part of the country from which the Minister comes, he knows full well the seriousness of the situation that is facing rural communities.  I was contacted by people from parts of Meath in recent years who are only 15 miles from O&rsquo;Connell Street in Dublin but who have difficulty not only with broadband but also with mobile phone coverage.  It is not just the people in the west or the south taking the pain; the problem is affecting areas adjacent to other regions as well.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware the Minister is transposing the European directive.  Where do we stand in terms of State aid?  What agreement has been reached with the European Union and what stage is the process at?  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor constantly told us a decision would be made, for example, by the middle of 2014.  In 2015 he said the same and he also said more information was required by the EU.  How far advanced is the process at the moment in terms of the European Union buying into the plan?  The fundamental point about infrastructure must be made strongly because we are connecting Ireland into this century.  Unfortunately, we are far behind the curve, but we are connecting all parts of the country into this century.  No matter where one is or how remote it is, every single parish has people who stay at home or who are working from home and providing a fantastic service.  We must embrace that as well.<\/p>  <p>  In order to apply a proper spatial strategy in the future, we must ensure that remote areas do not become wastelands, with the population leaving because services are not available.  A broadband service is as important in Kishkeam in County Cork as it is in O&rsquo;Connell Street in Dublin.  I urge the Minister to clarify the situation in terms of the European Union.  One could ask whether we are building castles in the sand until it ponies up an agreement.  We must ensure adequate broadband speeds are introduced because we saw what happened with postcodes last year when the emergency services did not buy into the system.  Emergency services, by and large, are controlled from a central location, but the necessary backup does not currently exist.  We must do a lot more work in order to ensure rural communities are connected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600044#LLL00200","speaker":"1283"},{"type":"speech","time":1467817200,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I did not get the opportunity before, but I wish the Minister luck in his position.  He and I would have talked many a time about broadband because we know the speeds down our neck of the woods, but I was baffled yesterday when I heard that we are not going to own the infrastructure.  I would have wished that we as a nation would own that for the betterment of all.  This will be the biggest infrastructure project since the electrification of Ireland.  We have to get it right.  We owe it to the next generation to make sure we get it right.  For the sake of the revival of rural Ireland, we have to get it right.  Yesterday evening, I looked at the news and saw that someone made a comment about water and had to resign.  It is a pity that there might not be as much focus put on broadband, for the simple reason that we need to make sure.  Right across the divide, from the people I talk to, there is unanimous agreement that we need this infrastructure to be owned by the State.  Let us put it up, because this is a licence to print money.  Private companies are interested in this not to lose money, but to make money.<\/p>  <p>  When the Minister and I sat at the talks earlier we went through all this, but next June is when the contract will come out.  There is no reason; it is bodies on the ground after that which will make sure.  I have one question.  Six months ago we talked about 80 Mbps; now we are coming down to 30 Mbps.  Why are we doing that?  We have to make sure we do the right thing now.  I am not blaming the Minister, but I ask him to go back to the Cabinet and ask it to try to put the infrastructure in the hands of the State, for the simple reason that this is for the future.  In ten, 15, 20 or 30 years down the line the decisions that politicians make here will be the ones that will help future generations.  In all parts of rural Ireland, broadband is crucial.  We are talking about regional development.  We have to make sure it is delivered as fast as possible.  I know that the legislation has to comply with the directive, but I ask the Minister to go back again and make sure that the State will handle the infrastructure, and that all the private companies run it after that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600045#MMM00100","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1467817200,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I now call on Deputy Stanley, who is sharing time with Deputies Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and Gerry Adams.

Rural electrification was and is in public ownership.  This will be a much-valued asset.  It is disappointing that the Government has not recognised the importance of keeping what will be a priceless asset in public ownership.<\/p>  <p>  In the 1980s, the Government invested heavily in upgrading telecoms infrastructure, resulting in a network being built that surpassed Britain's or those on the Continent.  I am glad that Fianna F&aacute;il has come to a more Sinn F&eacute;in position on this, even if it is 26 years too late.  They sold it off to venture capitalists.  We have seen little investment in the past 26 years, with the result that the telecommunications network is now way behind our European competitors.  The key difference is that we must have control of major infrastructure.  The decision to hand broadband infrastructure to private capitalists is short-sighted in the extreme.  The taxpayer and the State will have invested millions of euros, but it will be snapped up for profit.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure we all agree that the national broadband plan has potential and is badly needed.  We recognise that and we want to see this programme rolled out.  It has significant potential to reinvigorate the whole island.  In my constituency of Laois, and in south Kildare, places such as Borris-in-Ossory, Rathdowney, Portarlington, Graiguecullen and Monasterevin are all badly in need of this infrastructure.  If we take MANs, when it was built, as I saw in my own town of Portlaoise, some people considered it as a white elephant.  It has now developed across the country and is worth 20 times what it was when the infrastructure was put in.  I have no doubt that this infrastructure, the rural broadband network, will be valuable also.<\/p>  <p>  We have had a lot of talk of and a promise of new politics in this D&aacute;il term.  From what I am hearing, the Labour Party will do a U-turn as well and support Sinn F&eacute;in's position, so the majority of Members want this kept in public ownership.  I want the Minister to go back to the Cabinet and have a chat.  I heard the Minister trotting out the figures and the reasons, but he knows that is not the full picture.  That is a debate for another day, to revisit this again and keep it in public ownership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600045#MMM00700","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1467817200,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Last week, I attended a presentation in the AV room hosted by Deputy Bernard Durkan.  It included most of the communications companies in the State.  Deputy after Deputy took to the floor to castigate these telecommunications companies in the strongest possible terms over the desperately poor mobile and mobile internet coverage throughout the State.  The level of anger was a sight to behold.  Deputies were outdoing each other out of anger.  I found myself agreeing with the Deputies wholeheartedly.  They were right.  A large area across the southern State is a no-man's land for mobile phone and mobile Internet coverage.  People cannot do business, make social calls or even ring emergency services when they need them.  We are talking not about far-off headlands in the west, but about a couple of miles outside major towns in the Dublin region.<\/p>  <p>  On a separate occasion last week, my dog was barking and my son was giving out to the dog for barking.  I laughed because that is what dogs do - they bark.  In the same way, private companies maximise profits.  That is what they do.  They cherry-pick the most attractive elements of deals, invest in infrastructure to increase revenue streams and upgrade and maintain systems only on the basis of the income they generate.  Shouting at a private company for maximising profits is as stupid as shouting at a dog for barking, especially if those Deputies doing the shouting are the Deputies who privatised the system in the first place.  Many of those Deputies were the same ones that stood over the licence requirements necessary for those companies in the telecoms industry.  An example of that would be the requirement for ComReg to measure signals, which means that it does not measure the quality of the signal, only that there is one.  They measure only on the main road itself.  We know that handing over systems lock, stock and barrel to private companies is a dangerous system that comes back to haunt Deputies afterwards.<\/p>  <p>  The truth of the matter is that the privatisation of Eircom was one of the most damaging decisions made by any Government in this State.  The subsequent owners asset-stripped Eircom for the benefit of their shareholders and to the detriment of families, business and communities up and down the country.  It has cost the State billions of euros and has devastated the economic well-being of whole regions throughout the State.  The decision was made on the basis of the intellectual fashion of the time.  It was believed that privatisation was good and public ownership was bad.  Unfortunately, that intellectual fashion is still firmly embedded in Fine Gael and maybe in the Independent Fine Gael Deputy we have before us today.  Government's investment in infrastructure is one of the best things a Government can do because it creates efficiencies and competitive advantages now and into the future.<\/p><p>We have seen that investment collapse by about &euro;6 billion over the past seven years.  This process is part of that retrenchment from Government investment into State goods. <\/p> <p> Regional development has been one of the biggest burning issues, yet we know that massive sections of our society are currently second-class digital citizens.  However, the Government's response is to provide &euro;200 million over seven years, which is &euro;28 million per year.  This particular Government plan is a hollow husk in response to a disconnected, forgotten and ignored community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600045#MMM00800","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467817800,"counter":474,"content":"<p>Mo bhu&iacute;ochas don Rural Alliance, mar mhol siad an r&uacute;n seo agus t&aacute;im f&iacute;orbhu&iacute;och go bhfuil seans agamsa labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo.

It is also clearly the entitlement and right of those communities.  However, the decision to opt for a privatisation model is short-sighted, deeply flawed and will ultimately cost the State and consumers much more in the future.<\/p>  <p>  There is also widespread concern at the length of time that will now be needed to provide broadband access to all parts of the State.  Last December, the former communications Minister, Alex White, told me in response to a parliamentary question that there are still 15,000 premises in County Louth to be covered by the new arrangement.  The availability of broadband to that constituency will now be dependent upon the private sector provider.  Six months ago, Alex White predicted that 85% of addresses in the State would have access to high speed services by 2018 with all addresses being covered by 2020.  The current Minister, Deputy Naughten's scheme would see that framework pushed back to 2022.  Given the way these timeframes have been changed, how confident can we be that this new one will be met?  When can households and businesses in Louth expect to be fully included in broadband?<\/p>  <p>  Let me reiterate our opposition to the Government's privatisation proposal.  Our firm belief is that broadband should be retained in State ownership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600046#NNN00200","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1467817800,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I welcome the motion before the House.  I have some technical questions to ask and will also request a further discussion on this issue here to discuss the more technical aspects of this plan.  Perhaps that could be done outside the committee structure because every Member of the House has a vested interest in the issue and, while not necessarily being members of the relevant committee, they may be spokespersons in that area.  That is the new paradigm we are in.<\/p>  <p>  As I understand it, the options that were placed before the Minister were whittled down to two.  The first, which the Government chose, is the commercial stimulus or gap-funding model whereby the private sector finances, designs, builds, owns and operates the network.  There are contractual obligations within that model.<\/p>  <p>  Second, there is the full concession model whereby the private sector again finances, designs, builds and operates the network, but the asset is handed back to the State after 25 years.  My understanding is that going for the full concession model, involving a reversion of the asset back to the State after 25 years, would have had implications in putting the entire cost of the project on balance sheet.  There would therefore have been an impact on fiscal space.<\/p>  <p>  I did not hear the Minister's opening remarks but I think he referred to Deputy Howlin's earlier intervention about certain choices that have to be made by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I will not get into a political tit for tat on that.  However, the logic of opting for the fully privatised or gap-funding model is that the fiscal space would not be covered by the Exchequer's capital funding envelope.<\/p>  <p>  I am seeking a discussion on the KPMG report which advised the gap-funding model.  What was the legal advice in real terms for opting against the full concession model?  I am told - and, to be fair, the Department has been open about this - that the full concession model was deemed to be significantly more complex from a contractual perspective.  In addition, it would take six months or possibly longer to negotiate a contract.  One tries to be as factual as one can but if one goes to a company like KPMG, or another external adviser in the private sector, on the law of averages they are not necessarily going to say that one should come back with a model that reverts the asset back to the State after 25 years.  That is why I want to have a further discussion on this matter which warrants further investigation.<\/p>  <p>  The KPMG report presented arguments in favour of the commercial stimulus model.  A departmental document stated that this model placed all the technology and demand risk on the private sector, while costing the Exchequer less.  In addition, the asset will rely extensively on commercially-owned third-party assets which will not be within the control of Government.  That is one of the considerations which warrants further discussion.  <\/p>  <p>  There is cross-party support for this motion and we all have myriad examples in our own constituencies.  However, anything we do now could be surpassed by new technologies in the provision of broadband.  We do not know what kind of technology will exist in 25 years time.  I am not breaching the Minister's confidence in saying that we had a discussion on this matter previously; it was an open conversation.  If new infrastructure is being created and the State is investing in it, a more conservative view would be to retain the network in State ownership because we do not know what will happen technologically downstream.  That would be a more cautious approach.  Is there is a mechanism to have a discussion here on how we would fund the cost of the full concession model over a longer period that the five or six years we are talking about?  We can only talk in limited terms about the future fiscal space but if the capital envelope goes from approximately &euro;275 million up to &euro;600 million, which may be the true cost, is there room for such a discussion?  This is particularly relevant given our relationship with the EU at present and given the new political realities that exist with the EU.  <\/p>  <p>  I know the Minister will say that this would slow down the process.  I do appreciate that point and I am not trying to score political points.  I noted Deputy Stanley's reference to a Labour U-turn, but in fact there is no U-turn on this.  We are, however, trying to have as broad a discussion as possible so that we can future proof what we are creating now.  In that way, we will not give something away which we might have been able, with foresight, to retain as a public asset.  That is the logic of what I am proposing.<\/p>  <p>  However, we will support the amendment.  Given that the scheme has now been announced and agreed at Cabinet, I do not know if the scheme has any legal standing beyond the fact that the Parliament will make its own voice heard on this issue.  The scheme will proceed as agreed by the Government in the final analysis.  Nonetheless, there is an opportunity to have a more detailed discussion about the KPMG aspect, and the full concession model versus the gap-funding model. <\/p><p>I would like us to have that discussion in a more detailed forum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600046#NNN00300","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467818400,"counter":477,"content":"<p>The next speaking slot is being shared by Deputies Mick Barry and Br&iacute;d Smith.

We have some of the worst served regions of Europe in terms of broadband service and we rank 42nd in the world in terms of high speed Internet access, despite having the second highest customer costs in the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  The Government attempts to portray Ireland on the international stage as a modern country that is open for business to all types of multinational companies while in reality in many respects Ireland is in the dark ages.  Some 1,300 primary schools, 600 business parks and 40% of our population, mostly in rural areas, cannot access decent high speed broadband.  This is a major issue, estimated to cost 10,000 jobs annually to rural communities.  There are some parts of the country that have yet to get broadband while in cities and urban areas commercial operators can offer very high speed broadband because it is profitable for them to do so.<\/p>  <p>  In 1999 the State sold-off and privatised Eircom, thereby taking away the ability of the State to intervene and build the necessary infrastructure to ensure we have a modern telecommunications and broadband system.  Deputy Dooley's statement earlier in this debate that there was consensus in this House in 1999 on the privatisation of Eircom is not correct.  There was consensus between Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il but other Members of the House spoke out against it.  Former Socialist Party member, Joe Higgins, warned that the privatisation of Eircom would be a disaster for all concerned and it was for the almost 600,000 ordinary shareholders who were burned, the workers whose jobs, wages and conditions were slashed and the public whose services, including broadband, declined.  The only people for whom it was not a disaster were vulture funds such as Valentia and the employee share ownership trust which asset stripped the company to the bone and sold off Eircell.  They walked off with huge sums of money of which they reinvested hardly a cent, leaving the company with huge debts.  The State then had to step in and invest in different programmes to make up for the lack of private sector investment.  Our disastrous broadband system is the price we are paying for that decision.  It is a bit like the man who because he is depressed takes a drink only to end up even more depressed as a result of the drink.  The State has privatised the service, the situation has worsened and the Government is using that situation to excuse further privatisation.<\/p>  <p>  At the time of its privatisation Eircom had assets worth &euro;8.5 billion.  It was a leader in technology, it was innovative and it was investing.  Had it been maintained it would have invested in and delivered broadband throughout the country as a State-owned company not operating on a for-profit basis.  That is how we electrified rural Ireland through the ESB in decades past.  The State now has to intervene to provide high speed Internet connections for more than 900,000 people because the market and the private sector has failed.  Privatisation and the private sector, as we have seen from the privatisation of Eircom, fail to deliver basic services to people.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has announced plans to sell off and privatise infrastructure.  This will result in another handover of taxpayers' money to private profiteers.  We oppose the privatisation of this infrastructure.  It must be retained in public ownership.  The State should invest in and build the infrastructure directly rather than tender it out to private companies to build, run for 25 years and then own.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600047#OOO00300","speaker":"1281"},{"type":"speech","time":1467818400,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I want to speak to the Minister's announcement today rather than to the motion because the motion attempts to address the need for broadband but does not provide any detail on the model that its proposers claim would be best used.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has claimed with some justification that the national broadband plan is on a par with the electrification scheme which the State undertook in its early days.  It is odd then that while acknowledging the importance of the broadband infrastructure to the State, he simultaneously announced that the State proposes to hand it over in the future to private company ownership.  If back in the day Deputy Naughten had been Minister and what is proposed in respect of this so-called commercial stimulus model or the privatisation plan had been done with the electrification scheme, citizens at whom this motion is directed, namely, citizens living in rural Ireland, would still be reading by candlelight and this Chamber would probably be using candlelight to illuminate our discussions.<\/p>  <p>  We need to dismantle the myths that surround the Minister's announcement in regard to privatisation of this crucial State asset.  The Minister has told us that the cost of the infrastructure will be cheaper and that the money saved will be used to invest in climate change, housing and other great projects, with initial investment estimated to be between &euro;500 million to &euro;600 million.  We need to know in what areas the remainder of the money will be invested.  We know from experience that this is nonsense.  As in the case of past privatisations, public private partnerships have always cost the State more money in terms of the service delivered and the longer-term costs to the taxpayer and the Exchequer.  There will be no saving.  Instead, the State is guaranteeing the future profits of the private company that wins the bid.  This deal, unlike some of the worst done in the past, is extraordinary in that the State will never own the asset.  Under some public private partnerships we aspire to own the asset, as in the case of the M50 toll plaza or the numerous development projects that went belly up, such as O'Devaney Gardens and St. Michael's Estate.  We still do not fully own the National Convention Centre and we are paying massive rent on it.  All public private partnership projects end up costing us more in the long term.  The expertise and privatisation of the State sector is essential to the infrastructure of this project.  As such, the State must contribute a large amount towards it.<\/p>  <p>  There has been much talk about the need for proper broadband provision over the next 20 years.  I was delighted to hear Fianna F&aacute;il call for the nationalisation of the infrastructure.  However, as stated by a previous speaker, the current problem was caused by Fianna F&aacute;il's decision to privatise Eircom which resulted in no investment in the national broadband plan and our infrastructure lagging behind that of most countries.  Instead of investment in growth by a nationally owned and controlled telecommunications company, Eircom, as famously described by Fintan O'Toole, was passed around various vulture and equity funds like a joint at a student party, loading debt after debt on the company, thus ensuring it did not invest in the manner necessary.<\/p>  <p>  I support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  I reject the idea that the Minister came up with today, namely, that we sell-off and privatise this essential State asset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600047#OOO00400","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1467818400,"counter":480,"content":"<p>The next speaking slot is being shared by Deputies Thomas Pringle, Maureen O'Sullivan and Clare Daly.

I agree with other Members that that decision is, unfortunately, the wrong decision.  In terms of the history of privatisation in this State, including the disastrous privatisation of Eircom and what it has meant for broadband provision throughout this State, this decision will go down as having been a very bad one.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's e-mail to Members yesterday outlining the Government decision refers to the stimulus model and the full concession model, both of which are financed, designed and built by the private sector.  It is the State and not the private sector that finances both models.  The issue that arises is whether at the end of the contract period the State has an asset or not.  Based on the decision made yesterday, the State will have no asset at the end of this process.  What the national broadband plan should do is provide a future-proofed infrastructure for the country and the nation, but we are going to give that away and we are going to pay the private sector to take it from us.  That is what is wrong with this decision.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister referred in his contribution to a notional benefit to the State owning the asset.  However, in his communication to Members yesterday he stated that he recognised the potential long-term value in the State owning the network.  Which is it?<\/p><p>Is it long-term value or a notional benefit?  I believe it is long-term value, and that if we rolled out a proper fibre optic broadband solution to every house and premises it would pay dividends back to the State in terms of job creation, the development of rural businesses and returns to the taxpayer far beyond the cost of the period of the concession.  The Minister has taken a very short-term view that is completely wrong.  Unfortunately, it is part of the privatisation agenda that has been running through this and previous Governments, and we will live to regret that decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600047#OOO00600","speaker":"1366","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467819000,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Sa ch&uacute;pla n&oacute;im&eacute;ad at&aacute; agam, ba mhaith liom caint faoi ghn&eacute; &aacute;irithe den cheist seo, is &eacute; sin na fadhbanna at&aacute; ag muintir na n-oile&aacute;n maidir le leathanbhanda.  I know about this from my long association with Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire but I think it applies to all islands.  We know the difficulties and challenges facing rural Ireland, but they are compounded for those living on our islands.  I hope the Minister will have the opportunity to visit some of them and hear at first hand.  There is no doubt about the difference that high speed broadband will make in maintaining, supporting and advancing island life, thus enabling people to stay and encouraging others to consider island life.  Having quality broadband will help create a more level playing field between island life and mainland life.  It would mean additional activities and resources for children in primary schools and a bit of equality when it comes to extracurricular activities, because we know that for islands to continue, primary schools must last.  Bad weather can prevent the ferry from running.  We think about students on those islands who do not have a second level school there.  They are prevented from getting to school, particularly leaving certificate students.  Opportunities for online learning and adult education are other factors.  There is so much that we can do during the evenings that we take for granted, but people living on the islands cannot do these things.<\/p>  <p>  The same is true of work.  I have met islanders who have moved in and who have businesses but who depend on broadband for translation, language consultancy, database applications and e-books, so having that broadband will enable them to stay on the islands.  There are benefits for other businesses, such as the shops, the comharchumann and the ferry.  The islands quite bizarrely lost out on the Wild Atlantic Way, so one can think about the scope offered by webcam live screening on the beauty of island life and the archeological sites.  There is also the opportunity for a digital repository of island life, not to mention the advantages of what islanders in the Gaeltacht areas can do.  <\/p>  <p>  In the area of health care, there is the opportunity for the tele-health option, web-based health-related activities and medics, and islanders making those decisions without either of them having to make a 45-minute boat journey.  The same is true with veterinary tele-health.  <\/p>  <p>  Can the Minister tell me if there is a specific strategy to service offshore islands?  We know that cities and urban centres have excellent Internet speeds and distribution, but that is masking the problems for rural Ireland.

I am from north county Dublin, which is less than 30 km from this place.  Parts of my constituency are not connected to broadband.  They include Ballyboughal and Oldtown.  It is an absolute indictment of years of mismanagement and delay and is quite frankly shocking.  It is the reason we are joint last in Europe for fibre connectivity, yet the best-case scenario that has been put in front of us is to have a full roll-out by 2022.  The idea that we will achieve the best value for the taxpayer, customers, businesses and communities with a privatisation model is lunacy.  I do not know if the Government was thinking it could delay things for so long and have things so bad that people would say they will take anything.  That is not going to happen.  People know about the example of Eircom and will be very concerned about what the Government has announced in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The planned minimum download speed of 30 Mbps is pathetic.  Everybody knows that it will be antiquated before it is even delivered.  The Minister's own points yesterday left big gaps.  We only need to look at what happened with the privatised bin service to see where this type of disaster can lead us when we hand over the State's obligations to private companies.  It is very short-sighted, leaves big gaps in provision and will inevitably lead to price gouging.  Yesterday, the Minister told us that he does not even have a universal service obligation worked out but that he would raise the question at EU level.  Again, this is not good enough.  I compliment the Deputies in the Rural Alliance on tabling the motion.  It is a key issue for people all over this country.  I firmly support the amendment from Sinn F&eacute;in in this regard because, while the Rural Alliance acknowledges a greater role for the State, I do not think it goes far enough.

High quality, affordable broadband is critical for households, schools and businesses across rural and urban Ireland.  Let us not forget that there are many parts of urban Ireland that have terrible connectivity as well.  The national broadband plan is flawed in a number of very important ways, but it is nonetheless an ambitious plan and will put Ireland on the map in terms of digital connectivity.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is right to compare this to the electrification of rural Ireland in terms of the transformational effect it can have.  It is a significant public investment and will cover about 900,000 homes and drive the availability of broadband in Ireland for the next 25 years and more.  With this in mind, we must ensure that the fundamentals are right, and I suggest that several of the fundamentals suggested by the Minister are far from right.  First of all, the minimum speeds are far too low.  A speed of 30 Mbps now barely qualifies as broadband.  Broadband is defined now as connectivity above 25 Mbps, yet we are putting in a national system that will have 30 Mbps.  It needs to be at least 100 Mbps, and arguably far more than that.  We need to see much more emphasis on consistency of speeds.  Many businesses cannot afford the frequent disconnection that occurs.  I am aware of a company in Wicklow whose connection is so unstable that it couriers its data to Dublin on disc rather than using the network.  <\/p>  <p>  There needs to be far more transparency in the system.  There is no accessible asset register.  Nobody knows where the backhaul is right now.  There is no transparency in terms of business-to-business pricing.  Nobody knows how much it costs and how much the owners of the backhaul network are charging.  There is no accurate mapping of broadband speeds.  We have nonsense figures from the providers.  I set up a project in Wicklow under which we measured speeds, and there was no comparison between what the service providers were telling people they were paying for and what was actually being received.  There is very little consumer representation at ComReg; in fact, people I have spoken to have suggested that there has been very serious regulatory capture.  <\/p>  <p>  Most importantly, I will repeat what Deputy after Deputy has said here.  Privatising the broadband network is an extraordinary and massive mistake.  It is not one of these little mistakes that people make all the time.  The Minister compared it to the electrification of rural Ireland.  We would never sell the power distribution network to Northern Ireland.  Critically, we must look at who will be owning it.  Two of the three short-listed bidders are companies owned by US investment funds.  Think about that.  Imagine a US investment owning Ireland's power distribution network.  That is what is being suggested.  What is going to happen?  The network will be managed in the interests of the shareholders of those investment funds.  This is critical social and economic infrastructure for the next several decades and it may be owned by investment managers from the US.  That is bonkers.  It is exactly the kind of thing that happened with Eircom.  There was under-investment.  We are now in this situation.  I implore the Minister to go back to the Cabinet and say: \"If it costs the State an extra billion quid over 25 years, thank you, we'll take it.  We'll happily pay it.\"  If the only other reason is that we would have to wait an extra six to 12 months over a 25-year programme, that is fine.  Let us take it and own the thing at the end of that time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600048#PPP00400","speaker":"1230"},{"type":"speech","time":1467819000,"counter":486,"content":"<p>This is a complex area of policy.  It is not easy.  I wish the Minister the best of luck because we need a good outcome.  We need good broadband everywhere to lift our economy.  I think this should go back to committee.  We should sit down and go through the real detail and look at what the different options are, because the complexity is extensive.<\/p><p>There is a slight difference between broadband and water, electricity or other networks because there are three or four ways of getting broadband to a house.  It can go through the TV cable, wireless and mobile but it is likely to be fibre broadband.  If we looked in real detail perhaps we would come to the conclusion that we want fibre everywhere.  Maybe it would cost us more but if we are investing for 25 years that is what we should be doing.  One of the questions I would like to ask in committee is what standards we are setting and go into the real detail of different options so we can advise on it.  I hope there is still a process included in the timeline to consider this issue.  <\/p> <p> The real issue is whether we are creating a monopoly by investing in 700,000 or 800,000 houses and providing a subsidised solution.  Are we effectively saying it is the technology that will serve those houses in the coming years or do we expect there will still be market competition between other technologies at the same time?  <\/p> <p> If, as everyone is saying here, 30 Mbps is not enough, are we too late to consider faster, higher standards and go for a solution that will last 25 years, one which fibre broadband would provide?  It might make sense to keep this in State ownership.  If it is not in State ownership, we have to make sure that whatever rule is in place there is open access for other operators and that there is real flexibility in how it is used.  It is those details we should be debating next week in committee.  It would have been better if it had been done prior to the Cabinet decision yesterday and for the Cabinet decision to have been shared more widely.  We would not have this heated debate here after the fact.  <\/p> <p> Is it too late to revise the funding or the ownership model?  That is a question I would like the Minister to address in his response.  If not, will he give time in the committee for us to consider the complex and technical options and see if it is possible to accept the amendments that have been proposed and put them into practice?  Is it already decided and a matter now of how we have to manage?

The importance of the digital economy cannot be underestimated.  Broadband is a huge resource for businesses and there are significant growth opportunities for businesses that trade online.  It opens up a global market for rural tourism and for small artisan producers.  It is also a huge resource for schools, private homes and organisations.  Without broadband, expensive electronic equipment such as white boards bought by primary schools is undermined and efforts by Age Action to promote computer literacy among the elderly are thwarted.  Irish Rural Network estimates that up to 10,000 jobs are lost in rural areas every year because there is a poor broadband service or none at all.  Our cities have world class Internet speeds and distribution but rural areas rank among the worst served regions of Europe.  Rural broadband is no longer a luxury but an economic necessity.  There is no more important issue in terms of economic infrastructure and the future prospects of rural Ireland.  Broadband will make rural Ireland sustainable into the future.  Since 2004 there have been four Government initiatives to improve broadband, all of which have worked to a point, but major problems remain.  Broadband has become faster and more places than ever are served, but 40% of the population still lacks commercial coverage.  Ireland has some of the most pronounced two tier coverage in Europe.  High speeds in urban areas have obscured poor coverage elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  Only 35% of Irish premises have broadband speeds of 10 Mbps or higher.  More significantly, only 69% of Irish homes have broadband faster than a modest 4 Mbps.  Ireland ranks No. 42 in the world in the distribution of fast broadband services.  Commercial companies advertise broadband speeds of 240 Mbps in cities and towns, while those in rural areas subsist on speeds of 1 Mbps to 2 Mbps or have no broadband at all.  The digital divide has become a chasm.  Some areas of west Cork have never had a broadband service.  In areas such as Ballylicken and Skibbereen, subsequent to the merger of 3 and O2, many who had a broadband service have been left without one.  To have a bad broadband service is one thing, but to be left with no service is absolutely unacceptable in this day and age.  For some, having been customers of 3 for five years, their Internet service was taken without warning and they were told they would no longer have a service within the scope required to pick up 3G broadband.  This has had huge consequences for those affected.  Businesses are suffering, individuals are unable to work from home and people have been left isolated.  The lack of Internet makes life extremely difficult.  I call on the Minister to ensure a comprehensive investigation by ComReg to examine the reasons behind this and to ensure those who have lost their broadband service will have it reinstated as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I have very serious concerns for private broadband operators all over the country.  Companies like Digitalforge in west Cork, which are serving communities, may find it non-viable to continue if the national broadband scheme is rolled out.  In a statement to the D&aacute;il recently, the Minister said that 60% of the country could be covered in two years.  We all know where this 60% will be.  It will be in areas that are well covered already.  This could mean taking customers in built-up areas in that 60% from private operators and forcing them to shut down their business, leaving the major parts of rural Ireland and west Cork, which are part of the 40% that cannot be covered, without any broadband.  This is a very serious challenge.  I urge the Minister to sit down with these operators before this goes ahead and iron out the difficulties.  While we all want a state-of-the-art broadband service, we cannot forget the private operators that have served rural communities well over the years. <\/p>  <p>   I am encouraged and confident the Minister will iron out all the difficulties.  We have had many discussions and meetings since my election.  Today we are hearing worries about ownership in 27 years but the problems we have in rural broadband now is that there is little or no broadband.  <\/p>  <p>  Any discussions on broadband should include mobile phone coverage as similar problems exist and similar solutions can be found for the good of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600049#QQQ00200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1467819600,"counter":489,"content":"<p>The most frequent request at the doors, when canvassing in general elections and council elections and at clinics and many other places, has been for proper broadband coverage.

There are also those who wish to complete their entire courses from home and need to access information from lecturers which is often sent out at weekends when the students are at home in Kerry.

Certainly, in the past five to ten years, the way in which we conduct our business, access public services, use mobile phones or even go about our daily lives has been totally transformed by the Internet.  Understandably, the patience of many consumers, business owners and, indeed, politicians, has been wearing thin.  We have had many plans, budgets and targets, but many people also have been left behind.  There is a need for change.  I am confident that the partnership Government is committed to that change.<\/p>  <p>  As a Deputy for Meath East over the past three years, I have worked a great deal on this issue.  I have worked with affected communities as well as the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  In particular, I would mention Kentstown outside Navan in Meath, where Eir activated its exchange for higher speed broadband last year, with other companies coming behind it in providing the service.  I thank the companies publicly for that because I have seen how a united approach among a community, public representatives and providers can yield positive results.  Obviously, not every case has been that easy, and where commercial forces cannot or will not go, the State must go.<\/p>  <p>  We have a duty to citizens, where there is a pattern of rural living, to intervene.  This is why I welcome the renewed commitment by the Fine Gael and Independent partnership to the national broadband plan.  As announced by the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, yesterday, the plan has a dedicated funding model, the commercial stimulus model, which is no longer in direct competition with other priorities such as health and education.  That is what a 21st-century infrastructure model of investment demands - a dedicated and consistent funding stream.  I note that some of the members of the Rural Alliance have already acknowledged that it is a good model.<\/p>  <p>  Some speakers have raised issues with the minimum download and upload speeds.  I believe that our first priority must be to lay down the national infrastructure; when we have the footprint and the mechanics of the national infrastructure laid down, it will be much easier to update and upgrade it.  With no infrastructure in place, obviously, we need to start somewhere.<\/p>  <p>  If customers have consistent issues with their broadband speeds, especially compared to those of their neighbours or what companies say they provide or are charging for, then we need clear protocols for them to raise their complaints and have them addressed.  I would welcome the Minister's views on this.  Perhaps ComReg needs to expand its role in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600050#RRR00500","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1467820200,"counter":497,"content":"<p>First, I wish the Ministers, Deputies Denis Naughten and Heather Humphreys, the best in dealing with this critical issue.  The issue of broadband provision is a national emergency for Ireland.  There are a significant number of rural areas throughout the country that do not have adequate coverage.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the scale of the projects in terms of balancing state aid rules with the private sector and State provision, which can be difficult.  However, I welcome that the mapping process has been completed throughout the country and that we are going to tender, because it is important that this provision is not delayed any further.<\/p>  <p>  This is a critical issue for sustaining rural areas.  For example, in a small village in north Westmeath there is a large manufacturing plant called Mr. Crumb, which serves the whole community by providing significant employment.  It has won numerous business awards throughout the country and, indeed, exports to many European countries.  However, it cannot get high speed broadband.  That is a considerable challenge the company faces every day of its existence.  Broadband is obviously critical to the sustainability of rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue I have been faced with is that a number of the pupils in local schools have been unable to submit homework and projects as they live in rural areas.  Essentially, they cannot get their projects in on time because their parents must bring them to rural centres which are covered by broadband.  That is not good enough in this day and age.  It is critical that a solution to this problem is not delayed any further and that we get the top-quality communications and broadband that the citizens deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600050#RRR00600","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speech","time":1467820200,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important topic.  Rural broadband is an issue that affects many people in my constituency.  I have raised the issue in this House on many occasions.  In Louth, areas such as Carlingford, Lordship, Faughart, Hackballscross, Kilkerley and Knockbridge, and many areas in the mid-Louth region, badly need a fast and reliable broadband service.  It is vital that these areas are not overlooked and are provided with the same broadband services as their counterparts in urban areas.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past number of weeks and months I attended many briefings by the various service providers, which informed us of various statistics available on broadband coverage.  It simply unacceptable that time after time these providers will tell us that they have over 90% of the population covered.  Even with 90% of the population covered, it still leaves 10% of the population not covered, and in almost every case this 10% of the population are located in rural areas.  With this in mind, I welcome the national broadband plan.  I welcome the fact that the awarding of the contract is expected in June 2017 and that within three years it is expected that 85% coverage will be achieved, with 100% coverage within five years.  However, I wish to put on record my concern that the gap-funding ownership model has been chosen.  My concern is that we will not have ownership of this network after the initial 25 years.  I understand the reasons for choosing the gap-funding model over the full concession model, but I want to put on record my concerns on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that we now have a national broadband plan and a timeframe to cover all premises that currently do not have access to high speed broadband.  I look forward to the day when all premises in County Louth, particularly those in the rural areas of mid-Louth, Hackballscross, Knockbridge, Lordship, Faughart and Carlingford, will have access to high speed broadband that is on a par with their counterparts in the larger urban areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600050#RRR00700","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speech","time":1467820200,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Burke and Fitzpatrick, and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, for their comments supporting the motion.<\/p><p>The importance of rolling out high speed broadband to premises, schools and businesses right across the country cannot be underestimated.<\/p><p>The Government's national broadband plan aims conclusively to address Ireland's connectivity challenges by ensuring that every premises in the country has access to high speed broadband services.  As Minister with responsibility for the revitalisation of rural Ireland, I recognise the national broadband plan is essential to the future economic prosperity and social development of rural Ireland.  The plan will be delivered through measures to incentivise and accelerate industry investment and an ambitious investment programme by the State in areas where there is no economic rationale for industry to invest.<\/p> <p> It is important the House recognises the sheer scale of what is being envisaged.  The impact of the roll-out of high speed broadband on rural Ireland will be profound and lasting.  The programme for a partnership Government commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network both before and after contracts are awarded.  In line with this commitment, I recently commenced a series of meetings with local authorities and their chief executives to reinforce the importance of the roll-out of broadband and explain exactly what will be required of them.  I told them I wanted to work closely with them to deliver for rural Ireland.  I will be asking them to establish dedicated working groups to overcome any possible barriers and ensure there will be no unnecessary delays in rolling out this important infrastructure for rural communities.<\/p> <p> I will also establish a number of regional broadband task forces, working with local authorities, local enterprise offices, Leader groups and other relevant agencies.  By working closely with local authorities over the next 12 months, I want to ensure rural towns and villages are broadband ready once the State contract is signed in summer 2017.  The regional task forces will help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland by ensuring there are no local barriers to deployment and identifying priority areas for roll-out.  I want local authorities to work with my Department in developing county broadband plans in preparation for the national roll-out.  All the measures are designed to help ensure a timely roll-out of the network to counties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600050#RRR00800","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467820800,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600051#SSS00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1467820800,"counter":502,"content":"<p>Would Deputy Mattie McGrath mind if I took another minute?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600051#SSS00300","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1467820800,"counter":503,"content":"<p>That is up to Deputy McGrath.

We, like many others from my generation, find ourselves adapting to the new technologies that were not present when we were growing up, from computers, laptops and iPhones to e-mails, Facebook and Twitter.  It is far from the day when we would have to go to the neighbours' house as they were the only ones in the village who had a television or a phone at the time if we needed to get a message to someone in our neighbouring town or village.  Not only do we as a society have to adapt to this, but we as Members of the Oireachtas, along with the Minister and the Government, must ensure adequate basic needs are provided to the citizens of this country.  When I say \"basic\" I mean it because in the world we live today, Internet access in just a vital now as the water supply or sewerage facilities in a home.  It is as basic as that.

It is important because it is the first Private Members' motion introduced by the rural Independent group to the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.  It is a very important issue.  Broadband was one of the major issues in my election campaign, as I am sure it was in the campaign of the Minister, Deputy Naughten, and other individuals.  It is still a source of great frustration.<\/p>  <p>  Broadband is the digital highway to the outside world, connecting us socially, culturally, educationally and, most importantly, economically.  Areas across Ireland with poor broadband are at a serious disadvantage.  It is not only rural Ireland that is suffering.  In Clare, we have towns like Ennis, Shannon, Kilkee, Kilrush and Sixmilebridge that have very poor broadband, which is inhibiting the economic development in these areas.  Schools are struggling to download educational material and pupils are struggling to complete research projects.  Socially and culturally, low speed broadband means our young people find it very difficult to stay in rural communities.  Elderly people are socially isolated because of the poor broadband in their areas.<\/p>  <p>  Most important, economic growth and development is constrained by poor broadband.  One cannot set up or run a business or sell online without adequate broadband.  Broadband is as important to a business as electricity, and one expects to have electricity when one turns on a switch.  At the same time, we expect high speed broadband when we turn on a computer or click on a mobile phone.<\/p>  <p>  We are still in a precarious financial position.  Brexit has unknown consequences and more than ever we need high speed broadband to be competitive.  If the model chosen by the Minister, Deputy Naughten, is to save us &euro;1 billion, it is the option to go for as it allows us to invest in hospitals, education, infrastructure and capital programmes.  Additionally, it will speed up the roll-out of broadband.  If we saw a delay of six or nine months on top of the current delay of six to nine months, people could become very frustrated.  No constituent has brought to my attention concerns about ownership of the network.  I am not concerned by who owns the wires bringing electricity to my home or my phone or fax connections to the house or my medical practice.<\/p>  <p>  Who would have believed 25 years ago that we could connect to the outside world, enrol in education, work from home, grow business, exchange information and speak and see someone in real time anywhere in the world through the Internet?  Most people are paying for very poor broadband now.  They are not concerned by who owns the network or the cost and they are only concerned about when they will get high speed broadband.  People are hungry for broadband.  Who knows what communication will be like in 25 years?  It is certain that it will be completely different from what it is today.  Looking back 25 years, one could not believe the changes that have occurred.  Nobody is worried about who is going to own the network in 2043 or 2044.<\/p><p>It is futile to worry about that.  The broadband speed in my home is 0.25 Mbps.  One can practically see the little bytes dropping into the computer.  It is appalling.  We cannot operate a medical practice efficiently and we cannot download files.<\/p> <p> I commend this Bill to this House.  We are finally about to start on a planned, coherent roll-out of broadband to every part of Ireland.  There is no perfect plan, so let us get on with this plan and allow Ireland to enter the modern world as part of Europe and as part of the digital family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600051#SSS01400","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467821400,"counter":515,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600052#TTT00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1467821400,"counter":516,"content":"<p>Is amendment No. 2, in the name of Deputy Timmy Dooley, being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600052#TTT00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1467821400,"counter":517,"content":"<p>The ewe is missing and the lambs are lost.

I am determined that the outrageous and ruthless brutality we have seen on our streets will not go unanswered.  Concern has been raised in particular about the activities of some gang members who are operating locally but working for bosses who live overseas.<\/p><p>  My officials and I met with the Garda Commissioner and other senior garda&iacute; to examine what more could be done to tackle these gangsters.  At the end of May, I secured the agreement of the Government to a package of measures to enhance our efforts to fight organised crime.  That package includes the establishment of a special crime task force by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is currently under way, in co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.  We are working to ensure that staff are being seconded from those Departments and that there is co-operation in that respect.  The task force will focus relentlessly on persons involved in gangland activities.  The package of measures I spoke about also includes the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill, which passed Second Stage in the Seanad last night - it got all-party support and I thank everybody for that support - and which will shortly be brought before this House.  I am also bringing forward proposals to enhance and update the legislative framework for the lawful interception of communications and for covert electronic surveillance, in common with what other countries have, to combat the threats from serious and organised crime and terrorism.  I have been clear that we would fund whatever measures were needed for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to best tackle the critical and unprecedented challenges it currently faces.  Unfortunately, we have seen examples of it in recent days as well.  Government recently approved substantial additional funding, of which Deputies will be very aware, of some &euro;55 million for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, so that it can continue with Operation Thor and its other operations to deal with the security issues facing the country.<\/p><p>  An important element in that package of measures, and one which is particularly aimed at these gangsters, is the one we are debating here this evening.  The motion seeks approval for the draft regulations under section 44 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, which I have laid before the House.  Regulations under section 44 set the prescribed sum for the purposes of section 38 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.  Section 38 allows for the search for, seizure and detention of cash gained from, or for use in, criminal conduct.  Cash is defined to include notes and coins in any currency; postal orders; cheques of any kind, including travellers&rsquo; cheques; bank drafts; bearer bonds; and bearer shares.<\/p><p>  Powers under this section may be exercised by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or an officer of the Revenue Commissioners where he or she has reasonable grounds - a well-used concept - for suspecting that the cash, directly or indirectly, represents the proceeds of crime or is intended by any person for use in any criminal conduct.  The power of search under subsection (1) is only available where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person is importing or exporting, or intends or is about to import or export the cash.  This aspect of section 38 is more likely, therefore, to be availed of by customs officers at ports and airports.  The power of seizure under subsection (1A) allows garda&iacute; and Revenue officers to seize and detain cash, including cash found during a search under subsection (1), if it is not less than the prescribed sum, and the officer has reasonable grounds for suspecting that it directly or indirectly represents the proceeds of crime or is intended by any person for use in any criminal conduct.  When cash is seized by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or an officer of the Revenue Commissioners under section 38, it may be detained for 48 hours.  Detention beyond 48 hours may be authorised by a judge of the District Court if he or she is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion which led to the initial search and seizure.  Section 39 of the Act allows for a judge of the Circuit Court to order the ultimate forfeiture of the cash if satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the cash directly or indirectly represents the proceeds of crime or is intended by any person for use in connection with any criminal conduct.  The section currently sets the prescribed sum at &euro;6,349.  The draft regulations I have laid before the House will reduce this limit to &euro;1,000.  <\/p><p>  Provisional figures from the Revenue Commissioners, which I want to put before the House, indicate that over &euro;8 million has been seized by them under section 38 and almost &euro;7 million forfeited under section 39 since 2010.  The annual report of the Director of Public Prosecutions for 2014 notes that almost 40 files were opened in relation to section 39 applications from both Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In terms of forfeiture orders made in 2014, there were eight on the Garda side, amounting to almost &euro;390,000, and 24 on the Revenue side, amounting to almost &euro;500,000.  Reducing the prescribed sum to &euro;1,000 will ensure that garda&iacute; or Revenue officials will be able to seize amounts above that level from gang members.  If we are to tackle organised crime, we must go after those at the top, but also the foot soldiers who make it possible for gangs to carry out their criminal operations.  I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600052#TTT01200","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1467821400,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I support the motion put before the House by the T&aacute;naiste and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party supports the change in the draft section 44 regulation that proposes to reduce the prescribed sum from the old sum of &pound;5,000, or &euro;6,349 as it is now, down to &euro;1,000.  It is very important that as criminality gets more sophisticated and diverse our legislation also shadows that and keeps in line with the changes in criminality that are taking place in our society.  If our legislation and our regulations do not keep in line with what is happening on the ground, then we will lose the battle in respect of our contest against criminality.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to look at how these provisions have developed since they were first introduced back in 1994, with the introduction of section 38 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.  That shows us how we can have effective legislation that can be used by the State in order to ensure that we can seize and capture assets that we believe are the proceeds of criminality.  When section 38 was first introduced, back in 1994, it gave a power to a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, or, indeed, a customs officer, to seize and detain cash they thought was being imported or exported from the State.  At the time the regulation was introduced, it was set at a sum of IR&pound;5,000, as it was then.  It is also to be noted that at the time the measure was introduced, back in 1994, cash could only be seized if it was there was a reasonable suspicion that it was being used for drug trafficking.<\/p><p> Our law developed in 2005 when we amended section 38 with the passage of the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005, which extended the powers available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and customs officers.  Instead of garda&iacute; and customs officers just being permitted to seize and retain cash which they thought was being imported or exported for the use of drug trafficking, garda&iacute; and customs officers were allowed to search any individual whom they suspected was importing or exporting cash to be used not just in connection with drug trafficking but with any criminal conduct.  It was important to extend our criminal law provisions at that time to ensure they went beyond drug trafficking and applied in respect of any criminal conduct.  The amendment in 2005 was not limited to the import and export of cash into or out of the country and was extended to cash used throughout the country if it was believed that the cash constituted the proceeds of crime or was intended for use by a person in any criminal conduct.<\/p> <p> It is very serious for a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a customs official or a Revenue officer to have the power to seize money from an individual, so it is extremely important we have mechanisms in place to ensure this power is not abused.  Essential in this is honest policing, but it is also essential to have proper supervision of the powers exercised by garda&iacute;, the Revenue or customs officers.  There is a requirement that money seized can only be held for a period of 48 hours, beyond which it is necessary to get an extension from a District Court judge.<\/p> <p> Ultimately, the public is entitled to know what happens to the money which is seized.  Under section 39, garda&iacute;, Revenue or customs officers must go before the District Court in an application made by the Director of Public Prosecutions and must establish that the money that was seized was being used for the purpose of criminal conduct or drug trafficking.  It is important that the Judiciary inspect this power in this way.  It will be useful in the fight against criminality on the ground in certain parts of the city.  The way to defeat ganglords is to ensure they do not get the support on the ground from footsoldiers.

I was around the corner last week when the murder allegedly took place on Bridgefoot Street as part of this type of conflict.  So-called gangs are happy to murder openly people with whom they are in dispute, and may take the lives of their targets or others who are simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.  This poses significant dangers and threats to ordinary working class communities and we have to find any way possible to stop that.  The drugs trade is, in reality, a multimillion euro international business and so-called gang leaders are more akin to leaders of multinational enterprises, but dealing in crime and murder.  We support measures that will make it more difficult for them to operate.  This particular measure seeks the approval of the House to lower the threshold for the money that can be seized coming into and going out of the State when it is believed to be linked to drug trafficking.<\/p>  <p>  In general, measures that will make a real difference in cutting across drug trafficking should be agreed to.  We have a general hesitation when it comes to strengthening the power of the State because of how that can be used, and not just against people involved in criminality but against others, some examples of which we have seen.  A wider solution to the drugs crisis needs to be addressed.  Giving increased powers to the State will not provide employment and will not provide education or opportunities for young people and deprived communities.  Increasing the powers of garda&iacute; and Revenue will not resolve the problems that users of drugs have nor will it assist those who wish to end their use of drugs.<\/p>  <p>  This is part of a wider debate but is in response to the murders that have taken place, as are the series of measures the Government is talking of introducing.  I understand the Cabinet yesterday discussed powers of garda&iacute; to undertake surveillance of those engaged in serious crimes and crimes which affect the security of the State.  I understand we will be faced with a series of amendments to existing legislation which will extend surveillance to more modern forms of communication, such as social media, e-mail, WhatsApp, etc.  Without having seen the details of such proposals I am very concerned about them and I do not think I am alone.  Dr. T. J. McIntyre, the chair of Digital Rights Ireland, has said the measures may be premature and the existing scheme is flawed.  He suggested we need to start remedying the problems we have before expanding our provisions further.  The question is whether the increased power could be exploited, abused or used against not just criminals but protestors or others who do not threaten the interests of ordinary people in the State but are, nevertheless, perceived as a threat by a section within the State.<\/p>  <p>  At the moment there is not sufficient ongoing independent oversight of garda surveillance.  Surveillance can be authorised by the Minister on application by the Garda Commissioner or the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and there is an annual report from a High Court judge to the Taoiseach.  We should have a discussion about it but the Government should take on board the views of Digital Rights Ireland.  If we do not have measures to prevent abuse of an extension of the surveillance powers of the State and if we do not have ongoing judicial oversight, as opposed to retrospective oversight, we will be extremely concerned about it as it might present a threat to people's right to privacy as well as to their civil liberties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600053#UUU00300","speaker":"1308"},{"type":"speech","time":1467822600,"counter":530,"content":"<p>On the face of it, the amendment to section 44 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 seems fairly innocuous.  I know that many people in the communities blighted by crime and drugs and frustrated by the activities that blight them get sickened at people flaunting their wealth in the local area, be it the youngster showing off to the other children and demonstrating in a negative way that crime can pay or whatever.  I understand that, in some ways, this proposal is being put forward to try to deal with that and I know that the basis of support in many working class communities for a mini-CAB comes from that desire to make crime unattractive to our young people.  However, I would have concerns about it.  I have concerns about the approach being taken by Government, particularly when we see it in conjunction with the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill.  It is difficult to escape the conclusion that what the Government is up to here will not help families or communities that are ravaged by drug addiction but will probably end up nabbing people at the bottom of the food chain, as it were, the easy pickings.  It might make it look as if the problems are being dealt with without delivering the blow necessary to deal with these issues.<\/p>  <p>  The idea of reducing the minimum amount of cash that garda&iacute; and customs personnel can seize coming into or leaving the country from &euro;6,500 to &euro;1,000 will not stop drug dealing.  It will not help the families in the communities involved because the big boys and those at the top will do what they always do.  It will not affect them at all.<\/p>  <p>  We know that major criminals launder their cash through legitimate businesses or decamp to other jurisdictions where they can hide their cash and assets from CAB.  The middle income criminals are fairly adept at laundering and hiding their cash as well.  Will lowering the threshold deal with those issues?  No, it will not.  Life will carry on much the same for those individuals.<\/p>  <p>  If we really wanted a challenge in terms of going after those individuals, beefing up CAB, increasing the number of forensic accountants and the resources to tackle white collar crime, money laundering and that overlap between white collar crime and hard-nosed criminal activity would be far more effective than some of the measures being put forward in the motion.  The communities on which these powers are being imposed are the communities that need to have investment in drug treatment facilities and in terms of opportunity to make crime unattractive.  I am tired saying it but it comes back to the so-called war on drugs and, like all wars, the powerful become bigger while the weak are decimated.<\/p>  <p>  As far as I am concerned, as long as drugs are illegal we will end up lurching from one policy disaster to another.  We will make it more difficult for the people on the hard line as long as the real targets are untouched.  In that sense, a criminal justice led approach will not work.  We have to look at policies such as decriminalisation along with major investment in treatment and harm reduction, which has helped reduce drug use in other jurisdictions.  We know from the work done in Portugal, for example, that the figures have been lowered among those aged 15 to 24 years.  Problematic drug use was reduced, as was addiction.  The numbers of people being sent to prison for drug-related charges was reduced.  There was an increase in the number of people accessing drug treatment centres by more than 60%, and it massively cut the amount of debts from drug use.  That seems to be a successful approach to combating these issues.<\/p>  <p>  While I understand and appreciate the anger and frustration of people who are watching violent thugs swagger around their communities showing off the spoils of crime, I do not believe this motion will address the root causes of it.  I believe it sets a worrying precedent in focusing on the low hanging fruit rather than those who are seriously profiting from this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600054#VVV00100","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1467822600,"counter":531,"content":"<p>We will be supporting this legislation.

Passing this law is an important development but it needs to have sufficient resources to ensure that it is effective.<\/p>  <p>  I note that any garda or customs official will be empowered to seize and detain any cash intended to be used in drug trafficking where there is reasonable grounds to do so, but I also note from the explanatory memorandum that the Bill will not result in any additional direct costs to the Exchequer.  However, if additional resources are required, costs may arise and those costs may be recouped in time by the successful application of the law.  I would like to hear from the Minister how that is to be addressed if there are no costs involved because if the same resources are being stretched in terms of garda&iacute; and customs personnel, one would have to ask whether the Minister is giving them the power intended.<\/p>  <p>  We often see legislation giving enhanced powers but what is promised fails to meet the expectations because the institutional side has not got it right in terms of lack of resources, people with the right skills or basic equipment.  In addition to this measure, it is essential that the causes of crime be tackled.  There have been cutbacks in community initiatives, diversion programmes, youth and early education programmes and crisis intervention programmes, which are essential, as is the basic issue of inequality.<\/p>  <p>  While the Social Democrats can understand that this measure represents an urgent response, and we are supportive of that by way of this measure, I would like to see the same attention paid to those who asset strip, tax evade and place their assets in countries like Panama.

If a large amount of money was regularly moving out of an ordinary person's account, authorities would be notified.  <\/p>  <p>  I raise that in the context of this motion because this is the kind of money needed to make sure that the programmes in communities I spoke about remain in place.  I do not see it as a separate issue, although it is not associated directly with this measure, but it is the means of preventing what we are seeing happening currently because the Minister has the resources to do that.  I would like to see the same attention paid to the prevention of crime, the resources to deal with that, the causes of crime but also white collar crime and where that is impacting by virtue of the fact that there is not an income to which this country has an entitlement to allow us provide services for all our citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600054#VVV00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1467822600,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I call the T&aacute;naiste who has five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600054#VVV00500","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1467822600,"counter":535,"content":"<p>As I indicated in my opening remarks, substantial sums of cash have been seized and forfeited under this measure.  I put the figures before the House for people to consider, and the point was made by a number of Deputies that they are substantial.  Very large amounts have been seized already and that has contributed, in no small way, to tackling the ongoing fight against organised crime and targeting large amounts of cash which, as a number of Deputies said, is the lifeblood of any criminal organisation.<\/p>  <p>  By its nature any threshold, whatever its level, will always mean that some cases will fall far below it.<\/p><p>However, the existing relatively high threshold of over &euro;6,000 means that there have been cases where the Garda or Revenue officials have come across very substantial amounts of money in cash, sometimes several thousand euro, and they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that it is the proceeds of crime or is intended for use in criminal conduct, but they cannot use this power of seizure.  I thank Deputies for their support in lowering the threshold to &euro;1,000.  It strikes the right balance between limiting the power of seizure to substantial amounts of cash while at the same time enabling the Garda and Revenue officials to take more effective action against organised crime.<\/p> <p> I have spoken already of the safeguards that are in place and it is important that they are there.  It is for a short period before one goes to a court.  It is part of a package of measures.  Almost every Deputy has made the point that the issue of dealing with organised crime, and especially the drugs issue, needs a broader based response.  This is one element which is a security and criminal justice response.  However, we clearly need to be tackling the drugs crisis and the issues around it on many different levels including a preventative level.  There is much work to be done and it involves Departments other than my own.  The approach requires a multifaceted response and we certainly need to prioritise it, given the consequences we have seen from drug dealing and drug addiction.  We need to put more resources into our treatment facilities so that when people want to get treatment, it is available to them.  It is very important.<\/p> <p> With regard to the surveillance legislation and the concerns raised by Deputy Paul Murphy, it is important that safeguards are in place.  The Cabinet agreed yesterday to proceed with the heads of a Bill in relation to that issue.  That would bring Ireland into line with other European countries.  We are currently in a position where there are requests for such warrants coming from other countries and Ireland is not in a position to fulfil the warrants as we do not have that very basic legislation.  I acknowledge the points made by Deputies about adequate safeguards being built in which will need to be debated when we are considering the legislation, including what are the kinds of safeguards people think we need to have in place.  It is part of the debate around privacy and fundamental human rights versus the security issues about which, in today's world, we must be concerned in Ireland as well as internationally.<\/p> <p> With regard to resources, the allocation for the Criminal Assets Bureau in 2016 was just over &euro;7 million.  There are a number of vacancies which will be filled presently.  There is also the possibility - it is happening now - of people being seconded from the Department of Social Protection and from the Revenue Commissioners to work with the bureau.  There has also been extra funding for Garda recruitment.  Some &euro;55 million was allocated to the Garda just a couple of weeks ago.  All of this forms part of the resources that are needed to make sure this measure is implemented correctly and that there are garda&iacute; in place to do that.<\/p> <p> Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to certain kinds of cash transactions and obviously that should be dealt with under money laundering legislation.  There is an obligation on people to report those transfers of assets.<\/p> <p> I thank everyone who has supported the legislation.

Everyone is aware of the devastation that drugs cause to individuals and communities across the State.  Recently we have become all too aware of the on-street dealing in prescription medication, some of which is controlled under the misuse of drugs legislation and some of which is not.  This Bill is intended to deal with this issue and forms part of an overall package of initial measures being introduced by the Government as a matter of priority to further strengthen the hands of our law enforcement authorities in tackling those involved in gangland crime, the devastating effects of which we have seen in the recent violence in our capital city.<\/p>  <p>  Drug dealers on the street often carry relatively small quantities of drugs on their person which makes it difficult for the authorities to proceed with charges of sale or supply.  Drug dealers include drug users and addicts.  The primary purpose of this Bill is to aid the law enforcement functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling crime associated with the illegal sale of certain substances.  This Bill is not about targeting addicts.  It is about disrupting gangs who profit from the on-street sale of dangerous substances and giving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the power it needs to do so.  While the illicit trade in these substances is not confined to any area, it is clear that this trade has been noticeably prominent in the Dublin north inner city area.  This is a particular problem which has been highlighted by community groups and representatives from the local area and by political colleagues as one of the priority issues to be addressed as part of the Government&rsquo;s overall targeted response to issues affecting the north inner city area.<\/p>  <p>  Following the appalling violence witnessed over the past few months, the Government examined measures which could help to tackle organised crime in the north inner city and elsewhere.  One such measure, proposed by my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is to expedite the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill which had originally been scheduled to be introduced in the autumn of 2016.  The Minister decided to bring forward a shortened version of the Bill to aid law enforcement in tackling this serious issue.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill aims to protect public health by bringing under the scope of the misuse of drugs legislation certain substances which are open to misuse and known to be traded on the illicit market.  The Bill provides that certain prescription medicines currently being sold illegally on our streets and which are not already controlled drugs, will come under the scope of the Misuse of Drugs Act.  These include so-called Z-drugs, such as zopiclone and zaleplon.  Controlling the substances in the Bill is part one of a two-step process.  Ministerial regulations are required subsequently to determine the level of control which is to apply to each substance and who may legally possess the substances.  This would include practitioners and patients.  Work is under way on drafting the regulations in my Department.  The control of substances under the Bill will only be commenced when the associated regulations are ready.  This should happen relatively quickly.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputies are aware, this Bill completed its passage through the Seanad last week.  I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate and who made important contributions on many issues relating to drugs, drugs use, drug addiction, drug services and treatment.  There were also contributions on the subject of decriminalising the possession of small quantities of drugs for personal use.  I want to reiterate the point I made in the Seanad last week.  I do not want to criminalise anybody who takes drugs because of addiction.  Some of these addicts fund their addiction through the sale of drugs to others.  It is wrong for a person to unlawfully supply a dangerous substance to someone else - it is simply wrong - even if that person&rsquo;s motivation is to fund their own addiction.  That person is interfering with somebody&rsquo;s life by supplying them with a dangerous or harmful substance, possibly leading to death.<\/p>  <p>  In the Seanad, there was general agreement that consideration should be given to alternatives to criminal sanctions for drug addicts.  There was also general agreement that drug dealing should be prevented.<\/p><p>Drug dealers on the street often carry relatively small quantities of drugs on their person, which makes it difficult to proceed with sale or supply charges under the medicines regulations.  The garda&iacute; have told us that enabling the offence of possession under the Misuse of Drugs Act will assist them in tackling this dangerous and illegal trade.<\/p> <p> How do we help those addicted to drugs?  In the programme for a partnership Government we have committed to supporting a health-led rather than criminal justice approach to drug use, including legislating for supervised injecting facilities.  The Government intends to bring forward a second Bill later this year, which will legislate for supervised injecting facilities for chronic drug users.  Drafting of this Bill is at an advanced stage and, subject to approval by Government, it will be published in the coming months.  The programme for a partnership Government also includes a commitment to completing work and commencing implementation of a new national drugs strategy.<\/p> <p> A high level review of the current drugs policy has been undertaken by a panel of international experts, which will highlight the key issues that need to be addressed under the new strategy.  The strategy&rsquo;s steering committee will consider the approach to drug policy in other countries and a review of international evidence on interventions to tackle the drug problem.  Focus groups have been established to advise the steering committee on the relevance of the strategy in tackling the current nature and extent of problem drug use in Ireland, including emerging trends and cross-cutting issues.  This aspect of the process will identify any actions that need to be undertaken under the new strategy to meet challenges ahead.<\/p> <p> As Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I will shortly announce details of a consultation process on the new strategy, which I intend to be as broad, comprehensive and inclusive as possible.  I urge the Deputies and others to take the opportunity to contribute to this discussion.  Part of that discussion includes alternative approaches to dealing with simple possession offences.  Of course, one such alternative approach is decriminalisation of possession of small quantities of drugs for personal use.  Decriminalisation is a complex social, legal and practical issue which has to be worked out properly before we can say that people should not be criminalised for carrying drugs on their person.  The implementation of such a change in policy would need extremely careful consideration.  Such consideration is being given through the national drugs strategy but it must also include the views of people providing and receiving services on the ground, experts and public representatives.  It would of course need to be examined in great depth in conjunction with the Department of Justice and Equality.  The matter is being looked at and I would not like Deputies to think otherwise.  In the meantime, however, I ask for the co-operation of Deputies in enacting this legislation as just a piece of the jigsaw the Government is putting in place to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in protecting local communities.<\/p> <p> Most of the substances listed in the schedule to this Bill are already controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  Some Deputies will recall all substances controlled by Government orders made under section 2(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 had to be recontrolled by emergency legislation last year on foot of the decision of the Court of Appeal striking down that section as unconstitutional.  Therefore, the Schedule to this Bill includes substances already controlled, to which have been added several new substances.  These include certain medicines, as well as substances which have no therapeutic value.  These products have been identified as harmful and have already been the subject of much public and political concern.  A good example of this is the synthetic drug called \"clockwork orange\".  Concerns about the availability and use of clockwork orange\", particularly its use in the Cavan-Monaghan region, have been highlighted recently.  Calls for the controlling of this substance under our Misuse of Drugs Acts have been made in widespread media reports concerning this product.  This product was also the subject of much attention and concerns expressed at a special joint sitting of the Oireachtas Joint Committees on Health and on Justice and Equality held last July where the harms associated with the use of this substance and similar products were highlighted.<\/p> <p> Before I explain in detail the provisions of the Bill, it is helpful to give a brief explanation of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 which is to be amended by this Bill.  This legislation has two primary purposes.  First, it aims to protect the public by controlling access to substances which have a medical and therapeutic value but which are harmful if misused, such as benzodiazepines and heroin.  The legislation facilitates the safe use of these controlled drugs by means of ministerial regulations and orders but provides that it is an offence to possess or sell these unless authorised to do so under the regulations.  Second, the legislation aims to protect the public by establishing a system of tight control over dangerous and harmful substances with no therapeutic or other legitimate use.  Well-known examples of these would be ecstasy or headshop drugs.  These drugs are often manufactured by persons who try to stay ahead of the law by making relatively minor changes to the structure and chemical formula of a known drug.  Accordingly, it is important we regularly update our drugs legislation and, where appropriate, include generic definitions which potentially cover a large number of substances, some of which have not yet appeared on the streets.<\/p> <p> This Bill provides for a series of amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  These include an amendment to section 1, the definition section, which provides that references in this Bill to the &ldquo;Principal Act&rdquo; mean the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  This is a standard provision.<\/p> <p> Section 2 of this Bill involves an amendment of section 1 of the principal Act, which is the interpretation section of the principal Act.  It was amended by the Irish Medicines (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 2006 with the insertion of a definition for &ldquo;registered nurse&rdquo; which was based on the Nurses Act 1985, and an amended definition of &ldquo;practitioner&rdquo;, consequent on the insertion of the definition of &ldquo;registered nurse&rdquo;.  This was to provide that the Minister could make regulations allowing nurses to prescribe controlled drugs.  In 2011, the Nurses Act 1985 was repealed by the Nurses and Midwives Act.  The 2011 Act established a new definition of &ldquo;registered nurse&rdquo; and &ldquo;registered midwife&rdquo;.  This Bill proposes to amend the definition applied to nurses and midwives so that it is updated to reflect the 2011 Act, and the definition of &ldquo;practitioner&rdquo; consequent on that.<\/p> <p> Section 3 of this Bill amends section 5 of the principal Act which allows the Minister to make regulations to prevent the misuse of controlled drugs.  Under this section, the Minister makes regulations setting out who may prescribe and administer controlled drugs.  This section was amended by the Irish Medicines (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 2006 with the insertion of provisions allowing the Minister to regulate the issue of prescriptions, and supply of controlled drugs on prescription, but providing that the Minister will not do so unless satisfied that it is reasonably safe to allow such prescribing and supply.<\/p> <p> This Bill proposes to amend the provisions which were inserted into the 1977 Act by the Irish Medicines (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 2006 by updated references to &ldquo;registered nurse&rdquo; and &ldquo;registered midwife&rdquo; consequent on the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011.  Section 4 is an amendment of section 13 of the principal Act.  The purpose of this amendment is to facilitate the commencement of a provision of the Irish Medicines (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 2006 transferring responsibility for the issue of licences under the Act from the Minister for Health to the Irish Medicines Board, now the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  The HPRA already carries out all of the administrative functions relating to licensing, such as assessing and inspecting applicants but has to submit the completed licences to the Department for signing.  This is an unnecessary administrative burden.<\/p> <p> Section 5 is an amendment of section 21 of the principal Act.  The purpose of this amendment is to facilitate the commencement of a provision of the Irish Medicines (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 2006 transferring responsibility for the issue of licences under the Act from the Minister for Health to the Irish Medicines Board now the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.<\/p><p>The Schedule to the principal Act lists the substances which are to be controlled under the legislation.  The 1977 Act had a Schedule which was amended by the addition of paragraphs 1A and 1B under emergency legislation in 2015.  These paragraphs listed the substances which had been declared controlled under the Act by means of Government order made under section 2(2) of the principal Act.  The Court of Appeal found this section unconstitutional and Government orders made under it automatically became invalid.  The Court of Appeal decision was struck down by the Supreme Court on 22 June.  The Supreme Court judgment is most welcome, as it means that the future control of substances under this Act can once again be made by means of Government order.  <br\/><br\/> A number of ministerial regulations were confirmed under the 2015 emergency legislation.  This gives them the status of an Act of the Oireachtas and means that they can only be amended or repealed by primary legislation.  Section 7 provides for the revocation of these statutory instruments, coupled with the next section of the Bill which provides that the Act will come into operation on foot of commencement orders rather than on enactment.  The Minister will be able to revoke and introduce new regulations simultaneously and at a time of his or her choosing.  There will, therefore, be no time gap between the repeal of the regulation and the making of its replacement.<br\/><br\/> Section 8 of the Bill sets out the Short Title, collective construction and commencement of the Act.  It provides for the making of orders by the Minister with regard to setting the day or days on which different provisions of the Act will come into operation.  This will allow the Minister to commence the amendment to the Schedule to the Act on the same day as he or she repeals regulations and makes new regulations.  This is a standard provision.<br\/><br\/>As I said in the Seanad, I wish to reiterate my commitment as a citizen, public representative and Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy and that of the Government to addressing in a balanced and effective way the challenges posed by drug misuse to individuals and their families, neighbours, friends and, above all, communities.  I hope that all in this House will fully back this Bill and help to ensure its smooth and speedy passage through the Oireachtas before the summer break.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600055#WWW00400","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467824400,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be able to speak on this Bill on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, with Deputy James Browne, spokesperson on mental health, and in my role as party spokesperson on drugs, and on tackling the country's crippling drug problem.  It is an area in need of major reform in terms of our approach.  Every day we hear stories of individuals, families and communities around the country that have been devastated by drugs.  I welcome the renewed focused on this area, and also the development of the new national drug strategy which will shape our policies in trying to tackle this issue in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to be able to support the Bill, which addresses a problem that is currently causing major difficulties across the country.  It is an issue the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has raised for some time.  In May, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, highlighted how the main issue on the streets concerned tablets, specifically so-called Z-drugs.  I also welcome the decision of the Government to appoint a dedicated Minister of State with responsibility for drugs, as proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il, and I look forward to working with the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne.  I wish her well in her new role.<\/p>  <p>  Today's discussion highlights very clearly how we as legislators need to stay on top of a constantly evolving environment where clever and ruthless drug dealers use every loophole, grey area and opportunity they can to intimidate and prey on vulnerable people and make profits from the victims of drugs.  It is regrettable that it has taken the recent spate of gang-related deaths to focus minds on this issue. <\/p>  <p>  I am glad the Bill is being fast-tracked.  As legislators, we must be proactive and aggressive in tackling major international criminal empires.  People in all communities countrywide know of the devastation caused by heroin and narcotics on a daily basis.  Addiction to the specific substances in the Bill is second only to alcohol abuse in Ireland.  This shows the scale and prevalence of these drugs. <\/p>  <p>  The drugs being discussed today, which are, of course, legally available through prescription, are causing just as much harm in the hands of drug dealers.  Some drugs have been given colourful monitors such as clockwork orange, zimmos, blues and yellows, but people should not be fooled.  There is nothing harmless about the damage these drugs are causing, their devastating health effects, the cost to our health services, the relationships that have been destroyed and the lives that have been ruined.  We are banning these drugs because they are harmful and because the bodies trying to tackle the problem, such as community groups working in the inner city and the Garda, have sought this action to enable us to properly tackle criminal gangs.<\/p>  <p>  We should also be mindful of the doctors and nurses in our emergency departments who are on the front line dealing with the very real impact of what happens when drugs like these are taken.  For example, clockwork orange has been linked with several deaths.  Former users of the drug have also been to the fore in highlighting the dangers of these types of drugs.  One former user said: \"When you take it you don't want to move, you don't want to talk.  It is hard enough keeping your eyes concentrating on what's going on around you.  Then when you don't have it, it is just a total different person.  The whole paranoia sets in.  Anxiety.  It makes you feel very sick.\"<\/p>  <p>  This move is not an attack on problem drug takers and those with addiction problems.  There should be no confusion or obfuscation by Deputies in the House on this point.  This is about empowering agencies to be able to target the gangs that are controlling the supply and sale of these drugs at every level.  Like much of our drug problem, this is happening at every level.  We might like to trick ourselves into believing that this is a problem in certain areas, and the media often label only socially and economically deprived in regard to drug issues.  The problem is profound in those areas. <\/p>  <p>  Indeed, just this week a report from the Clondalkin drugs task force, led by Dr. Aileen O'Gorman, found that drug-related harm consistently clusters in communities marked by poverty and social inequality.  The research found that the situation was allowed to develop by the policies of successive Governments and year-on-year funding cuts.  These communities simply cannot survive if this continues.<\/p>  <p>  It is far too simple a narrative to think drug problems are simply confined to these communities.  Such thinking will only lead to an escalation of the drug problem if it is allowed to fester.  Drug dealers and gangs that are supplying heroin and feeding off addiction in the city centre are the very same drug dealers who are dealing to recreational, intermittent users who work on a daily basis but decide to consume their drugs of choice on a Friday or Saturday night.  The substances may be different but the result is the same. <\/p>  <p>  The victims in our city centres and in more deprived areas may be a more obvious symbol to point to the drugs scourge, but the task for all of us should be to make all people realise that every joint that is rolled, line of cocaine that is snorted and pill swallowed in a nightclub puts money directly into the pockets of criminals, the very same criminals who are now committing murders on a near-weekly basis.  Whether one is rolling a joint or a &euro;20 note, one is contributing to the carnage and terror being meted out.  Trying to get this point across and make this connection is important and has to be highlighted.  Equally important, however, is the need to develop proper treatment, rehabilitation, therapeutic and aftercare services.  No progress can be made in this area until these services are in place.<\/p>  <p>  As work gets under way on the new national drug strategy, more emphasis needs to be placed on prevention.  This should start with our younger people.  Greater emphasis needs to be placed on the teaching of SPHE in schools and informing children about the dangers of drugs.  Former users, as well as health care professionals and law enforcement agencies, have a lot to offer in this regard and can play an important role in educating and preventing young people from going down the road of drugs.  Many resources should be committed to local drugs task forces which are dealing with issues on the front line every day.<\/p><p>A widespread national public awareness campaign should be a key component of the next drugs strategy.<br\/><br\/>The provision of needle exchanges and methadone clinics serve a purpose but we must look at ways to improve such approaches to the drug-taking problem.  One option is to legislate for the use of Suboxone, a methadone alternative which helps to reduce the symptoms of opioid dependency.  Suboxone is less addictive and harder to abuse, making it safer for those with drug problems.  Although it is expensive, a pilot programme of 80 users has delivered promising results and it has been recommended by the HSE steering group.  It has been proven to be particularly successful in treating people who become addicted to over-the-counter drugs who, due to the stigma associated with methadone clinics, often go untreated.  All the while their addiction grows and consumes them, their work, relationships, their family and their whole life.<br\/><br\/>A study by the <i>British Medical Journal<\/i>found buphenorphine, the main component in Suboxone, is six times safer than methadone with regard to overdose.  I would welcome clarity and an update from the Minister of State on whether she intends to legislate for Suboxone and its introduction in primary care centres to improve the lives of many people who face drug addiction.  The Department of Health has also given its approval for Suboxone and I believe the House should work collectively to ensure the drug is dispensed.  Equally, we should push for more GPs to embrace such replacement mechanisms, moving away from methadone clinics and delivering treatments at community level.<br\/><br\/>The next drugs strategy should also ensure greater levels of research are undertaken to ensure we compile a database of information and statistics to get a full, encompassing picture of the current situation.  It is only with such information that can we properly and broadly tackle the problem.  Ultimately, we should implement a national substance misuse strategy to respond to the shifts in patterns of drug use and to include the growing crisis with alcohol abuse.  That would ensure equity of service provision in both urban and rural communities, assessment of need at community level, implementation of evidence-based interventions and measurement of outcomes.<br\/><br\/>It is important also to consider the work and report undertaken in the previous D&aacute;il term by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality which was under the Chairmanship of the newly appointed Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton.  Considerable research and work went into producing a report which examined the Portuguese model of tackling drugs.  I look forward to examining the report further and other issues related to tackling the drugs problems during the term of this D&aacute;il on the new Committee on Justice and Equality and in my role as the party's spokesperson on drugs.  It is clear the collective will exists to do something.  We now need to show a blend of compassion and understanding, determination and ruthlessness to tackle the significant drugs problem in this country effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600057#YYY00200","speaker":"1255","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467825000,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill, the aim of which is to make illegal the illicit trade in certain drugs that have become part of the illegal drug trade in recent years, which is fuelling much of the gangland violence and is leading to social breakdown in communities.  Drug abuse continues to be a scourge of individuals, families and communities, but the underlying issues have been ongoing for decades.  When the television focuses on the violence, which tends to come in waves, attention is focused on it, but when the violence leaves television screens, very often the communities that are affected are forgotten about once again.<\/p>  <p>  The role of the Minister of State and the Department of Health should not stop with the enactment of the legislation.  The Bill is important in terms of fighting gangland crime, but that is not a function of the Department of Health which has an important role to play in communities above and beyond drug legislation.  Children, young adults and teenagers are the most vulnerable in terms of drug use and advantage is being taken of them.  Vulnerable families are most at risk.  We have heard of children as young as 13 years of age earning up to &euro;300 to act as couriers, which is a fortune to any 13 year old, but to one who feels he or she and his or her family have been abandoned by society, who consider the system as having failed them and who see deprivation all around them, &euro;300 is like winning the lotto.  When drugs enter a community, they do so as hope leaves.  Drugs splinter communities.  The Department of Health has a critical role to play in addressing the cultural, social and environmental issues surrounding drug use and, in particular, in addressing deprivation in communities.<\/p>  <p>  I accept the Department does not run the prisons, the justice system or the Garda, but it has a significant and critical role in terms of intervention in order that young people do not end up in those systems.  Prisons are full of people with mental health problems, those who cannot read or write and those from towns and inner city communities who have been forgotten.  If one took out those categories of people from prison, there would not be too many left.  That is not to excuse criminal behaviour, but all too often it is the drug addict earning &euro;200 for a drug run, carrying &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 worth of drugs, who ends up before the courts rather than the drug lords.  Too often the drug barons remain free.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has the opportunity to provide public health information on drug use, to provide mental health and public health intervention teams and to provide family supports.  Very often in communities affected by drugs the resources are limited and people do not have the knowledge or wherewithal even to begin to look for what they need.  It is of the utmost importance to provide a public knowledge information system in order that people will be made aware of the resources that are available to help them and for the resources to be targeted in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  We know from the facts and figures available that, during the period of austerity, it was the poor and the young who suffered disproportionately in terms of cuts and emigration.  It is also those demographics that are the most vulnerable to mental health issues &ndash; depression, suicide and self harm.  The undeniable result is that communities feel abandoned, and that suits drug gangs who need a hopeless and vulnerable community to take advantage of to fuel their business.  Inner city communities should not be defined by a subset of drug dealers.  Communities are crying out for help and the Department of Health has a critical role to play in providing the help.  Often, they are strong communities but they feel disempowered.  The Department can play an important role in re-empowering communities by providing them with the supports they need in terms of early intervention, mental health supports and public health supports in order that they no longer feel abandoned and have the wherewithal to stand up to the gangs.<\/p>  <p>  However, the communities cannot do it on their own.  They need support and not just for today or tomorrow.  They need multi-annual support.  When communities were given support, they could take on the gangs, rebuild themselves and rekindle connectivity, given that the gangs thrive on breaking down such connectivity.  I urge the Minister of State, in conjunction with her fellow Ministers, to intervene further and to introduce the necessary task force and provide the help and support to tackle the problem, not just now or when the violence is gone from our television screens.  We need clear commitments and stepping stones for the next five to ten years.  Immediate interventions are required but so too are intermediate and long-term interventions to support communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600058#ZZZ00200","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1467825000,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic.  Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this Bill which has been expected for some time.  As the Minister of State is aware, problem drug use continues to be one of the most significant challenges facing the city of Dublin and the entire country.  We know how drugs and substances undermine the human potential of the drug user, devastating the lives of families and causing huge problems for local communities.  Equally, we know that many habits and addictions do not emerge from nowhere.  They do not exist in isolation, nor are they usually aberrations, disconnected from the context of the life of any one human being.  Rather, they tend to be symptomatic of a person's environment and, to borrow a phrase of which the Taoiseach seems to be so fond, a function and symptom of a person's lived experience.<\/p>  <p>  In supporting this legislation, I recognise the need to address the illegality of the sale and misuse of the listed drugs.  It follows the line of my party&rsquo;s manifesto position which seeks to develop and implement an effective national substance misuse strategy inclusive of all drugs, including alcohol and cannabis.  It is the view in Fianna F&aacute;il - my colleagues Deputy James Browne and the party's spokesperson, Deputy Jack Chambers, have articulated it - that further delay on this legislation is only adding to a growing crisis in the country and especially, though not exclusively, in inner city areas.<\/p><p>From talking to communities under pressure, with which I am in touch, as are my colleagues, a very strong signal was being sent by them to their public representatives that they were under siege from these so-called Z-drugs. Used by heroin addicts, the medication is highly addictive, deeply damaging and, in some cases, has fatal consequences.<\/p> <p> I am aware of the warnings issued in my constituency of Dublin South-West by the Tallaght drugs and alcohol task force concerning the need for users to stay clear of some \"homemade drugs\" which had left people hospitalised.  This was as far back as 2014.  However, in the intervening years the culture of drug use has changed.  There is a huge amount of experimentation with new drugs among young people, many of whom class their drug use as recreational.  Polydrug use is also a major concern, with people using a diverse range of substances, including alcohol.  We often forget alcohol when it comes to discussing the misuse of drugs.  For some people, alcohol and drinking have become a chaotic feature of their lives.<\/p> <p> We have been calling for this legislation to be updated for some time, and a change of regulations is required.  The signing of regulations is required to criminalise that activity and to give the Garda the power it requires to arrest those who are distributing tablets across the city.  Those powers are not there and, incredibly, the Garda is not in a position to move effectively on this phenomenon, which is a huge source of revenue to the drug lords and is damaging young people in these communities.<\/p> <p> I note the Minister referred in his speech to the legislation as an important element of the Government&rsquo;s arsenal in the fight against drug-dealing and trafficking, and consequent gangland crime. I want to be consistent in my response to this.  I welcome the intention of the Bill but I have to object to the term \"gangland\".  I wish the Government and some in the media would resist the temptation to continually use this term.  Deliberately or not, it is geographically defining and does a huge injustice to the amazing communities striving to live full lives in many parts of this city and country.<\/p> <p> I welcome that the Minister is presenting the Bill early and that the Government decided to expedite the drafting and publication of parts of the Misuse of Drugs Bill, originally scheduled for the autumn.  I support the aid it should provide for the law-enforcement functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling crime associated with the illegal sale of certain substances.<\/p> <p> There is a problem, as I referred to earlier, with the sale on the street of prescription medicines.  As the Minister pointed out, this is especially true of some medicines not controlled under the misuse of drugs legislation.  It is clear that the legislation in this area needs to be urgently strengthened, in particular to tackle the street trading in some of these prescription medicines. The Minister has noted that, \"the most prevalent products being sold on the street, for example, the zopiclone products used to treat insomnia, remain solely under the medicinal products regulations rather than the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  It is possible for persons selling prescription medicines to be charged under the medicines legislation\".  As the Minister pointed out, \"This legislation is framed as a regulatory measure to govern the legitimate trade in these types of product, rather than as a criminal code\".  The Minister also suggested that, \"It is clear there are those who are exploiting this for their own criminal gains\".  In view of this I welcome the move by the Government to address this shortcoming in the law in this regard.<\/p> <p> The Minister is right to highlight the misuse of psychoactive drugs.  Of those who use and misuse drugs, psychoactive drugs are becoming more and more the drugs of choice of teenagers and young adults in Ireland and across Europe.  Their use is endemic across Ireland, not in so-called gangland areas.  In fact, the notion that this will somehow limit the crime in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city is to completely miss the point relating to the scale of drug use in Ireland.  All this view does is reinforce the stereotype that drug use takes place in poor, disadvantaged areas of poverty and deprivation.  The use of psychoactive drugs is widespread.  While I support the measures in the Bill, I am disappointed at the linking in the Bill with the locations the Minister highlighted earlier.<\/p> <p> The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has visited the north inner city of Dublin.  I saw him there one of the days I was there myself, so he knows that, geographically, it is not a huge area, containing as it does a small number of tightly knit communities.  If the Minister thinks that the drug barons, whose names scream across our media on a daily basis, make their money\u00a0 from selling drugs in just these locations, he is sadly mistaken.<\/p> <p> To those who promote the decriminalising of drugs, or the legalising of drugs --- this point has been made in the other Chamber &mdash; we have to recognise that even if that measure were taken at some stage in the future, people would still be taking drugs and there is a consequence in that, even if the middle-person has been removed from the equation in terms of sales.  I am particularly happy that the focus of the Minister's speech was not limited to the inner city of Dublin, because it would be a mistake to identify this as a Dublin City-related problem, as he is well aware.  However, there is very little mention of other cities, or indeed other parts of Dublin.  In some ways, the only difference between the inner city and other parts of the country is that the main players in the ongoing murder campaign are, for the most part, based there, but we do know that not all of those players come from there. At least one of those major players hails from the very middle class of north Dublin.  The problems are equal nationally.  The answer is not necessarily more laws exclusively, but more opportunities for work, for further and continuing education, for meaningful apprenticeship programmes in their own communities, for the means of creative expression and celebration of a culture that, in the case of Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city, has been swamped, smothered and colonised by financial services, tech giants and property developers, with no community gain for people who have lived there for many generations.  This does not exclusively refer to Dublin City.<\/p> <p> The drugs task forces were established initially to address the chronic heroin problem that existed in a different era, but their role is as valuable today as ever.  They now embrace the problem of alcohol misuse, but with the polydrug misuse problem they need serious resources.  Those effective drugs task forces need to be strongly supported, and no community resource is as close to the drug problem, besides the local Garda, as the task forces are.  On the measures being proposed today by the Government through the Bill, the Minister in his capacity as Minister for Health and Deputy Byrne in her capacity as Minister of State might look at bolstering the role of those demonstrably effective drugs and alcohol task forces, which are like the proverbial child with their fingers in the dyke within their own communities.  The courts, too, need to be more proactive and more speedy in processing cases.  I want to take the opportunity to ask where the Government&rsquo;s mini-CAB proposals are at this stage.<\/p> <p> The Government&rsquo;s new strategy on drugs will not be ready until at least the end of the year.  There does not seem to be a sense of urgency about implementing measures that are badly needed, notwithstanding the measure before us today.  The Minister will be aware that drugs are at the root of a huge amount of petty criminal activity in Ireland: people rob things to feed their habit.  Political leadership is badly needed in this area and in this Government it is so far sadly lacking.<\/p> <p> For the last year figures were published, which was in 2013, we were aware that over 650 people died in Ireland from drugs or alcohol poisoning.  We know this from inquests and coroners' reports.  They are startling figures.  They are likely to be higher as more annualised figures become available to us.  Behind each statistic lies the cliche of devastation and loss at some level.  While this measure is to be welcomed, it can be truly welcomed as only one of a number of measures required.  Education regarding the misuse of drugs has to begin as early as primary school level.  For example, schools are addressing the mental health challenges that confront us through the introduction of wellness programmes at primary school level.  In view of this the dangers of drugs misuse have to be highlighted much earlier and in a programmatic way.  Most of all, huge energy has to be invested into helping those communities most affected by the drug problem.<\/p> <p> I hope the Minister and the Minister of State pay close attention to the valuable contributions that have been made and will continue to be made by Opposition Deputies.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that this is one in a number of steps to which the Minister claims to be committed.  They all add up - one by one - to the patchwork quilt that must be adopted in order to ensure that this problem, which is not going to be eradicated, will be addressed much more constructively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600058#ZZZ00300","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467826200,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lahart and his two colleagues for their co-operation with the Chair.

I have followed its progression through the Seanad and have read all the contributions by Senators during its passage through that Chamber.<\/p>  <p>  My party colleague in the Seanad, Senator M&aacute;ire Devine, outlined our support for the Bill.  She also put on the record of the Seanad our misgivings about the proposed legislation.  I wish to place on the record of this House my own critique of the legislation.  When enacted, this legislation will essentially have the effect of criminalising any person in possession of the listed prescription drugs when they do not have a legally-held prescription.  This legislation will criminalise vulnerable drug addicts.  It is as simple as that and there is no getting away from it.  From the 1970s to today, Ireland has viewed drug addiction as a criminal issue rather than a public health crisis, despite Government announcements to the contrary.  Introducing a criminal penalty for drug use is about as far away from this Administration's stated intention in its programme for Government of moving towards a harm reduction health care model of drugs treatment than one can possibly get.<\/p>  <p>  In basic terms, what this legislation is proposing is the ability of the State to arrest, charge and convict vulnerable addicts for the possession of prescription drugs for personal use.  I would be one of the first to sympathise with communities who are living with the scourge of drug use.  Indeed, I have seen at first hand what it can do to families.  We should be doing everything within our power to reduce drug abuse, but this legislation will certainly not achieve that goal.<\/p>  <p>  During a briefing with officials from the Department of Health, it was suggested the legislation is being brought forward because the Garda had requested it in its fight against organised crime.  It was also stated that there was no consultation with drug service providers in the State, nor was there any consultation with medical practitioners who are very often responsible for giving out large doses of benzos to individuals with drug addiction problems.  God forbid that we might ask the drug users themselves what their needs are concerning their addictions.<\/p>  <p>  This is not the first item of legislation that is being brought forward simply because the Garda wants it.  Legislation that gives the Garda sweeping powers to view electronic communications is planned.  Legislation that will increase penalties for women engaged in sex work is already on the schedule, all because - from what we are told - the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has stated that it is required.  That is no way to formulate or develop justice policy, and it is certainly not the way health policy should be developed.  While we must listen to Garda with regard to what powers it might like or need, we, as legislators, certainly should not be creating legal frameworks based solely on its views.<\/p>  <p>  It is not good enough that Ministers talk about evidence-based models and then introduce a Bill of this nature.  The Bill will not address drug use or gangland crime in the way the Minister for Justice and Equality has attempted to outline.  The only people who will be affected by this Bill are drug addicts who are the problem users of unlawfully held prescription drugs and those addicts who sell on their lawfully-held prescriptions of benzos to fund their heroin addiction.<\/p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; can seize benzos held by addicts if they want, but this will not magically wipe out any debt an addict may owe to drug dealers for buying heroin.  What will simply happen is that the addict will increase the amount he or she takes to sell on next time in order to pay off the debts he or she owes to local drug dealers.  Criminal penalties will not have any impact on his or her addiction and will not eradicate the anti-social behaviour of dealing that sometimes goes with it.<\/p>  <p>  If criminalising the possession of drugs - prescription or otherwise - had any impact on addiction rates, we would not have the highest ever rate of drug use in the history of the State.  Furthermore, if it had any impact, we would not have young people walking into Mountjoy or Cork prisons and then being released with full-blown addictions that they did not have on entry.  If the Government and the State as a whole were serious about addressing problematic drug use, they would be looking at investing in communities that are most affected by it.  Sinn F&eacute;in will table amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 2016, which has just passed Second Stage in the Seanad.  These amendments will state that all moneys seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau should be ring-fenced and put back into the communities worst affected by drugs.  Earlier today, our Seanad spokesperson who put forward those amendments was contacted by a senior civil servant asking him to withdraw them on false grounds.  The civil servant said it was impossible to implement the amendments and asked the Senator to withdraw them.<\/p>  <p>  Problem drug use flourishes in areas of embedded poverty, with generations of unemployment, poor education standards and a lack of facilities.  Policy responses from the State often give a passing acknowledgment to the environmental and social background of the drug problems affecting these communities.  However, they seldom address the need to do something about the wider social and economic issues that feed drug addiction.  Instead, the State pays lip service to the provision of detox facilities or rehabilitation but has no regard for the astonishing levels of social deprivation.  If evidence of this was needed, the Minister should note that there are only four beds for adolescents to detox in this State.  We have methadone maintenance programmes, limited needle exchanges and some excellent locally-based services that do great work in spite, rather than because, of the HSE funding structures.  Far more needs to be done and there needs to be an explicit commitment to harm-reduction, health-led approaches that are matched by the policy and resources to go with them - not the reactionary nonsense contained in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  We need to move towards a model of decriminalisation of drugs for personal use along the lines of the Portuguese, Swedish or Australian models - that is, an evidence-based model based on international best practise.  On Committee Stage of the Bill in the Seanad, the Minister said the policy goal was to have an evidence-based approach based on international best practice.  It is ironic that in this instance we are ignoring all the evidence and international best practise by further criminalising drug addiction.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation, as currently drafted, is pure rhetoric.  It is about being able to say that the Government is doing something about organised crime regardless of whether what it is doing actually works.  If Members think for one second that this measure will have a lasting impact on organised crime, they are sorely mistaken.<\/p><p>This will not result in any increase in tolerance or respect for drug users as, like those in our prisons, many consider them not worthy.  They are seen as a social problem to be dealt with by the State rather than as individuals who may need medical treatment for the affliction of addiction.  There will be little difference in the rates of drug use in years to come unless we tackle the core issues, such as poverty and deprivation.  Without addressing those issues, we are going nowhere.  This does not mean we simply provide more resources to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat drug dealers and traffickers and the addicts criminalised by this legislation.  While it is important to do that, we must also address the housing and education issues that are the basis of social exclusion.<\/p> <p> The approach to drug policy in this State has always been marked by words that are undermined by actions.  The Government established the local drugs task forces in 1997 to address the dual concentrations of problematic drug use and poverty and social exclusion.  I was a member of the task force in my local area.  Many of them have done great work to reduce the drug-related harm to individuals, families and communities by working in partnership with the community, the voluntary sector and the health services.  However, the impact of austerity policies on whole communities and the reduction of funding to these services will impact on generations to come.  Levels of poverty have increased massively since 2008.  Already deprived social groups are experiencing much higher rates of poverty than others.  More than half of those who live in social housing are unemployed.  More than half one-parent families experience deprivation, with more than one third of them designated as being at risk of poverty, living on less than &euro;200 per week or less than 60% of the average income.  It is not surprising that some people self-medicate the trauma of growing up in poverty with drugs when they are surrounded by communities in decay because Governments choose to line the pockets of the haves rather than the have-nots.<\/p> <p> Over the past two decades drug production, supply and consumption has changed.  The types of drugs people take is dependent on what is easily accessible and how much it costs.  According to HSE data, the number of people accessing methadone treatment has increased every year for the past five years.  Some may see this as a good thing but we do not know if there is a definitive correspondent reduction in the number of people taking heroin.  In many cases, people are taking methadone and heroin.  For more than a decade we have had people described as benzo-users.  It appears the State is only now waking up to that reality.  Young people commonly take cannabis, cocaine and pills along with alcohol.  New psychoactive substances continue to come on the market.  For every drug the Government has managed to put on the controlled substance list, new ones have appeared.  Gone are the days when an addict stuck to taking one drug.  Polydrug use is a major issue, with persons now taking cannabis, benzos and alcohol.<\/p> <p> This legislation will not address polydrug use.  According to active drug users and those working on the ground in drug task forces are concerned, there is no shortage of drugs despite the recession.  Drug use massively increased during the years the Government inflicted austerity policies on communities.  If the people who design these ill-thought out laws were to engage with people who are in the throes of addiction they would find that the years of austerity have had a major impact on them.  Welfare programmes have been restructured and are now harder to access.  Despite the Labour Party continuously banging on about no changes to core payments, there has been a reduction in social welfare payments.  There is a lack of respite and detoxification places for those wishing to exit addiction.  Despite an acknowledgement in this legislation that benzodiazepine use is a major social problem there is a severe lack of treatment options for those wishing to exit the use of benzos.  The HSE drug treatment services have in many cases been rightly criticised for their lack of engagement and consultation with the community and voluntary services that support them.<\/p> <p> As there was no work in certain areas over many years unemployment rates soared and social deprivation took grip.  There was a corresponding expansion of the drug economy that destabilised these communities even further.  That is no coincidence.  While no one would defend the so-called drug traffickers and organised crime figures - they need to face they full rigor of the law in respect of their activities because they are the people who are destroying communities and those with addictions - it is hard not to have sympathy for a young lad who ends up in the drug economy, having grown up in a community where drugs have been prevalent for many years and there was little economic opportunity for him outside of that community.  I am not making excuses for such individuals: I am simply pointing out that these are factors in young men and women ending up in the drug economy. Many start out as addicts and move on to selling drugs to fund their addiction.<\/p> <p> The outcomes of Government policies have been negative.  We are consistently moving towards the idea that if we address an individual's addiction the context in which the addiction manifested itself will be miraculously resolved.  We are in the context of this Bill now in a space where there is no cognisance being taken of the outcomes of Government policy and no mind paid to the fact that individuals are not always singularly responsible for their problematic drug use.  If that were the case then simply telling children in schools to say \"No\" would be a perfectly valid response to drug problems.  We all know that this is not the case.<\/p> <p> The approach in this jurisdiction to drug use is one based on a public system that measures outputs, effectiveness and value for money.  There is no assessment of the needs of people and communities.  It is based on consultants telling Departments how to run services on a skeleton crew and less money while doing more.  It does not matter if \"more\" might not work.  I recently spoke to an official from the Department about the supervised injection centres, which is a welcome, progressive initiative.  However, I am concerned that these centres will operate on a pilot basis and that we are not looking beyond that to the consumption room models.  However, that is a debate for another day.<\/p> <p> In preparation for the debate on this legislation I tabled a number of parliamentary questions to the HSE on the levels of drug use.  According to the HSE records, in 2014, 725 persons under 18 sought treatment for problematic drug use yet, as I said earlier, there are only four detox bed spaces available.  Those 725 people are either seeking, waiting for or in the middle of a drug treatment programme.  There are only two service providers in the State reported to be providing needle exchange services for individuals under 18.<\/p><p>We have no idea how many individuals under 18 are not in treatment or have not sought treatment.  There are 10,165 registered methadone users and this figure is increasing at a rate of about 100 each year.  The number of people who have entered drug treatment for specific drug problems, as opposed to alcohol use, has risen from 7,363 in 2012 to 9,046 in 2014.  Clearly, policies that criminalise addicts are not working.  The figures bear that out.  All of the statistics indicate an increase in the problem.  <\/p> <p> One of the analyses put forward by this proposers of this Bill, such as the Minister of State and the Garda, is that the garda&iacute; do not want legislation to go after vulnerable addicts or people with an addiction who may have prescription drugs on their person for personal use.  I need only look at the crime figures from recent years to know that this will not be the case.  Between 2004 and 2014, approximately 187,000 people were charged with drug offences in this State.  Around 90% of them were prosecuted for possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use, resulting in a criminal conviction.  Clearly, this policy of criminalisation will continue with this Bill.  Leaving aside for a moment the consequences for an individual of having a minor drug conviction for possession, how can anyone suggest that this is a necessary or valid use of public money?  A total of 168,000 people were convicted of having drugs for personal use.  <\/p> <p> I will return to the personal consequences of such criminal convictions.  Many local authorities have a policy of Garda checks on prospective tenants and, while I do not object to this in principle, there is growing evidence that individuals with minor drug convictions are being discriminated against in housing allocation.  A minor conviction for drug possession for personal use has lifelong implications for the person concerned, and I simply do not believe we should punish addicts indefinitely, even if they are no longer involved with drugs.  Simply excluding former addicts with a criminal conviction from the housing process and introducing further legislation that will criminalise individuals will not address these people's poverty or addiction or the issue of antisocial behaviour that goes with drug use.  People with addictions are victims of neoliberal austerity policies implemented by this Government and previous ones.  I cannot see the practical benefits of supporting such a legal framework that not only will not address the issue of organised crime, as alleged, but that also target addicts actively, making the lives of some worse.<\/p> <p> In her Seanad contribution, the Minister of State said it was the innocent victims who were most affected, and I agree completely.  She went on to talk about the people with the fancy cars and houses who do not live in the country and how they are the people this legislation is concerned with.  I find this a very bizarre statement when one takes it in the context of the Government's allegation that this will address organised crime while simultaneously backing up its public health approach to drugs.  The Minister of State cannot have it both ways.  Further punitive legislation as a policy response does not work and has never been proven to work, and this Bill simply creates scapegoats rather than solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600060#BBBB00300","speaker":"1280","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467827400,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I would like to use my speaking time to discuss addiction as a public health issue and the services for addicts that are so badly needed.  There are really no services to speak of to support people who are struggling.  There is one adolescent bed in St. James's Hospital in the Minister of State's constituency.  That would be fine if there was one adolescent in Dublin South Central struggling with drug addiction, but the Minister of State and I know that the problem that exists there far outweighs the availability of any access to services that might serve as a solution.  Yet here we are rushing to put through legislation while we systematically neglect the public health aspect, which was mentioned very explicitly in the programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  Those addicted to substances might now be cut off from their supply as a result of this legislation, without any structured programme for either coming off these substances over time or decreasing their level of use.  We do not want to simply criminalise the user by making possession of these drugs illegal without addressing the problems at the heart of it.  The Minister of State knows what the problems at the heart of this are and the impact this legislation will have.  She knows it will not solve to any great extent the systemic issues that exist.  <\/p>  <p>  There needs to be a very sensible approach to the situation of benzodiazepine dependence and its presence on our streets.  Legislation should not just be at the forefront of that.  Legislation in haste without scrutiny and without the consultation referred to by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien should most certainly not be front and centre of our considerations.  In the absence of public health considerations, this legislation could be deemed to be somewhat premature.  There are a lot of people dependent on the drugs we are discussing here today.  We need to look at this.  We need proper treatment facilities and to give people the option of trying to get off this medication.  We need further counselling and addiction services and greater community supports.  We need to focus on recovery and not simply management of addiction.  <\/p>  <p>  Problem drug use is first and foremost a public health issue.  That is the Sinn F&eacute;in position and it is one that we will continue to advocate for.  The provision of services aimed at reducing the harm caused by drug use and safeguarding the health of drug users must be central to any drugs strategy.  This is what we should be looking at this evening.  Funding for the health services is vitally needed to help addicts, but this funding has been severely cut.  The services are now seriously underfunded.  For many chronically addicted people, controlling or eliminating the supply of a certain drug does not necessarily result in their getting off drugs; it restricts the use of a drug.  While legislation may make some changes to the landscape, it will never be a complete solution.  Will this measure address the fundamental causes of problematic behaviour related to drug use or drug dealing?  Has the Minister of State considered how this legislation may change trends in drug use and how services that are already without adequate resources will keep up?  Has she considered how this may affect people with a benzodiazepine addiction?  Has she considered the public health effects of how an addict will cope without access to a treatment bed or services?<\/p>  <p>  If we are to put in place meaningful solutions to the issue of drug use, drug abuse and crime, we need more than this legislation.  The Minister mentioned that this Bill is just one part of a suite of measures to respond to the situation in the north inner city, but it is not part of a suite of measures to help addicts, the socioeconomic effects of addiction or, more importantly, the drug problem at large.  We need to be able to provide support at every opportunity so that people facing drugs problems personally or in their communities have access to it.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation will not undo 20 or 30 years of under-investment in drug and addiction services or indeed the lack of investment in the communities affected.<\/p><p>This approach and legislation may shift the visibility of drug related anti-social behaviour or increase the presence and competence of the garda&iacute;, but it will not address the root causes.  The Minister of State knows that.<\/p> <p> We need to target and deal with so-called gangland crime and those who profit from crime and drugs but this measure, standing alone and without any public health measures to accompany it or any funding for addiction services, counselling or otherwise, will not achieve the targeted aims.  I have had meetings with groups and representative bodies and many of them have raised issues.  Their opinion is that the process of prescriptions right from when a script is written until a person collects their drugs should be looked at.  There is a view that we should be looking at a partnership model with GPs, consultants and pharmacists on accountability of how medicines are prescribed.  This would allow a situation where it would be possible to follow a chain of why prescriptions were written, for whom and when.  Can we or are we doing this?  If we are not doing it, why are we not doing it?  Are there guidelines for prescribing and dispensing these drugs?  If not, why not?  If there are, why are they not being implemented?  There is a significant public health issue which the Minister of State is trying to avoid with this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600062#DDDD00200","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467828000,"counter":554,"content":"<p>The Deputy is way over her time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600063#EEEE00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1467828000,"counter":555,"content":"<p>If I could continue.

The question here is whether criminalising possession or use of those drugs will really do anything to help the situation that confronts us.  There have been many examples in many other countries of similar attempts to criminalise drugs of this kind and general character.  Recently in the United States there has been a major crackdown on prescription opiates.  OxyContin is an example of one of the drugs targeted in this crackdown.  The result has not been a decline in drug use: it has fuelled the fires of a major heroin epidemic because it is now cheaper to access heroin and easier to get one's hands on it than some of the prescription opiates that have been cracked down on.  Heroin deaths in the US have increased threefold since 2010.  What started that off was a crackdown on prescription opiates in Florida.  At one stage, 90% of prescription opiates were sold from a Florida base.  <i>The Guardian<\/i>said of this situation: &quot;Doctors also reported an increase in the number of babies born addicted to heroin, and Florida leads the US in new HIV-Aids infections&quot; and &quot;The National Institute on Drug Abuse declared a heroin epidemic in south Florida two years ago.&quot;  That has been the experience in the United States.<\/p><p>The drugs it is being proposed to ban here are so-called Z drugs or downer drugs.  Heroin is a downer drug.  Action on the proposals in this Bill would create a serious possibility of a big increase in the heroin trade flowing from such a crackdown.  Flowing from that we would see more deaths in the middle of what is already fast becoming a HIV outbreak in this country.  The prohibition of designer drugs is resulting in the development of new designer drugs - different cocktails and combinations to circumvent the law and controls that are there at the moment.  It gets good headlines in the newspapers and looks good for Government and politicians.  Action is being taken in the war on drugs but it has very little or no effect on the ground in terms of solving the problems faced by communities and people in their lives and in some cases makes the situation worse.<\/p><p>The so-called war on drugs has failed in Ireland and internationally.  It is incontrovertible at this stage - all the evidence points towards that.  The real choice is one between what we have in this State - uncontrolled availability of drugs, controlled by gangsters - and the alternative - a controlled availability of drugs in the hands of the State linked to properly funded harm reduction programmes.  They are the alternatives and choice that society has.  Let us look at the alternative in a practical sense.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien mentioned the example of Portugal.  In Portugal the use and possession of illicit drugs for personal use is no longer a criminal offence resulting in a prison sentence provided one is found in possession of no more than a ten day supply.  It is now an administrative offence in the same way as a parking fine or something of that nature.  There has been talk in the debate of an evidence based approach.  What is the evidence from Portugal about the use of that model?  I will give a statistic and information which should be central to this debate.  There are now three overdose deaths per 1 million citizens in Portugal.  That compares with the EU average of 17.3 overdose deaths per million citizens.  Portugal has the second lowest rate in the European Union.  How does that compare with the Republic of Ireland?  The latest figures I have, which are from 2012, show 70 overdose deaths per million citizens compared to three in Portugal and 17.3 in the EU.  Those are damning statistics.  They are not just statistics; they are people's lives we are talking about here.  What is the best approach to tackling this issue?  There have been some welcome signs of the potential for a change in policy in this State in recent times.  The example has been given of the all-party Oireachtas committee which, towards the end of the lifetime of the last D&aacute;il, recommended that drug possession be dealt with by means of a civil response rather than through the criminal justice system.  There is a second misuse of drugs Bill due to come before us in the autumn which will put on the agenda the idea of injection rooms for heroin addicts and which will deal with heroin addiction as a health issue rather than a criminal or justice one.<\/p><p>Recently, the new Minister, Deputy Harris, stated, &quot;the Government intends to deliver on the commitment in the programme for Government to having a health-led rather than a criminal justice approach to drugs use&quot;.  He further stated:<\/p><blockquote>There is significant debate, both nationally and internationally, on the issue of decriminalisation and-or alternative approaches to the current criminal justice approach to the simple possession of small quantities of illegal drugs for personal use.  The issue is also live here as part of the ongoing discussions on the drafting of a new national drugs strategy.<\/blockquote><p>Those examples, the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee, the Bill due to come before us in the autumn and the quote from the Minister are all encouraging signs but they are in complete contradiction to the approach being signalled by the Government in this Act.  The Government is facing both ways.  There is the United States-style war on drugs approach on the one hand or the Portuguese approach on the other.  We cannot face in two directions at the one time.  We cannot have both.  We must choose.  With this Bill the Government is taking the wrong choice.  It has been clearly proven by example, in this country and elsewhere, that it is the wrong choice.<br\/><br\/>I recently came across a phrase which commanded my attention: &quot;austerity drugs&quot;.  I came across it in the following context.  Members will think I am a reader of <i>The Guardian<\/i>although I do not read that newspaper as often as one might think.  In any case, this is another quote from <i>The Guardian<\/i>newspaper from recent times.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>Greece's infamous new drug, sisa, is basically meth and filler ingredients like battery acid, engine oil, shampoo, and cooking salt.  The majority of its users are poor, often homeless, city dwellers reeling from the psychological and physical impacts of a country in the grip of economic collapse.<\/blockquote><p>Some of these drugs cost &euro;2 or less a hit.  According to <i>The Guardian<\/i>newspaper:<\/p><blockquote>For Charalampos Poulopoulos, the head of Kethea, Greece's pre-eminent anti-drug centre, sisa symbolises the depredations of a crisis that has spawned record levels of destitution and unemployment.  It is, he said, an &quot;austerity drug&quot; &ndash; the best response yet of dealers who have become ever more adept at producing synthetic drugs designed for those who can no longer afford more expensive highs from such drugs as heroin and cocaine.<\/blockquote><p>The point that is being made in that report is that interrupting the supply of drugs will have a certain effect in the short term but it will not have a medium-term or long-term effect, get to the root of the issue or be effective.  Therefore, the answer rests not on the supply side but on the demand side.<br\/><br\/>We need to reduce the demand.  There are many ways of doing that, but a key central way of doing so is by tackling the poverty, unemployment and austerity which make so many people, especially but not exclusively the young, want to escape the reality of their daily lives through the medium of drugs.  To do that, to tackle poverty, unemployment and austerity seriously, we must tackle the root cause, which is the system of capital that causes it and which puts profit before ordinary people, and replace it with a genuinely human society which places solidarity among people ahead of the rat race of a profit system - a genuinely democratic and socialist society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600063#EEEE00500","speaker":"1281","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467828600,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan is sharing time.

I would be at the two semi-finals.<\/p><p>There is no police force or government in the world which can claim or demonstrate that prohibition of drugs is the solution to the problems surrounding drugs, or the problem of the drugs themselves, but thankfully there are many examples from all over the world of how relaxing drug laws brings positive outcomes for everyone involved.  Such examples show how lending a helping hand to those who find themselves trapped in a cycle of drug use, instead of criminalising them for needing a substance to lean on, can help them lead stable lives and save communities and families much pain and sorrow.  European countries such as Portugal and Switzerland have been showing us how progressive drug policy works for decades.<\/p><p>The most effective way to disrupt the gangs in Ireland is to take what is estimated to be a &euro;1 billion industry away from them.  The heroin trade is booming, and a recent UN report estimates that the Irish authorities intercept less than 3% of the heroin on the market.  If we really wanted to disrupt that trade, care for those addicted to the drug and do away with the stigma that surrounds it, we would follow the example of the Swiss and legally prescribe heroin in supervised injection rooms to those who need it.<\/p><p>British doctors used to prescribe to addicts as a matter of course heroin that was manufactured by the British state, and it did not have a heroin problem.  For decades, the number of heroin addicts in Britain never exceeded 1,000 and the addicts were mainly middle aged, from all kinds of social background and, according to doctors at the time, perfectly stable and healthy.<\/p><p>Addiction depletes one's day-to-day existence in many respects and is a source of human suffering, but under the safe supervision of doctors, some of what are thought to be the most dangerous drugs in the world can be regularly consumed by an addict who can live a relatively stable existence.  Heroin, safely prescribed by doctors, is benign, and there is no proof anywhere to the contrary.  As with most drugs, it is when its production and distribution are handed over to criminals, as we have done here in Ireland, that it becomes dangerous.  When heroin is pushed onto the black market, it gets cut with paracetamol, drain cleaner, sand, sugar, starch, powdered milk, talcum powder, coffee, brick dust, cement dust, gravy powder, face powder, curry powder, crushed bleach crystals - pretty much anything.  When a person takes contaminated heroin, it clogs up veins and destroys them.<\/p><p>When heroin is illegal, street heroin addicts need to raise large sums of money.  They can rob or prostitute themselves or, more easily, buy their drugs, take what they need, cut the rest with some talcum powder and sell it to others.  They need to convince others to take it to expand their customer base to support their habit. It is the laws around heroin that make it harmful, not the heroin itself, and because we insist on ensuring the criminals stay in control of this substance, those who take it will continue to suffer and die, the criminals will continue to make vast sums of money and we will continue to waste vast sums of public money intercepting a minuscule fraction of what is for sale.<\/p><p>In Switzerland, they saw the stupidity of this situation back in the early 1990s and have been prescribing heroin to citizens for more than 20 years.  The right-wing parties there have twice tried to overturn the programme by national referendum, and twice the Swiss have overwhelmingly supported the continued prescription of heroin to heroin addicts.  They saw that when heroin is illegal, the addict is trapped in a tragic vicious circle of getting money, buying heroin and having to inject, all day, every day.  It becomes a job, not just an addiction.  Johann Hari, in his powerful new book, <i>Chasing the Scream<\/i>, talks to those involved in administering the heroin and those receiving it.  The doctors stress how the heroin programme is built around helping the patients to rebuild their lives slowly by getting therapy, a home and a job.<\/p><p>Hari spoke to a number of heroin addicts who received treatment at one of the clinics in the city centre of Geneva.  One owns a gas station and another works at a bank.<br\/><br\/>A psychiatrist, Dr. Daniel Martin, who works with the heroin programme, clearly explains the work they are doing as follows:<\/p><blockquote>Most addicts here come with an empty glass inside them; when they take heroin, the glass becomes full but only for a few hours and then it drains down to nothing again.  The purpose of this program is to gradually build a life for the addict so they can put something else into that glass; a social network, a job, some daily pleasures.  If you can do that, it will mean that when the heroin drains, you are not left totally empty.  Over time, as your life has more to it, the glass will contain more and more, so it will take less and less heroin to fill it up.  And in the end, there may be enough within you that you feel full without any heroin at all.<\/blockquote><p>It goes without saying that the Swiss programme is and has been a huge success that has saved countless lives, while it has undermined and effectively destroyed the power of the drug dealers, who along with the conservatives and the United States Drug Enforcement Agency, are the most vitriolic opponents of the programme.  The United States has chaos at the heart of its drug war and has behind bars a higher proportion of its population than any other country in the world.<br\/><br\/>In Switzerland, the gangs have no power over the addicted because the state is caring for them.  The average patient uses the programme for three years, after which 85% of participants have stopped using every day.  Crimes committed by those on heroin have plummeted, with 55% fewer car thefts and 80% fewer muggings and burglaries.  This drop happened almost immediately after the programme started.  HIV infections from heroin use have almost entirely disappeared.  Why do we continue to pursue a drug policy that wastes money, kills people, destroys lives, empowers criminals and ruins neighbourhoods?<br\/><br\/>This Bill is designed to criminalise the sale and possession of certain prevalent prescription medicines.  It could be pointed out that we have a problem with prescription medicines at a time when I am advocating prescribing heroin.  However, a finer point needs to be appreciated.  These prescription drugs are cheaper than heroin, easier to get and are just as dangerous as heroin, which is regulated by criminals.  They provide a similar amount of oblivion and pain relief from a society that excels at social exclusion and inequality.  Criminalising those with addiction is placing further punishment on those who are already victims of the regressive laws surrounding prohibition.  They are often the victims of governments that for years now have pursued a neo-liberal agenda that promotes inequality.<br\/><br\/>As Senator Lynn Ruane has pointed out, this type of legislation will simply move people on to new drugs and when they are outlawed they will move on to other new drugs and so on.  That is exactly what happened in Canada.  We know that heroin is safe when prescribed and supervised by a doctor and we know that prescribing it to those who are addicted will lead to a betterment of the addicts lives, take away finance and power from the dealers, make communities safer, save the State money, and free Garda resources to pursue real crimes.  They might even have the resources to properly investigate what is going on in NAMA.  Why are we not even considering this as a real possibility instead of passing a Bill that will waste Garda time, make criminals rich and ruin more lives?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600064#FFFF00600","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467829200,"counter":565,"content":"<p>I stand here this evening very conscious of what has brought about this legislation and the earlier motion from the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.

It took the murders and the responses of the communities, the residents and those working in the projects and services, to bring about a sense of urgency that has us debating these two issues.

In September 2014, I put a question to the Minister about dealing with the Z-drugs and I was told the problem was acknowledged and garda&iacute; were working with relevant agencies.  I raised a Topical Issue matter on this in October 2015 in which I stated that communities were flooded with what was known as Z-drugs.  They are used with other drugs and alcohol and caused havoc and distress, pushing people further into addiction and causing much pain for families and the wider community.  They also contributed to anti-social behaviour and criminality.  The communities I represent were looking at young men who were selling these tablets, as it is mainly young men, some of them only in their late teens.  In the Topical Issue debate I offered to bring the Minister of State to a couple of places within the constituency where he could buy packets of Z-tablets without any problem.  I could also bring him to the people living beside this activity, where they could tell him about the nightmare of living with that open drug dealing.<\/p>  <p>  I was told, in response to the questions and the Topical Issue matter, that this was a matter for the Garda.  We knew its hands were tied because of a lack of appropriate legislation.  Garda&iacute; were being pressurised by communities at numerous community forum meetings and at other committee meetings and asked why they were not doing anything about this drug dealing.  We know their hands were tied with that.  We were told emergency legislation was needed and if it was introduced, places could be cleared of Z-drugs dealing very quickly.  It was not a priority and it is very regrettable that it took those murders to bring us to this point.<\/p>  <p>  We know the two relevant Acts were inadequate to deal with these tablets.  A garda could have a reasonable suspicion of dealing and search a person but if tablets were found, garda&iacute; had to give back a third of them so the person could do individual testing.  The communities were looking at the open dealing and it was irrelevant to them as to whether the drug was heroin, cocaine, ecstasy or tablets; it was interfering with their lives.  On a number of occasions I was on a quiet street and saw two or three young men emerge.  Within seconds, there could be anything from 30 to 50 people arriving in taxis, cars or on foot.  They heard through social media that the deal was on and the tablets were available.  They were not just coming from Dublin as they came from far and wide.  One can imagine an older person in particular living in that community, looking out the window and suddenly seeing masses of people around.  The fear is palpable and garda&iacute; were under pressure to act.  They kept saying their hands were tied.<\/p>  <p>  In 2012 I had a Private Members' business slot dealing with addiction.  I mentioned poly-drug use at the time, specifically the increase in use of dangerous substances that are illegal and unregulated.  I also mentioned the increased use of technology in accessing those substances and harm through overdoses, fatalities, long-term ill health, suicide, mental health issues and homelessness.  I called on the Government to prioritise addiction as a health issue and not primarily as a criminal issue.  I called on it to ensure the necessary resources were provided.  I also asked that legislation be introduced to deal with the Internet sourcing and accessing of drugs and that it would apply the harmonised EU definition of a medicinal product to a new psychoactive substance so the national medicine agencies could prohibit unauthorised importation, marketing and distribution.  The motion was defeated four years ago and we are speaking about the same issues now.<\/p>  <p>  I read what I called for in 2012 and the irony struck me because it is coming out again in discussions with the Taoiseach, communities and projects.  We were talking about supports for those high-risk, lower socio-economic populations that experience social disadvantage, which leads to addiction problems.  I called for improved supports in the areas of health care, education, housing and employment opportunities, and to refrain from further cuts to the services provided by the community and voluntary sectors for those in addiction, with continuing support for special community employment schemes for those in drug rehabilitation.  As we know, those projects saw cuts of between 30% and 40%.  It is ironic that in 2012 there was also a murder and a retaliatory murder carried out in front of young children.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.<\/p>  <p>  When the Minister, Deputy Harris, discussed this in the Seanad he stated that it is an important element of the Government's arsenal in the fight against drug dealing, trafficking and consequent gangland crime.  The Bill deals with a very particular aspect but we all know addiction covers a wide field.  I support what the Minister and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, are doing but we must examine other issues.<\/p><p>One of these relates to the unintended consequences of the legislation.  The projects that work with those addicted to Z-drugs and benzos are under major pressure.  Their supply is going to be interfered with when the legislation comes into force.  As a result, the projects are going to need support with the additional work that they are going to be doing.  There are problems in respect of detoxing from these drugs.  The projects have been seeing the difficulties for those addicted to benzos in trying to bring down their use so they can reach the point where they can get into a residential programme.  We know we do not have enough rehab places and the coming into force of this legislation could be the wake-up call for some in addiction to tackle their problems, particularly if they can access rehab and other services at that point.  We do not want them left in the precarious position of looking for alternative drugs.  We know there are plenty of those around, from crystal meth to heroin to crack cocaine.  The more addicts that get into recovery, the better it will be for them, their families and communities and also for our economy.  We know the cost of this, through the health system and through the justice system.<\/p> <p> Another aspect is the care planning and case management for individuals in addiction treatment, rehab and recovery.  We must also look at the methadone protocol.  I acknowledge the stabilising effect of methadone.  I know young people and older individuals who were able to improve their lives because they were on methadone, but it is only a part of a treatment process.  Methadone is not a stand-alone treatment, so there is a need for frequent monitoring and reduction of dosages.  Those on methadone need access to other services and treatment through primary health care.  Methadone, except in very extreme circumstances, should not be a long-term strategy.  Diagnoses of HIV are increasing among those injecting the drug snow blow.  I recently attended an event hosted by HIV Ireland at which this matter was highlighted and at which literature on harm reduction, which shows people what to do, was available.<\/p> <p> The SAOL Project works with women in addiction and it developed a really valuable programme called Reduce the Use.  Again, this was very practical, helping people to respond to their key drug issues and also for the professionals who work with them.  It made practical suggestions about the skills and tools needed, about cravings and relapse prevention and about negative thinking.  It was giving people in addiction the chance to work on their addiction at their own pace and in their own space.<\/p> <p> I will move on to decriminalising possession of small amounts for personal use.  It is not right that people are carrying this charge with them for the rest of their lives, but we also need to look at how some who are in recovery for quite a number of years are prevented from progressing in education and in study because they have a criminal record.  The bigger picture relates to the question of the legalisation.  We need a debate on this and I hope we can have it.  The decriminalisation of the possession of small amounts is the easy part.  Fr. Peter McVerry does not like the word &ldquo;legalisation&rdquo;.  He would prefer to talk about controlling the supply of drugs.  He sees it as the State taking control of the supply of drugs.  We know one immediate effect would be getting at the criminal gangs and cutting off their sources of wealth.<\/p> <p> I also want to mention the Recovery Academy, which came about as a result of a symposium of over 100 people, the majority of whom were in recovery.  They were acknowledging the role of harm-reduction measures and getting people into treatment, but the challenge then was to encourage individuals to move from treatment into recovery.  Again, the Recovery Academy came up with solutions that were practical, achievable and cost-effective.  It was about reorienting services to a recovery paradigm.  I hope the Ministers of State mention at the consultation process in which they are hoping to engage that those groups I have mentioned &ndash; the Recovery Academy, the SAOL Project and Soilse &ndash; will have a space there.  They have been there before.  They have been involved in other consultation processes.  We are all talked out on this.  People know what needs to be done and what can be done.  At a recent Recovery Academy meeting I met a group from England that was presenting.  With &pound;1 million, they had been able to open Recovery Central.  This is a caf&eacute; - with a space for business incubation units and with social enterprises - for those in recovery.  It was on a high street, so it was visible and was, therefore, also making a contribution to tackling the stigma attached to being in addiction.<\/p> <p> We know all the pillars of the national drug strategy &ndash; control of supply, treatment and rehabilitation &ndash; but prevention and education are the Cinderellas of the process, of that there is no doubt.  I was involved with prevention and education in the North Inner City Drugs and Alcohol Task Force and we ran a number of conventions for young people.  There were four in all, with about 400 young people attending.  They came from fifth year and transition year classes in the north-east and north-west inner city.  The conventions were facilitated by the youth leaders, but it was a listening exercise with young people and they were very willing to engage, because they appreciated that they were being listened to.  There was no telling them because they were aware of all of those dangers.  Some of them were prepared to take those risks.<\/p> <p> We also looked at intervention and prevention.  The levels of intervention and prevention varied greatly.  I know I am a former teacher, but I really feel that we need to look at prevention and education in a different way.  We should not just land it on schools because there are so many difficulties attached to schools in the context of this issue.  The young people to whom I refer very much appreciated the fact that we were willing to listen to their views and we produced a report on foot of what was said.  They were certainly willing to look at ways that would get those of them who were into drug and alcohol abuse to think.  There was a significant number of individuals who were not into those things, but it was about getting those who were abusing drugs and alcohol to stop and think about what they were doing, why they were doing it, what the dangers are if they go this route, what else they could do or how they could help themselves in a better way.<\/p> <p> I hope there will also be a space for young people in the consultation process, especially young teenagers from the areas that are most affected, to come in and give their views.  Equally, I hope there will be a space for the users forum, UISCE, which is represented on the North Inner City Drugs and Alcohol Task Force.  It has a really strong contribution to make in this area.  What the Ministers of State are doing is welcome, and it will certainly be welcomed by the communities in the north inner city.  However, it constitutes some very small steps on a much longer road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600065#GGGG00200","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467829800,"counter":567,"content":"<p>As has been pointed out, this Bill comes before the D&aacute;il consequent on the recent series of murders in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city.  The Minister for Health confirmed in the Seanad on 15 June that the Bill had been expedited in response to those murders and because the Government and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were both of the view that controlling these products under the misuse of drugs legislation would lead to more effective enforcement.  In fact, it appears this was the one tool the Garda had specifically requested.  While I fully appreciate the seriousness of the situation in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city and acknowledge the actions taken by the Government, I have serious concerns about the idea that this Bill is the most effective way to deal with the situation.  My doubts are further heightened by the failure to include the promised provisions for supervised injecting facilities.  These provisions would have enabled the Minister for Health to issue licences permitting the establishment of supervised injection facilities to provide enhanced clinical support and to mitigate the problem of public injecting by chronic drug users.  These provisions have now been kicked down the road.<\/p>  <p>  Most importantly, there is no urgency to the recognition by the Government that continuing down the road of criminalising the use of drugs is not working and that other countries have recognised this and taken a different approach or are in the process of doing so.  Put simply, the war on drugs has not worked and it certainly has not worked for those who are criminalised for their use of drugs.  The European Drug Report 2016 states that the majority of reported drug law offences relate to the possession of drugs for personal use, rather than for sale.  In Europe overall, it is estimated that more than 1 million of these offences were reported in 2014.  That is an increase of 24% on the figure that obtained in 2006.  Of the reported drug offences, more than three quarters involved cannabis, so we have a significant amount of Garda resources going into charging people with the use of drugs and a very low success rate in the conviction of drug dealers.<\/p>  <p>  If we return to alternative ways of dealing with this, Portugal - a small country like Ireland - recognised in the 1990s that the drug problem had become one of the main concerns of the public, as had the significant increase in the number of people infected with HIV-AIDS and other associated illnesses.  My knowledge of Portugal comes from a report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, whose members visited Lisbon and studied the situation there.<\/p><p>That report acknowledges that drug abuse was not confined to any particular social class but was a universal problem.  It also noted that not all addicts were using illicit drugs but were in some cases addicted to prescription drugs.  To criminalise, rather than treat, this group of people was viewed as wrong.  The first step in Portugal was to remove responsibility for this matter from the justice department and reassign it to the health department.  It was also noted that, while it was still an offence to take or possess drugs, the offence is now treated in a similar way to a traffic offence.  This provision applies only to possession of a quantity equivalent to up to ten days' supply for personal use.  Any person found in possession of drugs must report within 72 hours to a commission for addiction dissuasion for a treatment programme tailored to the individual's needs to ensure the best possible result.  The report is worth reading because a number of things are highlighted by the joint Oireachtas committee about the system in Portugal.  One advantage is that a person ends up with no criminal record.  This is an important component of the approach.  The purpose of this provision is to allow the person a second chance to turn his or her life around.<br\/><br\/>The importance of education was also mentioned.  They mentioned the importance of breaking the cycle and highlighted the fact that drug addicts have the opportunity to move away from a life of drugs through positive discrimination when it comes to gaining employment.  The system offers employers tax breaks to employ recovering addicts and the state will pay the employee's salary.  The employer is required to release the employee for treatment and counselling until his or her programme has concluded.  The delegation was told that, in many cases, these employees gained full-time employment and did not go back to using drugs.  Deputy Wallace has given other examples, but this is one the Oireachtas looked at.  The delegation may not have agreed with the approach, but it certainly thought it was well worth looking at.  <br\/><br\/>The outcome in Portugal has not been an increase in drug taking, nor has it resulted in Portugal becoming a destination for drug tourists.  The report sets out the fears that were expressed when the relevant legislation was passed and the outcome 15 years later.  It states that drug consumers are no longer looked upon or treated as criminals, either by the authorities or by society.  They become less dependent on traffickers and police discretion, and the system has saved money by avoiding thousands of criminal cases dealing with drug consumption, which is very important for police resources, as such cases cost time and money with absolutely no gain.<br\/><br\/>Closer to home, we have the report from the Royal Society for Public Health in the UK, called Taking a New Line on Drugs.  It states, &quot;We need a new, people-centred approach to drug policy, rooted in public health and the best available evidence.&quot;  The time for reframing the global approach to illicit drugs is long overdue and the imbalance between the criminal justice and health approaches to illicit drugs is counterproductive.  This is a high-level report published in the past couple of months.  It assessed the situation in the UK as regards the rising harm to health from illegal drugs, with reference to their context within the wider drug-scape, including legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco, which is particularly important given that we were all at a briefing on the Alcohol Bill today.  It sets out a new vision for a holistic, public-health-led approach to drugs policy at a UK-wide level.  Indeed, the executive summary states:<\/p><blockquote>At both individual and population level alcohol and tobacco cause far greater harm to health and well being than many of their illegal counterparts.  Tobacco kills the most people and alcohol is not far behind with death rates from alcohol misuse on the rise.  Alcohol and tobacco use alone costs society more than all class A drugs combined.<\/blockquote><p>It also discusses decriminalising the personal use and possession of all illegal drugs and diverting those whose use is problematic into appropriate treatment centres.<br\/><br\/>I will finish by asking the Minister to look at these reports and at international evidence and best practice and to let them determine the next strategy and the next piece of legislation that comes before this D&aacute;il so that we can all work together and tackle a problem that will not be tackled by criminalising drug users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600066#HHHH00200","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467830400,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I am pleased to speak on this Bill but it is regrettable that the attendance is so poor, which reflects the general attitude of the political establishment towards issues associated with drug misuse.  I welcome the new Minister in her new role.  I had the opportunity to meet and greet her in Ballymun in my own constituency last week and we appreciated her visit to the area.  I know she has a very keen interest in substance misuse and other issues associated with disadvantaged areas and I am sure she will be a big success in the job.<\/p>  <p>  As a previous occupant of the position, though I shared it with a number of other responsibilities, I very much welcome the fact that we now have a Minister of State who is dedicated and has sole responsibility for substance misuse.  I encourage the Minister to be as vocal as possible within Government on the issues associated with drug misuse which ravage so many of our constituencies and our communities across the country.  I also strongly encourage her to meet on a regular basis with those involved in the local drugs task forces and in regional drugs task forces.  They are a sounding board for what is actually happening on the ground and if she builds up a good relationship with them she will be very well informed about not only the scale of the problem and what is and is not working but emerging trends too.  That is important because the drug problem changes all the time and the substances involved change on a regular basis.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the Minister of State's previous party colleagues did not place any great value on the role of the drugs task forces or their valuable role in combatting the drug problem in Ireland.  There have been various attempts in recent years to contain local community groups, including drugs task forces, but despite the attempts of Ministers the task forces remained outside their control and I am very glad about that.  Many other community organisations were closed down, however, and communities are paying a big price for that.  There have been huge cutbacks in community funding compared to what was available in previous years.  This may have been seen as an economising measure but will not turn out to be so in the medium and long term.  The funding withdrawn from disadvantaged communities was the glue that kept many of them together, and we will pay a price for the cutbacks.<\/p>  <p>  I very much welcome the publication of this Bill.  It has been a very long time coming.  In August 2002 the local drugs task force in Ballymun and YAP, the organisation the Minister of State met last week, produced a report called Mother's Little Helpers, and this was already identified as an emerging problem.  There was a tendency to over-prescribe benzodiazepines and Z drugs, a practice that was replicated across many disadvantaged communities, with women, often young mothers, going to GPs and public health nurses showing all the signs of stress associated with social disadvantage and having to cope with rearing families in very poor conditions.<\/p><p>It was often the case that the general practitioner took out the pad and wrote a prescription.  Certainly, there was a significant problem with over-prescribing of benzodiazepines going back that far.<\/p> <p> In the past seven or eight years the local drugs task forces became aware of this as a very significant problem and the profile of the problem had changed somewhat.  It was still associated with over-prescribing but it was also associated with the widespread availability of prescription drugs.  Some of those were finding their way onto the streets through leakage from over-prescribing but other amounts were being brought in at the ports and airports.  Increasingly in recent years we have seen where large quantities were brought in by ordering them on the Internet.<\/p> <p> Over the past four years or so there seemed to be very little political leadership on this issue in the Department.  That is regrettable.  For whatever reason it seems to have slipped down the political agenda.  It certainly did under the previous Government, along with the need to prioritise the whole area of drug abuse, drug treatment and rehabilitation.  It is very much welcome that it is finally back on the agenda.  It is unfortunate that it took very serious incidents and a high escalation in gangland crime, particularly in the north inner city, to get it back on the agenda because some of us in this House have been raising it over a number of years.  It was not taken to be a serious issue, mainly because it predominantly affected working class areas, and there had not been much interest on the part of the previous Government in issues affecting such areas.  It took the explosion in gangland crime in the north inner city and public opinion demanding that something be done.  When this blew up, a number of Ministers suddenly discovered that there was a very serious problem and it does not just affect the north and south inner city.  It has now taken a hold throughout the country.  Second only to the problem of alcohol misuse is the problem of prescription drug misuse.  A problem that was confined to disadvantaged areas a number of years ago has become a scourge throughout the entire country.  Prescription drugs, benzodiazepines and Z drugs seem to be the drugs of choice for vast numbers of people and they are freely available in every city and town.  As a result of largely neglect at an official level, we now have a major problem that has to be tackled and it is very regrettable that it has got to this point before any serious action has been taken.<\/p> <p> Front-line workers across several different disciplines have been calling for this measure for years.  My local drugs task force in Ballymun, of which I am a member as are other public representatives in the area - I was also a member of the Finglas drugs task force - called for it but it is coming back from all of the drugs task forces, and has been for several years, that this is the second biggest problem in regard to substance abuse, second only to alcohol misuse.<\/p> <p> What was identified a number of years ago during my short time in the Department of Health was the need to introduce regulations to tackle this area.  We thought we were in a situation where primary legislation was required and, as a result of a Supreme Court ruling last week, we do not need that primary legislation but I am glad that we are at least having an opportunity to discuss this issue here.<\/p> <p> It is very difficult to discuss the issue in the absence of regulations.  We have heard various Members in this House and in the other House talking critically about these proposals and, on the face of it, it does appear that this is an attempt to criminalise people who have addiction problems with prescription drugs.  I do not believe that is the intention of it.  If the kind of regulations that will come forward shortly are like those that were produced in draft form four or five years ago, I would be very confident that that is definitely not the intention of this legislation.  The intention of this legislation is clearly to tackle the problem of the street dealing of prescription drugs, which is widespread.  Various people, including the Garda and the customs service, have been calling for urgent action in this area for several years.<\/p> <p> It is unfortunate that we do not have the regulations to consider now.  It would be helpful from the point of view of the public debate, the debate in this House and in the Seanad if we had the regulations because they would explain what is behind this move to legislate in this area.  It would also be helpful if there was input from Members of this House to those regulations.  I hope they are sound and robust and that they take into consideration all aspects of the problem, but it would be helpful if we could see them.  Bearing in mind that they are secondary legislation the Minister of State is not obliged to debate them.  She just lays them before the House, but I ask her to consider allowing some Government time for a discussion on the regulations, ideally prior to them being signed.  That is not an excuse for delaying them by any means.  If we had sight of the regulations now it would allow for far better scrutiny of the Bill, and it is unfortunate they were not published in advance.  I hope there is no further delay.<\/p> <p> The substance of the Bill is sound.  The primary purpose is to control certain drugs and to try to tackle the street dealing of prescription drugs, especially benzodiazepines and Z drugs.<\/p> <p> It is important that people who have spoken against the Bill and those who have raised concerns are clear about its primary purpose.  Obviously, it will do very little on its own, and no one is claiming that it will.  The country does not just need new laws; we know it needs new drug services.  We need to concentrate particularly on rehabilitation.  There is a need to update the national drugs strategy and I recognise that is under way.  It is critical that the new strategy includes all aspects of alcohol misuse because until recently there was concern that alcohol might be an afterthought or not included at all.<\/p> <p> There is a need for many more dual diagnosis places for people with combined mental health and addiction issues.  Many people who contributed to this debate in both Houses talked about the reasons people get involved in substance misuse.  We have a major problem with it in this country, whether it is alcohol, prescription drugs, heroin or what are called recreational drugs.  For some reason there is a basic problem in the Irish psyche.  Large numbers of Irish people want to get out of their heads on a very regular basis.  Many people spoke about the fact that very significant numbers of people are in serious pain for one reason or another.  It is pain caused by abuse, neglect, isolation or alienation.  That is very much at the heart of the Irish psyche and we need more study of that area.  We talk about responses to substance misuse but we spend very little time researching the root causes of it and the reasons people feel they have to take steps to numb their minds and get out of it.  That is not just an issue affecting disadvantaged communities but it is something I believe warrants further research.<\/p> <p> I first became aware of this problem in 2002 in Ballymun but also in the past seven, eight, nine or ten years where it was a consistent issue arising at the local drugs task force meetings in Ballymun.  The problem was with misuse and over-prescribing.  There was a very significant problem of polydrug use and other Members referred to that.  There was very high usage of prescribed drugs in comparison to other countries.<\/p><p>That also warranted further investigation.<\/p> <p> During my short time in the Department of Health we undertook a study to look at prescribing patterns.  We only had access to data as it related to public patients.  We looked at prescribing patterns of GPs across the State.  There was a wide variation among GPs in the quantities and durations of prescriptions.   There were some very serious cases.  In one example a person was arrested and in other situations there had to be serious interventions by the HSE with direct approaches to GPs to ensure they changed their prescribing practices.  GPs themselves welcomed the information.  Many of them are operating on their own in their practice and they welcomed the data showing how they compared to their peers. That basic information is the starting point to changing practice.  I do not know if that project is ongoing but it is important that it would continue.  We need to investigate and invigilate what is happening in patterns of prescribing.  Academic studies and Department of Health studies have over the years shown that Ireland is out of line with other European countries in the high level of prescribing of sedatives and benzos.<\/p> <p> It is a long time since the problem of street trading in prescription drugs became apparent, especially in the Dublin area.  I recall when I was in the Department of Health four or five years ago, one could actually look out from the Department and see dealing going on directly underneath the windows, all around the Screen cinema and on the Liffey boardwalk.  It was public and open and everybody wondered how on earth this was going on under the eye of the Garda, the Department of Health and everybody else.  When there was consultation and engagement on this problem by the law enforcement agencies and other players the Garda made it clear that its hands were tied regarding the policing of this problem.  The garda&iacute; would stop people who appeared to be dealing on the street and who may have had a few packets of benzos or Z drugs in their pockets.  However, because it was not an offence to be in possession of any quantity of benzos, garda&iacute; had to prove not only possession but also intent to supply.  That was the difficulty and why it was so hard to police the issue.<\/p> <p> With regard to the Customs and Excise, whose job it also was to police the problem, there were people coming in to the State with holdalls full of prescription drugs bought or accessed in Spain, Portugal or elsewhere.  The difficulty again, at airports and ports, was proving intent to supply.  The law enforcement agencies have been looking for the law to be tightened in this area for many years.  It was seen by the establishment as a niche issue and was neglected for far too long.<\/p> <p> It is very easy to order supplies of these drugs, in large quantities, over the internet.  The regulations a few years ago said that if a person was found in possession of prescription drugs they had to prove they had permission for them in one of two ways: either a prescription from the GP which would entitle a person to have benzos or Z drugs, or a licence to import.  I assume that the regulations would be the same in that regard.  There are associated problems when the substances being misused are legal and can be prescribed such as steroids.  Very large numbers of people are now addicted to steroids which are available on the street, on the black market and are part of the whole poly-drugs scene.<\/p> <p> Another issue which has recently come to light is the widespread availability of tanning pills.  Apparently, tanning pills, which can be bought on the street and can be accessed through friends or over the Internet, have the effect of making a person very hyper, they cannot sleep and they become agitated.  In order to counteract the impact of tanning pills people are also taking large quantities of benzos, sleeping tablets or Z drugs.  This is an emerging phenomenon which has become obvious over the last year or so.  This is what happens when a black market exists for prescription drugs which are very dangerous when taken in the wrong way or in large quantities.  I hope that tanning pills, or the substances in the tanning pills, will be added to the list and will be covered by the regulations.<\/p> <p> There are many statistics that show the scale of the problem in this country regarding the abuse of some prescription drugs.  Two fifths of poisonings in 2013 involved<\/p> <p> I pay tribute to the excellent work done in the Department five years ago on this issue.  The senior people involved there were Marita Kinsella and Siobhan Kenna who did extraordinary work.  It is unfortunate that the work came to a standstill and was left to gather dust for the last number of years.  When I left the Department in September 2012 I had signed off on draft regulations.  I accept that there was a need for primary legislation but in the meantime there has been a huge amount of slippage and very little attention paid by people who have been in the Department in recent times.<\/p> <p> As well as restrictions on possession and the intent to supply there are proposed restrictions on prescribing.  We know that benzos should only be prescribed for a limited period of time, should be reviewed on a regular basis and there should be no practice of repeat prescriptions.  That has been addressed with a number of patient groups and while there were concerns regarding people with epilepsy I believe that special arrangements were made in their case.<\/p> <p> There was widespread consultation five years ago with all of the different players, the law enforcement agencies, the drugs task forces, the patient groups, etc.  An important development in recent years was the creation of the community national counselling service.  We cannot underestimate the demand there is for a national counselling service.  It is very welcome that it has been rolled out so far but it is still quite patchy and there are major parts of the country that are not covered.<\/p> <p> To those Members in the House and in the Seanad who had concerns about this I would say that the overwhelming feedback from front-line workers is that these provisions are long overdue.  That has certainly been the feedback from the garda&iacute;.  Their difficulties could be addressed by these measures and they could be much more proactive in tackling this problem.  Drug dealers have been flouting the law by carrying relatively small amounts knowing that they could get away with it.<\/p> <p> Feedback from front-line medics is that misuse of these substances continues to be a very significant problem and that such use is very disruptive of care plans.  It is very demoralising for staff working in drug treatment centres who prepare their care plans, get their clients onto a programme and then their clients are bombarded on the street by offers of benzos and Z drugs.  This is what is happening.  People are being bombarded and it is very difficult for those who have addiction problems to avoid this.  They are given the drugs for free initially in order to get them into taking them.<\/p><p>Very quickly they get caught up in that tangled web.  Feedback from client community workers is that the misuse contributes to serious anti-social behaviour and that this law is desperately needed.  To those Members who have concerns about this, who balk at the idea of it, it is important to point out this is not a case of criminalising those with addiction problems but those who deal in death, in these substances that are so dangerous.  We need to strengthen the law to ensure we can tackle this problem and take control of it.<\/p> <p> I have serious concerns about the oversight of drug treatment services.  We spend &euro;100 million per annum on drug treatment yet there is little or no accountability, research or examination to see whether we are getting value for money.  It is a huge budget to dole out on methadone.  That seems to be the problem and there is no review of the value of this treatment.  As statistics are not  always automatically collected I encourage the Minister of State - if she has not been provided with them to date - to get answers to a number of questions.  For example, what do we know about methadone treatment, are we getting value for money, is it making a difference to people&rsquo;s lives and how long are people in methadone treatment?  Many people have been getting this treatment for ten years and more but there has been no intervention to get them to start on a road to recovery.  Recovery must be restored to the lexicon of drug treatment. In recent years we have tended to forget about recovery and to concentrate on maintenance.  Rehabilitation and recovery must be the by-words in the approach to drug and substance misuse generally.<\/p> <p> While we need to tackle these problems and to be much more innovative in ensuring there are proper care plans for all people with addiction problems we must vastly expand the range of drug treatment services available, particularly to the many people who are addicted to prescription drugs.  The level of service for such people is very limited.  There was an element of turning a blind eye and regarding the problem as minor.  We do not have significant drug treatment services for people addicted to prescription drugs.  <\/p> <p> When the law is changed and the approach to the widespread availability of prescription drugs changes there will be many people desperately looking for treatment.  We have to ensure the system is geared for that.  The Minister of State should talk to the people working in community addiction services and the drugs task forces because they have a handle on the scale of demand there will be for services.  It is important to be geared up for that and that the system can cope with the demand. <\/p> <p> While there are very significant problems with substance misuse across the population, we cannot get away from the fact that the problem is most pronounced in areas of severe disadvantage.  Providing drug treatment services and awareness is important.  Tackling the supply of drugs is critically important and that is where this legislation will play a role.  Unless we change the conditions that lead people to self-medicate in an effort to block out the issues that make their lives very difficult we will not get to the root of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600067#JJJJ00200","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467832200,"counter":573,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle nua.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; f&oacute;gartha go f&oacute;ill so n&iacute;lim chun a ainm a r&aacute;.<\/p>  <p>  This is a very important debate and I welcome the legislation the Minister of State has proposed.  It is timely and has been brought forward because of appalling deaths and criminality in parts of inner city Dublin.  It is urgent and necessary because the substances named in this legislation, and I presume others which should be allowed to be added, will help fight the criminality involved.  We must never forget that the communities that misuse drugs most are the ones that are most disadvantaged.  They are the communities where people have the least education, the poorest health, the highest unemployment rate and the highest number of people in prison.  We need a more holistic approach as a society to fight this.  This is not an attack on the Government.  We must have a new vision for change.  It is obvious what we must do.  We must go into the communities that suffer the greatest poverty and deprivation.  We know this is what we should do, particularly in terms of education.  Pre-school education must be an absolute priority.  It makes a huge difference to children from disadvantaged homes to get an extra year or two of pre-school education.  When they start normal school they can compete with their peers from any other part of the community.  We need to accelerate the engagement and involvement in education and health care in these communities.  <\/p>  <p>  I used to be a teacher agus a Cheann Comhairle, bh&iacute; tusa i do mh&uacute;inteoir freisin tr&aacute;th, and I know from my experience of 27 years in a classroom exactly how difficult people find it to come to school if they have not had a breakfast or if they do not have a parent at home. I know how difficult it is for a school to address the issues of young children with behavioural problems when there is nobody at home to look after them or when the culture in the home does not give high priority to education.  I am not preaching but I am saying we need to intervene earlier.  The significant increase in the ability of people to reach the very best in their lives in the most disadvantaged communities is measured by the earlier and the broader the education they get.  That is the first area to tackle.<\/p>  <p>  Affirming the importance of these communities and putting the resources into them is very important.  I welcome the homework clubs, the garda liaison officers and all the community workers involved in many if not all of these communities.  That is leading to change.  The Minister of State is well aware of these problems in her constituency.  Health care is also important, as is educating mothers and fathers in parenting.  People have suffered in recent years, particularly in the communities where drugs are most prevalent because of the recession and increased unemployment and they have poor self-esteem.  The poorer communities have suffered most in the recession.  As the economy improves we must give more back to these communities, identify and prioritise their needs.  Fighting drugs and fighting crime is very important but we must do much more.  Many people grow up in communities that do not have proper sports facilities, sports centres or decent youth clubs.  We need to support all of the existing organisations that are involved in these communities, we need to increase investment in those communities and the number of professionals who can intervene, support, acknowledge and work with people who are poor and outside our society.<\/p>  <p>  It can be very sad when people get into trouble for taking drugs.  I had a 14 year old student who once in his life took gas from a cylinder in a derelict house.  <\/p><p>Unfortunately, he died that day.  It was very sad because he never had a home or an opportunity to get what he should have got, namely, the care and support that he needed.  That is an extreme case, but it did happen.  All of us who worked with that child remember him well.<\/p> <p> It is a tragedy for our society when we read about the inquests into those who have died as a result of taking drugs at parties or whatever.  It is very sad to look at the faces in newspapers of the fine young people who had all of their lives to live but are in their graves because of drugs they should not have taken or because they took an overdose.  As we all know, taking an overdose or drugs is often a cry for help.  We can and must do more.<\/p> <p> I am aware of a number of garda&iacute; who have a vision for change.  I am aware of a number of primary school teachers and garda&iacute; who are alert to all of these issues.  Like Deputy Shortall, I am aware of community workers involved in this area.  The more involvement, investment and affirmation of individuals the better their lives and the better our society will be.<\/p> <p> In the recent recession the question of homelessness, families being brought up in hotels and people living in abject poverty who did not know when they would be put out of their accommodation arose.  The Government has taken action on that, which I welcome.  Nevertheless, the voices that I hear articulating their needs, concerns and worries say they are still in danger.  We still need to do more.  I welcome and very much support the Government initiative on housing.  The Chairman of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness, who came from the other side of the House, was exceptionally incisive and decisive in producing an excellent report.  We need to deal with housing issues.<\/p> <p> This is about giving people back their lives and giving communities a chance to shine.  Nobody can argue against the idea that the better the educators in schools, the better children will perform.  Some involved in education will disagree with me, but it is not about class size.  Rather, it is about teaching and the capacity of teachers to educate and deliver.  Teachers are not born.  They are made, trained and get involved in their communities.  We need and must have that.  We need to put even more resources into training primary school teachers, in particular.  We also need to put more resources into preschools and support all communities.<\/p> <p> I again affirm the importance of what the Government is doing in this recession.  I acknowledge the disaster the recession was for all of us, in particular for poor families.  We must never forget their needs and the lives they have to face.  We must never forget the children who go to school without breakfast in their stomachs and who go home to houses where nobody gives them a welcome smile at the door.  These are the areas in which we have to intervene.  Unfortunately, these are the communities that become involved in the abuse of alcohol and drugs.  The issue is broader than that, but we need to focus in particular on those communities.<\/p> <p> I refer to the policy of Tusla in regard to child care and the role and importance of regulating the care of children in care, in particular in the private sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600070#MMMM00200","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467832800,"counter":575,"content":"<p>T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm cur isteach orth ach an bhfuil t&uacute; chun an t-am ar fad a &uacute;s&aacute;id t&uacute; f&eacute;in-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600071#NNNN00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1467832800,"counter":576,"content":"<p>Sea.  &Uacute;s&aacute;idfidh m&eacute; &eacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600071#NNNN00300","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1467832800,"counter":577,"content":"<p>-----n&oacute; an bhfuil t&uacute; chun cuid de a roinnt le do chomhghleacaithe?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600071#NNNN00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1467832800,"counter":578,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Fitzpatrick want some time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600071#NNNN00500","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1467832800,"counter":579,"content":"<p>No, I need five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600071#NNNN00600","speaker":"1331"},{"type":"speech","time":1467832800,"counter":580,"content":"<p>Okay, I will finish shortly.

Bh&iacute; tuairisc&iacute; le d&eacute;ana&iacute; faoi contaetha L&uacute; agus na M&iacute;, the Louth-Meath report from Tusla in 2015, which was appalling and dealt with child care and child welfare in those counties.  It identified very significant problems with child welfare and child care.  Subsequent to that, and due to the intervention of Tusla and the greater involvement of the HSE and other child care providers in County Louth, there has been a significant change and things are improving.  I continue to be concerned about the value for money we are getting from some private service providers which provide child care facilities in remote rural areas to children who have been placed in care, often by the courts.  Some have no footpaths or places for recreation.  The children may not be from the community and are being watched 24 hours a day.  These issues lead to some of the problems of which Deputy Fitzpatrick and I are aware.<\/p>  <p>  We need to re-examine the type of interventions available for children in care or who are in trouble with the courts.  Not all interventions are successful or welcome.  Private service providers offer their facilities to Tusla.  In doing so, they decide where the places are and many other things.  They are extremely well paid.  The State pays, on average, about &euro;250,000 a year for each child that is in care.  It is a major resource and I welcome the money that is spent, but I am not satisfied that it is properly spent in every case.  I have given my colleague an extra two minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600071#NNNN00900","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1467832800,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The amendment to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 is very important and one with which I fully agree.  The amendment has a number of primary aims, including preventing the misuse of certain dangerous or harmful drugs and helping law enforcement authorities deal more effectively with trade in certain substances.  The misuse of drugs, in particular prescription drugs, is a major issue in society today.  In large urban centres such as Dundalk and Drogheda, the problem is becoming more evident.  I am of the opinion that the misuse of drugs legislation is an important element in the Government's fight against drug dealing and trafficking and the gangland crimes that occur.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the issues raised in regard to tackling drug crimes include the fact that drug dealers carry small quantities of drugs when on the streets, which can make it more difficult for garda&iacute; to charge a person with the sale or supply of drugs.  This Bill will enable the possession of controlled medicines to be made an offence for those in possession of drugs illegally but will not affect either those who have a prescription for drugs or health care professionals.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to controlling a number of prescription drugs, the Bill will also control a number of substances which the European Union has identified as being harmful and open to abuse.  I am glad that the Bill includes the drug N-bomb which, as we know, was responsible for a tragic incident in Cork last year where one person died and five others required hospital attention.<\/p>  <p>  Drug related deaths are also a cause of concern for me.  In 2012`, there were 189 reported deaths related to drugs, and this figure rose to 219 in 2014.  I am deeply concerned about the rise in drug related deaths and we need to do more in this regard.  Proper education at a young age on the effects of drugs is vital if we are to combat this problem.  We need to be more proactive in educating the younger generation on the effects of taking illegal drugs.  Drug-taking not only affects the user but also his or her family and friends.<\/p>  <p>  It is the families and friends of drug users who have to pick up the pieces and get the person back on the straight and narrow.  A major cause of concern for parents of teenagers in Dundalk was the fact that drug dealers were targeting students outside local secondary schools.<\/p><p>I received many calls from concerned parents about the practice.  They told me there were young men outside schools, who had no attachment to the schools, who were attempting to sell drugs to the students as they left the school.  That is a particularly nasty practice which targeted vulnerable young teenagers.  Great credit must go to Sergeant Eugene Collins from the Dundalk community policing unit who targeted the activity.  With the increased resources given in the last year to the Garda in Dundalk, garda&iacute; were able actively to patrol the areas around the schools at certain times of the day.  Initially, they targeted two schools in the town which resulted in an immediate decrease in the activity of the drug dealers.  I thank Eugene Collins and his team in Dundalk for taking the initiative in that way to take on the drug dealers proactively.  It was a great relief to parents and the schools to see the initiative being undertaken.<\/p> <p> I firmly believe that we must educate the younger generation on the effects of drug taking.  I suggest the process must start in primary school.  We must make children aware that drugs are simply not cool.  They must be educated on the dangers of drugs.  They must realise the serious harm and long-lasting effects of drug taking.  We must help those who are responsible for educating young children by providing increased resources to warn about the dangers of drug taking.<\/p> <p> I welcome the fact the Minister recently announced a new action-based national drugs strategy which will be published later this year.  I urge him to include an education programme as part of the strategy, aimed at primary schoolchildren and students in secondary schools, to outline the danger of drug taking.<\/p> <p> I welcome the Bill.  Its primary aims will prevent the misuse of certain dangerous or harmful drugs and also assist the Garda to deal more effectively with drug dealers.  In conjunction with that, I urge the Minister to work closely with his ministerial colleagues in other Departments, especially the Department of Education and Skills, to develop a programme to outline the grave dangers of the use of drugs.  I passionately believe that if we can convince the younger generation of the real dangers of drugs in society then we will go a long way towards reducing the number of people, particularly young people, who misuse drugs.

Drug misuse is a societal issue.  I passionately believe there are communities around the country that are affected by drugs, not just in the larger urban centres.  We, as a society, have been ignoring their plight, collectively and individually for a long time.  Some politicians more than others play on people's fears rather than focus on providing solutions to the problem.  They constantly do people down, play the big bad wolf or encourage the State to act as Big Brother looking down on people without engaging with them.<\/p>  <p>  In the past 60 years or so major housing developments were provided in Limerick and parts of Dublin where crime has continued to flourish.  The in-depth media reports on such areas go into the background and analyse generational poverty and drug use.  They show how such people are outside of societal norms.  They drop out of school early and fall prey to a raft of issues.  The major housing developments of that time were built without the proper infrastructure to make sure a normal society could develop.  The State has paid an enormous price for the policies of developing major urban centres such as Moyross in Limerick and in some parts of Dublin, and we continue to pay the price.  Hardly a month goes by without a shooting incident in parts of this country, which are all drug related.  Significant amounts of money can be got from drugs and major issues arise in terms of how the drug problem is being addressed.<\/p>  <p>  We have called for the Bill that is before us to come to the House for some time because of the devastation caused to families and communities.  Significant amounts of money from various State agencies are put into resource centres and trying to deal with the issues.  More resources are required, especially given the cutbacks that ensued during the years of austerity in recent times, but we must examine where the money is going.  I believe between 15% and 20% of society is not engaged.  I include the very youngest to the oldest people in that cohort.  They are not engaged in remaining in school.  They are not engaged in second level education or any aspect of the State or society.  That is having a disastrous consequence on young people.<\/p>  <p>  Reference has been made to the abject poverty that exists in other countries, but we have abject poverty in our communities.  Young children are being brought up in a climate of fear.  We hear various stories in that regard.  We must consider how people are being treated by society and what policies are needed.  Such communities formed 3% to 4% of society 25 years ago but they have now grown to 15% and their number is increasing.  Major social policy initiatives were taken by various Governments of all hues since Independence.  I refer to housing and free education, among others.  We must examine the development of policies to deal with the misuse of drugs but we must also focus on those areas where drug usage is highest and where people's health is a lot poorer than the average.

It is extremely important that we all act together in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of the front-line staff who must deal with desperate drug situations.  That is something on which we probably do not reflect enough.
