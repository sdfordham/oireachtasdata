It is a great honour to be elected to this House at any time.  It is a great honour to serve in the House and it has been a great honour to serve for many years, as you know, a Cheann Comhairle, along with your good self and many others.  I hope I have learnt some things along the way.  I hope I am still learning.  It is no harm to learn a little bit as one goes along.<\/p>  <p>  We live in very interesting times and we have to adapt, as I have said previously.  We have to be cautious as to how we deal with the situations that arise to a greater extent than we ever did previously.  We also need to encourage the new Members of the House to be able to stand up and speak in the House on their own behalf and on behalf of their constituents, to do so fearlessly and to have the confidence to do it and to know they have a job to do, a role to fill and words to say.<\/p><p> We all need to develop a greater recognition and respect for the words we say always in the House but, more especially, to each other.  The way in which we address each other in the House can be reflected in the way the public regards us and examine our performance.  At a time when politics and public life is challenged, it is important we look at ourselves in this self critical way to try to ensure that what we do does not reflect badly on the House and those we represent, but contributes to the Order of Business in the way the Ceann Comhairle would like us to proceed at all times.<\/p> <p> I do not know what the outcome will be.  I would be greatly honoured to be allowed to fill the role.  I do not know how people will vote.  There is no restriction on anybody voting for me who wishes to vote for me.

I have learned, over time, that one should never become bitter in politics.  It is very important.  It leaves a lasting taste not only in the minds of the people in the House, but in the minds of people outside the House who watch, absorb and take it on board.  We should also try to remember that, whatever we do, we should never take somebody's character, either inside or outside the House.  The pressures of politics are urgent, pressing and constant.  There is always a tendency to use that extra pressure to make a point.  We should avoid making personal points, and I hope I have succeeded in doing so.

Deputy Crowe hails form Rathfarnham, but has lived for many years with his wife, Pamela, in Tallaght, and for many years represented the area as a member of South Dublin County Council.  When the peace process was initiated, Deputy Crowe headed the Sinn F&eacute;in delegation to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in Dublin Castle.<\/p><p>He also represented our party in the multi-party negotiations that led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.  He is very experienced and he made a huge contribution to crafting these events and agreements which are now part of our history.  Deputy Crowe has served as a party spokesperson on foreign affairs for a number of years and has contributed positively to numerous D&aacute;il committees, particularly the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p> Teachta Durkan talked about never taking away anyone's character.

I have no doubt that he will act at all times in an impartial and fair manner to everyone's benefit.

I fully appreciate that the business of the D&aacute;il should be carried out in a dignified manner and, if I am elected, I will do my utmost to fulfil that role, with the co-operation of Deputies, and to work closely with the Ceann Comhairle.  I pledge, if elected, to be fair, understanding, balanced and accessible to all Deputies.  I will take an open-door approach, mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; i nGaeilge.

The situation is truly scandalous and is unacceptable, particularly for children who are waiting far too long to get to see a consultant in the three children's hospitals, especially in Crumlin and in Temple Street.<\/p>  <p>  One can trace it back to the decision of the then Minister, now Senator James Reilly, in 2011 to mothball and destroy the work of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  Prior to that, the average waiting times for elective patients was approximately two and a half months for those waiting for elective treatments.  Senator Reilly changed the system - it is all documented - and it has been all downhill since with dramatic increases in waiting times and in the waiting lists.  For example, we now have 415,000 people waiting for outpatient appointments and 62,000 people waiting longer than one year.  We have in excess of 75,000 people waiting for inpatient treatment in hospitals.  Some 4,500 children are waiting for appointments in the three children's hospitals, 2,000 of whom are waiting for more than a year.  One would think that when it comes to children, we should be moving might and main to eradicate or shorten dramatically those waiting times, particularly in terms of those waiting longer than a year.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government talks about progress and sustaining progress made.  I would suggest that the Taoiseach should take out the language of sustaining progress because no progress has been made over recent years in terms of waiting lists and, in fact, the situation has become dramatically worse.  The waiting lists are now up 45% in two years.  It is a sad indictment of what has been going on over the past two to three years in terms of policy initiative and a lack of basic urgency in dealing with this crisis.  Patients, in particular children, should not have to wait that long to get to see a consultant.<\/p>  <p>  There is a commitment, involving &euro;15 million, to re-establish the treatment purchase fund.  The &euro;15 million will not be enough.  There is a wider commitment of &euro;35 million, or &euro;50 million overall, in terms of waiting lists.  Will the Taoiseach outline to the House the plans to reconstruct and re-establish the treatment purchase fund back to the model that was in existence before Senator James Reilly mothballed it in order that it would be effective and have the capacity to deliver the results?<\/p><p>Does the Taoiseach accept these waiting times are absolutely unacceptable for the patients concerned?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600008#Z00400","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I accept that any waiting list is never satisfactory because the patient must wait.  As Deputy Martin pointed out, the programme for Government emphasises the need for a sustained commitment to improve waiting lists for patients, with a particular focus on those who have had to wait longest.  The Department of Health will engage with the National Treatment Purchase Fund to deliver on that &euro;15 million funding for an initiative targeted at those waiting the longest, with the continuing investment of &euro;50 million per year to deal with waiting lists.  I understand the Department is currently engaged with the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the Health Service Executive, HSE, is planning a dedicated waiting list initiative to be rolled out later this year.<\/p>  <p>  The issue for patients is how long they must wait.  Improving waiting times for scheduled or planned care for patients is absolutely key.  The action taken by the previous Minister resulted in improvements.  In 2015, some &euro;51 million in additional funding was provided to address maximum waiting times of 18 months by 30 June and 15 months by year-end for inpatient, day and outpatient cases.  The end of 2015 demonstrated a 95% achievement for inpatient and day case waiting lists and a 93% improvement for outpatient waiting lists against the 15 months maximum wait times.  This year, the HSE service plan undertakes to maintain the 2015 levels of service in respect of scheduled care.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, the HSE's scheduled care governance group is focusing on a number of key areas, including ensuring that the chronological scheduling of cases is adhered to, putting in place validation procedures to ensure patients are available for treatment when they are deemed to be for treatment and relocating high-volume low-complexity surgeries to smaller hospitals.  Many consultants have said to me they could do more work if some procedures of lower complexity were shifted to smaller hospitals.  The group is also focusing on designating an improvement lead for each hospital group to provide support in meeting the national targets both for appointments and treatments.<\/p>  <p>  There is an extra &euro;800 million in the health system because the state of the economy has improved and that, in turn, will lead to improvements in a number of sectors.  That money was not available before to deal with these very necessary cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600009#AA00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>That is not actually the case; the former Minister, Senator James Reilly, changed the policy.  He got rid of the treatment purchase fund, which was a singular, dedicated and focused approach to dealing with waiting times.  He blew it and got it terribly wrong.  Another Minister, Deputy Varadkar, came after him and demonstrated no urgency at all on this.  There are 5,000 patients waiting in Beaumont, meaning the numbers are up 57% on January this year.  The Government must have a real check on reality and not quote the kind of figures I mentioned.  The former Minister, Senator James Reilly, created a new target of 12 months - plucked from thin air - and up to then the target was six months for adults and three months for children.  The former Minister, Deputy Varadkar, put it at 15 months.  The Government could then judge against new targets that it created.<\/p>  <p>  This is an urgent issue for the number of people who are waiting for procedures.  In Crumlin's children's hospital, 2,000 children have been waiting for more than a year for an outpatient appointment.  That is not good enough.  We should immediately tackle that with a sense of urgency followed by real money now and not later in the year.  We must get to the bottom of it.

It has obliged him at every turn, or every U-turn, because the Fianna F&aacute;il Party has done a U-turn on every issue, from saying it would not support Fine Gael in government to water charges, bin charges, NAMA, the national monument on Moore Street, rent certainty and, just last night, banded hours contracts.  None of this is in the common good.  None of it is in the national interest.  It is motivated by the Fianna F&aacute;il leadership's desire to keep Fine Gael in government until it decides to pull the plug at the point most advantageous to itself and its ambition to form a government.  There is no other reason for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party's behaviour.  It is all about political power.  It is not about new politics.  It is nothing but the same old story.<\/p>  <p>  The commission on water charges is clearly only a committee to provide the Government and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party with a fig leaf on water charges as part of this partnership Government.  Joe O'Toole put it well when he said: \"People voted a certain way, Leinster House is not prepared that particular nettle, so we have to find a solution that will have enough sugar on it to make the medicine go down easily.\"  However, Leinster House has not been allowed to deal with this issue.  The public has rejected water charges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600010#BB00200","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797700,"counter":32,"content":"<p>It is Leinster House now, is it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600010#BB00300","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1467797700,"counter":33,"content":"<p>They should be scrapped and dealt with here in the D&aacute;il, democratically and decisively.

This will entail a 26-year contract with private providers, at the end of which the networks will be privately owned.  The reasons publicly given for the decision were that this would be cheaper than direct State funding and would be off balance sheet so as to free up capital spending elsewhere.  We have poor broadband in this country, particularly in rural areas, because of the decision by Fianna F&aacute;il to privatise Eircom in the biggest economic mistake this country made until Fianna F&aacute;il's even more disastrous mistake in giving the blanket bank guarantee in 2008.  This Government is about to repeat that mistake.  Just as the State was ultimately required to buy back the West Link toll bridge for &euro;600 million, ensuring that the private company, National Toll Roads, received a staggering &euro;1.15 billion return on its investment of &euro;35 million to build the bridge, as estimated by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, we will ultimately have to reacquire the broadband infrastructure in exactly the same way.<\/p><p>Fine Gael agreed with the Labour Party that vital infrastructure networks, such as the electricity and gas distribution networks, should be kept in public ownership.  We came to that agreement over the past five years, albeit after a battle, but now that understanding of the importance of the distribution systems for a vital resource seems to be gone.<\/p> <p> As the Taoiseach knows, the previous Government had two options when we decided this last December.  One was the model he decided on yesterday, the so-called gap funding model, or a full concession model whereby the asset, after the 25 years, came back into public ownership.  Will the Taoiseach accept that yesterday's decision is short termism and not in the public interest?  Will he agree that all relevant documentation and all the advice given to Government on this matter should be laid before this House in order that we can make a collective determination before this matter is finalised?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600011#CC01100","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467798600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>We do not intend to repeat what happened with Eircom.

What is involved is extending broadband for the last mile to many businesses and houses in areas throughout the country that are deemed not to be commercially viable.  It is an extension of the existing system.  It is not a national publicly owned entity like the Eircom network.  That is the first point.<\/p>  <p>  The second point is that a choice has to be made.  If we leave a situation where the State takes over the assets after 25 years, there is no incentive on whatever company or companies that own that system, from the tenth or 15th year onwards, to upgrade it, keep it in good shape and have it ready for handing over to the State.  Why would they?<\/p>  <p>  The intention is to be able to provide more than 750,000 individual premises with high quality, high speed broadband.

That is a choice that has to be made, and the Government made its choice clearly, but I repeat that this is not a national publicly owned entity.  This is an extension of privately owned facilities, and for that reason, the Government came down on the side of the gap funding model proposed by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources which will result, by independent regulation, in premises and businesses having access to that during and after the 25-year period but also to allow for the saving of serious sums of money that can be spent on other facilities people need throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600012#DD00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1467798600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Nobody would dispute for a second the essential nature of rolling out broadband.

I wish it was not a true story but it is.  Two sisters were both pregnant and happily looking forward to the birth of their children.  Tragically, towards the end of the first sister's uneventful pregnancy, the baby died in the womb.  She was medically assisted in delivering him, the family buried him and mourned him.  The second sister received a diagnosis that the foetus she was carrying had a condition of fatal foetal abnormality incompatible with life.  She wrote to me in the days that followed:<\/p><blockquote>I do not want to terminate my baby&rsquo;s life but he does not have one.  A heartbeat does not equate to an independent life for my boy, it only confirms a short few hours of pain for him and a lifetime of it for us.  I have watched what my sister went through, the amount of support she was offered and the support she will require over the coming months.  I feel so angry that this support is not available to me.  I have also watched my parents anguish, particularly my mother&rsquo;s, as they take note of all this and know that their other daughter has this ahead of her without that much needed support, hundreds of miles away from family and friends.  The dignity shown to the tiny corpse of my nephew in the hospital, in the mortuary and on his first and final journey home will not be extended to my son as he will have to be locked in the boot of the car on a ferry journey back across the Irish Sea or his ashes delivered by a courier weeks later, along with Amazon and eBay purchases.<\/blockquote><p>This is the Taoiseach's Ireland.  These events happened in the weeks after he last voted down our fatal foetal abnormalities Bill.  In anybody's book it is cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.  The Government has appeared in front of international human rights bodies on four occasions since and has been instructed to deal with these matters but the Taoiseach has done nothing.  In the case taken by Amanda Mellet, UN human rights experts stated that not only did Ireland violate her human rights, but the lack of action aggravated her suffering.  The Taoiseach comes to the House and speaks about a citizens' assembly reporting to an Oireachtas committee, which means that it will be at least 2018 before any proposals will be before the people to remedy this, condemning hundreds of others to the torture which was experienced by Amanda Mellet.

I get similar communications from women all over the country.  This is our Ireland.  It is an Ireland that is subject to a constitution, which is voted on by the people.  In the 1980s that vote was taken by the people and the interpretation of its meaning was made by the Supreme Court.  This impacts on people&rsquo;s lives.  I want to try to change that and in order to do that I have to build consensus, understanding and information for people who will have to vote if that be so to change the Constitution one way or the other.<\/p>  <p>  It is not a case of me as a citizen standing here, blocking anything.  We have put into the programme for Government a process which can be gone through rationally and in a common sense way, taking into account the changing attitudes and the sensitivities of so many people.  The Deputy may not appreciate that.  I understand her point of view.  She has been very forthright about it.  She has stated her views here very cogently on many occasions.  Unfortunately for her, she cannot change the Constitution unless she has the opportunity to cast her vote along with the citizens.  For that reason the process I have set out is one that will return here to the legislators elected by the people to cast their vote in a free way, according to their consciences.  If that recommendation is for a referendum to deal with the eighth amendment in whatever form then so be it, that vote will take place and that is the only way it can be changed.  While the Attorney General, as I told Deputy Howlin yesterday, is the only legal adviser to the Government under the Constitution, I accept that.  It is of course the Supreme Court at the end of the day which interprets what the Constitution means.  I have included as a central part of the programme for Government the citizens' assembly and a reflection in the first instance on the eighth amendment, taking into account many of the stories the Deputy has outlined and reference back to the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  While Deputy Daly has been forthright here, according to the medical assessments of what is contained in Deputy Wallace&rsquo;s Bill it will not be touched by any medic in the country.  This Bill is not good for women: it is bad for women.  It is inadequate and that means that it does not answer the question the good lady asked in her letter to the Deputy.  I have set out a process by which collectively we can reflect on this and eventually the people might be asked to make a decision.  That is the only way the Deputy&rsquo;s Constitution can be amended or changed.  I do share Deputy Daly&rsquo;s view that the services surrounding these events and instances should be improved.  We want to make arrangements that it be so.  The central issue is that if a child is born for whatever short length of time Article 40.3.3o kicks in and that is the challenge.  That is what needs to be talked about and understood.  That is why those at the top of the medical profession say that while Deputy Wallace might have the principle right in the Bill, the substance and the way it is phrased are grossly and wholly inadequate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600014#FF00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1467799500,"counter":89,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach does not stand here as a private citizen but as the leader of a country that has been found to violate the human rights of women.  When we did try to put to the House the proposal that there would be a repeal of the amendment to the Constitution to provide for abortion in this and other circumstances, the Taoiseach and his Government stood in its way.  He has used his position to block progress on this.  The arrogance of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, and several of his colleagues, who would presume to anticipate how the courts would deal with this matter, is absolutely breathtaking.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s use of the Attorney General as a block is in and of itself unconstitutional in my opinion.  The Government proposes laws, the D&aacute;il passes laws and the courts interpret laws.  Why can the Taoiseach not allow the courts of our country adjudicate on this?  We have not seen the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice but from the titbits we get, and the Taoiseach seems to have reiterated it, her advice seems to rest on the mistaken premise that Article 40.3.3o deals only with cases where there is a risk to the life of the mother.<\/p><p>That is not true.

My Bill centres on reducing the period before which one can apply for a divorce from four years out of the preceding five, to two years out of the preceding three.<\/p><p>Last month marked the 20th anniversary of the Family Law (Divorce) Act being signed into law.  We need to re-examine this law.  I believe in marriage and the constitutional protection given to it, but I do not believe in causing people unnecessary emotional and financial distress.<\/p><p>The four-year gap between separation and divorce has unfortunately proven to be cumbersome and draconian.  Protracted matrimonial litigation has dire consequences on the family unit as a whole, especially on children.  We have a duty to treat separated couples more humanely, less judgmentally and with compassion.  As a family lawyer for two decades and as a mediator, I have witnessed how the 1996 Family Law (Divorce) Act functions.  I have witnessed at first hand the consequences of couples waiting four years to issue divorce proceedings, even when those proceedings are uncontested.<\/p><p>Marital breakdown is a tortuous, complex and all-encompassing process.  The purpose of the Bill is to strike a balance between affording marriage the protection it deserves and showing fairness to separating couples.<\/p> <p> Currently, a separating couple is required to wait four years before they can issue divorce proceedings.  The Bill proposes a reduction in this timeframe to two years.  If the Bill is passed, a referendum on the proposed two-year rule will be required.  I believe that two years is sufficient time for a couple to come to terms with the fact that their marriage is over.  It gives the couple time to go through the five stages of grief that Elisabeth K&uuml;bler-Ross delineated, including denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.  It allows them sufficient time to adjust, to seek personal counselling and-or family therapy, to obtain independent legal advice and to inform themselves of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation.<\/p> <p> This Bill, if passed, will give people options.  They will be able to bypass the legal separation process and obtain a divorce after two years living separate and apart or obtain a legal separation by deed or a judicial separation and never seek a divorce.<\/p> <p> I have spent a long time reflecting on the needs of separating couples.  I believe this Bill is reasonable and fair.  Marriages break down, unfortunately, for all sorts of reasons.  We should no longer make finalising the break-up period too long, expensive and emotionally distressing.  In my experience, people have a greater sense of stability and certainty post-divorce when they are no longer embroiled in high conflict litigation and they have clarity and finality.  This is particularly true for the children of these marriages.  <\/p> <p> I believe this Bill represents an Ireland that is more compassionate and inclusive than the Ireland for which the four-year rule was written over two decades ago.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600018#KK01100","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467802500,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600019#LL00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1467802500,"counter":158,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600019#LL00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1467802500,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Cuireadh agus aonta&iacute;odh an cheist.\r\n\r\nQuestion put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1467802500,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600019#LL00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1467802500,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Tairgim: &quot;Go dt&oacute;gfar an Bille in am Comhalta&iacute; Pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideacha.&quot;<\/p><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600019#LL00600","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1467802500,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Cuireadh agus aonta&iacute;odh an cheist.\r\n\r\nQuestion put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions","time":1467802500,"counter":163,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600019#LL00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","time":1467802500,"counter":164,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600019#LL00900"},{"type":"question","time":1467802500,"counter":165,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[18143\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600019#LL01000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"to report on his recent contacts with the Government of the United States of America; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1330","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1467802500,"counter":166,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[18070\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600019#LL01100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"to report on his meeting with the Vice President of the United States of America, Mr. Joe Biden; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1281","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1467802500,"counter":167,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[19090\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600019#LL01200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the discussions he had with the American Vice President, Mr. Joe Biden, during his visit here in relation to progressing the proposed Cork to Boston Norwegian flight route.

I have also already reported to the House on my visit to Washington in May for events to commemorate the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising.<\/p>  <p>  On Tuesday, 21 June, I met with US Vice President Joe Biden in Government Buildings.

We had a cordial and productive discussion on a range of issues of mutual interest to our two nations, including the strong bilateral economic and trade relationship between Ireland and the United States.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, I recalled that I had raised the issue of the licensing of Norwegian Air International with President Obama and Vice President Biden when we met in March.  I welcomed the subsequent progress that the US authorities have made with their tentative decision on 15 April to grant a foreign air carrier permit to Norwegian Air International.  I emphasised to the vice president that we look forward to this decision being confirmed as soon as possible so that Norwegian Air International can launch new services between the US and Ireland, including a route from Cork.  The Vice President expressed his hope that the issue could be resolved as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Vice President and I also discussed a range of international and European matters, including the British referendum on EU membership, which was due later that week, and the Northern Ireland peace process.  We also discussed the issue of US immigration reform.<\/p>  <p>  The Vice President commended the Irish Government on its ongoing advocacy for immigration reform and expressed his dissatisfaction with the lack of progress on the issue in the United States.  Deputies will be aware of the latest disappointing development where the US Supreme Court is evenly split on President Obama's executive action, so the lower court decision blocking President Obama's executive action remains in place.<\/p>  <p>  During our meeting, we spoke about the recent mass shooting in Orlando.  I had previously written to President Obama to convey the condolences of the Government and the Irish people following this atrocity and I took the opportunity to express our condolences in person to the Vice President.<\/p>  <p>  Our meeting concluded with us looking forward to the remainder of the Vice President's visit, which included a meeting the following morning with President Higgins.  Reflecting the Vice President's interest in exploring his Irish heritage, the programme included events in counties Mayo and Louth as well as in Dublin.  The Vice President was also accompanied by a number of close family members.  Before his departure for Washington on Sunday, 26 June, I hosted a lunch at Farmleigh House for the Vice President and his family, which was also attended by Government Ministers, the Ceann Comhairle, representatives of the main Opposition parties, business representatives, the State agencies and Irish American interests.<\/p>  <p>  The Vice President's visit was a great success and, I believe, has contributed to further strengthening the deep friendship between Ireland and the United States.<\/p><p>Before his departure for Washington on Sunday 26 June, I hosted a lunch at Farmleigh House for the Vice President and his family, which was also attended by other Government Ministers, the Ceann Comhairle, representatives of the main Opposition parties, business representatives, the State Agencies and Irish-American interests.

Like the Taoiseach and others here, I have met many who have travelled back home to their ancestral home place.  It is always emotional and that was very obvious in the way Joe Biden and his family were met, not least in the Taoiseach's county of Mayo.  Along with Deputy Munster, I attended the event in Carlingford in County Louth and the farewell luncheon in Farmleigh House.  I thank the Taoiseach for the invitation to that event.  Vice President Biden was entirely at home in the beautiful Cooley Peninsula, particularly in the lovely village of Carlingford looking out across the lough towards the Mourne Mountains with Slieve Foy at our back.<\/p>  <p>  I am also pleased that the Taoiseach had the opportunity to discuss immigration reform.  Vice President Biden is a long-standing supporter of the peace process, so it was good that the Taoiseach was able to talk to him about that as well.  I know that Vice President Biden is very conscious of the difficulties faced by the 50,000 undocumented Irish citizens in the US.  <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach alluded to talking about other international issues.  He may know that, unusually, the US Administration has strongly criticised Israeli plans to illegally build hundreds of new homes in existing Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem.  The US State Department has described this as the latest step in a systematic process of land seizures and the UN Secretary General has said that he is deeply disappointed.  Half a million Israeli settlers have been living in more than 100 illegal settlements since the 1967 occupation.  Did the Taoiseach raise this issue with Vice President Biden?  Clearly, it is a good thing that the US Government is criticising this action.  I think our Government can give a lead.  The Taoiseach knows about the programme for Government commitment to recognise the state of Palestine and that in 2014, the Oireachtas voted in support of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.

What interests those who are trying to promote the region as a tourist destination is the footfall that would result from this connectivity.

I asked the Taoiseach whether he would be willing to go back to President Obama, because I understand that the US authorities will sit on this until after the election, so it will be towards the end of the year before they make any decision.  That is a lot of time and a lot of lost opportunities for the southern region.  It is not just a Cork issue.  I think the Taoiseach is aware that it has a knock-on effect on his constituency and the airport in Knock.  Indeed, I think it will have an impact on the entire country and our economy.

It is fair to say that in Cork city and county there is a strong mood for connectivity and flights connecting ourselves with Boston and New York at a later point.  Cork city and county also form an area with a strong tradition when it comes to standing up for and respecting workers' rights.  The issue of workers' rights is in the mix of the debate about these flights.  We have had reports that Norwegian Air is talking about using agency workers who would be sourced from outside the US and the EU, perhaps with cabin crew and pilots taken on from south-east Asia.  There has been talk of wages being paid of $500 a month, and with the race to the bottom, that is something that would concern people.  In this country, the Irish Airline Pilots Association, IALPA, has raised those concerns and in the US they have been raised by various trade unions and members of Vice President Biden's party, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.  I am interested in information and an update on flights and connectivity.  I am also wondering if the Vice President, whose Department of Transportation is looking into this, has any further update or information about the workers' rights issue here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600021#NN00200","speaker":"1281"},{"type":"speech","time":1467803400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I extended an invitation to Vice President Biden to come here quite a number of years ago and I was very glad that during his last year in office he was able to come to Ireland on a semi-formal visit.  I agree with Deputy Adams that he was really pleased to explore the roots of his forefathers in Carlingford and Ballina, County Mayo.  I found Vice President Biden to be really interested in people, his Irishness and his roots.  He was accompanied by his sister, daughter, sister-in-law, grandchildren and other members of his family.  He was making a real effort to have them understand the extent of the connections between Ireland and the United States.  His visit was an outstanding success.<\/p>  <p>  While we did not discuss the question of Israel with him, the acquisition of further lands by Israel for the purpose of building apartments or houses is one I deplore.  It is of great concern to the general, fragile efforts being made to bring about a two-state solution.  This will not help the situation.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is working on the question of Palestine, having moved some way in this direction, and there are still some matters to be considered.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Daly raised the question of Cork Airport and Norwegian Air, as did Deputy Barry.  Deputy Martin has also raised it on many occasions.  When I raised it with President Obama in the White House, while it is not directly within his remit, he was very supportive of the matter being dealt with quickly.  Shortly after that came the approval of a foreign air licence to Norwegian Air International from the secretary for aviation.  That was on the basis of it being compliant with the open skies agreement with the EU.  The matters Deputy Barry raised in respect of the employment of pilots have all been sorted out.<\/p><p>Vice President Biden was well aware of this and gave his support strongly for a quick conclusion.  It should be noted that, were this to be in operation now, Norwegian Air International would do for long-haul flights what Ryanair has done for short-haul flights, which would increase footfall through to the country generally in huge numbers either way across the Atlantic.  As I understand it, it is fully compliant with the European Union open skies policy and is backed by the European Commission.  This is not an administrative hold-up.  There were quite a number of objections from unions in the United States, which feared the employment of pilots from the Far East.  As I understand it, that matter has been resolved.  I hope this can become a reality quite quickly.<\/p> <p> Deputy Daly asked me to confirm that I would go back to speak to President Obama.  We can communicate with him anyway.  We will certainly do that because the Vice President undertook, after I spoke to him in Government Buildings, to speak to President Obama about this.  Obviously, we have given a report of the discussion that we had on that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600021#NN00300","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","time":1467803700,"counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600022#OO00150"},{"type":"question","time":1467803700,"counter":178,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[18144\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600022#OO00200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"to report on the recent meetings of the European Council that he has attended; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1330","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1467803700,"counter":179,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[19355\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600022#OO00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"his contribution at the European Council meeting on 28 June 2016 following the Brexit referendum result; and the response from member states to same.","asker":"1224","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1467803700,"counter":180,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[19375\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600022#OO00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"to report on the European Council meeting; and his agenda for European Council discussions in terms of the Government's strategy for dealing with the vote to exit the European Union by the electorate of the United Kingdom.","asker":"1353","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1467803700,"counter":181,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[19475\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600022#OO00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"to report on the two-day summit he attended in Brussels following the result of the referendum in the United Kingdom.","asker":"1254","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1467803700,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  I attended the European Council on 28 June and the informal meeting of 27 Heads of State and Government on 29 June.  The focus of both meetings was on the outcome of the UK referendum which took place on 23 June.  The European Council also considered, relatively briefly, a number of other issues, including migration, the Single Market, investment, economic and monetary union, taxation, agriculture, Libya, the EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy, EU-NATO co-operation, and the association agreement with Ukraine.  In an exchange on trade, I stressed that the Commission should continue to work towards agreeing the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, deal with the United States.  The British Prime Minister, David Cameron, attended the meeting on Tuesday, where all member states expressed regret at the outcome of the referendum but respect for the democratic decision of the UK electorate.<\/p>  <p>  At the meeting of the 27 leaders, it was agreed that there could be no negotiations until Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union was triggered, and that, while this will not happen immediately, it should take place as soon as possible.  The negotiations are likely to take at least two years and, in the meantime, the UK remains a full member of the Union.<\/p>  <p>  On the separate question of the future relationship between the UK and the EU, the UK side has yet to clarify what it wants.  There will be many complex and technical issues to consider.

The 27 leaders clarified that the European Council would direct the process, but the Commission and the European Parliament will also play important roles.<\/p>  <p>  At the meeting, I spoke about our long history with the UK, including the Northern Ireland peace process and our common entry to the EU in 1973.

Everybody is now well aware of the real risks to the well-being of our people as a result of the Brexit vote.  Yesterday, in his post-Council statement, the Taoiseach acknowledged that too lengthy a gap in the process of negotiation might prolong uncertainty, with negative consequences for businesses and consumer confidence.  Yesterday he spoke of the need for exploratory work to begin with the British Government.  The Taoiseach stated last week that the British Prime Minister wanted early bilateral engagements at senior official level and he went on to state that senior British officials met officials from the Department of the Taoiseach.  Can we get some sense of what issues were discussed, what progress, if any, was made, and when the next meetings will occur?  Could the Taoiseach also clarify the status of these engagements?<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has stated that he wants the Government represented at any EU-British negotiations in order to protect the interests of this State.  What has been the response to that?  Has the Taoiseach put that issue, and how has the EU - and, for that matter, the British Government - responded?  The Taoiseach rehearsed the issues which he quite rightly brought up at the Council meeting.  Can he give us some sense of how his concerns have been responded to?<\/p>  <p>  I will go back, if I may, to this issue of a national forum.  The Taoiseach stated it had merit and that it was a good idea.  Three of the Opposition leaders here have supported the proposition.  Will the Taoiseach meet these three leaders and others, if they want to be there, to discuss how we can advance this idea?  I also would argue strongly for, and welcome, an all-island framework and a whole-of-Government contingency framework as described by the Taoiseach.  That is appropriate because a partitionist approach to the development of strategy and policy in negotiation structures would put at risk, in particular, the gains that have been made for citizens since the Good Friday Agreement was achieved.<\/p>  <p>  I want to raise one specific issue.  There is an ongoing effort to achieve the building of the Narrow Water bridge project.  I recently visited the site with the Northern Minister for Finance.  Brexit strengthens the argument for proceeding with the project with all speed.  It does not weaken the argument.  A report was noted at the North-South ministerial meeting, but this is a project to enhance the tourist and economic potential of the Border region - both sides of the Border.  I ask the Taoiseach if he would be prepared to take an initiative on that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600022#OO00700","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1467803700,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Yesterday, the Taoiseach mentioned, both in his speech and in his reply, that the Council would lead the negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600022#OO00800","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1467803700,"counter":185,"content":"<p>The European Council will oversee the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600022#OO00900","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1467803700,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I put it to the Taoiseach that there is a view abroad that not only should the Council lead the process but it should appoint the negotiators on behalf of the Council to engage with the British Government on negotiating the Brexit situation, both the exiting process and the parallel process of building a new relationship with the United Kingdom.  Ideally, such a relationship would be something along the lines of the European Economic Area, particularly in view of the deal that was done for Norway, because Britain's access to the Single Market would benefit immeasurably the island of Ireland.  Anything short of that will cause difficulties.  These are issues for the incoming British Prime Minister, because they will have to swallow hard in the end of the day if the four pillars are to be observed in facilitating access to the Single Market.  This is important, because there has been some disquiet about the performance of the President of the European Commission, Mr. Juncker, and some of his commentary.<\/p>  <p>  In the immediate aftermath of the result, we needed cool heads.  First, one should always accept the democratic wishes of a people.  Whether one likes it or not and whether one agrees or disagrees, there should be respect for the will of the people as articulated in the ballot box.  That is the starting point in such a situation.  We all have made our contributions in terms of how it all happened, but the key point is that this is the starting point.  The Commission has, to a certain extent, compromised itself even before we start.  There has been a sense of getting even, or \"Let us move on quickly and move them on.\"  That kind of approach is not sane or sensible in the longer term.<\/p>  <p>  Looking at the longer term with regard to European Union coherence, the bottom line is that there needs to be a positive and constructive trading relationship with the United Kingdom.  Over time, that relationship needs to be built on proper values such as human rights.  Governments and democracies change, and therefore one must create a framework that can be adaptable over time to a changing political situation in the United Kingdom, which can certainly happen.<\/p><p> In terms of these negotiations, will the Taoiseach indicate if he has sought for Ireland to be represented on a negotiating team, given our unique and special trading, economic and social relationship with the UK?  We have a case to make that we should be on a negotiating team or have a representative on that team.  We have a unique contribution to make to the all-island dimension.  Europe has been an important backdrop to peace in Northern Ireland, including the PEACE fund and the other various funding mechanisms.  At this stage we should be working on a process that might seek to retain European Union supports for PEACE fund initiatives, reconciliation within the North and North-South engagement, interaction and projects.  We should put that proposition to the European Union, notwithstanding the UK wanting to exit.<\/p> <p> We should also put the proposition that there is a special issue with Northern Ireland.  I do not know how the United Kingdom would react to this but we should push the idea that under the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, the consent of the people in Northern Ireland is explicitly called for in terms of a united Ireland and the future of Northern Ireland.  Now, against the will of a majority of people in Northern Ireland, it will be taken out of the European Union.  There is an issue in terms of the future of Northern Ireland and the island of Ireland that is worth pursuing with the European Union.  It relates to the island economy and its political dispensation, and it is not something that can be glossed over as this issue unfolds.  The more people begin to realise the impact of Brexit - it is becoming more immediate by the day with real and hard impact on the streets and farms - the more people may begin to consider this in a different way, both within the North and across the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p> Is the Taoiseach's team in the Department looking at creating new structures for civil society dialogue, which has been underdeveloped in the North?  The parties were not enthusiastic about the civil society dialogue element of the Good Friday Agreement and it has been allowed to wither.  It never got off the ground.  Even politicians have said to us over the years that it is not something they want to entertain.  They were not too enthusiastic about it, truth be told.  Now, it is to be regretted, and I urge the Taoiseach to develop mechanisms for a robust civil society dialogue involving trade unions, farmers and business elements, as well as people in general.  We should get a dialogue going both North and South about the Brexit issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600022#OO01000","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467804300,"counter":188,"content":"<p>In the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, the Taoiseach provided a useful briefing for all leaders in Government Buildings.  Both the verbal and written presentation set out the strategic issues that needed to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  What is less clear to me since is the end game.  What is Ireland's objective, now we have had a chance for reflection?<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach stated yesterday that senior officials from the United Kingdom engaged with senior officials from the Irish Government in recent days.  What exactly was the framework in which that engagement happened?  Did the Irish team specify the desired outcome of the new position and whether the United Kingdom and Ireland could work in common effort to achieve those objectives?<\/p>  <p>  What is the Taoiseach's view on the timing of the invocation of Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty?  As Deputy Martin stated, there are various signals coming from leaders in Europe and those we look to for leadership.  In short, the attitude of European Commission President Juncker is, \"Here's your hat, what's your hurry?\"  The attitude of my socialist colleague, Mr. Martin Schulz, in the European Parliament was not an awful lot better, initially at least.  There was a little more measured response from President Tusk.  We need a specific attitude from Ireland as the strategic issues are so important for this country and the people of this entire island.  We must know what our objective will be and how we will work towards it.  From an Irish perspective, when would be the optimal invocation of Article 50?  This is entirely a matter for the United Kingdom but we should have a view with respect to our interaction with good friends in the United Kingdom as to when Article 50 should be invoked.<\/p>  <p>  As I indicated yesterday, should we in the interim work on a bilateral strategy between Ireland and the UK before we engage in a trilateral way between Ireland, the UK and the European Union to see what is the best common outcome for the people of Britain and Ireland?  I have not got external legal advice on this matter but my reading of Article 50 is that the framework for negotiations will be set by the Council.  It indicates the negotiations will be conducted by the Union and I am not sure what that means.  It has been said it is overseen by the Council but who does the negotiations?  Is that clear yet?  What inputs can we have as of right into those negotiations because our strategic interest is so much greater than virtually everybody else's, aside from the United Kingdom itself?<\/p>  <p>  The interim arrangements were touched on again by Deputy Martin.  The negotiations are ongoing on planning the expenditure of the INTERREG moneys that we negotiated in government.  I negotiated the PEACE IV moneys as there was no great enthusiasm from the British to have a new programme.  During the negotiations for the multi-annual financial framework, Britain wanted to reduce expenditure and did not want to be seen to advocate additional expenditure in any area.  The Taoiseach did much work on this and he knows the British attitude was that while they would not obstruct work on PEACE IV, they would not be overt advocates for it.  What is the state of the projects now?  Deputy Adams would be familiar with many of them.  It was expected they would be funded over the next seven years, but will that now happen?  Is there any interim arrangement or is it all on hold until the Brexit negotiations conclude?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600023#PP00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1467804300,"counter":189,"content":"<p>The 15 minutes allocated for this block of questions has elapsed.

Was there any serious discussion at the European Council about why people took the Brexit decision and how the EU should respond?  It seems there is an increasing mood across Europe against the EU.  There is an article in <i>The Daily Telegraph<\/i>, for example, suggesting a tsunami of referendums that might take place across Europe, as there is potential for 33 referendums to be called by different states.  Not all the people calling for those referendums are right wing and racist - far from it - and in one poll, nearly half of voters in eight big European states wanted to be able to vote on whether they should be a member of the European Union.  In France, for example, there is a major strike ongoing against French and EU austerity, emanating from the EU neoliberal agenda.  A poll indicates 38% of people in France had a favourable attitude to the EU and 62% had a negative attitude.<\/p><p>President Tusk, in writing about Brexit's outcome, indicates that it is clear that too many people in Europe are unhappy with the current state of affairs, on the national or European level, and they &quot;expect us to do better&quot;.<\/p><p>There must be more serious discussion among the ruling elite in Europe as to why the fifth largest economy in the world has taken this decision.<\/p> <p> Was there any discussion about the growing militarisation in Europe?  The image we had of the EU in this Chamber is of a benevolent and progressive institution, but the image many people on the ground have is of an increasingly undemocratic institution, which is racist in the way that it is disgracefully corralled.  The poorest people in the world, who are trying to escape war and poverty, much of the war generated by the EU, and trying to reach freedom, are being penned in in Turkey by the deal the EU has done.  It congratulated itself on that deal, saying it has made its borders secure, by keeping out some of the poorest people in the world.  It is an incredible state of affairs.<\/p> <p> Finally, in respect of events in Britain, does the Taoiseach have a response to the Chilcot report?  The Chilcot report has been released in the last hour and it essentially finds that the British Government of the time, and Tony Blair in particular, chose to join the invasion of Iraq before all other peaceful options had been exhausted.  It is now becoming crystal clear how the British Civil Service and the British Government duped others into believing there was a serious threat, regarding weapons of mass destruction and 45 minutes.  I read an article and the EU summit agreed with that decision.  This was two days after millions of ordinary people across Europe marched against the threat of war.  We had one of the biggest marches in this country on that issue.  Two days after that, the EU met in Brussels and agreed a resolution that expressly approved that war - it approved it as a last resort, but nonetheless it approved it - and condemned Saddam Hussein, etc.  The impression is being given that the EU is a wonderful institution, which is neutral, benevolent, or whatever.<\/p> <p> I made this point yesterday and I wonder if the Taoiseach would agree that actually there have been some very good developments in Britain since the Brexit result.  David Cameron is gone, Boris Johnson is gone, and Nigel Farage is gone.  Within the British Labour Party we have a battle for the leadership of the party, with the Blairite pro-war people who duped everybody and who have blood on their hands trying to oust Jeremy Corbyn.  I am hoping the Taoiseach will send a message of support to Jeremy Corbyn following the Chilcot report for being on the right side of history on that occasion, because I think he should be sent that message.  There will be a battle, but I think the membership will win and there could be a left-wing trend in the British Labour Party.  There will be a general election and possibly a left Labour Party, so it is not all bad, actually.  In terms of ordinary people across Europe, the people who feel the effects of the decisions of the elite and the austerity that is imposed, it could be a beacon for others to follow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600023#PP00600","speaker":"1254","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467804900,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Deputy Adams raised the leaders meeting.

That is an issue.<\/p><p>Deputy Martin mentioned the oversight of this by the European Council.  There are three institutions, as Deputies are aware: the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council.  Obviously the Parliament has grown in importance over the past number of years.  The theory here was that the European Commission has always had the expertise in and the experience of dealing with negotiations from countries that wanted to join the European Union.  Equally, that experience is there in this first instance in which a country wishes to leave the European Union, but there was a very strong feeling around the table that it is the European Council, that is, the elected Heads of State or Government, that should oversee this politically.  It is a matter for the European Council to give a mandate to the Commission in the nature of any negotiations to be conducted.  I would assume - I would make this case very strongly, because we are the country that is most affected by the Brexit decision - that we would be in there at those negotiations as part of the European Council oversight of the work being done by the Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600024#QQ00600","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1467804900,"counter":199,"content":"<p>Does that mean as part of the 27?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600024#QQ00700","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1467804900,"counter":200,"content":"<p>It is not finalised yet, but it is the European Council, that is, the leaders of the different countries, that will oversee the political process here, so we will have to see to it that this is not left just to the Commission, which has the expertise.

From our point of view, it would be very important that, as Ireland is at the apex of the journey towards the UK and the EU, we are central to these negotiations and we will have to put a facility in place for that.<\/p><p>We mentioned the PEACE funds.  We are co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  I like to think that, irrespective of what negotiations take place, the European Union itself is a peace process, which was founded after the Second World War, as Deputies are aware, but it is very important to understand that leaders are well aware of the importance of the peace process and they are well aware of the importance of the moneys put up by Europe for PEACE IV, negotiated by Deputy Howlin, and the<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>INTERREG funds that were put in place during our own EU Presidency.  I would like to think that, because of its importance, we would be able to keep those funds in place.<\/p><p>Deputy Martin mentioned a civil society dialogue.  I think some form of that is necessary.  That is what I had in mind about having conversations, North and South.<\/p><p>As I said, I do not have a mandate to negotiate for Northern Ireland but I have a duty and a responsibility to understand the common challenges that our people face.  If we are to be in a negotiating situation it is important to know this.  <\/p> <p> If and when Britain removes itself from the European Council, whoever the Taoiseach is at the time will be the only representative of the British Isles at the European Council table.  It is important that we understand the many challenges we will face.  We want Britain to have access to the Single Market but in so doing we also want it to accept the four fundamental principles of the European Union and that will be a challenge for whoever is elected as the new Prime Minister.  If they decide that they want to limit immigration and migration it will be very strongly resisted by the European Council, where freedom of movement is a fundamental principle.  We do not know who will be elected but Theresa May or whoever it is will have to set out their stall.<\/p> <p> People asked about the triggering of Article 50.  Nothing can happen until that happens.  I have said that I think it important that the new Prime Minister be elected first, and that will happen by 9 September.  He or she should then have some time to reflect on their strategies, objectives and intentions.  What does Britain want?  Does it want a mechanism like Norway?  Does it want a mechanism like Switzerland, or Canada, or Singapore?  Maybe it wants something new, something British.  From our point of view, the common travel area, the Border, the peace process and access to our trading links are all important so the nearer Britain is to the Single Market, the better for us.

Second, as I made clear publicly over the weekend and in the early part of this week, I am putting equal focus in my Department on the 23 unions that are inside the Lansdowne Road agreement while putting due focus on those three representative bodies who are outside it.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the other points the Deputy put to me, pay issues for public servants are currently determined within the constraints set by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Acts 2009 to 2015, while the industrial relations environment is managed under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2013-2018.  The programme for Government contains a strong commitment to the Lansdowne Road agreement and gives a framework for the next few years for the Government's proposals for ongoing public service reform as well as setting out an agreed pathway to pay restoration for public servants that is affordable to taxpayers, at a cost of &euro;844 million over three years.<\/p>  <p>  As I have always said, I believe this agreement offers the best framework for reconciling the wage needs of those who provide our public services with the broader needs of those who depend upon the delivery of public services.<\/p>  <p>  This agreement is now in operation for the vast majority of public servants.  Over 280,000 public servants are inside the Lansdowne Road agreement.  A point I have made, and I made it again to Deputy Cullinane, is that we need to put equal focus on those public servants who are inside the agreement and the 23 unions that voted for it.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has to, and will, respect and keep faith with the decisions of the vast majority of public servants to come within the Lansdowne Road agreement.  The benefits of and the protections afforded by the agreement will therefore apply to those people who are inside the framework.  Those not represented by a body that is inside the agreement will have the relevant provisions of the FEMPI Act apply to them, and will not benefit from the protections and benefits afforded by the agreement, including incremental progression, inclusion of the supervision and substitution allowance in the salary scale of teachers, and the protections negotiated in 2010 regarding compulsory redundancies.<\/p>  <p>  The Government does not want to be in dispute with any group of people working for it.  The recent decisions by the AGSI and the Teachers' Union of Ireland are clear examples of the progress that has been made in bringing more associations within the Lansdowne Road agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The agreement is also flexible enough to allow for the concerns of recent recruits to the public service to be addressed in a negotiated way.  I confirm to the House that in that context, officials of my Department and the Department of Education and Skills agreed yesterday with the INTO and the TUI, both unions inside the agreement, to have engagement later this month to begin to fully scope out the issues involving pay arrangements for newly qualified teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600026#SS01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1467806100,"counter":231,"content":"<p>The Minister said he had no intention of punishing those public sector workers who are outside the terms of the Lansdowne Road agreement, but then went on to set out exactly how he will punish them.

Has the Minister taken legal advice in this regard and, if so, what did it state?  By any measure, the State is no longer in an emergency situation.  For that reason, does the Minister accept that there is a very strong case for accelerating the restoration of public sector pay, particularly for low-paid workers, many of whom still qualify for family income supplement, and pensioners? <\/p>  <p>  I refer to new recruits.  Does the Minister accept the urgency of the situation?  Many young teachers are heading off to places such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi to try to get some money together in order that they can live in Dublin, in particular.  This is a wholly unsatisfactory situation.  Teachers, nurses and garda&iacute; are affected.

The Minister is maintaining that in the new agreement.  The reason the ASTI and others have not signed up to the agreement is that they are not willing any longer to go into the staff room and look young teachers in the eye when some people are earning higher pay and others are not.  The media is very fond of saying that the unions sold out young teachers.  Here is a union taking a stand against selling out young teachers and they are being blackguarded as a result.

I, too, am acutely aware of the flooding that happened throughout the country last winter.  I will cut to the chase.  The total funding available to the Office of Public Works for its overall flood risk management programme in 2016 is &euro;80.746 million.  This amount includes expenditure on capital flood relief works, drainage maintenance activities, the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme, purchase of plant and equipment, hydrometric and hydrological investigation and monitoring, and the general administration costs for operating the entire programme.<\/p><p>Of the total allocation, &euro;52.561 million has been provided in 2016 for expenditure on flood relief capital works. This amount provides for the preparation and design of flood relief schemes, the construction of flood relief works, the payment of compensation costs arising from these works and the carrying out of minor coastal and non-coastal works by local authorities with funding provided by the OPW under the minor works scheme.  It also provides for the carrying out of CFRAM studies.  The 2016 allocation includes a deferred surrender or capital carryover of &euro;7 million from the 2015 allocation.<\/p><p>The expenditure to date by the Office of Public Works in 2016 on the flood risk management programme has been &euro;23.223 million.  Good progress is being made on the implementation of all of the main elements of the programme.  In relation to the capital works element of the programme in particular, major schemes in Ennis, Waterford and the River Wad in Dublin will be completed this year.  Works are continuing on the major schemes in Bray, on the River Dodder in Dublin and on the quays in Dublin.  The Deputy will be pleased to know that works have now commenced on the River Clare scheme in Claregalway, contracts have been signed for Skibbereen and Bandon and the contractors are mobilising.  The schemes at Templemore, Foynes and Dunkellin, again in Galway, are expected to commence construction in 2016.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.<\/i><\/p><p>Another 21 schemes will continue to be advanced through design and planning stages.<\/p><p>Smaller-scale flood relief works continue to be funded in 2016 through the OPW's minor works scheme, which puts local authorities in funds to carry out more localised flood mitigation measures.  Expenditure of &euro;2.5 million to &euro;3 million is anticipated on this scheme in 2016.  Approximately 30 projects have been approved for funding to date in 2016, which brings the total number approved since 2009 when the scheme was introduced to 544, with total expenditure of &euro;30 million approximately.<\/p><p>Good progress continues to be made this year also on the implementation of the CFRAM programme.  The programme involves the production of predictive flood mapping for 300 areas of significant flood risk, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans for those areas.<\/p><p>The draft flood mapping is now being finalised, work on the development of preliminary options to address flood risk is under way, leading to the development of integrated flood risk management plans containing specific measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified.  The draft plans are scheduled to be made available for public consultation from mid-2016.  Following the public consultation process, the finalised plans will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost-effective manner.<\/p><p>The Government recently announced increased levels of investment in the area of flood relief as part of the overall capital investment plan 2016-2021 and this investment programme will allow for consideration of measures arising from the flood risk management plans.<\/p><p>Arising out of the particular difficulties experienced last winter by home owners along the Shannon, the Government decided on 5 January 2016 to establish the Shannon flood State agency co-ordination working group to enhance ongoing co-operation across all of the State agencies involved with the River Shannon.  The group has met on three occasions to date and has conducted an audit of the roles and responsibilities of State agency organisations and has published its Shannon flood risk work programme for 2016.  This work programme, which is available on the OPW website, sets out co-ordinated actions and activities for the Shannon catchment.  The group has engaged in a programme of public consultation and has held a series of open days on its work programme.  It is also considering, in co-operation with the Attorney General's office, the development of appropriate guidance that will set out more clearly the rights and responsibilities of non-statutory bodies in relation to watercourses.<\/p><p>An interdepartmental flood policy co-ordination group, established to support the OPW&rsquo;s CFRAM programme, was reconvened in July 2015.  This group is looking at a range of policy issues, including insurance, community resilience, individual property protection, a national flood forecasting and warning service, a review of the planning and development guidelines and, if necessary, voluntary home relocation to ensure that policies that can benefit communities and individuals directly - to be prepared and respond to or live with flood risk - are fully and carefully considered.  The report of the group will be finalised for submission to Government shortly, in conjunction with the completion of the draft flood risk management plans. <\/p><p>I think it is clear from the foregoing that a very considerable amount of work is under way by the OPW to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the problem of flooding and flood risk nationally.  It will take time for all of these measures to have effect, but it is important that the right solutions are found and put in place that will provide a lasting protection to those communities affected by flooding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600031#XX01200","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1467809100,"counter":363,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's public servants have provided him with a lot of information.

I give the Minister of State a good example.  As he knows, there was severe flooding during that period in south Mayo, from Cong, The Neale and right across towards Claremorris.

In other areas in Mayo and Galway similar minor works applications have been made continuously since 2015 and that is replicated across the country.  However, local authorities could be submitting more of these applications.  Funding is there for works that happened last year and up to &euro;500,000 can be provided if they meet the criteria.<\/p>  <p>  Our major projects are taking far too long to bring through the process so we can get construction on site.

The issue relates to the purchase of a site for a national school in County Cork, Rochestown Educate Together national school.  It is a relatively new school that was set up in 2013.  It is a fabulous school under the leadership of Dr. Alan Sheehan.  Having visited the school on a number of occasions, I can say that there is a palpable sense of enthusiasm within the school.  They are passionate about education, but they are facing serious accommodation difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  Since the school was established three years ago, staff and students have been accommodated in temporary accommodation in the grounds of Douglas Hall soccer club.  They are grateful for that and it has worked reasonably well since then.  However, the reality is that the school is growing rapidly and for the forthcoming school year, 2016-17, it expects to have in the region of 140 pupils attending the school so it will have to split across two campuses, Garryduff in Rochestown and the existing site.  Clearly, that presents practical difficulties for parents and staff but they will get over them.  The prize they are awaiting is confirmation that a site has been purchased for the permanent school building.  <\/p>  <p>  I am hoping the Minister can shed some light on this issue today.  At the end of 2015, the school was included in an announcement by the former Minister as going to construction in 2017.  It is now July 2016 and there is still no confirmation of a site being bought so that deadline is looming large on the horizon.  I hope the Minister can provide some clarity on that issue.  <\/p>  <p>  I know from communicating with NAMA that a site of over 20 acres in the heart of Douglas is being sold by a receiver appointed by NAMA.  I understand that this site is \"sale agreed\" with the Department of Education and Skills possibly with a view to accommodating Rochestown Educate Together national school and the new second level Educate Together school which is due to open in temporary accommodation this September.  The Department will not confirm that and has informed the school that the site is not being purchased with a view to accommodating the school.  I hope the Minister can provide some clarity on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I observed a Topical Issue debate last night where the Minister of State with responsibility for training and skills responded to another Deputy about a school.  The Minister of State said the existing contractual commitments for 2016 now fully account for the funding that was allocated for 2016 under the previous Government and implied that no new commitments would be made in terms of school buildings as in contracts signed.<\/p><p>Will the Minister confirm if that is the case?  Does it also relate to entering into a contractual commitment to buy sites?  Will the Minister confirm if the Department is in a position to do that because the contracts are with the Department for the site in question, which is in the heart of Douglas and which the Department says it is not buying with a view to accommodating this particular school.  It is sale agreed.  The Department is doing work in terms of land surveying and geotesting on that site.  I hope the Minister can provide clarity for the teachers, staff and parents so they can at least see a pathway to the acquisition of a site and the building of a permanent school building.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600034#AAA01800","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467811500,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McGrath for raising the matter.  I share his enthusiasm for the development of this school under Dr. Alan Sheehan.  There is no doubt it is a very popular school.  It opened in 2013 and is in temporary accommodation.  The last Minister for Education and Skills included it in the current six-year construction plan announced in November 2015.  It was designated to go to construction in 2017 but a permanent site is required to accommodate this new school building.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the then Minister for Education and Skills signed a memorandum of understanding between my Department and the County and City Managers Association in 2012.  This memorandum of understanding fosters increased levels of co-operation and formalises the local authorities' part in identifying and securing sites for educational use.  In this context, my Department has been working closely with Cork County Council towards acquiring a permanent site to meet the needs of the new primary school.  A number of potentially suitable sites were identified and were comprehensively technically assessed.  Specific aspects relating to the development of some of the sites under consideration required significant investigation.  In addition, the plans for infrastructure to access the Douglas area were also under review and clarifications about access to some sites have been required.  The Department has examined several options, none of which provided a straightforward solution.  The process has involved considerable discussions with relevant vendors and the local authority on the options considered.  I can confirm that, subsequent to the analysis which has been carried out, a site option has been identified and it is being actively progressed.  Given the commercial sensitivities associated with land acquisitions generally, I am not in a position to comment further at this time.  I assure the Deputy that the acquisition of a suitable site for the school is very active on the programme of site acquisitions.  My officials are aware of the limitations of the current temporary accommodation and every effort is being made to secure a suitable permanent site for the school as expeditiously as possible.  Officials from my Department will be in contact with the relevant school authorities once the site acquisition process has been completed.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy raised a couple of other issues.  On the issue of sites, the budget for school construction to which the Deputy and the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, referred is separate from the budget for site acquisitions.  The fact that the projects fully absorb our capacity for 2016 does not impinge on our capacity to conclude site deals.  I am not in a position to enter into commentary on any specific site.  For good, historical reasons there is a commercial sensitivity and until a deal is finalised it is not helpful to speculate on any individual site.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600035#BBB00200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1467811500,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

Hopefully, if I am joining the dots correctly, the site in question is the one currently at contract stage with the Department of Education and Skills though I understand the Minister is not in a position to confirm that.  I welcome the fact the Department is in a position generally to enter into contractual commitments to purchase land with a view to accommodating schools and that the exhaustion of public funds in terms of commitments for school building does not apply to the acquisition of land.  That is welcome.<\/p>  <p>  There is an urgency about this.  The school is moving to a split campus situation for the forthcoming school year, 2016-2017.  There will be sufficient capacity across those two sites for one further school year - the 2017-2018 school year - but that is it then.  At that point it will be in serious trouble.  It is taking in two junior infant classes every year and there is growing demand for places at the school.  It is in an area of very large population growth.  There are a lot of young families in the Rochestown-Douglas area and there is a demand for this school.  I ask the Minister to take a personal interest in this case to ensure the file does not gather dust, that the site is actually purchased and the next steps are then taken to move this through the process because when it comes to preliminary design, planning applications, tendering and so forth, to have this school going to construction next year is a challenge.  I hope it can be co-located with the second level Educate Together school for the south suburbs area of Cork city which is opening in temporary accommodation at Nagle Community College this coming September.

It employs almost 16,000 people directly.  The number of passengers using the airport reached 25 million in 2015 and in the first five months of 2016 these numbers increased by 14% in a year-on-year comparison.  Mr. Kevin Toland, the CEO of DAA, whom I met at his briefing last week, stated that the development of the new north runway will support around 1,200 extra jobs and ultimately create another 30,000 jobs.  While this further growth and economic impact of Dublin airport is strongly welcomed it is imperative we do not lose sight of the responsibilities of the Dublin Airport Authority to the residents and locality surrounding the airport which is impacted by noise pollution and pollution to the environment.  Over the years I have made representations to the DAA on very early take off and high noise levels over Clonshaugh, Coolock and Artane, generally when the wind is coming from the east.  Recently I made a number of representations to the chief executive, Kevin Toland, and his staff on behalf of residents from the Offington area, the Howth peninsula and Sutton due to their complaints about take offs from 4.55 a.m.  In the late 1980s the 10R-28L runway was built without any planning conditions, no environmental impact study or night flight restrictions.  At the time the St. Margaret's community council battled against Aer Rianta for appropriate insulation against noise pollution for the homes affected.  The insulation scheme which was implemented at the time is apparently the one now being offered to those affected by the north runway without any review of whether it is still an appropriate level of insulation.  Will the Minister confirm this?  What research has the DAA carried out to show it is a proper level of insulation?  The new north runway is not expected to have night flights though the DAA is saying it will fight that planning condition, meaning that the old 10R-28L runway will have night flights.  Residents affected, who I represent, recognise the importance of the growth of the airport, particularly in the light of Brexit.  They are simply asking to be treated fairly, with great consideration and the same treatment as those affected by the new north runway, given that the international legislative environment was very different 25 years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600035#BBB00600","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1467811500,"counter":422,"content":"<p>There are two issues here, both connected.  The first is the old runway at Dublin Airport.  Residents within the contours of the old runway are concerned that increased flights, emissions and traffic will compound the problems they already experience.  As Deputy Broughan said, they feel hard done by that the original runway was not subject to the same planning conditions or environmental impact study requirements.<\/p><p>They are worried that the mitigation measures that will be available to those coming within the contours of the new runway may be superior to the protection that they get or do not get, as the case may be.<\/p> <p> There is a second issue which is of critical importance, and that is the new runway itself.  We must register that this application is being made now almost ten years after the permission was given in a completely different type of world that we live in.  Even then, with lesser criteria on noise and environmental protection than we have now, the condition applied was that the DAA should not loosen up on its restrictions on night flights.  Anybody who went to the briefing last week will be aware that the DAA is explicit in its intention to break that condition that was applied years ago when conditions were less stringent than they are now and that is completely unacceptable to the local communities in the area.<\/p> <p> There is a significant issue that the current proposal is to insulate homes that would experience noise levels of 63 dB or above, but night noise levels of 40 dB to 55 dB are known to have adverse health effects according to the World Health Organization, WHO.  It is a little annoying that the WHO changed its recommendation on night noise maximums in 2009, two years after the planning permission was granted at a level of 63 dB.  We cannot have that.  With the current knowledge, we cannot ignore the health and safety impacts on residents in that community.

I met the DAA last week on the same day as it was making the presentation in Buswells, and I put some of those points to them to take away.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, DAA has a statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop Dublin Airport, including the provision of infrastructure necessary to meet existing and future demand, such as the north runway project.  The DAA was granted planning permission in 2007 for a second parallel runway and the necessary lands have been preserved for such a project since the 1960s.  However, due to the downturn in the economy, the project was not progressed.  Given the significant increase in passenger numbers at Dublin Airport in recent years and the projected traffic growth in future years, it is clear that a second parallel runway is needed.<\/p>  <p>  Against this background, the DAA announced its decision to proceed with the development of the north runway project in April 2016.  The DAA expects construction to commence in early 2017 with the runway operational by 2020.  The planning permission granted for the second parallel runway in 2007 had 31 conditions attached and is valid for ten years.  I should point out that planning matters are the responsibility of the relevant local authority, Fingal County Council in the case of Dublin Airport, or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as appropriate.  Two of the conditions relating to noise operating restrictions are of particular concern to DAA in that they would result, DAA states, in operations across the entire airport being restricted during the night, between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m., to limit noise impacts on the surrounding area.  The constraints are such that flights at the airport in the peak hour between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. would have to be cut back by approximately one third.  Over the last number of months, DAA has been examining the scope of a further environmental impact statement, EIS, for the purpose of seeking a review of the operating restrictions foreseen for Dublin Airport under the existing planning permission for the north runway.  I understand that a public consultation has now commenced to explain why changes are being sought to the two planning conditions and to provide an opportunity for stakeholders to contribute to the content of and the approach to be adopted in the EIS process.  Regarding the issue of noise, EU Regulation 598\/14 relating to the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions at EU airports entered into force last month.  This regulation sets out the process to be followed when deciding on noise-related operating restrictions and involves consideration of all potential aircraft noise mitigation measures.  The regulation provides for consultation with interested parties, including local residents living in the vicinity of the airport.  The new noise regulation presents an opportunity to establish a modern, cohesive and measured approach to the management of noise at Irish airports which is capable of delivering the best outcome for all stakeholders.  With a view to ensuring the most effective implementation of the new noise regulation in Ireland, my Department is currently working on the detailed technical arrangements to be set down in regulations that I intend to make in this regard as soon as possible.  Finally, I met with senior officials of DAA last week to discuss a number of issues, one of which was the north runway project.  The DAA advised that it is very conscious of balancing the national needs in delivering an essential piece of infrastructure while minimising impacts on local communities.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, DAA briefed me on its engagement with residents on the project and outlined the various strands of work underway on the project, which include the discharging of pre-commencement planning conditions relating to noise mitigation measures, such as the voluntary insulation and house buyout scheme which will be available to residents whose houses are most impacted.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, they spoke about the substantial public consultation and communications programme they have commenced which will continue as the north runway project develops.  I understand that these information sessions will provide relevant and accessible information to stakeholders about the planning permission that has been granted, what will be built, when it will be built, how it will be built and how any issues will be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600036#CCC00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1467812100,"counter":425,"content":"<p>The Minister referred to EU Regulation 598\/14, some new legislation he would be bringing in, detailed technology arrangements etc.  Does the Government intend to introduce a general noise Bill?

That morning glut is all about aircraft going out and come back in time for a second leg.<\/p>  <p>  The profits of airlines are of a lesser concern to the well-being of the local community.  It is unacceptable that those conditions would be breached and that we would not have a cost-benefit analysis on this proposal.  Such an analysis needs to be done holistically.  I hope the Minister takes those points into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600036#CCC00400","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1467812100,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies again for bringing this to my attention.

It is an issue on which I have campaigned for a number of years so I hope we can work together on it.<\/p>  <p>  This issue is addressed to the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and I refer to the crisis in University Hospital Limerick, as over the past seven days the number of people on trolleys has consistently been the highest in the State.  Today there are 30 people on trolleys, yesterday and the day before it there were 40 people on trolleys, while on 1 July there were 30 people on trolleys.  Will the Minister of State relay the following questions to the Minister?  What steps does he intend to take in dealing with the issue?  When does he expect the new accident and emergency department at the hospital to be fully operational?  A press release in August 2015 from Professor Colette Cowan, the chief executive officer of the hospital group, stated that the new facility would be delivered in the first quarter of 2017 rather than the previously revised date of December 2016.  In response to a question at the regional health forum meeting in June 2015, Professor Cowan indicated that capital funding is approved and in place and the group was working towards the completion of an accident and emergency department by the end of 2016.  However, at a briefing by Professor Cowan in May this year that I attended, she stated the expected completion date is now March 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the ongoing crisis and the fact that University Hospital Limerick has the distinction of having the highest number of sick and ill patients on trolleys, when will the new accident and emergency department be in operation?  Will the Minister of State give an assurance today on the floor of the House that the opening will bring an end to the trolley crisis, as people are on trolleys instead of beds in University Hospital Limerick?  I refer specifically to an opening date rather than completion date, as there is a massive difference in the terms.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Minister of State know the additional bed capacity requirements to enable the new accident and emergency department to function without the chronic overcrowding that exists now?  This crisis will only be resolved when more beds are delivered.  We are dealing with people and not just figures, and unfortunately many of them are waiting for hours and, in some cases, days for care.  Many of them are elderly.  We must resolve the crisis as quickly as possible and I ask for urgent action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600037#DDD00200","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1467812700,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I am taking this Topical Issue matter on behalf of the Minister.  I welcome this chance to update the House on the current position on the accident and emergency department at University Hospital Limerick.  Pressure on accident and emergency departments throughout the country has been rising as the population is both growing and ageing.  Accident and emergency department attendances have been significantly higher this year, and the HSE has reported an average increase in accident and emergency department attendances of nearly 6% compared with the same period last year.  The accident and emergency department in University Hospital Limerick is one of the busiest in the country, with more than 60,000 attendances annually.  Of those presenting, the proportion of patients requiring admission has also increased.<\/p>  <p>  I completely accept that delays at accident and emergency departments are upsetting and distressing for patients and families.  It has long been recognised and accepted that the current accident and emergency department at University Hospital Limerick is not fit for purpose.  A new state-of-the-art accident and emergency department, which will triple the size of the current department, is being fitted out and is scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2017.  Once built, the experience of accident and emergency department patients will improve immeasurably in terms of comfort, privacy and dignity.  Pending completion of the new accident and emergency department, the university hospitals group is following the system-wide escalation framework agreed by the national accident and emergency department task force and issued to hospital groups in December 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Actions being taken to relieve the pressure on University Hospital Limerick accident and emergency department include the transfer of suitable patients from the hospital to model 2 hospitals in the region, including Ennis, Nenagh, St John's and Croom.  Also, and where appropriate, patients are being transferred to community care settings.  I know that staff in the hospital are working very closely with community intervention teams to provide antibiotics and other basic care in a patient's home or care facility.  This will, it is hoped, facilitate hospital avoidance as well as early discharge.  With such a system, people might be able to go home rather than stay in hospital.  In addition, extra ward rounds are being conducted and elective surgery is being kept under review.  Extra ward rounds are being done in order that people may be discharged more quickly.<\/p>  <p>  The hospital is also communicating with local GPs to ensure patients are referred to the accident and emergency department only where necessary and encouraging appropriate use of local injury units.  In the mid-west, there are now three local injuries units in St. John's, Ennis and Nenagh.  These units are equipped to see patients with minor injuries and play a significant role in diverting patients from the accident and emergency department.  In 2015, over 30% of unscheduled care patients were seen in one of these units.  An awareness programme to inform the public of the range of services provided by these units was launched in autumn 2015.<\/p>  <p>  I fully acknowledge the difficulties the current surge in accident and emergency department activity is causing for patients and their families.  It is also important that I acknowledge that the staff are doing their utmost to provide safe and quality care in very challenging circumstances.  I assure the Deputy that addressing accident and emergency department overcrowding is and will remain a priority for this Government.  In that regard I am confident that the issue in University Hospital Limerick will be significantly improved in 2017 with the opening of the new accident and emergency department.  I do not have a date for the opening but I will ask the Minister to revert to the Deputy on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600037#DDD00300","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1467812700,"counter":434,"content":"<p>It is difficult to respond as the Minister is not here, but I hope the Minister of State will relay my comments to him.

The amalgamation caused the crisis and the Minister of State mentioned the hospitals at Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's.  Closing the accident and emergency departments in those facilities caused the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Is the expected opening in March 2017?  If the date has been decided, has the Minister drawn up plans to incorporate existing accident and emergency staff into the new department?  In that context has the Minister spoken to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, the Irish Medical Organisation and other relevant unions and representative associations who will be involved in amalgamating the staff?<\/p>  <p>  If the new unit is established, what new skills will be required?  How is the recruitment drive for the accident and emergency department proceeding?  In the framework of the hospital's operational plan for 2016, it states that the hospital will need to reduce total staff numbers in 2016 to achieve financial targets contained within the acute hospital division operational plan.<\/p>  <p>  Is there any plan to reform and invest in modern diagnostic services, such as X-ray scanners, ultrasounds, etc. that will allow faster turnaround of patients?

I also acknowledge, as the Minister has done in his reply, that the other hospitals in the region are helping out at a critical time when patients' needs are rising, people are getting older and more people are attending the emergency department.  It is imperative that we inform people that where there are other facilities within a county, people should also use those.  They might be only step-down facilities and there might be units that are not fully equipped to deal with emergencies, so only those cases that need to go to the emergency department should go there.

St. Mary's in Drumcar is run by the St. John of God's order and for many years there has been an excellent relationship between the staff and the order and, indeed, the users.  However, as Drumcar moves into a transition phase, going from a congregated setting to different alternative living for those who will become their former residents, its budget is still very significant.  I understand it is around &euro;24 million per year.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State can imagine my concerns when in the last few weeks I have had a number of constituents ringing me, all of them regretfully in tears and very upset, looking for an increased level of care in terms of the respite their family members need.  Their family members, in each case, have an intellectual disability.  One of them occupies a respite bed in St. Mary's in Drumcar for three weeks and then on the fourth week of the month they are forced to leave that respite bed in the proper place and to go to a private nursing home, notwithstanding the excellence of care there.  It is inappropriate and unacceptable to the family and, indeed, to the person who is in that bed, because they leave their familiar surroundings and they are put into an entirely inappropriate place with people who are much older than them.  Some of those people are in their 90s, while the person I am talking about is in their 40s.  When the person's mother is on the phone and she is crying and upset, one says this is not good enough.  That is followed by another mother, who is concerned about a family member whom she looks after at home.  Every three months the family member gets excellent respite in St. Mary's, Drumcar, but it keeps being cancelled.  It was cancelled the week before last and I rang up and asked what was happening with this person, then it was cancelled again last week.  People who are getting older are unable to continue without the reasonable respite that Drumcar has always offered them.  That is another case.<\/p>  <p>  I also have another member of a different family who has an adult with intellectual disabilities and is unable to get an appropriate and proper medical appointment and assessment for them due to behavioural issues which arise in terms of their disability and their inability to communicate.  In fact, there are many difficulties in the house because the person with disabilities has increasing anxieties and concerns and needs to be properly looked after.  All of them have been brought to the attention of Drumcar and to the attention of the HSE.  To date, they remain unresolved.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State look at the issue, not just the cases of the people who have come to me, but the wider issue of the emerging needs in our communities?  As the institutions close, continuing professional respite and help for these people must be available.  It is very important to families who look after their loved ones.  I am talking about people in their 60s, 70s and 80s who are looking after their children as they grow older, still with concern for them.  They love and care for their families and they just feel the State is neglecting them in this hour of need.<\/p>  <p>  When one contrasts the tremendous work of the staff and the community of St. John of God's with the scandal of the under-the-table payments to senior executives that were announced recently, it is absolutely unacceptable that this can happen.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State will intervene immediately and urgently, so that the care these people need comes first and always first.  These people must be looked after and I look forward to the Minister of State's response and, indeed, his actions.  I know they will be appropriate, but it is unacceptable that the scandal of payments under the counter would continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600038#EEE00300","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1467813300,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Fergus O'Dowd for raising this important issue.  I commend him for his work as a strong advocate for people with disabilities in the County Louth area and particularly in relation to this issue of St. Mary's in Drumcar and the PEER project, which I am also working on.<\/p>  <p>  I will outline my position on services for people with disabilities who need residential supports from the health service.  This Government - I emphasise it is a partnership Government - is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide them with greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  I am acutely aware of the changing needs of people with disabilities and understand that many people require additional or alternative services.  That is key.  The approach I am pursuing is to move away from the old institution model to one of community-based, person-centred services.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, defined as a setting where ten or more people with a disability are living, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.<\/p>  <p>  This work is already under way and the number in congregated settings has dropped from over 4,000 in 2008, to under 2,800 today.  Capital funding of &euro;20 million from the Department of Health is being made available to the HSE in 2016 to move people out of congregated settings.  That funding was announced two weeks ago.  The funding will be used to facilitate the relocation of some 165 people currently living in 14 institutions around the country to suitable accommodation.  St. Mary's, Drumcar, is one of these institutions and St. John of God's is committed to moving 20 residents from St. Mary's into community settings this year.  That means 20 people are being dealt with immediately.<\/p>  <p>  I accept the point Deputy Fergus O'Dowd has made that St. Mary's, Drumcar, is a significant provider of disability services in the Dublin north-east area and is part of St. John of God's services, funded by the HSE under section 38 of the Health Act.  In 2010 the St. John of God's north-east services amalgamated their adult and children's respite, thereby reducing the capacity of respite provision in St. Mary's, Drumcar.  The respite provision is now three weeks for adults and one week for children.  There is currently a waiting list of 40 to 43 clients who have been identified as needing community residential placement due to elderly, frail parents caring for adult clients with an intellectual disability.  All of these clients - people with disabilities and mental health issues - have been mapped onto a national housing strategy in partnership with Louth County Council.  Capacity to respond to residential and respite emergencies is identified and managed on a geographical basis.  This is done in consultation with service providers and taking cognisance of the policy in moving people out of congregated settings.<\/p>  <p>  The emerging residential need in the absence of residential development funding over the past number of years is acknowledged by the HSE and myself as a challenge for all services providing support to clients with a disability.  Recognising this, I recently announced an additional &euro;31 million in funding for people with disabilities, of which &euro;3 million is earmarked for new initiatives, including the anticipated cost of a number of emergency residential placements arising this year.  In this regard, the HSE will continue to reform service delivery models to maximise the use of existing resources and develop sustainable models of service provision with positive outcomes for service users, delivering the best value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600038#EEE00400","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1467813900,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's statement and I again acknowledge his commitment, as well as the extra funding.  Drumcar is not doing what the HSE and the parents wish it to do and that is why the intervention of the Department is essential.  The HSE has assured me there is adequate funding to provide respite needs, which are required by two of the families to which I have referred.  It is not acceptable that an adult can be in a bed for three weeks and is need of respite care for another week but is sent into a private nursing home.  It is totally inappropriate and it is equally inappropriate that a person under 18 then takes that service.  Extra respite facilities need to be opened in Drumcar.<\/p>  <p>  The person in the HSE who deals with this is actually on holiday at the moment but I spoke to them about this earlier and they said they were prepared to initiate any funding that might be available.  I cannot speak for this person but I can speak for the families.  They are deeply concerned and deeply distressed.  I acknowledge that the Minister's brief is to move people out of Drumcar and into community settings but these people are already in the community.  They are not getting the service they received for many years.  One mother said to me that the respite care she had been receiving for her son for 40 years was no longer available to her.  The mother who rang me about this said she was at her wits' end and could not cope with looking after her adult child at home for three months with promises of respite care having been broken not once, but twice.  I urge the Minister to ensure the promise is not broken a third time.

That is vital for parity of esteem, fairness and equity.  In particular, the motion calls on the Minister to ensure that services provided by the telecom sector can be delivered in rural Ireland, and where there is a doubt over delivery by the telecom sector, provide assurance that those homes, schools or businesses will get an affordable high speed broadband connection and can be included as part of the State intervention if necessary.  That is very important if we are to thrive as a nation and develop not only our agriculture industry but the many cottage industries and businesses that want to locate in rural Ireland but cannot do so at present.  One of the main factors people coming here to take up jobs or those wanting to advertise jobs take into account is the area of broadband provision.  It is about high speed connectivity but it is unfair and wrong that people living in towns and regions in rural Ireland, down to the parishes and the streets, and farmers in rural Ireland have one hand tied behind their backs, and sometimes two, because of the lack of a broadband service.  That is deplorable and it is time we dealt with this once and for all.  We should grasp the nettle and ensure that every house, school and business that needs it has broadband.  I say that from the bottom of my heart, and I know that every TD in the Rural Independent Group is of the same view.  The Minister understands the problem because he too serves a rural constituency.  Those who will speak in the debate this evening, be they from town or city, understand that there are problems with broadband provision, and all we seek is parity of esteem.  We are not asking for favouritism or special treatment but parity of esteem with our colleagues, brothers and sisters throughout the Twenty-six Counties.<\/p><p>People doing their examinations and those trying to complete CAO forms are at a terrible disadvantage.  I am aware of a case involving a person who had passed the examination to get into the Army some years ago but who for health reasons could not be accepted.

Half way through the online interview the system crashed, and that person was denied the right to continue.  She had failed her examination as far as the authorities were concerned.  That is not right.<\/p><p>Farmers trying to complete application forms or draw down details of grant payments are at a disadvantage.  If they are 30 seconds late submitting their applications they are excluded from that process.  It is very important that we have broadband in place.<\/p><p>Business people are affected also.  I am a business man who, but for the private providers, would be out of business.  I set up a business in 1982 but everything changed with the onset of broadband.  Everything has to be on the button and done in minutes.  When we first got the fax machine we thought it was a wonderful tool but everything has progressed at a fast pace.  It is wonderful, but there is no parity of esteem.  We have had roll-out after roll-out of broadband services.  I sat behind the Minister when he was a backbencher from 2007 to 2011, and it was nothing but roll-outs.  We had them in the previous Government, but they all came to nothing in terms of the person who cannot use it.  That is the bottom line.  We are depending on the Minister and his officials to do something about that.  <\/p><p>We are having this debate now, and I see an amendment has been tabled about the privatisation aspect.  I do not care who delivers the service as long as somebody delivers it.  It has to be delivered.  It is like milk, butter or bread.  People cannot live on the wind and without broadband they are at a distinct disadvantage.  I dislike comparing this with food when many people are starving but it is as important as everyday kitchen essentials.  We need broadband connectivity to the household for people from the cradle to the grave.<\/p><p>Doctors surgeries in rural Ireland are affected also.  We have a doctor in our group who I am sure will relate to that.  They cannot practise unless they have a high-speed broadband connection to transfer information to consultants back and forth.  I refer to vital information on X-rays and so on.  It is basic information if one is living in a city but for those who do not, it is different, although there are black spots in cities as well.  It is vital that we have that service.<\/p><p>There are 42,207 premises in Tipperary which need to be covered by interventions under the national broadband plan.  That is an enormous number.  I do not wish to be parochial about this but I speak as a Tipperary TD.  Until yesterday, 49% of those premises were not covered by the NBP intervention area, with the remaining 51% to be covered by commercial operators.  I had them on to me all week, and I know the Minister met them yesterday.  They were on to me again all day today.  Those people must be saluted and supported.  They cannot be pushed overboard and told their services are no longer required because they have been the lifeline for the countryside, and they must be brought in to whatever is going on.  I know there is a tender process taking place but I do not want to see big conglomerates involved.  According to the newspapers last night the number was whittled down to three.  We have to have respect for those providers who took risks, put their hands in their pockets, put up temporary masts and did everything they could.  My colleague, Deputy Michael Collins, had a meeting in west Cork last Saturday morning with a group of private people who are waiting to put their hands in their pockets to pay for this because it is valuable and vital.  We must not allow those people to be disenfranchised.<\/p><p>The figures I gave the Minister demonstrate the extent of the broadband crisis, particularly in a rural county like Tipperary which has 3,167 townlands and where services need to be expanded and upgraded.  I saw on the six o'clock news last night a report about a family from Clerihan, a village only three miles from Clonmel, which is a town of 20,000 people.  We are fortunate with all the industry we have in the area through foreign direct investment and otherwise.  Clerihan is three miles out the road from Clonmel.  I canvassed there during the election but I nearly had to leave because people are so frustrated.  Some of them relocated back from England and elsewhere.  They want to work from home and set up small indigenous businesses.  They are the people we need to drive the recovery and if they cannot do that without a proper broadband service it is a sad day for Ireland as a whole, especially now following Brexit.  We need to be up and at it.  We have to compete with the best in Europe and in the world.  I will hand over to Deputy Michael Lowry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600040#GGG00600","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1467814200,"counter":450,"content":"<p>Deputy Lowry is sharing six minutes with Deputy Noel Grealish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600040#GGG00700","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1467814200,"counter":451,"content":"<p>In 2015, leading figures in the world of telecommunications stated that anything below 25 MB could no longer be defined as broadband.\u00a0 As we are all aware, the European Commission has set 30 MB as the basic speed needed for a viable service.  In 2016, several reports highlight the fact that only one third of Irish premises are consistently reaching speeds of 15 MB and above.  The remaining two thirds of premises are enduring speeds of less than 15 MB, with a majority of premises in rural areas suffering Internet speeds of less than 4 MB and as low as 1 MB.<\/p>  <p>  Broadband speeds in rural Ireland are way below the European Commission viable service measure of 30 MB.  According to international standards, we should not even define rural speeds of 1 MB to 4 MB as broadband.  By these standards, rural Internet access speeds in Ireland should be labelled as \"low\" band and, in many instances, \"no\" band.  Rural citizens are suffering glorified dial-up Internet access, with far reaching and negative consequences for rural homes, business and education, as well as aspects of social and cultural life in rural areas.<\/p><p>In my county of Tipperary it is estimated that there are 41,000 properties without broadband, 8,000 of which are businesses of varying sizes, each attempting to compete in a wider marketplace.  Large towns such as Clonmel, Thurles, Nenagh, Tipperary and Templemore are well served by commercial operators.  Other smaller towns and villages throughout County Tipperary require immediate intervention by the Government.  No business in today&rsquo;s world can expand and develop without fast, reliable, high speed broadband.  It is a basic ingredient needed to progress.  What is the use of developing other infrastructure outside main towns and cities when a fast, effective and reliable broadband system is absent?  Poor broadband is a destructive obstacle to rural business growth and, consequently, to rural job creation and employment.<\/p> <p> The digital divide that exists between rural and urban business impacts upon the delivery and development of education in rural settings.  Rural primary and secondary schools have invested in the latest tablets, laptops and interactive whiteboards.  To maximise the educational potential of these IT resources, teachers and pupils need decent broadband facilities.  How can rural pupils compete with their urban and international peers if they do not have the same opportunities to develop their digital literacy skills?  This is a pressing and current form of disadvantage in education which must be addressed as a matter of priority.  The landscape of third level education in particular has been reshaped and has evolved in response to demands for e-learning course platforms and facilities.  Given the poor standard of broadband speeds, if a person wants to pursue third level education or other online educational opportunities, he or she is at a major disadvantage if he or she lives in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p> Inadequate broadband must be recognised as another significant factor prompting rural dwellers to flee their locality in favour of greater prospects in urban areas and elsewhere.  Rural dwellers can rightfully feel abandoned and unable to compete, despite their professional capabilities, as they watch urban-based establishments continue to thrive in the unfair, two-tier system that currently exists.  Ireland and rural Ireland needs to be able to compete in the global economy now.  A five-year timeline or greater is too long and too late.  We can no longer permit ambiguity and hesitation around the national broadband plan.  We need confirmation that it will be implemented with certainty.  Therefore, I would ask if the State could fast-track further the necessary capital funding to expedite the promised roll-out schedule which would grant an earlier delivery date of rural broadband to the majority neglected homes and businesses.  It must be remembered that broadband is a basic and essential utility.<\/p> <p> Broadband has become, and remains, the single most essential feature of the 21st century for home life, business life and educational development.  Businesses and educational institutions, whatever their size, remain the very lifeblood of every economy.  If entrepreneurship, small and medium enterprises and the necessary digital skills are to be encouraged to thrive in rural Ireland, access to broadband is essential if we are to work, grow and compete fairly in a national and global economy.<\/p> <p> I am encouraged by the Minister's particular interest and commitment and by the fact he has taken the initiative to make this issue a top priority in his Department.  Consumer price can be protected through regulation in the chosen ownership model.  I would ask the Minister to roll out the scheme as a matter of urgency and without further delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600040#GGG00800","speaker":"1240","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467814800,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Naughten, on his appointment.  I know he will do an excellent job and that he will not be found wanting in his delivery of broadband.  I also congratulate Deputy Hildegarde Naughton on her appointment as Chair of the Committee on Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources.  She will be busy.  It is good to have in the House today the two most important people with regard to broadband provision.  I am sure any pilot project that will be rolled out will be done in the west.  I compliment the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Humphreys, on the presentation she gave recently regarding the proposal to roll out broadband in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister, Deputy Naughten, is aware, there is a massive digital divide between rural and urban areas in the State.  On the one hand, broadband connection speeds of up to 1,000 Mb per second are being offered by some commercial companies in cities.  However, in rural areas people are struggling in many cases to get speeds of even 1 Mb, which is not much better than the old dial-up connection when the Internet was in its relative infancy.  People are suffering daily as a result.  Consider the difficulties of trying to operate a business without a reliable broadband service in this day and age which requires daily connectivity to customers and suppliers.  It cannot be done.<\/p>  <p>  A proper Internet connection has also long since gone from being an enjoyable pastime for rural households to being vital to them.  One of the biggest problems faced by many rural areas over a number of decades is a growing sense of isolation.  Their sense of community, in many cases, has been gradually eroded by a combination of factors, including a loss of local jobs to bigger companies, usually located in urban areas, emigration of huge numbers of the younger generation, and closures of post offices, shops and Garda stations.  That sense of isolation will continue to grow at pace in areas which do not have a high speed broadband connection or even a broadband connection of any kind.<\/p>  <p>  While connection speeds continue to grow in the larger urban areas, it is not just a question of creating new employment opportunities.  It is increasingly about people being forced out of their home areas because they cannot make a living without reliable and fast Internet access.  Even farming is becoming an occupation that cannot function without broadband.  More and more forms have to be filled in online.<\/p>  <p>  My home county of Galway is a good example of the level of connectivity that exists in rural areas compared with larger urban areas.  Of more than 133,000 premises, including residential and commercial, 62,000 require State intervention to bring them an Internet service.  This is in a county that is home to the third largest city in the country where commercial companies will meet the majority of the demand for broadband connections.  Almost all that huge number of homes and businesses expected to be covered by State intervention under the national broadband plan will be located in rural areas of the county.<\/p>  <p>  Figures provided recently by the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, indicate that more than 56,000 premises in Galway currently have no access to high speed broadband and another 62,500 premises do not have broadband of a sufficient standard.  If one removes the figure of 40,000 homes and businesses in Galway city, one is left with the stark reality that less than 13% of those outside the main urban area are without broadband.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the commitment of the Minister to rectify this situation and his intention to bring high speed broadband to every home in the country.  I understand that rolling out such an extensive plan will take time, but I know the Minister will push for it.  I know too that the committee will not be left standing either and will support him in his endeavours.  I urge him, however, to proceed at the fastest possible pace before even more rural communities have the life squeezed out of them.  For the rural communities to survive and thrive in today's world, broadband access is as vital to them as the massive programme of rural electrification was back in the middle of the last century.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke earlier about broadband speeds in the context of a rural-urban digital divide.  Ireland is the only country in Europe where average Internet connection speeds have fallen since last year, which is a matter of serious concern.  The latest state of the Internet report just published by Akamai indicates a 14% decline, to an average of 14.4 Mb per second, in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015.  The remaining countries on the Continent all enjoyed double digit gains over the same year according to this respected American based global Internet service provider.  Norway, for example, increased its average speed by 68% over the same period, and 26 countries saw yearly gains of at least 25%.  Ireland is now ranked 15th in Europe, although our average Internet connection speed is still ahead of Germany and France.  At the start of 2015, Ireland ranked best in Europe and second in the whole world in terms of average connection speeds, at 17.4 Mb.  This followed a huge improvement in speeds over 2014, but we are slipping back now at such a startling rate that it is a matter of serious concern.  The slide down the index will have to be stopped as we strive to give all the people in the State a fighting chance to make a living and to live their lives where they want by arming them with high speed Internet connection, which is a basic necessity in this day and age.<\/p><p> I know the Minister and the Department will do this.  I was impressed with the presentation he gave us.  There will be many obstacles in his way.  Some local authorities will be proactive while some will not.  The Minister should work with local authorities where they are doing work in towns and villages, and he should work with Irish Water when it is laying pipes and constructing drainage schemes.  It is important that these bodies work with the Department to ensure the infrastructure is installed at the same time to provide the service and they are not digging the streets twice.<\/p> <p> I wish the Minister all the best in his position and I wish the same to the Acting Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600041#HHH00200","speaker":"1313","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467815400,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I thank the Rural Alliance for tabling this motion.  Delivering high speed broadband to every home, business and school in Ireland is a personal promise from me and my top priority as the responsible Minister.  Like all Deputies, I have been frustrated with the lack of progress in this area for the past few years, and so too have hundreds of thousands of people throughout Ireland, including our constituents, the people who elected us to deliver.  Yesterday was an important day, a milestone in a project which I believe, in its scale and significance, matches rural electrification.  The process is finally moving and is on time.<\/p>  <p>  The motion, tabled by the Rural Alliance, is timely.  I promise the Deputies that every home and business in Ireland will have high speed broadband.  The roll-out will start in every county in the first year of the programme, and the last homes and businesses will be connected within three to five years.  No one will be left behind.<\/p>  <p>  Turning now to the amendments put forward by Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in, let me be clear that both procurement models will deliver the same service to consumers for the next 25 years.  People in rural Ireland will not see any difference in terms of the type, timeliness and cost of services they receive.  The Government will exercise the same control over the network for the full 25 years under both models.  The network will, as Fianna F&aacute;iI asks, ensure the future needs of homes and businesses are met.  The only tangible differences are in the cost to the taxpayer and the time it will take to get contracts in place.<\/p>  <p>  On cost, the full concession model, which Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in want, would cost between 50% and 70% more than the gap funding model.  The full cost of the project would be likely to go on the Government&rsquo;s balance sheet, and the commercial sector input would also be regarded as Government debt.  The impact of this on the general Government deficit would be approximately &euro;1 billion more than the gap funding model.  This would also reduce the available capital spend by up to &euro;600 million over the next six years.<\/p>  <p>  On timing, the full concession model would take at the very least six months more to negotiate with bidders, a delay the people in need of broadband cannot afford.  Ten weeks ago, a delay of six months to the procurement process was announced.  Are we really saying to the people that we want them to endure another six-month delay?  We want to encourage investment in rural Ireland and that means avoiding delays that are within our control.<\/p>  <p>  As both models will deliver the same thing, the benefit of State ownership is a notional benefit at the end of the contract.  My questions to Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in are these.  What projects are they prepared to forgo to pursue a State-owned model?  From which projects will they cut &euro;600 million?  Do we close long-stay homes for older people that are not up to the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, standards?  Are they comfortable returning to their constituencies tomorrow to tell the families and business people of rural Ireland that they are proposing further preventable delays in delivering their vital broadband service?  Can they really look them in the eye and tell them that in a world that is more connected than ever, they will continue to lose out?  I certainly will not be going to the Connacht final this weekend to tell my constituents that they will have to wait at least six months longer because certain Deputies in this House want the State to own and control the network in 2043, that is, 27 years away.  The Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson in the Seanad, Senator Terry Leyden, while expressing concerns earlier today said that he would not impede me and told me to get on with it.<\/p>  <p>  People in rural Ireland are already frustrated and angry about the delay in delivering services to them.  I am not prepared to put other urgent capital investment priorities in schools, local and regional roads, flood relief and primary care residential centres in jeopardy by opting for an ownership model that will give the same outcome at a significantly higher cost.  The telecoms industry has invested strongly to deliver high speed broadband to approximately 1.2 million premises in towns and villages throughout Ireland, and this investment is ongoing.  It is covering homes and businesses in towns such as Tipperary, Clonmel, Tralee, Cahersiveen, Killarney, Cooraclare, Barna, Inchydoney and Kilrush, to name only a few.  Industry had previously promised to deliver to 1.6 million premises.  The Department has been closely monitoring these developments.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, I announced that the Department has identified up to 170,000 premises which had been expected to get services from the telecoms sector and which will not now get those services.  We are working to identify these premises in order that we can include them in the State intervention programme.  This will ensure no premises, no matter how isolated, will be left behind.<\/p>  <p>  Effective regulation, such as a universal service obligation, can deal with many of the concerns that could arise in 2043.  I am already considering what regulatory safeguards we could introduce to ensure quality services continue to be delivered over the coming years and after 2043 when the contract or contracts expire.<\/p>  <p>  I was amazed this morning to hear Deputy Howlin extolling the virtues of public ownership.  As a member of the previous Government he could have made a decision on ownership last December if he was so keen on the full concession model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600042#JJJ00200","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1467815400,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600042#JJJ00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1467815400,"counter":457,"content":"<p>He consented to the privatisation of almost 300 Coillte telecommunications masts last year, which would have an impact on mobile phone coverage throughout the country.

The speeds we have set out in the procurement process are minimum speeds and not &ldquo;up to&rdquo; speeds.  I will in the coming days lay a statutory instrument before the House which will transpose key aspects of the European cost of broadband directive.  It will deal with infrastructure sharing by utility network operators and timelines for processing permissions to install telecoms infrastructure along public roads in line with the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment.  I intend to follow this with measures to ensure all new-build premises have ducting installed for the purposes of installing telecom lines.  This will add to existing legislation in this area since 2002.<\/p>  <p>  I believe there is unanimous support in this House for the speedy and efficient delivery of the national broadband plan.  I would like to put firmly on the record of the House, the progress that has been made.

The Department continues to monitor deployment by the telecoms industry and I am now moving to include another 170,000 premises in the intervention area.<\/p>  <p>  The gap funding ownership model will deliver the same network and services that would be delivered under a full concession model for consumers over the next 25 years.

The Minister will note recent figures released by the IDA indicating that it is missing its own targets on investment in areas outside Dublin and Cork.  That means rural Ireland is missing out.  Leaving aside companies such as Google, people trying to set up or maintain small businesses are at a distinct disadvantage.  When I talk about infrastructure I include areas such as access to reliable power, clean water and high speed broadband.<\/p><p>Access to high speed broadband is a problem for over 30% of the population.  When one compares Ireland to other highly developed countries in Europe, we are lagging behind countries such as Latvia, Hungary and Poland.  Iceland has a 95% broadband penetration rate. <\/p> <p> In 2012 the Government task force highlighted all of these issues, as well as the importance of high speed broadband for economic growth, jobs, boosting small and medium enterprises, schools being able to access online tools and combatting rural isolation.  Only a few years after Independence, the State embarked on a major challenge with regard to rural electrification, and the roll-out of broadband is equivalent to that.  It was only in 2003 that the last two areas in the country were connected to electricity mains, in Inishturk and Inishturbot.  There is a five year roll-out plan for broadband to every house and business in the country.  It is just as important as rural electrification.

It is a pity that he did not have a more appropriate speech at Cabinet.  It seems that he is a ram in the D&aacute;il and a lamb at Cabinet.  Unfortunately, he lost the battle.  <\/p><p>Over the past two days he has delivered a forceful presentation on what has been achieved.  On a number of occasions, he has identified that his personal opinion and wish would have been to retain the network in the State ownership.  He went on to give a standard finance line, that is, to ask from where the money would come and the projects we do not want to see happen.  <\/p><p>It is a standard line.  I was a backbencher on the other side of the House when the same line came from the Department of Finance.  It would ask what schools, roads or sewerage schemes we did not want to build.  It provides a toolbox of excuses, and it is incumbent on the Minister of the day to fight on behalf of his Department and the interests that fall within his remit.  Sadly, the Minister lost the battle.  He could have told the Department of Finance and the Minister concerned that the economy is growing and there will be an extra &euro;1 billion in revenue available to the State for the budget this year.  He could have rolled the &euro;600 million to which he referred over six years, which would be 10% of the additional moneys available this year and probably a lesser percentage if the growth projections remain on target for the next five or six years.<\/p><p>The Minister could have told them to look at the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and consider it as a commercial investment, in terms of the part that would be commercial.  As the Minister knows, whatever contractor ultimately wins the battle will have to go to the marketplace for finance.  It is very possible that the winner could eventually be funded through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund because it has the capacity to invest in commercial entities.  The back-end of this contract will be commercial because the gap in the middle is being filled by the State. <\/p><p>It is very possible that the State will provide money through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to the ultimate contractor.  The Minister will fill the gap in funding and the project will reside in the hands of a multinational that will have the capacity before the ending of the contract to flip the assets and make significant profits for the company concerned.  <\/p><p>I speak with some knowledge of and interest in this area.  In the past, my party took a decision which at the time seemed like the correct one.  All of the discussion and political consensus in the House and in Europe at the time was that it was in the best interests of the State to sell Eircom.  We were told the return to the State would build more schools, water and sewerage schemes and public housing.  As a result of that decision, which was taken in good faith by all concerned at the time, there were significant delays in the roll-out of broadband which has put us well behind the European average in terms of the penetration of broadband. <\/p><p>That happened because we did not have the capacity to control access to and investment in the network.  The vulture funds that played fast and loose with the asset that is now Eir's asset in order to make a profit for themselves in the short-term jockeying of resources left Ireland, in particular the parts the Minister and I know best, those areas we seek to represent, in a difficult position.<\/p><p>Many speakers will catalogue the various enterprises that have failed to get appropriate speeds in order to be able to carry out their business.  There are personal stories of homes where junior certificate, leaving certificate or college students are failing to get access broadband to prepare reports, interface with universities and submit dissertations on time.  We all deal with these issues in our constituency offices on a daily basis.  We can say or do little other than to point out that Eir is a private company and, sadly, we have no more control over it. <\/p><p>I have been in the House for 13 or 14 years - the time flies.  Sadly, on far too many occasions decisions are taken here that focus on the electoral cycle.  Decisions are made to build schools before the next election cycle so that people can get a bunch of votes.  That kind of planning should be consigned to history.  We should look to a much greater extent to the future and put in place the kind of foundations that will build upon future necessities.<\/p><p>The spine that will be delivered in the network has major potential not just to deliver broadband to homes, but to provide the backbone for future generations of mobile phone technology.  There is little doubt that Ireland has the capacity to be a mobile island in terms of the roll-out of various pilot projects by many social media organisations, all of which are now delivered in a mobile environment.  We should be doing everything we possibly can to attract more activity into that space. <\/p><p>Handing this network to an environment that will ultimately fall into the control of private operators will not encourage that kind of investment and will have significant negative long-term consequences for the State.

Unfortunately, the record has not been good to date.  I wish to take issue with one comment the Minister made, namely, that we are on time.  We are patently not on time.  I appreciate that the Minister was not in government in 2011, but the previous Government committed to 90% coverage by 2015.<\/p>  <p>  In 2012 a task force was established under the then Minister, Pat Rabbitte, which committed to 100% coverage by 2020.  These are noble goals and lofty aspirations, but unfortunately we are nowhere near them.  We currently rank 42 in the global rankings for high speed broadband and in terms of international competitiveness, attracting foreign direct investment and supporting our own people, we are well down the league table.<\/p>  <p>  I could quote statistics, but can speak more powerfully from personal experience.  I live in Sallins, a town in the commuter belt of North Kildare, in an estate in a very urban area about five minutes walk from the nearest train station.  On a good day I get perhaps 30 Mb per second, which is not a bad speed, but according to the US authorities it is barely broadband.  In fact, under 25 Mb per second is now considered to be narrow band according to US metrics.  If I drive a few miles down the road towards Dublin to places like Kilteel or Eadestown on the Kildare-Dublin border, I find I cannot get broadband at all.  These places are less than 18 km from Dublin city centre.<\/p>  <p>  I have much sympathy for my colleagues in the west and other rural areas, but even in the greater Dublin area and hinterlands of the city there are places which have no broadband.  In villages and towns like those in which I live, we might get 30 Mb on a good day.  Many areas of the countryside cannot access any broadband.  It is a major issue.  Deputy Dooley has highlighted many reasons this issue is important, including educational, commercial and competitiveness considerations.  That highlights the stark reality of the situation. <\/p><p> I welcome the national broadband plan, which we have been hearing about for five years at this stage.  It is very well and good, but I would like to see it accelerated.  There are also many things we could do as the framework is already there.  I have worked with operators in Kildare and elsewhere to roll out broadband.  Drawing from personal experience, I know that a number of obstacles exist, such as planning and technical anomalies that hold up progress.  Even without the broadband plan, the tender and the significant investment and work programme that lie ahead, we could ensure progress is made today or tomorrow to strip away some of the impediments that exist.  There are widely varying local development plans and contribution schemes.  In some cases local authorities put exemption zones in place, and there are other anomalies.  Any provider seeking to implement a wide programme faces multiple planning authorities with multiple approaches.  The lack of a streamlined approach is a barrier to progress.<\/p> <p> State subvention is required in areas where provision is not commercially viable, but once some of the barriers are removed the cost comes down and the commercial reality comes to the fore in many areas.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to transposing the EU directive.  The target was 1 July.  There are many common-sense ideas in it in terms of making the plan work and taking State infrastructure that is already in place and making it available.  The directive is useful in that it refers to infrastructure in State ownership and the commissioning of public buildings.  Another difficulty that arises is access.  One could ask whom a provider in the market talks to if he or she wants to access a council building, a Garda station or a Coillte site.  There is a lack of communications, understanding or responsibility in some State agencies.  I put that to the Minister as an issue that must be addressed if the broadband plan is to work.  We can transpose the directive, which is welcome and needed and is full of common sense, but we must go a little further and put a plan in place to manage the process.<\/p> <p> Deputy Grealish referred to double-digging.  Very few things get people&rsquo;s back up more than a road being dug up again and again.  There is a reference to ducting being provided in all new roads projects.  However, I wish to add a caveat in that regard.  The State can put ducting underground, but the issue that arises is how an operator would gain access to it, and, if it leases it, what the price would be.  In some cases providers have told me it is cheaper for them to get a licence to dig up the road and lay their own cable, even if that is a foot away from the cable that was put in by the State.  That is a bizarre situation.  The State should acquire a fair market rent for the infrastructure but it should not be the case that providers have to dig up the road a second time just to make the process work for them.<\/p> <p> Broadband is badly needed, and these are a couple of suggestions that could transform the market overnight.  The national broadband plan is a lofty ideal.  It is badly needed in many areas where it might be non-competitive and non-commercial, but there are quick fixes we could put in place in the morning.  Such changes should be implemented immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600043#KKK00400","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467816600,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate.  I commend those who have tabled the motion before the House, thereby allowing D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to discuss this very important issue.<\/p>  <p>  There have been two major infrastructure projects in this country &ndash; the ESB from the 1930s to the 1950s, and the installation of a telephone system decades later.  Now we are rolling out broadband.  A two-tier society is developing whereby there are those with access to broadband and those without.  We have catalogued many companies, individuals and families who have made decisions to move to rural areas because of access to broadband due to the potential for improved quality of life and the ability to deal with work commitments.  Nearly all Members who serve rural communities are aware of the situation.  Agriculture is our greatest indigenous industry and it is very much regulated.  The sector provides a fantastic product and now it is very much dependent on access to online services for record keeping and other purposes.  There is a major vacuum in broadband services.<\/p>  <p>  Some of those involved in the telecommunications industry made a presentation to Oireachtas Members in the AV room last week.  A range of issues were raised, including mobile phone coverage.  Deputy Dooley and I were members of a committee in the previous D&aacute;il and industry representatives came before it as well.  The fulfilment of the terms of reference in terms of the licence they have leaves much to be desired.  The areas with poor mobile phone coverage 20 years ago are the same ones that lack coverage today.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has outlined the first steps towards providing a broadband connection for each and every citizen.  There are great fears, especially in rural communities, in spite of the great plans.  One initiative was announced between the ESB and Vodafone to share their networks and bring broadband to provincial towns, but it only brought broadband to areas that were commercially viable.  The biggest issue is that between 30% and 40% of the land mass of the State has a difficulty with broadband reception.  Many of the private sector initiatives around the country, such as for wireless broadband services, are hit and miss.  We cannot get broadband in rural communities and we are disadvantaged because of that.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister was a member of the same committee of which I was a member in the previous D&aacute;il.  I congratulate him and wish him well in the role, because it is very challenging.  The previous two Ministers were from Dublin and, while they had the full facts in front of them, perhaps they did not appreciate the seriousness of the situation.  I take it that, coming from the part of the country from which the Minister comes, he knows full well the seriousness of the situation that is facing rural communities.  I was contacted by people from parts of Meath in recent years who are only 15 miles from O&rsquo;Connell Street in Dublin but who have difficulty not only with broadband but also with mobile phone coverage.  It is not just the people in the west or the south taking the pain; the problem is affecting areas adjacent to other regions as well.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware the Minister is transposing the European directive.  Where do we stand in terms of State aid?  What agreement has been reached with the European Union and what stage is the process at?  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor constantly told us a decision would be made, for example, by the middle of 2014.  In 2015 he said the same and he also said more information was required by the EU.  How far advanced is the process at the moment in terms of the European Union buying into the plan?  The fundamental point about infrastructure must be made strongly because we are connecting Ireland into this century.  Unfortunately, we are far behind the curve, but we are connecting all parts of the country into this century.  No matter where one is or how remote it is, every single parish has people who stay at home or who are working from home and providing a fantastic service.  We must embrace that as well.<\/p>  <p>  In order to apply a proper spatial strategy in the future, we must ensure that remote areas do not become wastelands, with the population leaving because services are not available.  A broadband service is as important in Kishkeam in County Cork as it is in O&rsquo;Connell Street in Dublin.  I urge the Minister to clarify the situation in terms of the European Union.  One could ask whether we are building castles in the sand until it ponies up an agreement.  We must ensure adequate broadband speeds are introduced because we saw what happened with postcodes last year when the emergency services did not buy into the system.  Emergency services, by and large, are controlled from a central location, but the necessary backup does not currently exist.  We must do a lot more work in order to ensure rural communities are connected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600044#LLL00200","speaker":"1283"},{"type":"speech","time":1467817200,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I did not get the opportunity before, but I wish the Minister luck in his position.  He and I would have talked many a time about broadband because we know the speeds down our neck of the woods, but I was baffled yesterday when I heard that we are not going to own the infrastructure.  I would have wished that we as a nation would own that for the betterment of all.  This will be the biggest infrastructure project since the electrification of Ireland.  We have to get it right.  We owe it to the next generation to make sure we get it right.  For the sake of the revival of rural Ireland, we have to get it right.  Yesterday evening, I looked at the news and saw that someone made a comment about water and had to resign.  It is a pity that there might not be as much focus put on broadband, for the simple reason that we need to make sure.  Right across the divide, from the people I talk to, there is unanimous agreement that we need this infrastructure to be owned by the State.  Let us put it up, because this is a licence to print money.  Private companies are interested in this not to lose money, but to make money.<\/p>  <p>  When the Minister and I sat at the talks earlier we went through all this, but next June is when the contract will come out.  There is no reason; it is bodies on the ground after that which will make sure.  I have one question.  Six months ago we talked about 80 megabits; now we are coming down to 30.  Why are we doing that?  We have to make sure we do the right thing now.  I am not blaming the Minister, but I ask him to go back to the Cabinet and ask it to try to put the infrastructure in the hands of the State, for the simple reason that this is for the future.  In ten, 15, 20 or 30 years down the line the decisions that politicians make here will be the ones that will help future generations.  In all parts of rural Ireland, broadband is crucial.  We are talking about regional development.  We have to make sure it is delivered as fast as possible.  I know that the legislation has to comply with the directive, but I ask the Minister to go back again and make sure that the State will handle the infrastructure, and that all the private companies run it after that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600045#MMM00100","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1467817200,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I now call on Deputy Stanley, who is sharing time with Deputies Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and Gerry Adams.

Rural electrification was and is in public ownership.  This will be a much-valued asset.  It is disappointing that the Government has not recognised the importance of keeping what will be a priceless asset in public ownership.<\/p>  <p>  In the 1980s, the Government invested heavily in upgrading telecoms infrastructure, resulting in a network being built that surpassed Britain's or those on the Continent.  I am glad that Fianna F&aacute;il has come to a more Sinn F&eacute;in position on this, even if it is 26 years too late.  They sold it off to venture capitalists.  We have seen little investment in the past 26 years, with the result that the telecommunications network is now way behind our European competitors.  The key difference is that we must have control of major infrastructure.  The decision to hand broadband infrastructure to private capitalists is short-sighted in the extreme.  The taxpayer and the State will have invested millions of euros, but it will be snapped up for profit.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure we all agree that the national broadband plan has potential and is badly needed.  We recognise that and we want to see this programme rolled out.  It has significant potential to reinvigorate the whole island.  In my constituency of Laois, and in south Kildare, places such as Borris-in-Ossory, Rathdowney, Portarlington, Graiguecullen and Monasterevin are all badly in need of this infrastructure.  If we take MANs, when it was built, as I saw in my own town of Portlaoise, some people considered it as a white elephant.  It has now developed across the country and is worth 20 times what it was when the infrastructure was put in.  I have no doubt that this infrastructure, the rural broadband network, will be valuable also.<\/p>  <p>  We have had a lot of talk of and a promise of new politics in this D&aacute;il term.  From what I am hearing, the Labour Party will do a U-turn as well and support Sinn F&eacute;in's position, so the majority of Members want this kept in public ownership.  I want the Minister to go back to the Cabinet and have a chat.  I heard the Minister trotting out the figures and the reasons, but he knows that is not the full picture.  That is a debate for another day, to revisit this again and keep it in public ownership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600045#MMM00700","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1467817200,"counter":472,"content":"<p>Last week, I attended a presentation in the AV room hosted by Deputy Bernard Durkan.  It included most of the communications companies in the State.  Deputy after Deputy took to the floor to castigate these telecommunications companies in the strongest possible terms over the desperately poor mobile and mobile internet coverage throughout the State.  The level of anger was a sight to behold.  Deputies were outdoing each other out of anger.  I found myself agreeing with the Deputies wholeheartedly.  They were right.  A large area across the southern State is a no-man's land for mobile phone and mobile Internet coverage.  People cannot do business, make social calls or even ring emergency services when they need them.  We are talking not about far-off headlands in the west, but about a couple of miles outside major towns in the Dublin region.<\/p>  <p>  On a separate occasion last week, my dog was barking and my son was giving out to the dog for barking.  I laughed because that is what dogs do - they bark.  In the same way, private companies maximise profits.  That is what they do.  They cherry-pick the most attractive elements of deals, invest in infrastructure to increase revenue streams and upgrade and maintain systems only on the basis of the income they generate.  Shouting at a private company for maximising profits is as stupid as shouting at a dog for barking, especially if those Deputies doing the shouting are the Deputies who privatised the system in the first place.  Many of those Deputies were the same ones that stood over the licence requirements necessary for those companies in the telecoms industry.  An example of that would be the requirement for ComReg to measure signals, which means that it does not measure the quality of the signal, only that there is one.  They measure only on the main road itself.  We know that handing over systems lock, stock and barrel to private companies is a dangerous system that comes back to haunt Deputies afterwards.<\/p>  <p>  The truth of the matter is that the privatisation of Eircom was one of the most damaging decisions made by any Government in this State.  The subsequent owners asset-stripped Eircom for the benefit of their shareholders and to the detriment of families, business and communities up and down the country.  It has cost the State billions of euros and has devastated the economic well-being of whole regions throughout the State.  The decision was made on the basis of the intellectual fashion of the time.  It was believed that privatisation was good and public ownership was bad.  Unfortunately, that intellectual fashion is still firmly embedded in Fine Gael and maybe in the Independent Fine Gael Deputy we have before us today.  Government's investment in infrastructure is one of the best things a Government can do because it creates efficiencies and competitive advantages now and into the future.<\/p><p>We have seen that investment collapse by about &euro;6 billion over the past seven years.  This process is part of that retrenchment from Government investment into State goods. <\/p> <p> Regional development has been one of the biggest burning issues, yet we know that massive sections of our society are currently second-class digital citizens.  However, the Government's response is to provide &euro;200 million over seven years, which is &euro;28 million per year.  This particular Government plan is a hollow husk in response to a disconnected, forgotten and ignored community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600045#MMM00800","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467817800,"counter":474,"content":"<p>Mo bhu&iacute;ochas don Rural Alliance, mar mhol siad an r&uacute;n seo agus t&aacute;im f&iacute;orbhu&iacute;och go bhfuil seans agamsa labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo.

It is also clearly the entitlement and right of those communities.  However, the decision to opt for a privatisation model is short-sighted, deeply flawed and will ultimately cost the State and consumers much more in the future.<\/p>  <p>  There is also widespread concern at the length of time that will now be needed to provide broadband access to all parts of the State.  Last December, the former communications Minister, Alex White, told me in response to a parliamentary question that there are still 15,000 premises in County Louth to be covered by the new arrangement.  The availability of broadband to that constituency will now be dependent upon the private sector provider.  Six months ago, Alex White predicted that 85% of addresses in the State would have access to high speed services by 2018 with all addresses being covered by 2020.  The current Minister, Deputy Naughten's scheme would see that framework pushed back to 2022.  Given the way these timeframes have been changed, how confident can we be that this new one will be met?  When can households and businesses in Louth expect to be fully included in broadband?<\/p>  <p>  Let me reiterate our opposition to the Government's privatisation proposal.  Our firm belief is that broadband should be retained in State ownership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600046#NNN00200","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1467817800,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I welcome the motion before the House.  I have some technical questions to ask and will also request a further discussion on this issue here to discuss the more technical aspects of this plan.  Perhaps that could be done outside the committee structure because every Member of the House has a vested interest in the issue and, while not necessarily being members of the relevant committee, they may be spokespersons in that area.  That is the new paradigm we are in.<\/p>  <p>  As I understand it, the options that were placed before the Minister were whittled down to two.  The first, which the Government chose, is the commercial stimulus or gap-funding model whereby the private sector finances, designs, builds, owns and operates the network.  There are contractual obligations within that model.<\/p>  <p>  Second, there is the full concession model whereby the private sector again finances, designs, builds and operates the network, but the asset is handed back to the State after 25 years.  My understanding is that going for the full concession model, involving a reversion of the asset back to the State after 25 years, would have had implications in putting the entire cost of the project on balance sheet.  There would therefore have been an impact on fiscal space.<\/p>  <p>  I did not hear the Minister's opening remarks but I think he referred to Deputy Howlin's earlier intervention about certain choices that have to be made by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I will not get into a political tit for tat on that.  However, the logic of opting for the fully privatised or gap-funding model is that the fiscal space would not be covered by the Exchequer's capital funding envelope.<\/p>  <p>  I am seeking a discussion on the KPMG report which advised the gap-funding model.  What was the legal advice in real terms for opting against the full concession model?  I am told - and, to be fair, the Department has been open about this - that the full concession model was deemed to be significantly more complex from a contractual perspective.  In addition, it would take six months or possibly longer to negotiate a contract.  One tries to be as factual as one can but if one goes to a company like KPMG, or another external adviser in the private sector, on the law of averages they are not necessarily going to say that one should come back with a model that reverts the asset back to the State after 25 years.  That is why I want to have a further discussion on this matter which warrants further investigation.<\/p>  <p>  The KPMG report presented arguments in favour of the commercial stimulus model.  A departmental document stated that this model placed all the technology and demand risk on the private sector, while costing the Exchequer less.  In addition, the asset will rely extensively on commercially-owned third-party assets which will not be within the control of Government.  That is one of the considerations which warrants further discussion.  <\/p>  <p>  There is cross-party support for this motion and we all have myriad examples in our own constituencies.  However, anything we do now could be surpassed by new technologies in the provision of broadband.  We do not know what kind of technology will exist in 25 years time.  I am not breaching the Minister's confidence in saying that we had a discussion on this matter previously; it was an open conversation.  If new infrastructure is being created and the State is investing in it, a more conservative view would be to retain the network in State ownership because we do not know what will happen technologically downstream.  That would be a more cautious approach.  Is there is a mechanism to have a discussion here on how we would fund the cost of the full concession model over a longer period that the five or six years we are talking about?  We can only talk in limited terms about the future fiscal space but if the capital envelope goes from approximately &euro;275 million up to &euro;600 million, which may be the true cost, is there room for such a discussion?  This is particularly relevant given our relationship with the EU at present and given the new political realities that exist with the EU.  <\/p>  <p>  I know the Minister will say that this would slow down the process.  I do appreciate that point and I am not trying to score political points.  I noted Deputy Stanley's reference to a Labour U-turn, but in fact there is no U-turn on this.  We are, however, trying to have as broad a discussion as possible so that we can future proof what we are creating now.  In that way, we will not give something away which we might have been able, with foresight, to retain as a public asset.  That is the logic of what I am proposing.<\/p>  <p>  However, we will support the amendment.  Given that the scheme has now been announced and agreed at Cabinet, I do not know if the scheme has any legal standing beyond the fact that the Parliament will make its own voice heard on this issue.  The scheme will proceed as agreed by the Government in the final analysis.  Nonetheless, there is an opportunity to have a more detailed discussion about the KPMG aspect, and the full concession model versus the gap-funding model. <\/p><p>I would like us to have that discussion in a more detailed forum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600046#NNN00300","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467818400,"counter":477,"content":"<p>The next speaking slot is being shared by Deputies Mick Barry and Br&iacute;d Smith.

We have some of the worst served regions of Europe in terms of broadband service and we rank 42nd in the world in terms of high speed Internet access, despite having the second highest customer costs in the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  The Government attempts to portray Ireland on the international stage as a modern country that is open for business to all types of multinational companies while in reality in many respects Ireland is in the dark ages.  Some 1,300 primary schools, 600 business parks and 40% of our population, mostly in rural areas, cannot access decent high speed broadband.  This is a major issue, estimated to cost 10,000 jobs annually to rural communities.  There are some parts of the country that have yet to get broadband while in cities and urban areas commercial operators can offer very high speed broadband because it is profitable for them to do so.<\/p>  <p>  In 1999 the State sold-off and privatised Eircom, thereby taking away the ability of the State to intervene and build the necessary infrastructure to ensure we have a modern telecommunications and broadband system.  Deputy Dooley's statement earlier in this debate that there was consensus in this House in 1999 on the privatisation of Eircom is not correct.  There was consensus between Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il but other Members of the House spoke out against it.  Former Socialist Party member, Joe Higgins, warned that the privatisation of Eircom would be a disaster for all concerned and it was for the almost 600,000 ordinary shareholders who were burned, the workers whose jobs, wages and conditions were slashed and the public whose services, including broadband, declined.  The only people for whom it was not a disaster were vulture funds such as Valentia and the employee share ownership trust which asset stripped the company to the bone and sold off Eircell.  They walked off with huge sums of money of which they reinvested hardly a cent, leaving the company with huge debts.  The State then had to step in and invest in different programmes to make up for the lack of private sector investment.  Our disastrous broadband system is the price we are paying for that decision.  It is a bit like the man who because he is depressed takes a drink only to end up even more depressed as a result of the drink.  The State has privatised the service, the situation has worsened and the Government is using that situation to excuse further privatisation.<\/p>  <p>  At the time of its privatisation Eircom had assets worth &euro;8.5 billion.  It was a leader in technology, it was innovative and it was investing.  Had it been maintained it would have invested in and delivered broadband throughout the country as a State-owned company not operating on a for-profit basis.  That is how we electrified rural Ireland through the ESB in decades past.  The State now has to intervene to provide high speed Internet connections for more than 900,000 people because the market and the private sector has failed.  Privatisation and the private sector, as we have seen from the privatisation of Eircom, fail to deliver basic services to people.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has announced plans to sell off and privatise infrastructure.  This will result in another handover of taxpayers' money to private profiteers.  We oppose the privatisation of this infrastructure.  It must be retained in public ownership.  The State should invest in and build the infrastructure directly rather than tender it out to private companies to build, run for 25 years and then own.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600047#OOO00300","speaker":"1281"},{"type":"speech","time":1467818400,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I want to speak to the Minister's announcement today rather than to the motion because the motion attempts to address the need for broadband but does not provide any detail on the model that its proposers claim would be best used.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has claimed with some justification that the national broadband plan is on a par with the electrification scheme which the State undertook in its early days.  It is odd then that while acknowledging the importance of the broadband infrastructure to the State, he simultaneously announced that the State proposes to hand it over in the future to private company ownership.  If back in the day Deputy Naughten had been Minister and what is proposed in respect of this so-called commercial stimulus model or the privatisation plan had been done with the electrification scheme, citizens at whom this motion is directed, namely, citizens living in rural Ireland, would still be reading by candlelight and this Chamber would probably be using candlelight to illuminate our discussions.<\/p>  <p>  We need to dismantle the myths that surround the Minister's announcement in regard to privatisation of this crucial State asset.  The Minister has told us that the cost of the infrastructure will be cheaper and that the money saved will be used to invest in climate change, housing and other great projects, with initial investment estimated to be between &euro;500 million to &euro;600 million.  We need to know in what areas the remainder of the money will be invested.  We know from experience that this is nonsense.  As in the case of past privatisations, public private partnerships have always cost the State more money in terms of the service delivered and the longer-term costs to the taxpayer and the Exchequer.  There will be no saving.  Instead, the State is guaranteeing the future profits of the private company that wins the bid.  This deal, unlike some of the worst done in the past, is extraordinary in that the State will never own the asset.  Under some public private partnerships we aspire to own the asset, as in the case of the M50 toll plaza or the numerous development projects that went belly up, such as O'Devaney Gardens and St. Michael's Estate.  We still do not fully own the National Convention Centre and we are paying massive rent on it.  All public private partnership projects end up costing us more in the long term.  The expertise and privatisation of the State sector is essential to the infrastructure of this project.  As such, the State must contribute a large amount towards it.<\/p>  <p>  There has been much talk about the need for proper broadband provision over the next 20 years.  I was delighted to hear Fianna F&aacute;il call for the nationalisation of the infrastructure.  However, as stated by a previous speaker, the current problem was caused by Fianna F&aacute;il's decision to privatise Eircom which resulted in no investment in the national broadband plan and our infrastructure lagging behind that of most countries.  Instead of investment in growth by a nationally owned and controlled telecommunications company, Eircom, as famously described by Fintan O'Toole, was passed around various vulture and equity funds like a joint at a student party, loading debt after debt on the company, thus ensuring it did not invest in the manner necessary.<\/p>  <p>  I support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  I reject the idea that the Minister came up with today, namely, that we sell-off and privatise this essential State asset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016070600047#OOO00400","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1467818400,"counter":480,"content":"<p>The next speaking slot is being shared by Deputies Thomas Pringle, Maureen O'Sullivan and Clare Daly.

I agree with other Members that that decision is, unfortunately, the wrong decision.  In terms of the history of privatisation in this State, including the disastrous privatisation of Eircom and what it has meant for broadband provision throughout this State, this decision will go down as having been a very bad one.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's e-mail to Members yesterday outlining the Government decision refers to the stimulus model and the full concession model, both of which are financed, designed and built by the private sector.  It is the State and not the private sector that finances both models.  The issue that arises is whether at the end of the contract period the State has an asset or not.  Based on the decision made yesterday, the State will have no asset at the end of this process.  What the national broadband plan should do is provide a future-proofed infrastructure for the country and the nation, but we are going to give that away and we are going to pay the private sector to take it from us.  That is what is wrong with this decision.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister referred in his contribution to a notional benefit to the State owning the asset.  However, in his communication to Members yesterday he stated that he recognised the potential long-term value in the State owning the network.
