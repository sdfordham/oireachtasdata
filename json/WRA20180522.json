There are many, many people in the school system with very good ideas.  The introduction of the School Excellence Fund will enable them and their schools to adopt more creative and innovative practices which will support improved outcomes for students in our schools. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of strands in the School Excellence Fund. There are approximately 265 schools involved in the Digital, STEM and DEIS strands of the School Excellence Fund.

For example, the closing date for participation in the Creative strand of the School Excellence Fund has just passed and the closing date for participation in the Step-up strand is fast approaching.  As these strands commence, additional schools will be involved in the project, while approximately forty further schools will participate in phase two of the DEIS strand. <\/p>  <p>  Participation in one of the strands of the School Excellence Fund will require schools and school leaders to collaborate, to network and to rise to the challenge of having the freedom to try things.

I will look to build on this investment in 2019 and beyond. <\/p><p>In January I published an independent review of the current allocation model for funding higher education which provides a roadmap for transitioning towards a reformed funding model that is more transparent, consistent across higher education institutions, incentivises actions in key strategic areas such as access to education, research and STEM provision, and supports improved accountability while also respecting institutional autonomy.<\/p><p>This comprehensive approach is being taken in order to contribute to the development of a long-term sustainable funding model for the sector.

I, together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, negotiated a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers.  The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver convergence of the pay scales at later points in the scale.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of these changes, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. <\/p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs and over 1,000 extra teachers.<\/p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010.  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently laid before the Oireachtas a report on the matter of the pay of new entrants to the public service.  The report assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that during the financial crisis there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).  Addressing any issues arising from changes which are not specifically detailed in the report would give rise to additional costs over and above the foregoing figures. <\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s report will inform discussion on remaining salary scale issues with the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 in accordance with the commitment in the Agreement to consider the issue of newly qualified pay.

Further talks began on the 27th of April with all public service unions in relation to new entrant pay.  Further engagement is being arranged for early June as the parties continue to work through the various aspects of this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200059#WRC05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":147,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200059#WRC05600"},{"type":"question","counter":148,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[22425\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200059#WRC05700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of applications for either new building or improvement works by schools (details supplied); the options being considered for the new school buildings; the timeframe for their delivery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1289","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":149,"content":"<p><b>Gaelscoil na gCeithre Maistr&iacute; <\/b><\/p><p>The major building project referred to by the Deputy is currently at Stage 1 of the Architectural Planning Process.<\/p><p>Stage 1 is the Preliminary Design Stage where the Design Team in conjunction with the school authorities, will analyse all the constraints of the site, develop a preferred design option and ensure that the preferred option is the best option for the delivery of the brief. <\/p><p>Once the Stage 1 submission has been received and reviewed by my Department a meeting will be arranged with the school authorities and its Design Team to review and progress the design proposals.<\/p><p>The project will be progressed through the normal stages of architectural planning and it will be a matter for the school and its design team to expedite the progression of the design through those stages.<\/p><p><b>St. Mary's National School, Stranorlar<\/b><\/p><p>The major building project referred to by the Deputy is at an advanced stage of architectural planning Stage 2b (Detailed Design), which includes the application for statutory approvals and the preparation of tender documents.

The new model differs significantly from the old Resource Allocation Model, as schools are now front-loaded with additional resources based on the profile of each individual school.  This means that the Department has allocated special education teaching support directly to schools to enable them to respond to pupil needs without having to wait for an assessment to allow them to apply for additional resources.  School can now respond to individual need in a flexible way and pupils do not have to have a psychological assessment or a diagnosis of a disability in order to access Special Education Teaching.  It also means that those with highest level of need can access the highest level of support within the school.  Medical or psychological assessments will still be used to assess a child&rsquo;s needs, or the nature of difficulties they may have. However, an assessment, or diagnosis, will no longer be needed to access additional teaching support in schools. <\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools.  This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.  I am not aware of any particular delays in the process.<\/p>  <p>  I would advise that if there are concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of any student these should be raised by the parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he\/she is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200059#WRC06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation Provision","counter":156,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200059#WRC06500"},{"type":"question","counter":157,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[22457\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200059#WRC06600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to provide additional secondary school places in south County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":158,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, I announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022).

Over the coming weeks, the Group will engage with relevant stakeholders, to inform the development of a framework for a new National Digital Strategy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200060#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":182,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200060#WRD02100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":181,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200060#WRD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":182,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[22137\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200060#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the breakdown of the training and development and incidental expenses incurred by his Department in the year ending 31 December 2017.","asker":"1347","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":183,"content":"<p>The total expenditure on training and development of civil servants and civilian employees of my Department in the year ending 31 December 2017 was &euro;238,539.16. <\/p><p>Incidental expenditure, such as individual travel and subsistence, is not collated centrally and is not  met from the training and development budget. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200060#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"question","counter":185,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[22153\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200060#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the breakdown of the travel and subsistence expenses incurred by his Department in the year ending 31 December 2017.","asker":"1347","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":186,"content":"<p>Total expenditure by my Department on travel and subsistence in 2017 was &euro;656,815.66.

This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage.  The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, each partner is treated for the purposes of income tax as a separate and unconnected individual. Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, tax credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.<\/p>  <p>  From a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners.  Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status.  It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting and it would be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.\u00a0 Furthermore, while there may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the partial transferability of the standard rate band and tax credits, their legal status as spouses \/ civil partners has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them.  To counter tax avoidance, numerous restrictive provisions regarding transactions between \"connected persons\" are contained in the various Tax Acts and the definition of \"connected persons\" extends to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners.  Such provisions could be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition.<\/p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage.  Any change\u00a0to the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200061#WRE04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living Wage","counter":259,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200061#WRE04100"},{"type":"question","counter":260,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[22116\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200061#WRE04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a policy in which all State-owned banks work towards paying all their workers a living wage will be committed to; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":261,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware Government policy on banking remuneration has remained unchanged since the financial crisis.

It is important that the right policies are in place to ensure a competitive but also a fair playing field.<\/p>  <p>  For that reason, I have initiated a review of bank remuneration policy so that I can determine whether or not the bank pay policy that is in place is fit for purpose.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to your question about a living wage, I have no role in setting\u00a0general pay levels for staff at the banks as these are commercial decisions for the institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200061#WRE04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200061#WRE04400"},{"type":"question","counter":263,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[22140\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200061#WRE04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the breakdown of the training and development and incidental expenses incurred by his Department in the year ending 31 December 2017.","asker":"1347","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":264,"content":"<p>The Department of Finance continues to invest in staff development in order to supplement the skills and qualifications of\u00a0the teams, through a combination of internal and external training, learning and development.<\/p>  <p>  The Department strives to improve learning and development in order to develop greater professional, technical, management and leadership skills.\u00a0 Using the Performance Management and Development System (PMDS), the Department reviews the staff's performance and endeavours to identify any skills requiring enhancement so as to ensure the Department's training resources meet\u00a0the business objectives.<\/p>  <p>  In striving to be 'the best we can be' the Department's Learning and Development Strategy 2014-2016 introduced the Department's model of learning which utilises the 70:20:10 approach.

As part of this exercise, they will outline what people need to do under a number of different circumstances depending on the length of time they intend being away from Ireland.<\/p><p>If a returning emigrant believes that they have received a high quote due to an insurance provider not accepting driving experience gained while abroad, they should contact the free Insurance Information Service operated by Insurance Ireland, which can be accessed at<i>feedback@insuranceireland.eu<\/i>or 01-6761820.<\/p><p>Ultimately, if a\u00a0returning emigrant is unable to secure a motor insurance quotation on the open market, they may be in a position to avail of the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA) process, and<i>declined@insuranceireland.eu<\/i>is the relevant e-mail address in this respect.<\/p><p>In relation to the implementation of Recommendation 6, Insurance Ireland submitted a report to the Department in December 2017.  This report confirmed that Insurance Ireland members have agreed to publish the wording of the agreed protocol on their company websites and any other forms of social media, in addition to providing training for staff who can work through issues with emigrants before they leave, whilst they are out of the country and when they return to Ireland.  The stated intention is &ldquo;to resolve any issues well before they arise and for the consumer to be aware of the considerations when moving abroad&rdquo;.  The wording of the agreed protocol is also available on the Insurance Ireland website.<\/p><p>The Insurance Ireland report also outlined some sample cases which demonstrate how the rolling-out of the protocol has led to disputed cases being resolved to the benefit of returning emigrants, and provided figures indicating that the number of such cases being processed under the DCA is decreasing.<\/p><p>In conclusion, my Department is satisfied that the essence of the recommendation is being fulfilled without a need for legislation to underpin it.  Moreover, I would be very cautious about going down such a route as in my role as Minister for Finance I cannot interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.<\/p><p>You should note however that I will continue to monitor the implementation of this recommendation through my Department&rsquo;s regular engagement with Insurance Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200062#WRF03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":298,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[22344\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200062#WRF03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether policyholders should be informed of a claim made against them once that complaint has been lodged; his further views on whether recommendation No. 8 of the report on the cost of motor insurance can be legislated for; when he expects this recommendation to be completed in full; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":299,"content":"<p>As the Deputy\u00a0will recall, Recommendation 8 from the\u00a0Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance\u00a0requires that a protocol be put in place around the requirement for insurance providers to notify a policyholder of claims made against them.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, I believe policyholders should of course be informed of a claim as soon as possible after it has been lodged.

It did however recognise that this sector serves a social as well as an economic purpose, particularly in rural areas where public transport is less readily available.  This position was acknowledged by the inclusion of Recommendation 10 in the Report of the Cost of Insurance Working Group on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  This recommended that the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles should enter regular discussions with Insurance Ireland to explore solutions for drivers in the sector.<\/p><p>The Working Group&rsquo;s Fifth Quarterly Progress Update was published on 11 May 2018:<i>.<\/i>That Report outlines the implementation of this recommendation.<\/p><p>In summary, Insurance Ireland met with the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles, commonly known as the Taxi Advisory Committee (TAC), on 22 May 2017.  The TAC submitted the required report in relation to this meeting on 21 June 2017 to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  To date, no further meetings have taken place between the TAC and Insurance Ireland.  However, the TAC has advised my officials that it is keeping itself informed of developments in the area, particularly through the industry representatives on the Committee, and future meetings with Insurance Ireland are a part of the TAC strategy.  Recommendation 10 has been completed in the sense that the TAC has reported to the Minister for Transport.  Notwithstanding this, my view would be that work needs to continue on this general issue.\u00a0 Therefore, I look forward to further engagements between the TAC and the insurance industry.<\/p><p>I would add that, notwithstanding the role of the TAC, the issues raised by the taxi sector were in the main similar to those affecting consumers generally, notwithstanding that there are risks that are specific to the sector.  While there is no silver bullet to reduce the cost of insurance, I believe that cooperation and commitment between all parties can deliver fairer premiums for consumers, including taxi drivers.  I note that the most recent CSO data (for April 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 19% since peaking in July 2016.  While these statistics are not directly relevant to commercial vehicles, I do believe they signal greater stability in pricing on an overall basis and I am hopeful that the general downward direction in pricing will continue.<\/p><p>I also believe that the work of the Cost of Insurance Group should better facilitate potential new entrants to the market.  In this regard, I have been informed by my officials that Insurance Ireland has stated that there has been some increase in market capacity in relation to the provision of motor insurance for taxi drivers recently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200062#WRF03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":304,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[22346\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200062#WRF04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is satisfied that recommendation No. 12 of the report on the cost of motor insurance has been completed; if his Department will use and report on data obtained independently of an organisation (details supplied); if independent analysts have been engaged on behalf of his Department rather than on behalf of the organisation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":305,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Minister of State, with special responsibility for Financial Services and Insurance, Michael D'Arcy T.D., published the second Motor Insurance Key Information Report of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (the Working Group) on 11 May 2018.  The Report is the second in a series of reports designed to address Recommendation 12 of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, which aim to increase the level of transparency of the insurance sector in advance of the National Claims Information Database.  The Report follows up on the first report, published in July 2017.  It is likely that there will be at least one further report prior to the establishment of the National Claims Information Database.<\/p>  <p>  By way of additional information on the production of these reports, a Sub-group of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, chaired by the Department of Finance, was established in January 2017 to implement this and other recommendations to improve data transparency.  The Sub-group engaged extensively with Insurance Ireland who indicated that a number of the metrics identified in the Working Group&rsquo;s Report were not available in a consistent fashion due to different definitions and different ways for reporting and recording data.  Notwithstanding this, a data set was agreed and a data request was issued to Insurance Ireland in March 2017.<\/p>  <p>  This request sought information in two tranches.  The first tranche was received on 13 June 2017 and resulted in the publication of the first Motor Insurance Key Information Report in July 2017.  In line with the complexity of the additional data being requested in the second tranche, it was agreed that Insurance Ireland would engage independent consultants - Verisk - to collect and compile the data in the case of this more complex data set.  On 18 December 2017, a return, in the form of a report by Verisk outlining certain data and conclusions, was submitted to the Department by Insurance Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently, the Department and the Sub-group engaged with Insurance Ireland seeking some clarifications in relation to how the data and the conclusions presented were arrived at.<\/p>  <p>  The Department, while accepting that the process to collate the data was rigorous, emphasises that any conclusions reached on the data are Verisk&rsquo;s and have not been subject to any further actuarial analysis by it or the Central Bank, other than for clarifications.  This is because, from a practical and cost perspective, the subgroup saw little to be gained from procuring a further independent actuarial analysis to verify the return, where it was satisfied that a robust process was evidenced by the detailed approach to the gathering of this data by Verisk.  In addition, it should be noted that over the course of its work, the Sub-group took the view that the production of reports on a quarterly basis was not realistic in view of the complexity of the data exercise.<\/p>  <p>  To conclude, while the recommendation is seen primarily as an interim step that increases the level of transparency in advance of the establishment of the National Claims Information Database, I believe that the series of reports are an important foundation stone as they have helped prepare industry for the new database.  In addition, in view of the challenges in collating and analysing aggregate level data across the insurance sector in Ireland, this exercise strongly demonstrates the value and need for the National Claims Information Database.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200062#WRF04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":307,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[22347\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200062#WRF04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when he expects recommendation No. 13 of the report on the cost of motor insurance to be completed; if he is satisfied that a claim-by-claim register can be set up; if the data sub-group has addressed the cost implications to the State, the potential barriers to entry issues and the data protection issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":308,"content":"<p>Recommendation 13 of the Cost of Insurance Working Group recommended that the Department of Finance consider the feasibility of a longer term insurance claim-by-claim register.

The rules apply the arm&rsquo;s length principle to trading transactions between companies within a multinational group.  The arm&rsquo;s length principle is the international transfer pricing standard that OECD member countries have agreed should be used for tax purposes by multinational groups and tax administrations. For Irish tax purposes, &lsquo;arm&rsquo;s length&rsquo; is to be construed as far as practicable in accordance with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (July 2010).<\/p>  <p>  Under the arm&rsquo;s length principle, the amount charged by one related party to another for a product or service must be the same as would be charged between unrelated parties.  If, for example, an expense incurred by an Irish subsidiary company of a multinational group \u00a0in dealings with a foreign member of that group is greater than the arm&rsquo;s length price, or receipts are less than the arm&rsquo;s length amount, the company&rsquo;s profits will be understated for Irish tax purposes.  The transfer pricing rules require this understatement of profits to be reversed so that the full arm&rsquo;s length profits will be taxed.<\/p>  <p>  The transfer pricing rules apply to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011 in relation to arrangements the terms of which were agreed on or after 1 July 2010.  The rules do not apply to Small or Medium Enterprises (&ldquo;SMEs&rdquo;), being enterprises that, on a group basis, have less than 250 employees and either a turnover of less than &euro;50m or assets of less than &euro;43m. SMEs are however subject to general tax principles which can also operate to guard against abusive transfer pricing practices.<\/p>  <p>  Companies are required to have documentation available for inspection by Revenue in relation to their transfer pricing policies in order to demonstrate compliance with the legislation. Revenue carries out risk-based transfer pricing compliance interventions.<\/p>  <p>  In his Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Code, Mr. Seamus Coffey made a number of recommendations in relation to the Irish tax code, including the following recommendations in relation to transfer pricing:<\/p>  <p>1. Irish legislation should provide for the application of the 2017 update of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, incorporating Actions 8, 9 and 10 from the OECD&rsquo;s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (&ldquo;BEPS&rdquo;) project.<\/p>  <p>2. Transfer pricing legislation should be applied to arrangements the terms of which were agreed before 1 July 2010.<\/p>  <p>3. Consideration should be given to extending transfer pricing rules to SMEs and also to non-trading and capital transactions.<\/p>  <p>4. In order to ensure implementation of BEPS Action 13 (Transfer Pricing Documentation and Country-by-Country Reporting), there should be a specific obligation on Irish taxpayers who are subject to domestic transfer pricing legislation to have available the transfer pricing documentation outlined in the OECD 2017 Transfer Pricing Guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  In his review, Mr. Coffey recommended that if it is decided to implement any or all of these recommendations, this should take place no later than end-2020, being the year to which the OECD and G20 have agreed to extend their cooperation on BEPS.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Coffey also recommended that, in order to ensure certainty of our regime, there should be detailed consultation with relevant stakeholders in relation to his recommendations.\u00a0 Therefore, in October 2017, I launched a public consultation on the implementation of the Coffey recommendations.\u00a0 The consultation ran up to 30 January 2018 and over 20 submissions were received, many of which were detailed technical submissions.\u00a0 My Department is currently reviewing the responses received and these will inform my decisions on the development of future legislative change in the area of transfer pricing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200063#WRG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Data","counter":343,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200063#WRG02300"},{"type":"question","counter":344,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[22595\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200063#WRG02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the most recent, actual or estimated\u00a0average and total cost of whiplash claims; the most recent, actual or estimated typical premiums for\u00a0drivers by age in particular for young drivers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":345,"content":"<p>At the outset, it is important to understand that as Minister for Finance, my Department does not collect the information that the Deputy is seeking.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The only general guidance available on award levels for whiplash injuries is the Book of Quantum.  In that Book, the most common type of neck injury is called a &ldquo;whiplash&rdquo; injury which is described as an over extension or sprain often suffered in a motor vehicle accident or high impact slip\/trip\/fall type of accidents. \u00a0It states that whiplash injuries can involve a very minor sprain that heals within days or weeks or they can in extreme cases cause long lasting pain and permanent disability. \u00a0It is therefore difficult to provide an average cost for such types of injuries as there is such a range of injuries linked to &ldquo;whiplash&rdquo;.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In this respect, the Book of Quantum differentiates between the awards that may be considered for such injuries, ranging from &euro;15,700 to &euro;77,900.\u00a0 While the recently published Second Motor Key Information Report provides average costs for lower value or capped motor third party injury claims, it does not provide specific values with regard to whiplash claims.\u00a0 Costs associated with whiplash claims may form a part of these claims costs, however I would not interpret the data within the report in such a way to state that the values represent the average cost for &ldquo;whiplash&rdquo;

This process, as agreed, will build upon the current structures and will involve the establishment of a number of sub-groups under the aegis of the LEEF.

This includes significant change with respect to the design and management of education programmes in the area of social care practice.  This is necessary if such programmes are to achieve recognition from CORU, the statutory regulatory agency concerned, for listing under the Approved Qualifications Bye-Law.  This recognition will be essential if programme graduates are to be eligible to apply for entry onto the Social Care Workers Register as professional practitioners, which is a key objective for any such programme.  Social care practice programmes are in the process of being redesigned to meet the new CORU criteria, a process expected to be complete in the autumn. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Students are required to achieve certain learning proficiencies at each stage of their programme.  This includes a requirement for a minimum of 800 hours of practice placement divided over 2 or more blocks demonstrating that the proficiencies have been met and supervised by a qualified Social Care Worker Registered with CORU.  Programmes as currently constructed, cannot accommodate this large volume of hours within a single academic year.  Because of this, a student completing a 2 year programme with one provider and seeking advanced level entry to year 3 of a higher level programme with another provider, must be able to demonstrate that they have successfully completed substantial placement hours that comply with the standards established by CORU.  Their initial programme of study will also need to be consistent with CORU criteria.  These criteria will come into effect from September 2019.<\/p>  <p>  As this new landscape develops, the third level institution will\u00a0continue to work with\u00a0the college\u00a0to devise appropriate pathways for their HND students to progress onto higher-level programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200064#WRH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Oideachas Riachtanas Speisialta","counter":413,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200064#WRH03500"},{"type":"question","counter":414,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[22045\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200064#WRH03600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad den 19 dteiripeoir urlabhra agus teanga agus den 12 theiripeoir saothair at&aacute; le fost&uacute; sa sc&eacute;im ph&iacute;ol&oacute;tach a f&oacute;gra&iacute;odh an 14 Bealtaine a mbeidh s&eacute; riachtanach go mbeidh siad in ann feidhmi&uacute; tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge; agus an bhf&eacute;adfadh an tAire a chur in i&uacute;l c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad scoil agus r&eacute;amhscoil a fheidhm&iacute;onn tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge at&aacute; san &aacute;ireamh sa 150 scoil agus r&eacute;amhscoil roghnaithe le bheith mar chuid den sc&eacute;im; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1225","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":415,"content":"<p>D&rsquo;fh&oacute;gair m&eacute; le gairid go dtabharfar isteach tionscadal l&eacute;irithe chun seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; teiripe r&eacute;amhscola&iacute;ochta a shol&aacute;thar don scoilbhliain 2018\/19.<\/p><p>An Chomhairle N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta um Oideachas Speisialta a dh&eacute;anfaidh bainisti&uacute; agus comhord&uacute; ar an tionscadal. <\/p><p>Is iad na Ranna Oideachais, Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Leana&iacute; agus &Oacute;ige, Sl&aacute;inte agus Feidhmeannacht na Seirbh&iacute;se Sl&aacute;inte a d&rsquo;fhorbair an tsamhail, agus t&aacute; s&eacute; mar chuid d&rsquo;aidhm fhorioml&aacute;n an rialtais cuidi&uacute; le gach leanbh barrchumas a bhaint amach. \u00a0<\/p><p>Is &eacute; cusp&oacute;ir an tionscadail seo n&aacute; t&aacute;st&aacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh ar thaca&iacute; teiripeacha saincheaptha tr&iacute;nar f&eacute;idir idirghabh&aacute;il luath a dh&eacute;anamh maidir le teiripe cainte, teanga agus teiripe shaothair a shol&aacute;thar laistigh de &lsquo;chomth&eacute;acsanna oideachais&rsquo;.\u00a0Comhl&aacute;n&oacute;idh an cl&aacute;r p&iacute;ol&oacute;ltach nu&aacute;la&iacute;och seo sol&aacute;thar reatha maoinithe FSS ar sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; riachtanacha teiripe.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Glacfaidh 75 scoil, lena n-&aacute;ir&iacute;tear sampla ionada&iacute;och de bhunscoileanna, d&rsquo;iarbhunscoileanna agus de scoileanna riachtanais speisialta p&aacute;irt sa tionscadal.

All ESF activities, including YEI activities, are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer with the EU (ESF\/YEI) funding being claimed in arrears.  <\/p><p>The ESF authorities must be designated in accordance with the EU regulations prior to making the first payment application.  This designation is based on the opinion of the Independent Audit Body (IAB) which must be satisfied across a range of criteria that systems are in place to allow the ESF authorities to perform their required functions.  These systems requirements include the provision of a computerised accounting and information system for EU funds to meet the 2014-2020 functionality requirements.  The final phase of the IT system went live at the end of March 2018.  The ESF authorities are engaging with the IAB and it is expected that designation will be completed in the coming weeks.  <\/p><p>Preparations are underway for the submission of a first payment application to the Commission in Q3 2018. The European Commission has advised that the potential decommitment at end 2018 is &euro;127.7m, if not claimed in payment applications in the meantime.  The ESF authorities will ensure that sufficient payment applications are submitted to fully drawdown the EU funding allocations.<\/p><p>While no payment application has been made in respect of the YEI, in accordance with the ESF Regulations initial pre-financing of 3.5% and annual pre-financing for 2016 and 2017, of the EU support for the YEI priority axis, including the ESF matching financing, amounting to some &euro;8.3m has been received to date.  Separately, additional initial YEI pre-financing of &euro;19.8m was also received in line with EU Regulation 799 of 2015 but was subsequently reimbursed as Ireland did not submit an interim payment application by May 2016 for at least 50% of the amount advanced.  The reimbursement of this amount has not resulted in any loss of EU monies to the Exchequer.  <\/p><p>The ESF Managing Authority and the Operational Programme Monitoring Committee (PMC) maintain an ongoing overview of the funding allocations under the PEIL and re-allocate the available funding as required, in accordance with the EU Regulatory provisions.  <\/p><p>Seven activities were originally selected for YEI funding namely, the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA); JobBridge; JobsPlus; Momentum; Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP); T&uacute;s; and Youthreach. Improvements in the rate of youth unemployment coupled with the discontinuance of the JobBridge and Momentum schemes, had consequences for the expenditure expected on YEI activities.  Consequently, the PMC agreed to the inclusion of the Community Training Centres; the Defence Forces Employment Support Scheme (DFESS) and the planned Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) under the YEI.  The PMC agreed to the removal of the T&uacute;s, JobBridge and SICAP from the YEI, having unsuccessfully explored the potential to use Simplified Cost Option models and\/or in the light of audit trail difficulties.

The focus of the Department&rsquo;s Policy will be on strengthening Irish-medium education in existing schools in a manner that will provide for the differing and distinctive needs of both native speakers and learners of Irish.  The Policy also supports the implementation of immersion education (tumoideachas).<\/p><p>Circulars 0034\/2017 and 0022\/2018 set out the process involved in the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme<i><\/i>for post-primary schools in the Gaeltacht.  These schools were invited to express an interest in the Scheme and were required to involve the school community in the decision-making process involved.  27 of the possible 28 post-primary schools located in Gaeltacht language-planning areas have expressed an interest in the Scheme to date.  A further opportunity has been provided to any remaining school in the Gaeltacht to participate in the Scheme, following consultation with their school community, so that the school can access the additional supports available to strengthen the quality of Irish-medium education. <\/p><p>The criteria for recognition as a Gaeltacht School includes a requirement for schools to develop a whole-school action plan for improvement to set out how the school will, on a phased basis, to take steps necessary to ensure the use of Irish as the language of communication, instruction and socialisation within the school.  The school is also required to promote the benefits of learning Irish and learning through Irish to the school community.  The specific content of these plans is a matter for each individual school to consider as it applies to its own unique sociolinguistic context and school community.<\/p><p>In the case of schools not opting to participate in the Scheme, such schools will continue to access the supports that are available for other English-medium schools with similar enrolments.  The supports provided under the Gaeltacht Schools Recognition Scheme and the Policy on Gaeltacht Education are additional to this. <\/p><p>Parallel provision of Irish-medium and English-medium educational provision is already available in some Gaeltacht areas, particularly those that are immediately adjacent to areas not designated as within the boundaries of the Gaeltacht.

Typically, a two classroom unit is provided in new primary schools and a two or four classroom unit is provided in new post primary schools.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of existing schools, where a school is not in a position to accommodate a special class within its existing accommodation, it is open to the school to submit an application to the Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class or to construct additional accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200066#WRK04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Recruitment","counter":535,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200066#WRK04900"},{"type":"question","counter":536,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[22665\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200066#WRK05000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which class sizes and pupil-teacher ratios are likely to improve over the next year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":537,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[22680\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200066#WRK05100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which the number of extra teachers likely to become available at primary and second level in 2018 will beneficially impact on pupil-teacher ratios throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":538,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 and 245 together.<\/p><p>Budget 2018 marks the second year of major reinvestment in the education sector, as we continue to implement the Action Plan for Education, which has the central aim to make the Irish Education and training service the best in Europe within a decade. <\/p><p>Budget 2018 provides for an additional 1280 teaching posts in the 2018\/19 school year.

We start from a strong base in the school sector: standards in literacy and numeracy have risen over the lifetime of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy and the performance of our students on international assessments of reading, Mathematics and Science is strong at primary and post-primary levels.<\/p>  <p>Despite these excellent results, there remain some challenges to achieving the vision in the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019 to provide the best education and training system in Europe.  These include:<\/p>  <p>   - Improving numeracy outcomes for all students<\/p>  <p>   - Tackling educational disadvantage<\/p>  <p>   - Enabling higher-achieving students to reach their full potential<\/p>  <p>   - Embedding achievements gained in literacy, with a particular focus on literacy for and through the Irish language and digital literacy.<\/p>  <p>  Progress towards meeting those challenges is already underway and specific, measureable, actions are set out in the Department&rsquo;s Action Plan for Education 2018.  I don&rsquo;t underestimate these challenges but remain confident that they will be met through the commitment and effort of Early Years practitioners, teachers and school leaders, parents and staff in support services of various types, teacher educators, and a range of other bodies, agencies and organisations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In relation to higher education, Ireland is in the top 5 positions in Europe in terms of participation and in the top 10 positions in terms of educational attainment.  The participation rate of 18-20 year olds in higher education has grown from 20% in 1980 to a current level of 58%.  Ireland has one of the highest rates of 30-34 year olds with higher education attainment in the OECD with over half of 25-34 year olds having completed higher education.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016\/17 there were 43,569 new full-time undergraduate entrants into higher education.  This represents a 10% increase in the last 5 years.  79% of new entrants went into an Honours Bachelor Degree programme.  In total there are 225,628 students enrolled in higher education in Ireland.  Over 6% of the country&rsquo;s adult population is now enrolled in a higher education programme.  The latest HEA report &ldquo;A study of progression in Irish HE 2014\/15 to 2015\/16&rdquo; indicates that 86% of first year students progressed to their second year.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of investment, Budget 2018 saw investment in higher and further education increasing &euro;100 million above 2016 levels.  This will allow for an additional 2,100 student places to be provided this year.  There is also a significant ramping up of Government investment on the capital side of the higher education sector and over a 10 year period, investment of some &euro;2.2 billion is envisaged.<\/p>  <p>  The focus of the Action Plan for Education 2018 is on excellence and innovation.  In the higher education sector there is a new Systems Performance Framework and new funding arrangements are being put in place.  These will see more funding for STEM courses, the introduction of an Innovation Fund and a performance fund to reward institutions who excel in particular areas, as well as new funding streams for research and incentivised life-long, part-time and flexible learning opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  The Further Education and Training (FET) sector has undergone transformational reform in recent years bringing together Further Education and Training as a single sector to firmly establish it as the fourth pillar of the national education system.  The Further Education and Training Strategy 2014-2019   sets out a vision to transform the sector to deliver a world-class integrated system of further education and training that will support economic development, increase social inclusion and to meet the needs of all who engage with FET.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Technological Universities Act 2018 was signed into law on 19 March 2018.  This is a sea-change in the higher education landscape and provides the legal framework for the establishment of a new type of higher education institution, building on the strengths of individual institutions\u00a0but achieving a greater critical mass and scale.  Technological universities will provide an opportunity to drive regional development and provide more opportunities for students, staff, enterprise and local and regional communities.  They will have a significant reach, impact and influence regionally, nationally and internationally.  Already the first application for TU designation was made last month by DIT, IT Blanchardstown and IT Tallaght and three other consortia, comprising 7 IoTs, are working towards making applications.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has a strong track record, too, in research and innovation, and Irish researchers have been very successful under Horizon 2020&rsquo;s highly competitive international funding stream.  Under Horizon 2020, to January 2018 Irish researchers had secured funding to the value of &euro;513 million, of which nearly 53%\u00a0was won by higher education institutions.  In 2016, we achieved a world ranking of 10th for the overall quality of our scientific research, an increase of 26 places in only 13 years; and we also made significant improvements in our global rankings for individual subjects, for example, we are 2nd in the world for nanotechnology, Animal and Dairy, and Immunology; 3rd for Material Sciences and Agricultural Sciences; and 4th for Mathematics.  In 2016\/17 there were 7,962 full time enrolments in postgraduate research.  Total full time enrolment in postgraduate programmes has increased from 21,780 in 2012\/13 to 23,092 in 2016\/17.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200066#WRK05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Patronage","counter":543,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200067#WRL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":544,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[22667\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200067#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which minority religious schools continue to be facilitated arising from recent agreement on the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":545,"content":"<p>The objective of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 is to make it easier for parents to access their local schools and to enrol their children in a school that meets their needs.<\/p>  <p>  Report Stage for the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 is scheduled to commence on 29 May 2018. \u00a0I will be bringing forward an amendment on this date that\u00a0will remove religion as a criterion which can be used in school admissions. <\/p>  <p>  It is not fair that publicly funded schools which amount to 95% of primary schools can admit children of their own religion who might live some distance away ahead of children of a different religion or no religion who live close to the school.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The amendment will also provide protections to ensure that children of minority religions can continue to access primary schools of their ethos. <\/p>  <p>  The amendment will also involve amending the Equal Status Act 2000 to provide that a recognised primary school does not, however, discriminate where it admits as a priority a student from a minority religion who is seeking admission to a school that provides religious instruction or religious education consistent with the religious beliefs of the student concerned or a religion similar to that of the student concerned.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment will allow a student from a minority religion to seek admission to a recognised primary school that runs a religious instruction or religious education programme that is the same or similar to the religious ethos of the student concerned.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The amendments were published on 9 May 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Minority religious communities because of their small size within the overall population, could find it extremely difficult to access schools of their own religious ethos.

Moreover, my Department continues to discuss these matters and those recommendations arising in appropriate detail and directly with the membership of the Working Group which also includes the Department of Finance, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Central Bank of Ireland, the State Claims Agency and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.<\/p>  <p>  In replying to the series of Questions from Deputy McGrath, I would like to take this opportunity to point out that the Department of Finance produces regular quarterly updates on the progress of the main Report of the Working Group on the Cost of Insurance by reference to the specific recommendations made including those which fall to my Department. The most recent of these, publicly available on the website of the Department of Finance, is the Fifth Quarterly Progress Update which was published on 11 May 2018.  This latest update also includes details of the implementation of the Action Plan of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public liability Insurance published by the Working Group in January 2018. In replying to each of the recommendations that have been raised by Deputy McGrath I will, therefore, be reflecting the content of the Fifth Quarterly Progress Update as it relates to my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 16 of the Motor Report seeks to ascertain and set out the measures necessary to implement pre-action protocols for personal injury cases.  Draft Heads have been prepared by my Department to provide for regulations on the use of such protocols. The draft Heads are being discussed further with the a view to their being agreed in this Quarter. It should also be remembered that their introduction is being informed by the development of such protocols for medical negligence cases under Part 15 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 for which I expect to issue the relevant regulations soon.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 22 of the Motor Report is to examine the impact of legal and other fees on personal injury awards.  While the review has been commenced, definitive conclusions from somewhat limited available data have been difficult to draw to date.  However, in the context of the set-up of the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators which is to replace that of the Taxing-Master under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, a new publicly accessible Register of Determinations is to be maintained which will provide enhanced data for such purposes.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 23 of the Motor Report is to review the impact of the changes to the court jurisdictional limits as they evolve.  The Courts Service has provided my Department a first provisional data set which is being analysed at present and matters are on track for a report to be submitted to the Working Group by the required deadline of Q2 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 24 of the Motor Report is to examine the setting of the discount rate in personal injury lump sum awards.  My Department is examining this issue in consultation with the Department of Finance and the State Claims Agency with whom it has also met specifically on this issue. As part of this work, account is being taken of recent Irish case law and of relevant developments in the United Kingdom and their potential applicability in an Irish context. The relevant findings will be brought soon for consideration by the Working Group.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 27 of the Motor Report is to review section 30 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 which provides that the Courts Service will establish and maintain a register of personal injuries actions.  While the development of the register has been progressed by the Courts Service there are some issues of a technical and data protection nature which have arisen and require further consideration.  The Courts Service may wish to propose amendments to section 30 and intends to report on these aspects in Q2 2018.  My Department will consider this report when it is received in consultation with the Working Group.<\/p>  <p>  My commitment and that of my Department to the Cost of Insurance Working Group is reflected in the fact that my Department and its relevant agencies have the lead in the implementation of 8 of the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and 9 of the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance. This commitment is also reflected in the continuing and active participation of officials of my Department in the deliberations of the Working Group and those of its Legal Sub-Group as well as in the work of the Personal Injuries Commission which has been set up on recommendation of the Working Group. We continue to work closely with Minister of State D'Arcy as Chair and with other members of the Working Group in support of insurance costs reform under this key Government initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200068#WRM00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Trafficking","counter":604,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200068#WRM00900"},{"type":"question","counter":605,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[22500\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200068#WRM01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his attention has been drawn to persons (details supplied) who were victims of human trafficking on Irish-flagged fishing vessels between January and April 2018.","asker":"1317","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":606,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that on Friday 13 April, 4 Ghanaian men who came to Ireland to work in the fishing industry entered the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) as potential victims of human trafficking.

The Group is made up of representatives from my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB), Insurance Ireland and the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland (MIBI). The Group has completed a report, which includes recommended parameters for the database, who will be responsible for administering the database and disseminating data and how the database will be funded.<\/p><p>The report of the Group was submitted to the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) and, in response, the ODPC has strongly endorsed the Group&rsquo;s view that detailed Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) will be required in order to justify the potential addition of new datasets to the existing Insurance Link database, and the increased sharing of data. The ODPC also recommends that further work needs to be undertaken to detail the evidential requirements for the creation of a new database or the enhancement of the existing Insurance Link database.<\/p><p>The application of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) later this week and the related data protection legislation, which I launched with Minister of State Breen in February this year, will have a significant impact on any new data sharing arrangements between industry members and between the industry and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. As such, the establishment of any new data sharing structures will require careful consideration against the impending changes to the legislative landscape.<\/p><p>As a starting point, it is necessary for a review to be undertaken by the insurance industry of the information held on Insurance Link in the context of the GDPR. It is also necessary for the industry to assess in more detail what specific additional data is proposed to be shared and in what additional circumstances such data is proposed to be shared. It is essential that a critical balance is identified to ensure that data sharing between insurers is maximised while, at the same time, the data rights of the public are protected.  Any changes, therefore, to the existing data-sharing arrangements for the purposes of Insurance Link must be proportional to their effect.<\/p><p>I am informed that Insurance Ireland expects to complete a detailed DPIA in this regard by the end of August 2018.<\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that, as further progress on Recommendation 25 will depend upon the outcome of this DPIA, it is not currently possible to provide a definitive timeframe for the establishment of the database.

Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly. <\/p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that on the 30 April 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was 13,632. There are also 562 Garda Reserves and more than 2,280 civilians attached to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 more Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years. This is an ambitious programme of accelerated recruitment. To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates a new recruitment drive was launched by the Commissioner last week with a closing date of 6 June. The competition is being undertaken by the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner and applications should be made to www.publicjobs.ie.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.

This is an ambitious programme of accelerated recruitment. To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates a new recruitment drive was launched by the Commissioner last week with a closing date of 6 June.

It consists of voluntary unpaid members, drawn from the community, to support the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, an allowance is payable to Reserve members who complete a minimum of 208 hours duty annually as a contribution towards expenses incurred in performing their duties. The allowance is currently set at &euro;1,000 per annum. Members of the Reserve are also reimbursed for expenses incurred while attending court in respect of their service in the Garda Reserve.  <\/p><p>The strength of the Reserve was 589 on 31 December 2017. I am informed that 205 members or 34.8% were paid the allowance in 2017.<\/p><p>The Deputy also asked a number of questions relating to the criteria applied by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for determining whether a crime should be recorded as a burglary as opposed to a criminal damage offence, whether both crimes are recorded on the PULSE system in circumstances in which criminal damage is committed in the course of a burglary, the checks in place to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are correctly classifying crimes recorded on the PULSE system and the process and policy in place for the re-characterisation of crimes already submitted in the PULSE system.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that reviewing and re-classification of incidents, both crime and non-crime, is routine.  Incidents recorded on PULSE are subject of review by supervisors, Performance and Accountability Framework (PAF) Administrators and District Officers, as well as staff at the Garda Information Service Centre (GISC) who are tasked with the recording of crime statistics. This is part of the normal process of regular review. <\/p><p>I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in determining whether a crime should be recorded as a burglary as opposed to criminal damage, provide that both incidents should be recorded on PULSE as both instances occurred during the same criminal incident.  Both incidents are grouped together and the most serious one is flagged for crime counting purposes in the official statistics.

Either parent of a child, whether or not he or she is also a guardian of the child, may apply to court for a direction regarding custody of, or access to, the child.  Section 11(5) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides that the court may, of its own motion or on application, give directions to procure a report from such person as it may nominate on any question affecting the welfare of the child. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Article 42A.4.1 of the Constitution requires that provision be made by law that in the resolution of all proceedings concerning the guardianship or custody of, or access to, any child, the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration.

Part V, entitled &ldquo;Best Interests of the Child&rdquo;, contains two important sections.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 31 sets out an extensive list of factors and circumstances to be taken into account by a court when determining the best interests of a child.  These include the views of the child that are ascertainable (whether in accordance with section 32 or otherwise). The court can ascertain the views of the child in person or through an expert.  Section 31(6) provides that in obtaining the ascertainable views of a child, the court shall facilitate the free expression by the child of those views and endeavour to ensure that any views expressed by the child are not expressed as a result of undue influence, and may make an order under section 32.<\/p>  <p>  Section 32 facilitates the hearing of the voice of the child by enabling the court to appoint an expert to determine and convey the child&rsquo;s views to the court, so that the child&rsquo;s voice can be heard in the proceedings.   <\/p>  <p>  These provisions allow the courts to take account of the evolving capacity of children and also give the courts the flexibility to ensure that all children&rsquo;s views can be heard.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.

The Group was formed in March 2016 and Membership of the Group includes the Restaurant Association of Ireland (RAI), the Irish Hotels Federation, the Irish Hospitality Institute, Licensed Vintners Association, Vintners Federation of Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Higher Education Authority, Skillnets, SOLAS, Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI),Technological Higher Education Association(THEA), Quality and Qualifications Ireland, Regional Skills Dublin and the Departments of\u00a0 Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Education and Skills and Employment and Social Protection.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Group is aware that the hospitality sector is very diverse with many different kinds of employers and occupations. As a result, different priorities and needs have emerged within the industry.\u00a0 While F&aacute;ilte Ireland has a defined role for the development of tourism enterprises, many of the constituent hospitality businesses fall outside of the tourism sector. Areas such as contract catering, institutional catering, artisan food production, delicatessens etc are all sources of employment for trained hospitality staff.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Group focused on the following priority areas between March 2016 and March 2018:<\/p><p><b>-Promoting careers in the hospitality industry<\/b><\/p><p>The hospitality sector has suffered from poor career perception in the past.\u00a0 Since the establishment of the Oversight Group in 2016, the IHF, IHI in partnership with FI came together and launched a National Tourism Careers Programme.\u00a0\u00a0The programme is being run in close collaboration with tourism and hospitality businesses and is designed to enable second-level students aged 15-18 to explore the full range of exciting career paths and educational and training options available all over the country.\u00a0 The Irish Hotels Federation&rsquo;s &ldquo;Get a Life in Tourism&rdquo; is an example of a positive response to the challenges of attracting new entrants to the industry.\u00a0 The Careers Roadshow undertaken by the IHF, IHI and Tralee demonstrates how effective collaboration can yield positive outcomes.\u00a0 Tourism Insight is another positive development resulting from collaboration between IHI, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, IHF, Tralee and regional skills fora.It is an interactive online programme for students and teachers featuring tutorials and videos, which can be delivered as part of class in school or for students to complete in their own time at home. The Transition Year programme was launched in September 2016.<\/p><p><b>-  Audits of hospitality-related courses and facilities in further and higher education<\/b><\/p><p>The Audit of Hospitality Courses in Further and Higher Education Report was published in November 2017. This report was commissioned by SOLAS and the HEA on behalf of the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group. It provides a high level of analysis of the data available that shows the alignment of skills provision against identified gaps in the hospitality sector. The HSOG is considering a proposal to carry out a pilot exercise into facilities and capabilities in specific geographical areas.\u00a0 The pilot project would look at a designated geographical area where a FE and HE institution exist and audit the equipment, space and downtime available.<\/p><p><b>-\u00a0\u00a0Development of apprenticeship and traineeship programmes<\/b><\/p><p>The Oversight Group sees apprenticeships as an alternative model of learning and an opportunity for certain cohorts of learners to start on the pathway of a career in a variety of sectors, including hospitality.\u00a0The Commis Chef Apprenticeship Programme was launched in January 2018 and will take place in the ETBs - led by Kerry ETB.\u00a0 The apprenticeship will involve two days in training and 3 days in work. This will lead to a Level 6 award and will take two years to complete.<\/p><p>In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was begun by SOLAS in collaboration with ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning. As of late 2017, eight hospitality programmes have been completed in 4 ETBs (Laois &amp;amp; Offaly ETB, Limerick &amp;amp; Clare ETB, Mayo, Sligo &amp;amp; Leitrim ETB and Cavan&amp;amp; Monaghan ETB). One programme is currently running in Louth &amp;amp; Meath ETB.\u00a0 5 programmes are currently planned for Limerick&amp;amp; Clare ETB, Kildare &amp;amp; Wicklow ETB, Kilkenny &amp;amp; Carlow ETB, Donegal ETB &amp;amp; Kerry ETB.<\/p><p>There is considerable scope within the Career Traineeships to provide a range of craft level skills training in supported employments. This model compares well against the much commented upon former CERT training model. The Group notes that early indicators are that the participating enterprises are very satisfied with the traineeship approach.<\/p><p><b>-  Launch of Skillnets for the hospitality industry<\/b><\/p><p>Skillnet Ireland is a national\u00a0body with responsibility for the promotion of enterprise-led training. It is funded through the National Training Fund by the Department of Education and Skills. The RAI-promoted Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet was formally launched by Minister Bruton in March 2017 to help drive employment growth, talent attraction and retention in the hospitality sector, with a particular focus on career progression for those at lower skilled levels. <\/p><p>Skillnet\u00a0Ireland has a rolling Expression of Interest process open to new applicants, and in April 2017 a second hospitality-sector network was approved, the Tourism &amp;amp; Food Skillnet. Promoted by Ballyhoura Development CLG, this network was developed to address the skills needs of tourism and food businesses in a rural catchment area in the south-west region. The training plan in year one comprises a mix of courses on digital marketing, business skills and sector -specific technical skills. As Skillnet Ireland continues to seek to develop new networks to expand its reach, the Expression of Interest process remains open to interested parties including the hospitality sector.<\/p><p>-<b>Connecting people with jobs through initiatives of the Department of Social Protection<\/b><\/p><p>As part of its role in providing supports and information to unemployed people, the Department of Employment and Social Protection (DEASP)\u00a0helps to match jobseekers with employers and vacancies, including in the hospitality sector. The jobsireland.ie website is the national job matching service run by the DEASP.\u00a0 Vacancies advertised on the Jobs Ireland website are also promoted through the EURES service to maximise awareness of the opportunities across Europe.\u00a0 A proposal regarding a recruitment campaign in Portugal was submitted for consideration by RAI and an invitation extended to participate in the European Online Job Fairs.\u00a0 Ongoing support for recruitment has been offered and availed of by employers in the hospitality sector.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200069#WRN04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":691,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200069#WRN04400"},{"type":"question","counter":692,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[22133\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200069#WRN04500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the breakdown of the training and development and incidental expenses incurred by her Department in the year ending 31 December 2017.","asker":"1347","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":693,"content":"<p>The total expenditure in Subhead Ad3 of the Department's Vote,\u00a0Learning and Development and Incidental Expenses,\u00a0amounted to &euro;1.05 million in 2017. <\/p><p>Learning and Development related expenditure last year amounted to &euro;399k and covered:<\/p><p>- The provision of over 230 training courses attended by 1,280 staff. <\/p><p>- Attendance at various seminars and conferences.<\/p><p>- Payment of fees for a range of third level courses undertaken in their own time by 43 staff of the Department.<\/p><p>The remaining &euro;653k expended covered a wide range of incidental expenses and primarily on items such as:\u00a0<\/p><p>- Health &amp;amp; Safety requirements and cleaning materials. <\/p><p>- Room Hire and related costs for hosting various meetings, conferences, seminars across the country.<\/p><p>- Translation &amp;amp; Interpreter Services.<\/p><p>- The Department&rsquo;s provision to the National Shared Services Office (NSSO) for centralised HR and Payroll services.<\/p><p>- Costs associated with Departmental staff seconded to foreign postings in Brussels, Geneva and London such as removal costs, rental costs and school fees. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200069#WRN04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":695,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[22149\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200069#WRN04800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the breakdown of the travel and subsistence expenses incurred by her Department in the year ending 31 December 2017.","asker":"1347","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":696,"content":"<p>A breakdown of the travel and subsistence incurred by my Department, for the year ending 31 December 2017, is detailed for the Deputy in the following table.

The construction sector SEO was the first Order\u00a0made under this legislation and came into effect in\u00a0October 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 provides for a new framework under which proposals for wage setting in particular sectors can be considered.  The 2015 legislation was in response to the striking down on constitutional grounds of the previous regime of Registered Employment Agreements. <\/p>  <p>  The 2015 Act allows for applications to be submitted\u00a0to the Labour Court either\u00a0separately or jointly by worker or employer bodies that are substantially representative in the sector concerned.  In the case of the construction sector SEO, the application was made to the Labour Court by an employer body.\u00a0 The Court undertook its examination of the application in line with the legislation and this included\u00a0a public consultation process\u00a0with\u00a0advertisements\u00a0in the national print media\u00a0seeking submissions to the application received by the Labour Court. <\/p>  <p>  I would stress that it is open in this process for any interested party to make a submission to the Labour Court. \u00a0Parties that make a submission to the Court are subsequently invited to a further oral hearing at the Labour Court.

The LEOs can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, public procurement and other regulations affecting business.<\/p><p>There are a range of supports available from the LEOs to assist start-ups.  The LEOs can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities.  These include feasibility grants (investigating the potential of a business idea) and priming grants (to part-fund a start-up).  In 2017,\u00a0almost &euro;6.5 million in priming grants was approved for\u00a0294 new LEO clients across the country.  It should be noted that the LEOs do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, construction\/local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses).<\/p><p>The LEOs attracted 1,471 applicants to the recent Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE) competition.

It helps students to grasp real life skills associated with running a real enterprise including working as part of a team, managing production and finances, organising a sales and marketing campaign and liaising directly with customers, judges and the media.  Over 22,000 second level students participate on the Programme each year.<\/p><p>The LEOs also run promotional events such as the National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day and the Local Enterprise Week, which are aimed at, <i>inter alia<\/i>, promoting the LEO services and encouraging people to start or grow a business.

Successful applicants can avail of a more favourable interest rate from MFI if they make their application through the LEO.<\/p><p>A range of supports have been developed to assist LEO clients facing the challenges posed by Brexit, but many of these are beneficial for all micro and small enterprises, particularly those who are seeking to grow their business or explore new markets.  These supports include: <\/p><p>- Information events around the country for core and non-core clients.  The objective of these sessions is to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit, and to engage in a process of strategic planning to ensure their companies have a robust strategy in place. <\/p><p>- The information sessions are supplemented by an online Brexit SME Scorecard that LEO clients can complete to self-assess their readiness for Brexit.  The Scorecard generates an immediate report which contains suggested actions and resources, and information on events for companies to attend, to prepare for Brexit.<\/p><p>- A key element of the range of LEO Brexit responses is a Lean4Micro programme, which was designed to encourage clients to adopt Lean business principles in their organisation to increase performance and competitiveness.  This programme is relevant to all micro and small businesses.<\/p><p>- Along with the core LEO priming and business development grants, the LEOs are now offering a Technical Assistance for Micro-exporters (TAME) grant, which is designed to help LEO clients to find new markets and exports by part-funding expenditure incurred investigating and researching export markets, e.g. exhibiting at Trade Fairs, preparing marketing material and developing websites specifically targeting export markets.<\/p><p>- The Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVs) is a grant scheme designed to assist micro businesses to establish or enhance their online presence, which can also aid the Brexit transition.\u00a0 It offers financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500 along with training, advice and mentoring to help businesses trade online. <\/p><p>- The LEO Mentor Programme is designed to match up the knowledge, skills, insights and entrepreneurial capability of experienced business practitioners with small business owners\/managers who need practical and strategic one-to-one advice and guidance.  Tailored mentoring is being rolled out to address Brexit-related business challenges.\u00a0 The LEOs also share the Enterprise Ireland Mentor platform for their clients, which provides expertise regarding export matters, including in relation to export finance.<\/p><p>- The LEO Innovation and Investment Fund (LIIF) programme is a new scheme to support innovation in micro-enterprises and get them investor ready to scale their businesses.

The Medical Council collects and analyses data from the general, specialist and trainee specialist registers to produce valuable data on the GP workforce. The HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service collects data on the number of GMS contract-holders and those GPs delivering state-funded primary care services. The Irish College of General Practitioners also collects and analyses data on the GP workforce, including the number of doctors registered for professional competence and those holding membership of the ICGP.<\/p>  <p>The number of doctors on the Medical Council&rsquo;s Specialist Register in General Practice has increased from 2,270 in 2010 to 3,668 as at 18  May 2018. Holding registration does not, however, necessarily mean that a medical practitioner is active in general practice at the time. <\/p>  <p>  Doctors on the Medical Council&rsquo;s General Register may practice\u00a0independently without supervision but may not falsely represent themselves as holding specialist or trainee specialist registration. There are currently 9,805 doctors registered on the General Register of the Medical Council. All doctors registered with the Medical Council must maintain professional competence by enrolling in a professional competence scheme and maintain professional competence activities that are relevant to their practice. <\/p>  <p>  In the last ten years, the number of GPs contracted by the HSE to provide services to medical card holders and GP visit card holders under the GMS scheme has increased. At the end of 2008 there were 2,098 GPs who held GMS contracts. As of 1 May 2018, 2,491 GPs hold GMS contracts.

IFI manages salmon stocks on an individual river basis as each of Ireland&rsquo;s 147 salmon rivers (including river sections and estuaries) has its own genetically unique stock of salmon.<\/p>  <p>  IFI is supported in its management role by the independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC), comprising scientists from a range of organisations. \u00a0Scientific and management assessments of each of the\u00a0distinct stocks are carried out every year with IFI engaged in extensive stock monitoring which feeds into the SSC's annual reviews. The SSC uses catch returns of individual rivers (rod catch, catch and release and any commercial catch) over the previous five years to estimate the total salmon returns in each of the previous five years. \u00a0The use of a five year average ensures that a good or bad year does not have a disproportionate impact on the stock assessment in any single year.<\/p>  <p>  Each river has an individual conservation limit which is the number of adult salmon required to maintain a healthy population.\u00a0 Rivers which sufficiently exceed their conservation limit may be opened for harvest fisheries (recreational and\/or commercial). Rivers which meet 50% of their conservation limit may be opened for catch and release (C&amp;R) angling which permits enjoyment of angling while having a negligible impact of vulnerable fish stocks and encouraging the shared responsibility to contribute to conservation and the potential rebuilding of these stocks.\u00a0 For 2018, 78 rivers in Ireland were open to harvest or catch and release fishing. <\/p>  <p>  The decline in wild Atlantic Salmon is an international issue manifesting in rivers in all countries around the North Atlantic with scientific analysis from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) estimating that marine survival of migrating salmon has been at or below 5% in the North Atlantic for more than a decade. <\/p>  <p>  Marine survival is considered to have\u00a0the biggest influence on return, from far North Atlantic feeding grounds, of salmon to all rivers on Atlantic coasts.\u00a0 Climate change in the ocean is considered to be a major factor.\u00a0 There is also evidence that heavy sea-lice infestation from salmon farming has resulted in additional mortality in respect of migratory North Atlantic salmon generally.\u00a0 In freshwater, water quality and a range of pressures such as afforestation, drainage, effluent discharge, siltation and agricultural enrichment can all\u00a0have an impact on juvenile salmon production.<\/p>  <p>  The protection and conservation of salmon internationally is managed through the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) with which Ireland is aligned through the European Union. Concerted international co-operation has ensured that restrictions in feeding ground in Greenland and Faroese waters have been in place for a number of years via NASCO agreement. In June this year, my officials and those of IFI will join delegates from the EU, USA, Canada, Norway, the Russian Federation, Greenland and the Faroes in seeking to negotiate a continuation of restrictions in these waters. <\/p>  <p>  The Atlantic salmon is a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive with which Ireland&rsquo;s current salmon management regime complies. In order to align fully with the Directive and the\u00a0NASCO principles, Ireland closed mixed stock fisheries at sea since 2007. It is considered that river stocks in Ireland would be in a far more perilous state if the closure of mixed stock fisheries had not been implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200079#WRX01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1314"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Management","counter":1221,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200079#WRX02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1222,"qnumday":466,"qnumall":"[22019\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200079#WRX02100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 499 and 504 of 6 February 2018, the progress made on the introduction of the new household waste collection charging arrangements; the way in which the annual support of &euro;75 for persons with lifelong and long-term medical incontinence to assist with the cost of disposal of incontinence products will be implemented (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1346","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1223,"content":"<p>In line with the commitments set out in A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland,<i><\/i>published in 2012, and in the interest of encouraging further waste prevention and greater recycling, flat-rate fees for kerbside household waste collection are being phased out over the period autumn 2017 to autumn 2018, as customers contracts come up for renewal.

Neither I nor the Pensions Authority has the power under legislation to intervene to compel an employer to continue to make contributions to a scheme.  Even where a scheme is closed to new members or to future accrual of benefits, the sponsoring employer role continues in relation to that scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Almost all Irish defined benefit schemes have a rule that allows the employer to cease contributions, usually after a notice period.  Currently there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions and no further liability on the employer where contributions cease.  Neither is there an obligation on the employer to give notice to members or to consult in advance of ceasing contributions.<\/p>  <p>  However, in the case where a restructuring of benefits is proposed, the employer and the trustees of a pension scheme are required to notify scheme members, beneficiaries and the authorised trade unions.  Furthermore, changes made to the Occupational Pension Schemes (Section 50 and 50B) Regulations in 2015 require trustees to also notify groups representing the interests of pensioners and deferred scheme members in a scheme in such a situation.<\/p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform, which was published recently, details specific measures that will modernise our pension system.  It sets out under Strand 4, &lsquo;Measures to Support the Operation of Defined Benefit Schemes&rsquo;, that the Government is committed to advancing the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.  The purpose of this Bill is to respond to the ongoing difficulties in DB schemes and to increase protections for members as well as encouraging employers to ensure that schemes are well funded and managed.<\/p>  <p>  The general scheme of the Bill, which was published in May 2017, contained a number of key measures relating to DB pension schemes.  These proposed provisions will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting by providing a 12 month notification period where an employer is seeking to cease making contributions to a scheme.  The amendments seek a middle road between the current position where employers can abandon DB schemes and full and immediate debt on employer provisions.  The measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will provide for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments also provide for more frequent monitoring of the financial position of schemes and will further provide that, where a scheme is in deficit and a funding proposal has not been put in place in a timely manner, the Pensions Authority may direct steps to be taken to ensure that the scheme meets the funding standard.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that if this new legislation is enacted, a scheme will have to give a minimum notice period of twelve months before contributions can be stopped.  However, it will not prevent a company from ceasing contributions once the minimum notice period is served provided the scheme meets the Minimum Funding Standard.<\/p>  <p>  These provisions are quite technical and complex.  Work to finalise them is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in position to bring forward the amendments at Committee Stage at the end of May or early June.  With the cooperation of the Oireachtas, the Government intends to pass this legislation before the summer recess.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200083#WRBB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Eligibility","counter":1464,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200083#WRBB04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1465,"qnumday":550,"qnumall":"[21986\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200083#WRBB04500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if non-taxable subsistence payments while working in rehabilitative employment are exempt from the means test for the purposes of disability allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1466,"content":"<p>Disability allowance (DA) is a weekly means tested allowance paid to people with a disability.<\/p><p>All sources of income (for example, cash income, employment, capital and maintenance) are assessed as part of the means test; however, certain cash income is legislatively excluded from the assessment.

The package is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments.  The package is currently paid to over 436,000 customers and will cost an estimated &euro;237 million in 2018.  An applicant would only have to satisfy a means test for HHB if they are aged between 66 and 70 years and not<i><\/i>receiving a social welfare type pension.  Therefore an increase in the rate of primary social welfare payments would have no detrimental effect on this cohort of people. <\/p><p>The fuel allowance is a payment of &euro;22.50 per week from October to April, to over 338,000 low income households, at an estimated cost of &euro;227 million in 2018.  The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.  A person applying for a fuel allowance must satisfy a means test.  All qualifying non-contributory recipients are accepted as satisfying the means-test.  Where a person on a contributory payment resides with household members in receipt of non-contributory payments, income from the non-contributory payments is disregarded for the purpose of calculating entitlement to Fuel Allowance.<\/p><p>The current income limit for fuel allowance is set at &euro;100.00 a week above the appropriate maximum State Pension (Contributory) rate.  The following assessable income limits therefore apply from 30 March 2018 when the rate of State Pension (Contributory) increased:<\/p><blockquote>(i) &euro;343.30 for a single person under 80 years (&euro;100 plus &euro;243.30), up from &euro;338.30 <br \/><br \/>(ii) &euro;505.40 for a couple, where the qualified spouse\/civil partner\/cohabitant is under 66 years (&euro;100 plus &euro;243.30 plus &euro;162.10), up from &euro;497.10<br \/><br \/>(iii) &euro;561.30 for a couple, where the qualified spouse\/civil partner\/cohabitant is 66 years or over (&euro;100 plus &euro;243.30 plus &euro;218.00); up from &euro;551.80<\/blockquote><p>Therefore the income limits for HHB and fuel allowance automatically increase when the rates of State Pension (Contributory) increase.  Accordingly it is not necessary for my Department to conduct an analysis of the impact increasing primary social welfare payments has on income thresholds for entitlement to HHB or fuel allowance payment. <\/p><p>Additionally, my Department would not have any figures on the number of people who lost entitlement to HHB or fuel allowance because of an increase in primary social welfare payments as the income threshold is automatically adjusted.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200084#WRCC03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Partial Capacity Benefit Scheme Eligibility","counter":1518,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200084#WRCC04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1519,"qnumday":569,"qnumall":"[22241\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200084#WRCC04300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a partial capacity payment will be awarded to a person (details supplied) following a review of the person's case and medical evidence; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1520,"content":"<p>Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB) is a social welfare scheme which allows a person return to employment if they have reduced capacity for work and to continue to receive a payment from my department.

This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role. It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines a final pension outcome.<\/p>  <p>  Under the new arrangements a person who reached pension age after 1 September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new HomeCaring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme. Crucially, unlike the existing Homemakers disregard system, periods of home-caring before that scheme was introduced in 1994 may be recognised under the new scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Up to 10 years of other credits, for example when unemployed or ill, may also be used, subject to the total number of credits not exceeding 20 years.  So, for example, a person might receive a maximum pension based on 20 years paid PRSI contributions, 5 years jobseeker credits, and 15 years HomeCaring Credits, over a 50 year period.<\/p>  <p>  The new TCA for pensioners assessed under the 2012 rate band changes, comes into effect from 30 March 2018. Pensioners do not need to contact the Department at this juncture.

Following the passing of this legislation, the Department expects to send out these invitations from Quarter 4 of 2018 and to begin payments, including arrears for any period from 30 March 2018, from Quarter 1 of 2019.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200085#WRDD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bereavement Grant","counter":1556,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200085#WRDD02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1557,"qnumday":582,"qnumall":"[22605\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200085#WRDD02600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans for the reintroduction of the bereavement grant.","asker":"1250","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1558,"content":"<p>During the economic downturn, my Department protected primary social welfare rates and in recent years, as the economy recovered, the Government has concentrated resources in improving the core rates of payments, particularly for pensioners.

The project was submitted for funding by Fingal County Council, following a Call for Proposals in August 2016.  The proposal was assessed by the LIHAF Advisory Group and LIHAF Management Committee and was recommended for approval.  It received preliminary approval in March 2017 and a grant agreement was signed in October 2017. The overall cost of the project is &euro;14.16 million, of which &euro;10.62 million is being funded by the Exchequer, with Fingal County Council funding the remaining &euro;3.54 million.  The project is being managed by Fingal County Council and my Department reviews its progress on a regular basis, in line with the terms of the grant agreement. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Donabate Distributor Road was granted planning permission by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in July 2011 and the approved scheme comprises approximately 3km of dual-carriageway and 1km of single-carriageway road.  At present, the scheme is being constructed as a single-carriageway road along its entire length, as this configuration is forecast to be sufficient to accommodate traffic flows in advance of the various developments taking place in and around Donabate.  Construction is being undertaken, however, to include provision for upgrade to dual-carriageway standard in due course, in line with the scheme planning permission.

I have no plans at present to increase HAP rent limits in particular local authority areas, a course of action which\u00a0could have further inflationary effects on the private rented sector and thereby have a potentially detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.  \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200085#WRDD04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Referendum Commission","counter":1576,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200085#WRDD04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1577,"qnumday":588,"qnumall":"[22004\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200085#WRDD04600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the Referendum Commission has given consideration to the regulation of referendum posters specifically in circumstances in which posters contain imagery deemed offensive to viewers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1578,"content":"<p>The Referendum Commission does not have a role in\u00a0the regulation of\u00a0referendum posters.\u00a0However, one of the main functions of the commission, which is an independent body established under section 2 of the Referendum Act 1998, is to explain the subject matter of referendum proposals and communicate these explanations to the electorate. <\/p>  <p>  Section 140 of the Electoral Act 1992, which also applies at a referendum, provides that every notice, bill, poster or similar document having reference to an election or referendum or distributed for the purpose of furthering the candidature of a candidate at an election or a particular result at a referendum shall bear upon its face the name and address of the printer and of the publisher.<\/p>  <p>  The Electoral Acts do not regulate the content of electoral material, including election posters, during or outside of electoral or referendum campaigns.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Section 7 of the Public Order Act 1994 provides that\u00a0&lsquo;It shall be an offence for any person in a public place to distribute or display any writing, sign or visible representation which is threatening, abusive, insulting or obscene with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or being reckless as to whether a breach of the peace may be occasioned'.\u00a0 In this regard, it would be a matter for\u00a0An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with public order offences generally (in terms of the operation of the relevant legislation), including offences under section 7 of the Public Offences Act 1994, either at their own instigation or on foot of allegations made in that regard.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200085#WRDD04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payment Administration","counter":1579,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200085#WRDD04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1580,"qnumday":589,"qnumall":"[22044\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200085#WRDD04900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will make changes to the housing assistance payment scheme in order to speed up the process (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As a long term housing support, an assessment of housing need must be completed in order for a household to qualify for HAP. Any household with an identified housing need is eligible for HAP.  The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provide that subject to conditions, a housing authority shall deal with such an application within a period of 12 weeks.  Local authorities will prioritise housing needs assessments for those in greatest need and average waiting times are significantly shorter than the statutory maximum in many areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector. My Department does not hold details on the processing times for HAP applications or payments.  The earliest date a HAP payment will issue to a landlord is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority. \u00a0Limerick City and County Council provide a highly effective transactional shared service on behalf of all HAP local authorities. This HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC. On average, HAP applications are processed by the HAP Shared Service Centre within 1 working day of receipt.

Other PPP programmes, such as those designed to deliver schools or medical facilities, would be the responsibility of the Ministers for Education and Skills, and\u00a0Health, respectively, while more general\u00a0policy on PPPs is the responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  The first bundle in the social housing PPP programme, comprising a total of six PPP sites, will provide\u00a0over 500 homes in the Greater Dublin Area. Two of the sites are located in the Dublin City Council area with one each in the\u00a0County Council areas of South Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Louth. The second bundle, comprising eight PPP sites, will provide over 450 new homes. Three of the sites are located in County Cork, with one in each in the cities of Galway and Waterford, and\u00a0in\u00a0the counties of Clare, Kildare and Roscommon. The identification and selection of sites for the third project bundle is at a preliminary stage.<\/p>  <p>  The social housing being developed at all these sites is\u00a0in co-operation with the relevant local authorities.

This can result in the Board\u00a0attaching greater significance to\u00a0new and updated\u00a0Government policy than to a development plan objective that may have been adopted a number of years ago, thereby\u00a0resulting in the contravening of the development plan by the Board in making its determination\u00a0on a planning appeal or application.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200087#WRFF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Building Regulations","counter":1646,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200087#WRFF01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1647,"qnumday":617,"qnumall":"[22657\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052200087#WRFF01300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he is in receipt of correspondence issued by a group (details supplied) in County Donegal; if the invitation contained therein to visit County Donegal and meet with affected homeowners will be accepted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1648,"content":"<p>I\u00a0can confirm that I have received the correspondence\u00a0referred to in the Question\u00a0and a\u00a0reply has issued from\u00a0my Department.<\/p><p>As you are aware, the Expert Panel on concrete blocks was established by my Department in 2016, to investigate problems that have emerged in the concrete blockwork of certain dwellings in Counties Donegal and Mayo.<\/p><p>The panel had the following terms of reference:<\/p><p>(i) To identify, insofar as it is possible, the numbers of private dwellings which appear to be affected by defects in the blockwork in the Counties of Donegal and Mayo;<\/p><p>(ii) To carry out a desktop study, which would include a consultation process with affected homeowners, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, testing laboratories, industry stakeholders and other relevant parties, to establish the nature of the problem in the affected dwellings;<\/p><p>(iii)\u00a0To outline a range of technical options for remediation and the means by which those technical options could be applied; and<\/p><p>(iv)To submit a report within six months.<\/p><p>On 13 June 2017, the report of the\u00a0was published and included eight recommendations which my Department are actively progressing with the relevant stakeholders.<\/p><p>My Department is prioritising the implementation\u00a0of Recommendations 1 and 2. <\/p><p>With regard to Recommendation 1, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) Technical Committee, established to scope and fast track the development of a standardised protocol, held its inaugural meeting on 11 September 2017 and has held several further meetings since.
