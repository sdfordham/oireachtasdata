Action 1 of the strategy provides that a national framework for housing supply is to be established on a statutory footing with an annual national statement of projected housing supply and demand published every June.  I have asked the Housing Agency to take the lead in implementing this action. <\/p><p>The proper management of all State land is critical and, accordingly, both lands that have been transferred to the Housing Agency and local authority held lands suitable for development will be the first sites considered in any future targeted social housing building programme.  My Department&rsquo;s annual housing land availability survey gathers information from local authorities to inform the publication of the amount of zoned residential land in their areas that is currently serviced.  It is currently estimated that there is in excess of 25,000 hectares of undeveloped residentially zoned land nationally, which equates to a capacity for over 500,000 new homes based on a national average of 20 units per hectare.  This capacity is considered sufficient to meet the housing requirements nationally for in excess of the next ten years. \u00a0In line with the commitments under the Construction 2020 strategy, a housing supply co-ordination task force for Dublin has been established with an immediate focus on addressing supply related issues.<\/p><p>Under action 8 of Construction 2020, a social housing strategy is to be published by quarter 3 of 2014.  To assist in the development of the social housing strategy, the Housing Agency has invited submissions by 31 July 2014.  This invitation for submissions is available at the following website: <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>Action 9 of Construction 2020 provides that a review of Part V of the Planning and Development Acts, which, <i>inter alia<\/i>, deals with affordable housing and social housing gain from private development, will be completed by the end of quarter two of 2014.  It is anticipated that any legislative changes required on foot of the review will be incorporated into the general scheme of a planning Bill which is currently in preparation.<\/p><p> I am acutely conscious of the difficulties caused by rising rents and of the problem of sourcing suitable accommodation, especially in Dublin and other urban centres, with growing evidence of increasing rents affecting more vulnerable tenants, such as those in receipt of rent supplement.  I have asked the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, to carry out a focused piece of research that will explore options to address the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector and report to me with policy recommendations in the coming weeks.  On 30 April 2014, the Government approved the publication of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014, which, when enacted, will provide for the introduction of the new housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.  HAP will provide a new framework for the provision of rental assistance and will, in as much as it can, facilitate the removal of existing barriers to employment by allowing HAP recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment.<\/p><p> I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2014 to be in the region of 6,000 new housing units.  The number and method of delivery of social housing units in future years is determined in the course of the annual Estimates process and will be informed by the social housing strategy currently in preparation.  It will set out clear objectives for delivery over the next five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700012#K00800","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403019300,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.

The problem is even greater in Dublin.<\/p><p>  Since the Government took office, we have had a 2011 housing strategy and we were told there would be a social dividend from NAMA.  We have also had the Construction 2020 plan and a housing Bill to be finished later today which, as somebody noted in last week's debate, contains no houses but rather deals with housing supports.

The Government is taking the &euro;7 billion and paying down Government debt to lower the debt\/GDP ratio ...  So let&rsquo;s take half of that money the Government is using to pay down debt - &euro;3.5 billion &ndash; and use it to build social houses, house the homeless and put some people back to work ...  The &euro;3.5 billion would build approximately 20,000 social houses ...  The impact on employment would be considerable.  35,000 direct jobs would be created &ndash; that is, jobs on site.  NERI estimates further job creation given the impact on downstream sectors (building supplies, transport) and the additional demand injected into the economy.<\/blockquote>It is hardly rocket science to suggest this would be a good way to move forward and address many problems.

The money that is being provided is welcome.  I think a figure of &euro;70,000 has been mentioned with regard to County Laois.

We are facing something like what we faced in the 1950s and the 1930s.  There are huge problems out there.  I do not think the scale of this massive problem has been absorbed by the Government.  I accept that the problem was already there when the Government came into power, but it has grown since then.  There is always a problem with a shortage of social housing, but there is an absolute crisis at the moment.  It has to be dealt with by the Government.  It cannot be left to the voluntary agencies, which are building up huge stocks of housing.  I do not have a problem with the voluntary agencies <i>per se<\/i>.  I want the problem to be solved.  The Government is brewing up a problem down the line.  Neither the local authority nor the Government at national level has control over the housing stock.

When taking an estate in charge under the terms of this provision, a planning authority must take in charge any roads, open spaces, car parks, sewers, water mains or drains within the attendant grounds of the development.  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides for the transfer of responsibility for the provision of public water services from local authorities to Irish Water.  In addition, it provides a mechanism whereby water services infrastructure may be transferred by ministerial order to Irish Water.  Contrary to certain misunderstandings that may exist, there is no specific legal impediment to the taking in charge of water services infrastructure by local authorities. <\/p><p>  In Circular PL 21\/13, issued by my Department to planning authorities on 30 December 2013 in light of the transfer of certain statutory water services functions from local authorities to Irish Water with effect from 1 January 2014, it was stated that legislative amendments to clarify further the existing provisions on the taking in charge of housing estates would be made in 2014.  My Department is currently considering, in consultation with Irish Water, what amendments to section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, will be required in this regard.  In addition, in consultation with Irish Water and the local authorities, we are working on developing a protocol for the taking in charge of estates.

In that case, the card was removed from a 13 year old with multiple disabilities and I can give the Taoiseach details of the case.  I received details of a third case of a five year old who lost the medical card which he has had since he was two years of age.  It is unbelievable that this continues to go on.<\/p><p>In regard to the decision which has been taken, will the Taoiseach outline to the House how many cards will be restored?  Will all of those who lost discretionary medical cards have them restored?  Will those who lost medical cards as a result of this decision be refunded for the cost of medication they have incurred since the discretionary medical cards were wrongly taken from them?

They should receive their cards back within the next four weeks.  The question that arises is what one does in respect of ordinary medical cards for which applications are being made and on which a review continues and in cases where an appeal is lodged.  The first criteria is to deal with cards that have been withdrawn that had been issued on a discretionary basis where undue hardship applied and where there were particular medical circumstances.  A number of such cases were outlined in the House recently and the impact the withdrawal of the cards had on families.  I have not seen the newspaper to which Deputy Martin referred, or the cases he outlined, but the decision made by the Government was to cease the review that was under way in respect of discretionary cards that had been awarded in order that people who have had a discretionary card given to them should continue to have one because of the suspension of the review process.  I do not know the cases Deputy Martin spoke about but following the decision of the Government, those who have a discretionary medical card should continue to have it.  I will have the cases checked.  It is clear that the decision made today was to deal with those who had been awarded discretionary cards whose cards were withdrawn for whatever reason on review.  The issue is an administrative one as distinct from a legal one.  The point is to give the cards back to the people who had them awarded on discretion and who lost the card following the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700018#Q00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1403022000,"counter":144,"content":"<p>This is a very serious issue in that the Taoiseach has said 13,000 cards will be restored - the Minister said something similar in his press release, 15,000 - but the bottom line is that if one looks at the HSE performance report of January 2011, there were 80,000 discretionary medical cards.

When this was brought to the attention of the Minister, it was dealt with seriously and the chairman resigned.  I understand Mr. John Killeen has assumed the role of interim chairperson of the board.  I answered that question for Deputy Adams last week.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Adams will be aware, the current legislative base for the issuing of a medical card is the Health Act 1970.  What it is concerned with is undue hardship which is defined with reference to household means.  When a person applies for a medical card, the question asked is if there is undue hardship based on the household means.  If a person is ruled out of receiving a medical card on that basis, then one then has to see how much discretion could apply to deal with a particular undue hardship.  That was, however, implemented in a very uneven fashion and, accordingly, in an unfair fashion.  In some places discretionary cards were issued with very little analysis and in others with very stringent analysis.  The equalisation of that process resulted in many thousands of people being severely affected.<\/p><p>  The Minister has asked the clinical panel to examine the setting out of a policy framework that will take account of medical conditions as a method for having access to medical facilities.  In fact, the Health Act 1970 does not specifically refer to medical cards but to the issue of access to medical facilities based on undue hardship, taking into account household incomes.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s decision today is clear.  All those who lost the discretionary card awarded to them on the basis of the central review from July 2011 will have those cards restored on an administrative basis.  They should have them back within the next four weeks.  That means that people who have lost a medical card awarded on discretionary grounds because of exceptional medical issues will have those cards restored to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700019#R01600","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1403022600,"counter":201,"content":"<p>It will be only half of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700019#R01700","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1403022600,"counter":202,"content":"<p>The cost of that will be &euro;13 million, which the Government approved this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700019#R01800","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1403022600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>That is the first figure the Taoiseach has had right in a long time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700019#R01900","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1403022600,"counter":204,"content":"<p>The whole issue of inquiries has been very much in vogue with much chatter over the weekend.

Is it not logical against this backdrop of one of the longest running police operations in the history of the State, in an area deemed to be the most heavily policed in Europe, coincidentally in the Taoiseach's backyard, where more than 100 complaints to GSOC have been made, that the Taoiseach would agree this obviously should be the subject of an independent inquiry?  Such an inquiry has been sought for a long time by national and international human rights campaigners such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the UN special rapporteur for human rights defenders.  The campaign yesterday outlined 22 reasons such an inquiry needs to take place, ranging from the lack of legality of arresting people without charge, protesters being hospitalised, phone tapping-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700019#R02200","speaker":"1192","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403023200,"counter":208,"content":"<p>What about the investment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700020#S00200","speaker":"1108"},{"type":"speech","time":1403023200,"counter":209,"content":"<p>-----retired garda&iacute; working for the IRMS and Shell and the fact that all of the regulatory and monitoring agencies have been demonstrably shown to have been subverted by Shell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700020#S00300","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1403023200,"counter":210,"content":"<p>The &euro;1 billion investment should be welcomed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700020#S00400","speaker":"1108"},{"type":"speech","time":1403023200,"counter":211,"content":"<p>The question I need to ask the Taoiseach is whether he is aware of the meetings of the Shell committee of managing directors in London prior to the commencement of the Shell project when it discussed whether the company had sufficiently well-placed contacts in the Irish Government and among the Irish regulators, an instance which it said it would investigate further and which set the scene for everything else that followed?

Our programme included a series of meetings with senior officials from the organisation, as well as a public event attended by the media. <\/p><p>  The OECD&rsquo;s Secretary-General, Angel Gurr&iacute;a, had previously visited Dublin in September 2013 to mark the organisation&rsquo;s launch of its biennial economic survey of Ireland.  At that time, we discussed Ireland&rsquo;s economic prospects and exchanged ideas on how the OECD could more valuably contribute to the formulation of economic and social policy in the country.  The working visit to Paris therefore allowed the Government to assess progress since then and to identify more specific areas where OECD expertise and analysis could assist the Government's continuing reform programme.  We also touched on the importance of Ireland's exit without a backstop facility from the troika programme for both improving market confidence and securing more favourable borrowing rates.<\/p><p>  The key focus, however, of the discussions on 7 February was on job creation and reducing unemployment, areas where the OECD has significant expertise and experience.  The OECD&rsquo;s view, which I share, is that Ireland has made important strides in this context, especially in terms of structural reforms, but that much more needs to be done.  Its officials noted that youth unemployment remains a serious challenge and we must ensure that Ireland's workforce is increasingly equipped with the skills needed for a modern, 21st-century economy such as our own.  We also had useful exchanges with the organisation&rsquo;s experts on domestic labour activation strategies that can help jobseekers find suitable employment.  The global economic situation has an obvious bearing on an export-driven economy like that of Ireland and I therefore was interested to hear the OECD&rsquo;s views on the broader international economic environment.  Its assessment was that the recovery of the global economy is progressing at a moderate pace but urgent action still is required to address structural weaknesses that remain from the crisis.<\/p><p>  The OECD is well-known as an authority on tax issues and we had a short discussion with it on the efforts the organisation leads to combat international tax evasion and avoidance.  Mr. Gurr&iacute;a welcomed the Government's support for the OECD's work on base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, and for its co-operation with the OECD on tax matters.  In light of the discussions in February, the Government is now working with the OECD to select specific projects and areas for further co-operation.  Possibilities in this regard include enhancing the performance of the national innovation system, strengthening the Government's public supports for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, and entrepreneurship, including a particular focus on access to finance, a renewed emphasis on the role of towns and cities in unlocking the economic potential of the regions and stronger co-operation in the area of public governance more generally, including through better regulation.<\/p><p>  In an increasingly knowledge-intensive and inter-connected global economy, Ireland's long-standing membership of the OECD has never been more important.  I am confident that our visit to Paris in February will provide the basis for a stronger level of co-operation with the organisation across all areas of public policy in the months ahead and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700021#T03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1403023800,"counter":295,"content":"<p>Eight questions in total have been linked to the Taoiseach's visit to the OECD in Paris.  I put it to the Taoiseach that right now, there is something close to panic in Europe about the threat of deflation and its potential dramatic impact on growth.  What is somewhat incredible is I have yet to hear from the Taoiseach a single word on the threat the impact of deflation across Europe represents for Ireland.  When replying to me, can the Taoiseach explain why he has not made a public statement on this issue?<\/p><p>  The OECD recently published an evaluation of the Action Plan for Jobs and the Government's press release in this regard probably was one of the most deliberately misleading, in a long line of over-hyped press releases, to which Members are used.  I believe the Government press release stated the OECD had said the action plan was delivering tens of thousands of jobs but of course the OECD said no such thing.  It stated directly that it cannot state how many, if any, jobs came from the action plan and that the improving international economy has been by far the biggest driver of jobs growth.  However, this is what tends to happen with press releases.  The OECD also criticised the lack of progress on youth unemployment, which is a particular scourge at this point in time, both in this country and across the European Union.  What is important is to tell it as it is to people, because people are somewhat fed up with the over-spin on a general basis, because it does not accord with the daily realities they face in respect of employment, life, incomes and so on.<\/p><p>  As for the corporation tax issue, I believe one must state in an assertive way that Ireland's corporation tax rules are in accordance with OECD guidelines on taxation.  In his reply, the Taoiseach has stated the issue of corporation tax was discussed with the OECD.  It appears to me that the OECD does not necessarily have a problem with Ireland's regime or framework.  I put it to the Taoiseach that he has not been proactive enough in making the case definitively for retaining autonomy in setting our own corporate tax rate, as well as having flexibility in our tax structure in general, both in respect of inward investment and to encourage entrepreneurial activity.  Does the Taoiseach accept that the disparaging references in the United States Senate and the House of Commons to Ireland's corporation tax regime have caused significant reputational damage to our tax system?  In addition, does he accept they potentially have created challenges for Ireland in respect of foreign direct investment into the future, in that they are undermining certainty about our framework into the future?  I put it to the Taoiseach that the Government has not treated this issue with the seriousness it deserves since the initial European probe was launched nine months ago.  I believe the Government has been complacent and dismissive and I do not believe it has allayed the concerns of the European Union to prevent a formal inquiry.<\/p><p>  One must repeat there are no special corporate tax rates in Ireland.  There are rules on how taxable income is calculated to determine the figure to which the 12.5% rate is applied and they are set out clearly.  The Taoiseach and I are both aware but I ask him to confirm that companies such as Apple, for example, eventually will pay 35% in corporation tax when global profits are repatriated to the United States.  The problem for the United States is that companies are deferring indefinitely this tax by holding the money offshore and not repatriating it.  Does the Taoiseach accept this is a United States problem, not an Irish problem?  It is facilitated by an exemption granted by the United States, rather than by any provision in the Irish tax code.  The headline corporation tax rate is only one consideration in assessing a country's corporate tax regime.<\/p><p>I ask the Taoiseach to provide details of the discussion he had with the OECD about the taxation question.  I refer to BEPS - base erosion and profit shifting.  I ask him to confirm that the international trend is to cut corporation tax rather than increasing it.  I have noted what is happening in the United Kingdom with the patent box and its stated aim to reduce its corporation tax in an attempt to attract inward investment.  Would he agree that a one-size-fits-all tax regime would not work for Europe?  I refer to last week's press release from the Department of Finance which stated that the subject of transfer pricing up to 2010 was being examined and that the corporate tax rate was not being examined by the European Union.  I ask him to outline to the House what has the European Commission told the Government in this regard.  What does the Government propose to do in response to the EU probe?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700021#T03600","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403024400,"counter":297,"content":"<p>What was the Deputy's initial question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700022#U00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1403024400,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I asked about the action plan for jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700022#U00300","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1403024400,"counter":299,"content":"<p>The Deputy remarked that I had not made a comment about something.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700022#U00400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1403024400,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I apologise.

It is clearly an issue and I expect it will be discussed next week at the European Council.  I expect that Mr. Draghi will be in attendance at some stage during the course of that two-day meeting and that he will deal in some detail with the threat as he has outlined it.<\/p><p>  Deputy Martin is well aware of the importance of the corporate tax rate as a cornerstone for investment in the country.  I can confirm from my meetings last week in the United States that the line of investment into the country is very strong.  It is not a question about the rate of corporation tax because that has never been questioned.  There have been discussions in different member states and sectors about the fluctuation in rates.  Britain has had discussions about this and the Prime Minister has commented about the outcome of his intention to make a decision about the corporation tax rate in Northern Ireland once the outcome of the Scottish referendum is known.  The question has never been raised about the rate of corporate tax.  The Commission has given notice of launching an investigation into a number of countries, the Netherlands and Luxembourg and, in the case of Ireland, in respect of Apple.  <\/p><p>  Last week I had a meeting with the senior personnel in Apple in California.  This is about a specific technical issue, about a specific instance for a company, which is that any company is entitled to speak to Revenue in respect of the options that might be considered when making a decision to invest in Ireland.  The question of the corporate tax is one of statute-based law and is not one that allows for specific deals for any individual company.  This is an important point.  The Government on behalf of the country will defend this very robustly in that our legislation is statute-based and we believe it is ethically implemented and that therefore it does not constitute a state aid.  The announcement by the Commission is in respect of its intention to look at a specific issue of a technical nature related to one particular company and it is not dealing with the rate of corporate tax as it applies.<\/p><p>  In reply to the Deputy's other question, I refer to the role of the OECD in respect of base erosion and profit shifting.  Most companies that use these BEPS strategies to reduce the amount of tax they pay take advantage of mismatches or different rates and regimes between the tax rules in different countries, making it difficult for any single country to fully address the issue.  There is a need to provide an international and a joined-up approach which would reinforce domestic efforts as well as protecting tax bases and providing comprehensive international solutions to the problem.  That is where the OECD comes into play in that it is co-ordinating an international response to deal with these challenges through its BEPS project.<\/p><p>  The OECD BEPS action plan published in July 2013 sets out 15 specific actions to deal with the problems of base erosion and profit shifting.  The plan provides a timetable for the completion of these various steps spanning five separate areas, namely, the digital economy, coherence, substance, transparency and the formulation of a new multilateral instrument.  The timetable for their completion is from September this year to December 2015.  The fundamental goal of the project is to better align and the right to tax with real economic substance and activity.  This issue of substance and taxation is a core pillar of the Irish taxation system.  That is the reason the BEPS project is consistent with our tax strategy.  <\/p><p>  We fully support the important work of the OECD.  This is an issue which is not limited to any one country, rather it represents a global challenge involving a wide variety of jurisdictions and companies and it accordingly requires a globally co-ordinated response such as that led by the OECD.  We are committed to the process underway to ensure that what is termed the global architecture is fair and seen to be more equitable.  We welcomed the original report in February 2013 which identified the problems and challenges.  We fully support the action plan subsequently published in July 2013.<\/p><p>  Deputy Martin also referred to the question of youth unemployment and youth employment which is an issue in a number of countries.  The OECD published tailored recommendations for each individual country.  A number of Ministers attended that meeting to meet with the specialists in each area.  Depending on the nature of the conversation, they recommended schemes or activities to deal with youth unemployment in the various countries.  For example, a comprehensive review of the apprenticeship system was undertaken and has been completed recently.  It examined apprenticeship training systems with a view to providing an updated model of training that delivers the necessary skilled workforce to service the needs of a rapidly changing economy.  That review was progressed by an independent group which has made a series of recommendations and which prepared a comprehensive framework for a future expanded system of apprenticeship in Ireland.  It suggested that the current system could be expanded to a number of other industries, including the ICT sector.  For example, I met two companies last week and both said that they could employ 1,000 software engineers in the morning if they were available but we do not have them.  <\/p><p>  The taxpayer provides substantial funding for the board of SOLAS to be delivered through the new educational opportunities structures.  It is a question of how to structure the apprenticeship training schemes to provide for industries requiring large numbers of trained personnel.  The group also made recommendations about the existing apprenticeship trades.  It was suggested that programmes should provide for the integration of various skills such as literacy, numeracy, mathematics, science, ICT and that these should be designed to equip the participants for progression to the next level.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn and the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, agree with this policy.<\/p><p>  Deputy Martin asked what actions are being taken to address the skills gaps in higher education.  The Government and the OECD both recognise the importance of ensuring that Irish workers have the necessary skills to deal in a modern 21st century economy such as ours.  We have the highest rate of tertiary enrolment in the EU and at 45%, Ireland has the third highest proportion in the EU of higher education students studying science and mathematics and ICT.  I acknowledge Deputy Martin's involvement when he was Minister for Education.  It was a good policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700022#U00800","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1403025000,"counter":304,"content":"<p>That is rare praise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700023#V00100","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1403025000,"counter":305,"content":"<p>We will not rest on our laurels and for that reason we have targeted incentives to meet emerging skills needs.

Furthermore, 63% of demand for high level IT professional is being met from the higher education system through the implementation of the ICT skills action plan.  In 2011, the corresponding figure was 45% and we have set a target of reaching 75% by 2018.  In addition, 15,000 Springboard places have been provided since 2011 in areas of identified high demand from enterprise.

According to the 2012 survey, 75% of employers are satisfied with the skills of Irish graduates.  <\/p><p>  This morning, I met Mr. Liu Yunshan, a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, who invited 200 Irish students to visit China to participate in a language summer camp.  China is expanding its investment in Ireland and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, will shortly visit the country.  I expect the Minister will also be in a position to announce the first round of investment under the China-Ireland technology group growth capital fund. <\/p><p>  Having spoken this morning to representatives of some of the major financial institutions, it is clear that this sector, in which more than 35,000 people are employed, offers further opportunities.  Those to whom I spoke noted a radical shift in Ireland in the recent period and pointed out that the quality of talent coming through the system is second to none.  This is creating a ripple effect across Europe, with Dublin in particular holding a magnetic attraction for many young people because of the numbers of companies located here and the energy and creativity that flows from that.  <\/p><p>  While we have made significant progress on unemployment, the rate is still too high.  Access to credit is a major issue and one which the Government seeks to address.  Today, for example, we made a number of changes to the credit scheme introduced for small companies by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in his action plan.  As I have noted on a number of occasions, it is not for Governments to say how many jobs they create.  The Action Plan for Jobs is a mechanism, if one likes, for easing the way to enable jobs to be created.  Of the 60,000 jobs created last year, 40,000 were in companies that are less than five years old.  This is indicative of the change that is under way.  <\/p><p>  Many of those who participated in the Enterprise Ireland boot camp and presented in the United States seeking investment from venture capital will sell exclusively on the Internet and they will not be restricted by any requirement to have a physical shop or the timelines that apply in such circumstances.  Sales methods and demand and supply are changing radically.  <\/p><p>  The Government regularly engages with the OECD because it has a brilliant range of expertise available to it and is able to respond to specific queries on the design of schemes for young people that are appropriate to Ireland's circumstances, as opposed to those of Italy or Portugal, for example.  The OECD wishes to continue with this type of engagement, which is done on the basis of catering for the changes that will take place in 18 months or five years and the requirement to structure our needs accordingly.<\/p><p>  These are some of the issues that were discussed.  The issue of base erosion and product shifting, BEPS, was also discussed and the Government fully supports the position being taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700023#V00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1403025000,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I propose to concentrate on the way in which the tax regime here is being used by some multinational companies to avoid paying tax in countries in which they operate.  The Taoiseach acknowledged that this issue was raised at the OECD meeting in February.  It is another mark of the dysfunctional nature of the process of engagement in the House that we are dealing with questions dating from February.<\/p><p>  In response to Teachta Martin, the Taoiseach stated that the corporation tax rate was not raised at the February meeting, which is welcome, and that this was a specific technical issue, which is more of a global problem than an Irish one.  He also acknowledged that the issue was raised during his visit to California.  The issue that captured the media headlines here and, I believe, in the United States, was the barbed joke made by California Governor, Jerry Brown, at an Enterprise Ireland event in San Francisco.  The matter is, therefore, raised consistently. <\/p><p>  I will outline some of the concerns that arise in this regard.  At the end of September 2013, an Irish registered Google company had a revenue of &euro;15.5 billion but paid only &euro;17 million in corporation tax here.  A US Senate hearing in Washington was also told that Apple had a special arrangement that provided a 2% tax rate and that one Irish registered subsidiary of the company had profits of &euro;40 billion.  The sums involved are substantial.  The issue, which the Taoiseach described as technical, is that tax avoidance for multinational companies is facilitated through the funnelling of funds through this State into tax havens.  I concur with the Taoiseach's previous comment that this State is not a tax haven.  While his view is borne out, the fact that the money comes through Ireland means it is a matter of Irish tax law and enforcement in this State.  I have other figures to hand but I am sure the Taoiseach has a sense of the issue in terms of royalties, licences and taxable profits that have been transferred out of the State.<\/p><p>  This issue is pertinent not only to Ireland but also the developing world where people depend on corporation tax income to support vital public services.  As the Taoiseach is aware, people are dying from hunger and experiencing poverty.  I recall that last September, at a Clinton Global Initiative event in New York, the former US President, Bill Clinton, asked what major companies could do to support development in Africa.  In response, Mo Ibrahim, a Sudanese-British mobile communications businessman and billionaire, argued that global companies should pay taxes in Africa and it was not acceptable that they do not do so.  Ireland has issues in this regard in terms of State law.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach also referred to fairness.  Where is the fairness in companies that make billions in Africa being able to funnel revenue through Ireland, thus avoiding tax in the country in which their wealth originates?  Citizens, including Members of the Oireachtas, and small companies are correctly expected to pay tax, whereas multinational companies are being facilitated in avoiding paying tax.  Sinn F&eacute;in's strong view is that the tax code must be organised in a fair and ethical manner.  <\/p><p>  The effect of this practice on the developing world means it is not merely a technical issue but an issue of tax justice.  Surely Ireland cannot and should not be complicit in allowing money to be funnelled through this country in a manner that results in the developing world being robbed of income that could assist countries to emerge from poverty, save lives, prevent famine and be employed to promote economic growth and public services.  I ask the Taoiseach to reflect on these points and respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700023#V00300","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1403025000,"counter":307,"content":"<p>The discussions were not about the 12.5% corporation tax rate in place here as corporation tax is a matter for individual countries.  The rate we have set has been a cornerstone of our policy for a very long time.<\/p><p>I agree with Deputies Adams and Martin that the question of reputational damage is an issue.  It arises from some of the comments made following the United States Senate hearings last year about this country being a tax haven when clearly Ireland does not qualify under any of the headings for tax haven status.  It took a while to deal with that argument comprehensively and clearly.  In view of reputational damage or perception of reputational damage, the Minister for Finance abolished the stateless concept in the budget last year.  That was a clear decision to remove any perception of difficulty from an Irish point of view.<\/p><p> Governor Brown's comments in California arose at an occasion where quite a number of small Irish companies had gone through an analysis and presentation of their products and what they intended to offer and pitched to potential investors in California to invest in their businesses.  Some of them were very exciting concepts designed here by Irish people.  Governor Brown certainly has a sense of humour and, obviously, people can play words the way they want.  He has transformed the Californian economy, where there was a $27 billion deficit, to a point where it is making serious progress, not, I might add, without taking significant and difficult decisions.<\/p><p> When Deputy Adams mentions companies paying the tax rate that applies here, it is important to state we do not have the brass-plate system in Ireland.  For instance, I visited Apple in California last week.  When one goes to its ultra-modern facility in Cork where over 4,000 highly-skilled people are employed one can understand the contribution it is making to the economy of Cork, both city and region, along with its presence in a number of other countries.  Companies which employ significant numbers here pay the tax and their workers pay tax, but in the BEPS initiative the OECD is dealing with the 15 different areas internationally so that there can be an international response to have a fair system that everybody understands.  We are participating fully, openly and comprehensively in that, and have done so from the outset.<\/p><p> Deputy Adams raised a number of interesting points about Africa.  Prior to the Olympic Games, British Prime Minister Cameron called a meeting in London with a number of African leaders who spoke about discrimination against women and young girls, discrimination in education, corruption and the difficulties that many countries in the African continent experience.  It is evident, if the population of Africa doubles in the next 20 years, as it probably will, that even if 10% of young males were to decide to emigrate from the African Continent, no country in Europe could withstand the scale of that pressure and it is necessary that democratisation and anti-corruption measures be put in place in Africa.  A number of African leaders addressed the G8 summit in Lough Erne and what they said was startling in its effect in that companies, and in some cases countries, which do deals with phenomenal amounts of African land, supply all the legal requirements at the start of a contract but there is never an analysis as to the impact for the peoples, the tribes or the economies of the regions.  The point was made by President Obama at that meeting that the G8 could supply expertise and experience in contract law and treaty agreements so that African countries or their regions would be able to avail of the best expertise on what they are being asked to sign.  An example would be the rape of the land for mineral extraction to no benefit for the African people or the regional economies.  Some of the leaders gave examples of where a truck-load of mineral clay or whatever driving 20 miles might be stopped 50 to 100 times for payment.<\/p><p> There is an issue here that goes to the heart of the matter, that is, corruption and greed.  Clearly, significant amounts of money have been drifting into some bank accounts to the disadvantage of millions of people, tribes and local areas.  That was an issue on which the G8 was to follow up, where expertise could be made available to countries and regions to state what they are being asked to do, what is the agreement that they are being asked to sign and how is it that there cannot be much greater benefit for the people and the area depending on the nature of the contract in place.  I suppose, when the gentleman Deputy Adams quotes states that all companies should pay their taxes in Africa, perhaps that may be a reason that some do not.  In any event, Ireland's participation and support for the OECD's work on the BEPS covering the 15 areas that I mentioned to Deputy Martin is something that we hope can bring about an international response to the different regimes that apply in different countries.<\/p><p> Ireland's participation in the OECD does not mean that we have to change our tax laws.  The OECD does not have the power to do that.  It is anticipated that the OECD analysis of BEPS will result in changes being made to the international taxation rule-book on which countries rely for international trade.  We always have played by these rules and that is evidenced by the extent of the strength of the continued line of investment into the country.  These issues are under active consideration.  We participate in that, openly and fully, and we look forward to dealing with the response.<\/p><p> The Commission's investigation is not a global issue.  The Commission's investigation here in Ireland is on a specific technical point for a specific company.  That is not an issue that applies globally.  The Commission has a slightly different investigation taking place in Luxembourg and in the Netherlands with other companies.<\/p><p> The bigger picture is how does one respond to the digital world having moved so far ahead of the legislative world that companies can move through different jurisdictions, regimes and tax operations before a baseline is reached.  For us, with companies here in Ireland, there are no brass-plate operations.  We believe strongly that, as ours is a statute-based law, it is not a state aid and it is ethically implemented.  We work on that up-front basis with the OECD and we will defend our position strongly with the European Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700023#V00400","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403025600,"counter":309,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach began by speaking about youth unemployment being discussed at the OECD meeting but he did not outline whether any concrete proposals came from the OECD regarding the scandal of the extent of youth unemployment throughout the European Union, particularly in the so-called peripheral states, the victims of austerity, where up to half the young people available for work are unemployed.  Can he outline whether, apart from platitudes by the OECD establishment, there were any proposals for concrete investment in those societies that would lead to young people finding meaningful work and a decent future which the current system does not give them?<\/p><p>This also relates to the issue of corporation tax.  I do not know if the Taoiseach reads the international financial press, but there have been articles about the massive extent of accumulated profits by major corporations that lie in banks and other financial institutions around the world.  In the case of Europe, for example, an estimated &euro;3 trillion is not invested by European corporations within the EU but is running around the banking system.  That is because those corporations judge it is not sufficiently profitable for them to invest in infrastructure or new employment and jobs.  <\/p><p> That begs the question of whether a different and new tax regime is needed, not just in this country but also throughout Europe.  Those companies should be taxed at a much higher rate so that those funds, which in any case are earned by the hands and brains of working people around Europe, should be available for public investment, for example, in major infrastructural projects which are desperately needed in every European country.  That would put literally millions of people to work.  <\/p><p> Is that not a crying condemnation of the type of corporate tax regime that the Taoiseach and his Government insist on keeping in this country?  The headline rate here is among the lowest in the EU.  Nobody believes the Taoiseach or the institution of paid advisors when they say the effective rate is 11.9%.  Everybody knows that there is a huge tax scam going on in this country as far as major corporations are concerned.  Professor Stewart of Trinity College put the corporate tax rate between 2% and 3%, while Social Justice Ireland put it at 6.2%.  If we are generous and say that the effective corporate tax rate is 8%, based on 2012 figures every percentage extra they would pay would be &euro;525 million.  Therefore if they paid the full rate of 12.5%, which is a derisory amount, it would be &euro;2 billion extra.<\/p><p> Does the Taoiseach not agree that in a country that is crucified by austerity, where our people are hurting badly through massive extra taxation, property tax and the projected water tax, these funds should be taxed?  Given the current situation, corporations should be made to pay.  The Taoiseach's position in blankly stating that 12.5% is adequate as a headline rate and that corporations here pay about that rate, is completely unsustainable.  <\/p><p> Does the Taoiseach not understand that an increasing subject of discussion, debate and controversy around the world, but particularly in Europe and the United States, is the growing inequality between the tiny elite, 1% to 5% of populations, at the top who continue to accumulate massive wealth even in years of austerity, while ordinary people suffer?  Society and services are also suffering.  Will it ever dawn on the Taoiseach to point out these issues at EU fora, rather than being part of the current establishment regime's thinking which is hugely destructive of society?  It is giving rise to massive and growing inequality, and is actually criminal.  Does the Taoiseach see no responsibility for the Irish Government there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700024#W00200","speaker":"954","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403026200,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Higgins for his comments.

The details of this have been considered at length by the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Social Protection.  The OECD was critical of the Government regarding the lack of action concerning labour activation measures, as they call them.  The EU and the IMF criticised us to some extent in this regard also.  By and large, however, international organisations have been supportive of the approach taken by the Government to reduce unemployment and boost job creation.  We always welcome advice, ideas and recommendations on how we might improve our performance in that context.<\/p><p>  The Pathways to Work programme will remain a central feature of the Government's jobs plan in 2014.  The OECD's input will have an important role as we refine that and examine it for the future.  In late 2013, the OECD was commissioned to provide a commentary on Irish youth employment policies and to advise on the implementation of the EU recommendation about a youth guarantee for employment.  That work was completed at the end of 2013 and was a helpful input into drawing up the youth guarantee implementation plan, which was approved by Government and published in January this year.<\/p><p>  The OECD also regularly advised on aspects of Irish labour market policy, as was the case in its economic survey of Ireland published last year, and most recently in its review of the action plan for jobs.  In that review, the OECD was positive in its assessment of labour market reforms but concluded that more needed to be done.  There is nothing new about that.  This view is shared by the Government, as evidenced by the additional measures being taken under the Pathways to Work 2013 programme.  These include the extension of activation to those who are long-term unemployed and the continuing reallocation of staff to frontline activation work.  Some 300 additional case officers were put in place in late 2013.  All elements of the Pathways to Work programme will be reviewed and, if necessary, augmented and refined in Pathways to Work 2014 which is due around the middle of the year.<\/p><p>  I have dealt before in detail with the question of the effective rate of corporation tax here coming down to 11.9%.  The Deputy has estimated evidence to the contrary and we have discussed that before.  The ones that really count, however, put Ireland's effective rate at approximately 11.9%, which is very close to 12.5%.  It obviously depends on the statistics used.  We are a small but important entity in a very big world where different jurisdictions, regimes and tax rates apply.  Many companies are involved in multi-country situations, which is why Ireland has been up front in recognising that we need to deal with this in a fair and equitable fashion.  That is why we contribute to the 15 sectoral committees the OECD is working on.<\/p><p>I am very happy to defend the Commission investigation into a specific technical issue relating to a specific company.  It is fair to say that a great deal of international finance is sloshing around the system, much of which is available for investment.  One of the problems about Ireland is that it has never produced the range of projects that would draw sufficient funds for investment in infrastructure.  That is why I was glad to see that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation were in a position to put together significant packages for investment through stimulus, whether for road developments, bundles of schools or the Grangegorman development in Dublin city centre.  These major investment requirements will draw on elements of the finance that is out there.<\/p><p> Our position is that we are continuing to maintain our corporate tax rate and are dealing robustly with the Commission investigation.  We will work upfront and comprehensively with the OECD and other countries.  At the European Council meeting at which this was agreed last year, there was agreement from everybody, including countries that were silent on the matter in the past, that an international response is needed on the issue of tax regimes in different countries and the different rates that apply.<\/p><p> The projections for Ireland in the coming period are interesting.  The unemployment rate is projected to decrease to 11.5% in 2014, 10.5% in 2015, 9.7% in 2016 and 8% by 2018.  That is in keeping with the medium-term economic strategy that the Government published when we exited the programme of assistance at the end of last year.  Our projections for growth and GDP and GNP are set out in the economic programme up to 2018.  The emphasis this year is on construction, services and retail, as well as the efforts now being made by the Government to put together an exciting programme in respect of the construction to deal with housing, social housing and other infrastructures.  I hope this will bring about significant job creation for people who are on the unemployment register and were previously involved in various aspects of the construction sector, and for those who come with new skills and new ways of dealing with this.  That is all part of the fabric of the Government's work to create more jobs, increase income and continue to grow and strengthen our economy to make it easier for the Minister for Finance to meet the targets we have set ourselves of reducing the deficit to below 3% by 2015 and eliminating it by 2018.  I do not accept the assertion of the independent Fiscal Advisory Council that the rate of projection we have is faster than the EU's.  We set out our targets in the medium-term economic plan and we expect to be able to adhere to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700025#X00500","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403026800,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I have just come from a meeting of the Joint Sub-Committee on Global Taxation, to which Professor Jim Stewart was giving evidence.  He was asked by Deputies from various parties to back up his assertion that the real corporate tax rate in this country - the so-called effective rate - is only 2.2%.  He was categorical about it.  Whereas the Government claims the corporate tax rate is 11.9%, virtually every international commentator and a minority of us in this House say that is nonsense and that, in reality, these big multinationals are paying a fraction of that amount.  Professor Stewart was absolutely clear in stating the figure was much closer to 2.2%.  He pointed out that in Irish tax law - not American tax law or any other country's law - the norm is that if a company is incorporated in this country, it is deemed to be tax resident here and that foreign-owned companies are the only exception to that norm.  It appears that a different set of rules is applied to foreign-owned companies.  There is one law for Irish companies and another law for the multinationals.<\/p><p>  That double standard in how we judge companies' liabilities for tax purposes allows them to shift massive amounts of profits abroad and to claim the profits are made in the Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands or Bermuda when, as Professor Stewart pointed out, these companies have employees here in respect of whom they pay PRSI, they pay VAT and they occupy offices in this country.  Somehow, they claim they are owned and controlled in Bermuda or the British Virgin Islands, where they have no offices or employees, and do not even have telephone numbers.  The Revenue Commissioners simply conclude they are owned and controlled in the Cayman Islands or the Virgin Islands.  He rightly pointed out this is not a reasonable assessment of where they are owned and controlled.  In so far as one can reasonably allocate their profits, any reasonable person would say those profits should be allocated here.  Irish tax law states that a company incorporated here is normally regarded as tax resident.<\/p><p>  Is it not obvious that we are facilitating incredible tax evasion from these multinational companies?  That option is not available to Irish companies and small and medium enterprises.  It is solely available to enormously profitable multinationals.  I would like to hear the Taoiseach's response to that.  Professor Stewart was very convincing and he knew the Irish tax code very well.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could explain further.  Professor Stewart also suggested that while we may not be the only country that could be described as having features of a tax haven, we are in the same category as Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland, all of which are also being investigated for being tax havens or countries with the features of tax havens.  The way in which we interpret and apply our tax laws is facilitating this.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach stated that we do not have brass plate companies.  I discussed this subject with Professor Stewart in a telephone conversation, and he confirmed in his submission to the sub-committee and in a radio interview that one could wallpaper one's house with all the brass plate companies in the IFSC.  He put flesh on the bones of that when he pointed out that there are &euro;2.1 trillion in assets in the IFSC.  He asked why these assets do not show up on the national accounts.  If even 1% of these assets appeared on the national accounts, they would amount to &euro;20 billion.  As the assets do not appear in the national accounts, clearly the companies are not paying taxes on them in any substantial way.  Is that not the definition of a brass plate company?  I ask the Taoiseach to explain that to us.  It strongly suggests that, contrary to his assertion, the IFSC is thronged with brass plate companies which have no real linkages with the Irish economy.  We cannot claim they are making a great contribution at any level to the economy.<\/p><p>As Professor Stewart pointed out, they are here purely because it is easy to minimise tax liability in this State.  In that sense we are again displaying features, as he put it, of a tax haven.  The allegations being made against us have serious substance, although it is important to note they are not just being made against us, and they are also levelled at Holland, Luxembourg and Switzerland.  We are at the top of the league table but in a race to the bottom on corporate tax issues and allowing multinationals to facilitate these practices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700026#Y00200","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403027400,"counter":318,"content":"<p>There is only a minute left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700027#Z00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1403027400,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Sure.

This is the Act used in setting up the banking inquiry.

Earlier today, there were 32 people on trolleys at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  That figure, which represents an increase of 25 on yesterday's figure, is almost double what it was last Friday.  These figures are recorded and monitored by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation.  No other hospital in the country has as many people on trolleys today as Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  University Hospital Limerick was in second place with 22.  Given that there are 210 patients on trolleys across the country as a whole, it is clear that Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital accounts for one in seven patients on trolleys.  The figures compiled by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation indicate that 1,855 people spent time on trolleys between January and April of this year.  This compares to a figure of 1,397 for the same period in 2013.<\/p><p>  Last week, this House debated the overcrowding and the cramped conditions at University Hospital Limerick.  I am pleased this week to have an opportunity to raise the very serious problems at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  We are continually receiving complaints from our constituents in counties Louth and Meath, and from people further afield, about the serious problems with accident and emergency facilities at the hospital.  The Irish Association for Emergency Medicine has mentioned the possibility of accident and emergency department closures this summer, as budgetary measures aimed at making savings in the general health area take effect.  The association has warned that accident and emergency units will face a perfect storm if staffing meltdown is accompanied by the possibility of closures.  This is extremely serious.<\/p><p>  I am glad the Minister for Health is present to respond to what I have to say.  He is quite familiar with Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which is just down the road from his own constituency in Fingal.  I am sure a few of his constituents have had cause to use the accident and emergency facilities at the hospital.  As he will be aware, the hospital's huge catchment area extends not only across counties Louth and Meath, but also to the north of County Dublin and the south of County Monaghan.  Perhaps some people have to come from further afield to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  The reality is that the accident and emergency facilities at the hospital are overcrowded and the level of staff cover is seriously inadequate.  I predict that a very serious crisis will arise at the hospital sooner or later when it proves impossible to admit patients to the hospital in emergency situations because an adequate level of staff to cater for their immediate needs is not available.<\/p><p>  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is one of the busiest hospitals in the country.  While people who ring my constituency office accept that the hospital is fine or excellent when they get into mainstream treatment there, they are concerned that it has become a huge challenge to get through the accident and emergency department.  The whole concept of requiring people who are more than 80 years of age to lie on trolleys for ten or 12 hours at a time is simply unacceptable in this day and age.  We all accept that savings and curtailments are necessary, but certain areas need to be prioritised in that context.  I suggest that the area of accident and emergency should be a clear priority within the health service.  People receive excellent care in the mainstream hospital service after they have finally overcome the huge challenge of coming through the accident and emergency unit.  As I said earlier, I am pleased that the Minister is here to take this Topical Issue matter because he is quite familiar with the problems at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  I appeal to him to ask the HSE immediately to examine the adequacy of staff cover at the hospital.  We know that measures are clearly needed to address this problem immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700029#BB00250","speaker":"945"},{"type":"speech","time":1403028600,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  In common with many hospitals, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda has experienced an increase in attendances at its emergency department in the current year.  For hospitals like Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital that serve populations with significant numbers of high acuity elderly patients presenting with complex co-morbidities, the requirement to admit patients is similarly high.  The nature of these patients' needs may require longer than average lengths of stay.  Patient experience times at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital are roughly in line with national patient experience times.  Approximately 70% of patients are discharged home or admitted within six hours.  Some 81.4% of patients are discharged home or admitted within nine hours.  Despite the increases I mentioned at the outset, the number of patients waiting for ward bed accommodation has decreased by 15.4% in the last three years.  The Deputy quite rightly pointed out that it is unacceptable to have patients on trolleys for eight to ten hours.  While I agree with him, he should acknowledge that such waiting times represent a huge improvement on the waiting times of three or four days that were experienced when he was in government.<\/p><p>  The special delivery unit has worked intensively with management and staff at the hospital.  A variety of initiatives which address many of the needs of the local population have been introduced.  A cross-sectoral group that will focus on frail and vulnerable elderly patients, with representatives from the community, private nursing homes, the acute sector and groups such as Alzheimer's disease carers, has been established.  The HSE is seeking to expedite the recruitment of nurses, particularly for the emergency department and for critical care.  Internal medicine services have been reconfigured to enable acute medicine assessment unit physicians to manage all acute medicine assessment unit and short-stay medical unit patients.  An additional acute medicine physician has been recruited to further extend these services.  Twice-weekly medical census meetings and once-weekly surgical and orthopaedic census meetings, led by the clinical director, have been introduced.  At these meetings, an overview of each inpatient's care takes place and potential impediments to their discharge are discussed.  Ten private nursing home beds have been purchased for the provision of orthopaedic rehabilitation following hip fractures.  This service also utilises a physiotherapist.  It has significantly reduced orthopaedic patients' length of stay at the hospital.<\/p><p>  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is making progress in implementing all elements of the emergency medicine programme.  Practice changes and patient pathways that have been put in place for acute medicine remain very effective.  A recent audit undertaken by the quality and patient safety audit validated the hospital's full compliance with the acute medicine programme.  The overall length of stay in medicine, surgery and orthopaedics is well within the targets set nationally and by the clinical care programmes.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital recently got planning permission for the second phase of its planned expansion, which will provide an enlarged emergency department and 60 en suite single accommodation rooms which are fully compliant with the strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland.  The hospital is actively bringing NCHD rosters into compliance with the requirements of the European working time directive.

The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive are focused on implementing the Government's reform programme for acute hospitals, including the organisation of these hospitals into a small number of groups, each with its own governance and management, to provide an optimum configuration for the delivery of high-quality, safe patient care in a cost effective manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700029#BB00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403029200,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I find it very difficult to accept the Minister's assertion that patient experience timelines at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital are broadly in line with national timelines.

The SDU has visited the hospital in the past and listened to suggestions from staff for service improvements, taking on board those which made immediate sense, asking for a better price on the provision of certain services and dismissing proposals that did not make any sense financially.  That review encompassed such issues as community nursing facilities, home help provision, home care packages and even community intervention teams to deliver intravenous antibiotics to patients at home so they would not have to stay in hospital for long periods, thereby freeing up beds to allow for more admissions from the emergency department.

The meeting was to discuss their concerns that the drug they are currently taking to alleviate the symptoms of MS, Fampyra, will no longer be available free of cost as a result of its manufacturer, Biogen, being refused access to the general medical services scheme by the Health Service Executive.  Having tabled this matter for discussion yesterday, I learned this morning that Biogen has reapplied for inclusion in the GMS scheme, which is great news.  I also welcome the indication last week by the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, of his openness to a new application by Biogen and his acknowledgment of the serious impact the refusal of its application is having on some of the 8,000 MS sufferers in this country.<\/p><p>  People have experienced an incredibly positive impact on their condition from taking this drug and are now in fear that they will no longer have access to it in the coming weeks.  Will the Minister give an assurance today that he will ask the HSE to fast-track Biogen's application for inclusion in the GMS scheme?  In the meantime, it is my intention to ask the company publicly to continue to provide its product free of charge, for the duration of the application process, to the people on whom it is having such a positive impact.  The two women I met last week - I am sure the Minister has heard similar testimony from other Deputies - spoke movingly of the impact the drug has had on their health.  One of them is younger than me and has a young child.  I have been unable to stop thinking of her description of being able, for the first time ever, to plait her daughter's hair.  It can seem like a small and insignificant thing to people like me to be able to brush our children's hair every day and make their lunches, but to this woman it was an enormous achievement.  Now she faces the prospect of once again being unable to do it because she cannot afford to pay for the drug.  Moreover, without access to this medicine, she will be unable to work and will be entitled to a &euro;785 per month disability benefit payment.  She is young and full of vitality and wants to return to work.<\/p><p>  I am asking for the Minister's commitment that he will request the HSE to fast-track this process.

The HSE will consider the application on receipt, in line with the agreed procedures and timescales for the assessment of new medicines.  The Deputy has indicated that the company submitted a revised application today.<\/p><p>  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drugs schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  The HSE has already considered an application for the inclusion of Fampyra in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  This application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by my Department and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, for the assessment of new medicines.  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampyra and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate its cost effectiveness in the Irish health care setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product.  The report is available on the NCPE's website.<\/p><p>  The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable.  In these circumstances, the HSE has not approved the reimbursement of Fampyra under the community drugs schemes.  I understand studies are ongoing to assess the wider impact of the drug on both walking ability and quality of life for persons diagnosed with MS.  I acknowledge the Deputy's clear testament in this regard.  The results of these studies will contribute to the evidence base demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of Fampyra, which can be used to support future applications for its inclusion on the lists of reimbursable items supplied under the community drugs schemes.  In this context, it is open to the manufacturer at any time to submit a new application to the HSE for its product's inclusion.  As we have heard, it did so this morning.<\/p><p>  I assure the Deputy that I, and the HSE, fully understand that patients are very anxious that this product be made available under the community drugs schemes.

I would like to make a few general points.  The Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association and the Irish pharmaceutical sector are very important to this country, but we have a problem in that we have a very limited budget.  We have just exited a bailout and the pressures of the health budget are well known.  In the context of Fampyra, there are more than 7,000 people with multiple sclerosis, and at a cost of &euro;6,000 each, it is &euro;42 million per annum, which is an awful lot of money.  For how many of these people will this drug be successful?<\/p><p>  I would like to see the pharmaceutical industry engage in risk sharing so that in situations where there is a drug which we can prove by way of a blood test, a biopsy or an independent clinical assessment of the activities of daily living, such as walking distances, that it really improves the situation for patients, we will pay for those patients.  However, what about the two thirds or the four fifths of patients for whom it does not work?  Are we to pay from them also?  Where is the role of the industry in this?  Why does it not join us in terms of sharing the risk and if it does not work, let us negotiate what we will pay for those, if anything at all?<\/p><p>  For a long time patients have looked to the Government to provide care and it is our duty to provide it, but I would like to appeal to patient groups to join the Government to ensure the new medicines which become available are made affordable for us to provide to our people and that the pharmaceutical industry engages in risk sharing in regard to these very expensive and sometimes hugely effective drugs that can have a life changing impact on people's daily activities which, as a doctor, I fully accept.  However, I appeal to the pharmaceutical industry to engage with the health service in a way that these drugs become available at an affordable price for those who can avail of them and will benefit from them and that we look at some other way to deal with the high risk to the system for all those who use these drugs but do not get any benefit from them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700031#DD00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Levels","time":1403029800,"counter":442,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700031#DD00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1403029800,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to address this matter.  I would like to start by quoting a letter I sent to the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, on 29 August 2013.<blockquote>Dear Minister<br \/><br \/>I wish to refer to gang slayings in the city.  These are occurring with a regularity that now breeds acceptance.  This is proof to the criminals who profit from these barbarous acts that it is their will alone that determines the limits to this behaviour.<br \/><br \/>Paralleling the criminals' acceptance at these new norms that they have established to serve their own ends is an acceptance by civil society that a frightening new layer of brutality has become an integral part of contemporary urban life.<br \/><br \/>Decent people are silently seething that their communities, which act as a backdrop to these shootings, are being redefined by criminal behaviour to an extent that civic pride and community wellbeing is being undermined.<br \/><br \/>The government now must demonstrate that the will of the 99 per cent can prevail.  Slaying at the whim of these criminals must be stopped.  Limerick offers a glowing example of how the tide can be successfully turned.<\/blockquote>Deputy Dowds and I had a meeting with the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, after that but there was no discernible outcome.<\/p><p>The subject matter of this letter - gun crime - was brutally illustrated last Friday evening when a young child in Cherry Orchard was hit by gun fire.  How ironic that any child should be in danger on his own doorstep.  The very place where he should feel safest was attacked.  A sanctuary was breached.  Little Sean is still in hospital and, hopefully, he will soon be back home safe and well.  Of course, we wish to send him our best wishes.  Gun fire in the proximity of children is quite a frequent occurrence in the city.  Recently when children were being dropped off at a cr&egrave;che in Donaghmede gun fire erupted.  This is a reckless practice which must be halted.<\/p><p>I wish to refer to a linked matter, namely, to a fear people have that their area can be somehow defined by the occurrence of brutalising incidents such as that which happened in Cherry Orchard last Friday evening.  In that regard, I would like to say a few words about Cherry Orchard.  Some 30 years ago, when people first moved into this new estate, there were only houses.  The streets, footpaths and street lighting were unfinished.  It did not have shops, a school, a church, facilities, a bus service and playgrounds.  Some 30 years later, through the efforts of residents, the area has been transformed and, with the assistance of Dublin City Council, there are splendid parks and very good playgrounds.  It has one of the most pioneering schools in the country, St. Ultan's, a youth orchestra which regularly performs at the National Concert Hall and one of the country's leading amateur soccer clubs, which is regularly visited by scouts from English league clubs, is based there.<\/p><p>All of this is the outcome of dedication, commitment and hard work by the people engaged in community building, the people of Cherry Orchard and the parish priest, Father O'Connor, over a 30 year period.  Cherry Orchard needs the Minister's help.  It needs more garda&iacute; and more resources to counter some of the activities which have been referred to.<\/p><p>I would like the Minister to consider visiting Cherry Orchard to meet the people, which they would like, and to talk directly to them and discuss how serious outstanding issues can be tackled by them with her support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700031#DD00300","speaker":"1031"},{"type":"speech","time":1403029800,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Conaghan and &Oacute; Snodaigh for raising this important matter.  I would like to record my outrage at the appalling incident last Friday where a young child was shot at Croftwood Gardens, Ballyfermot.  As the Deputies know, a major Garda investigation is under way.  I spoke to the acting Garda Commissioner about this incident when I met her yesterday and she assured me progress is being made with all necessary resources deployed.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is determined to bring to justice those involved and I know it has the full support of the local community in identifying the perpetrators.  Clearly, anyone who has information which could be helpful to the Garda should pass this on immediately.<\/p><p>  I am further advised that a Garda liaison officer has been appointed to assist the family and that an incident room has been established in Ballyfermot Garda station to investigate this incident which is being overseen by a senior investigating officer.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy rightly said, gun crime represents a real challenge for policing and poses significant potential for harm in the community, in this case, unfortunately, in the form of very serious injuries to a young child.<\/p><p>Garda strategy for tackling gun crime involves targeted and intelligence-based operations, often disrupting and preventing incidents before harm is caused, as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved.  Much of this work goes unheralded but it is carried out with great determination by the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who can themselves face great risk in taking on armed criminals.<\/p><p> The robust Garda response to violent crime has led to firearms offences decreasing last year by 7%, and the number of crime incidents in which a firearm was involved was also down, by more than 7%.  However, I accept all the points made by Deputy Conaghan on the horrific nature of the incident.  The precise deployment of resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I have discussed the policing situation in Ballyfermot in general terms with her and been assured that the Garda is working with the community and providing the best possible support on the ground.  I am informed that at present there are 198 garda&iacute; in the Clondalkin-Ballyfermot district.<\/p><p> The sale and possession of legally held firearms in this jurisdiction is highly regulated.  However, my Department is currently conducting a review of firearms legislation after which I will engage in broader consultations ahead of preparing any legislative changes arising from the review.  Ahead of completion of the review, I would point out that our criminal law already rightly provides heavy penalties for weapons offences and mandatory minimum penalties are in place for certain firearms offences.  The Garda also has considerable powers available to it in tackling serious and armed crime, and they have been supplemented further by the recent DNA database legislation which has just been passed in both Houses.  The Bill was completed last week in the Seanad.  When established, the DNA database will have the capacity to link suspects to unsolved crimes using forensic evidence, and will greatly assist the Garda in investigating crime.<\/p><p> The acting Garda Commissioner is aware that if she believes other legislative measures or steps would assist in tackling armed and serious crime they will be given the most serious consideration by me.  I take serious note of the views expressed by the Deputy during the debate.  Our thoughts are with the family of the young victim of this shooting.  We are concerned with the well-being of the family during this very difficult period and look forward to the recovery of the victim.  I visited St. Ultan's in the past.  I am very struck by the range of initiatives and work that, as Deputy Conaghan, rightly pointed out, has been done by the community of Cherry Orchard in the past 30 years and the significant community work in which everyone engages.  Deputy Conaghan is familiar with the work the Garda is doing with local youth groups.  The local youth diversion programme has proved very successful.  There are also two major Garda operations in the area: Operation Hybrid and Operation Domino, which are both designed to provide a proactive response to organised crime in the Dublin metropolitan region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700031#DD00400","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403030400,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response which was very knowledgeable and informed.

Their conditions are deteriorating daily.  Approximately 80 hunger strikers have been hospitalised and many are in grave danger of losing their lives.  The Israeli state is now trying to pass legislation that will allow the force-feeding of the strikers which prisoners have labelled a form of torture.  Amnesty International and other groups around the world have said the same.  The latest update I received some minutes ago from Palestine is that the Bill has passed the second and third reading in the Knesset and may very well be introduced into law by Monday.<\/p><p>  It is the longest mass hunger strike among prisoners in Palestinian history and the hunger strikers remain steadfast in their demands to end the policy of administrative detention.  I ask the Minister to condemn Israel&rsquo;s widespread use of administrative detention which is in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention which states that internment can be used &quot;only if security of the detaining power makes it absolutely necessary&quot;.  Amnesty International has called Israel&rsquo;s administrative detention arbitrary detention that fails to fulfil the international criteria for a just trial, and inhumane and degrading and it notes that Israel uses it to suppress the legitimate and peaceful activities of activists.<\/p><p>  I have been informed that the 80 detainees who have now been taken to hospital had intrusive body searches.  The cells in which they were kept were below basic standards.  I believe those who have been taken to hospital have been shackled hand and foot to their beds.  That is an outrage and an appalling human tragedy.<\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, has constantly spoken on the inhuman treatment of the Palestinian people in general.  Israel appears to listen to no one.  As of 2008, Israel was in violation of 30 UN Security Council resolutions and 60 UN resolutions.  The manner in which Israel treats the Palestinians would not be tolerated from any other state in the world.  It is appalling and unacceptable.  Given this country&rsquo;s record in condemning human rights violations around the world, the time has come for us to call in the Israeli ambassador and make it clear to him that we will not accept people, some as young as 17 years of age, being arrested without charge, interned without charge and tortured.  Prisoners have a right not to accept food under protest yet the state has gone so far as to commence the introduction of a law to force-feed the detainees.  Ireland is a country that has always stood up for human rights around the world and condemned the Israelis.  It is not good enough to simply show our concern, as some have suggested.  We must express our condemnation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700032#EE00500","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1403031000,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Halligan for raising this issue which I am taking on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore.<\/p><p>  The Government has consistently made clear its concerns about the use of administrative detention by the Israeli authorities.  This is a practice which Israel has resorted to for many years and the numbers so detained have fluctuated according to the prevailing security situation on the ground.  Some 190 Palestinians are held in administrative detention.  The hunger strikes by Palestinian prisoners which began on 24 April were directly prompted by what the prisoners claim was Israel's failure to make progress in reconsidering the use of administrative detention, particularly following the conclusion of the last Palestinian hunger strikes in 2012.<\/p><p>  Israel is undeniably faced with serious security challenges and therefore may have recourse legitimately in exceptional circumstances to special powers.  However, there are clear grounds for concern that administrative detention is being used in some cases to suppress legitimate dissent and protest.  The instances of repeated extensions of detention orders can also mean individuals may be detained for prolonged periods, even several years, without ever having charges laid against them.  The use of intelligence material as sole evidence for the decisions by military tribunals can result in denial of access to prosecution evidence to the detainees and their legal representatives.  Any system in which a person can be imprisoned for years with no means to challenge the basis of their detention is clearly unacceptable.<\/p><p>  Ireland has repeatedly drawn attention to these concerns with administrative detention both directly with the Israeli authorities and in discussions at EU or UN level, including in the UN Human Rights Council last March where our national statement under item No. 7 made clear our long-standing concerns about this practice.  Ireland has also raised this issue in EU discussions on the Middle East and ensured the EU also has explicitly criticised on several occasions in recent years, the excessive use by Israel of administrative detention.  There has been a significant reduction in the use of the practice by Israel in recent years but the problem remains a serious one.  We will continue to make known our concerns about the practice overall to the Israeli authorities at all appropriate opportunities.<\/p><p>  There have been repeated protests by Palestinian detainees in recent years over the use of administrative detention.  In common with our EU partners, we have encouraged the parties to engage in negotiations which address the legitimate complaints of the detainees and to avoid any provocative actions which would risk the health or life of the detainees.  Our missions in Tel Aviv and Ramallah remain in contact with civil society groups dealing with prisoners' rights, including the issues of administrative detention and hunger strikes, as well as working with our international partners to support progress on these very difficult issues.<\/p><p>  The use of hunger strikes is a very dangerous tactic which we cannot encourage.  It is notable the Israeli authorities have responded to recent hunger strikes in a manner to avoid the death of any prisoner.  They are clearly alert to this danger but there must always be a very strong risk, particularly with repeated hunger strikes, that the authorities will eventually conclude that they must make a stand, and refuse to compromise further.  This is perhaps a particular danger at this moment when the Israeli Government and public are, understandably, strongly focused on the abduction of three teenagers who are still missing and whose safe return we all hope for.<\/p><p>  It is the case that a draft Bill to permit the force feeding of hunger strikers has been submitted to the Israeli Knesset.  However, no final decision on its approval has yet been taken by the Knesset.  The Israeli Medical Association has declared, as have several human rights groups, that force-feeding is in breach of medical ethical standards.  There is some expectation that any possible new law might be challenged in the Israeli courts on the grounds of its constitutionality.  We would strongly urge the Israeli authorities to refrain from the force-feeding of hunger strikers in the event of parliamentary approval of this proposed law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700033#FF00100","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1403031000,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comprehensive response to this serious issue.  It is appropriate there are several former Israeli soldiers, Breaking the Silence, in Dublin today who gave a presentation as to how they were forced to treat Palestinians and violate their human rights.  Ireland never stands idly by and always opposes the violation of human rights.  The chances of Israel paying any attention to us, however, are remote when it is already in breach of over 90 UN and UN Security Council resolutions.  It is important, none the less, that we make it known to the Israeli ambassador to Ireland and the Israeli Government that we will not tolerate the force-feeding of hunger strikers and the detention of individuals without charge.  From the information I received today, I note some of those hunger strikers, even though they are critically ill, are being constantly asked to eat.  When they refuse, their guards eat the food in front of them.  It is appalling what is happening in these hospitals in Israel.<\/p><p>  I condemn the recent abduction of three Israeli students and hope they are returned safely.  I condemn all violence from all sides.  The history of violence against Palestinians by Israeli forces has been well-documented by various Ministers for Foreign Affairs, from Deputy Martin to Deputy Gilmore and others.

Because HAP tenancies will be governed by the Residential Tenancies Act these requirements will also apply to HAP tenancies.  Rather than replicate an existing provision, under section 55 I have provided for a specific provision for the exchange of information between housing authorities and the PRTB as a named specified person under the section for the purpose of enabling both to carry out their statutory functions.  In this context I expect housing authorities to provide periodically to the PRTB a list of properties in respect of which HAP payments are being made so it can ensure these tenancies are appropriately registered and allow it fulfil its statutory function where the tenancies have not been registered.

Essentially, the legislation limits the amount from the Exchequer on an annual basis and a dangerous lack of flexibility in this regard is evident at present.  This provision seeks a much more flexible arrangement whereby the local authorities will consider the limits every three months and in the case of less than 10% of available rental accommodation being accessible, there must be intervention or a relaxation of the rent caps.  I do not know whether the Minister of State does this but I find myself accessing <i>daft.ie<\/i>three or four times a week to ascertain whether anything is available for individuals within the rent caps and invariably, I find there is not.  I understand this legislation pertains to the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme and not the rent supplement scheme but it is being governed by the same type of caps.  Consequently, one can expect the same situation will arise.  One then is informed there will be a review, which will be undertaken every 18 months.  However, that is not all that helpful to someone who has a problem now and is at risk of becoming, or in many cases has become, homeless.<\/p><p>This amendment attempts to introduce a level of flexibility and in this context, I looked at the Labour Party's local election manifesto which states: &quot;We will seek the urgent return [of] flexibility at ... local level in terms of rent caps to tackle displacement and allow discretion to be applied by Community Welfare Officers.&quot;  The Minister for Social Protection, who is a member of the Labour Party, has responsibility in this regard and this is in that party's manifesto.  All I seek is for such flexibility to be applied to the legislation, which would be in keeping with the Labour Party view according to this manifesto.  I believe this must be done if one is to avoid the extremely rigid application of something that evidently is posing so many problems at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700035#HH01000","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1403032200,"counter":488,"content":"<p>One issue is that the State will continue to have a substantial proportion of the rented properties, estimated at approximately 33%, whether through HAP or through long-term rent supplement.  However, the main focus of any rental limit review process must be to ensure that pricing of maximum rental limits does not distort the market, while at the same time providing opportunities for tenants to acquire accommodation.  Its purpose is to get that balance right.  Due care must be taken that pricing be established by natural supply and demand conditions, as opposed to by reference to the State's intervention, in order to avoid setting maximum rental limits that could force families, especially those on low incomes, into competing with pricing floors they cannot afford.  The current policy for maximum rental limits within the rent supplement scheme is an 18 month cycle.  The timing of 18 months represents a balance between the rental arrangements of tenants, as tenancy agreements normally are for approximately one year, and the need to ensure sufficient reviews to keep apace of the market.  A shorter period to review maximum rental limits, for example, quarterly, would place a significant degree of ongoing pressure to change rental agreements mid-agreement on tenants and landlords alike.  The cycle of how long the agreement lasts is part of the consideration.<\/p><p>  In addition, rents fall as well as rise - this might be a lovely dream at this point in time - but in declining markets, tenants would be forced to consider alternative accommodation as landlords continued to seek previous rents agreed.  It must be remembered that rents can increase as well as decrease and reviewing maximum rental limits on a quarterly basis would not allow the market any time to adjust naturally to the imposition of new limits, therefore distorting the natural market rent level.  I suppose this is a judgment call in terms of not intervening too often and not having what are now called caps affect or distort the market unduly - if there still are caps in respect of HAP - and to take account of the fact that were they to be reviewed regularly, this would happen in a time of declining rents, as well as a time of increasing rents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700035#HH01100","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1403032200,"counter":489,"content":"<p>The fact that 33% of rental properties involve people who basically should have social housing is a scandal in its own right.

Nobody of the Deputy's political persuasion or mine would see this as an ideal situation by any means.  I have said it many times that we do not have the cash at the moment to provide housing in any large numbers through the voluntary sector or the local authorities.

Unfortunately, the problems with the caps are spreading out into County Kildare and many areas around Dublin.  This issue of review is a pertinent one.  When one further considers that the consequences of not having a review for the people who are affected currently is homelessness or the threat of homelessness, then manifestly there is a need to have a greater degree of flexibility, as set out by Deputy Murphy, than what is envisaged in the Minister of State's legislation.

Having flexibility in cases where people are at risk of homelessness seems to me to be a very sensible approach to the whole issue of rent caps.  It does not make sense to have people in hotels instead of being able to stay where they are and have the flexibility of the rent cap.  The problem with raising or lowering rent caps, as the case may be, on a three-monthly basis is that one is influencing the market - I am sorry to call it a market but that is what it is essentially - in so far as there is a danger that landlords will simply increase the prices as they are unlikely to decrease the prices.  Even where there is an agreement between the landlord and tenant for a year, for example, a three-monthly review would interfere with that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700036#JJ00700","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1403032800,"counter":497,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Murphy wish to make a further contribution?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700036#JJ00800","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1403032800,"counter":498,"content":"<p>The Minister of State did not say if she was willing to consider a period of more than three months and whether an amendment can be tabled in the Seanad.

It is already starting to happen.  Where landlords who are in arrangements with the local authority through the HAP scheme decide, as they undoubtedly will on a regular basis, to pull out of those arrangements for whatever reason, the local authority will be overwhelmed with tenants to whom it has an obligation but who it simply has no means to house.  The local authorities do not have the local authority housing stock and they do not have other private landlords with whom they will be able to house tenants.  This will increase the pressure on the local authorities to push tenants into accepting accommodation which they should not have to accept and then if the tenants do not accept it, they will be penalised.

If a person is offered a house within those communities and turns it down, that is one refusal.  There are various reasons people might turn down an offer of housing.  Their circumstances might change.  For instance, a spouse or partner may have suffered ill health in the past six to 12 months.  I have come across a case where somebody had a heart attack and turned down a housing offer because the property was on a hill with no bus service.  They may return to the city council and change their area of preference but that is still deemed as one refusal on their record.  When another offer is made they are left in a dilemma either to accept or have no hope of being rehoused.  Two offers is therefore very limited.  On the second offer, regardless of what type of property is being offered, the person must choose either to accept it or, in the case of Cork City Council, become ineligible for consideration for housing for up to two years.  Under the old scheme, the welfare officer was also informed if a person was in receipt of rent allowance.<\/p><p>  There are major issues involved.  In Cork City Council the refusal rate for housing is running at 40%.  People are not being offered suitable accommodation because the local authority does not have any such accommodation to meet people's needs.  Half of Cork City Council's housing list comprises single people, men and women, who rarely receive offers of housing.  When they do, it usually in substandard accommodation even by local authority standards.  They have no choice but to refuse those offers.

It will be essential to monitor this experiment to ensure it is not allowed continue if it is seen to fail.<\/p><p> We have not seen the results of the Limerick city pilot.  I know that one of the seven other pilots will involve a large city authority which should give some sense of the difference between large and small authorities.  There should be ongoing monitoring.  The Government is undertaking large regeneration schemes where there were failures in housing policy, but we should not allow this to continue if it is seen not to be the solution to the housing problem.  I do not believe it will solve the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700041#OO00100","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403035500,"counter":530,"content":"<p>Some of us believe that this Bill will turn a housing disaster into a complete catastrophe for social housing and homelessness.

The very least the Government could do is accept this amendment from those of us who are deeply alarmed by what it is doing, and agree to review this scheme every few months, monitor it closely and let us have all the details about what is happening in the different categories of housing need in order that we can assess what is going on.  It will be very telling and damning.  The Minister of State would obviously argue otherwise, but if she genuinely believes in it, she should make the commitment to regular reviews and to giving us all the detail necessary to make a proper assessment of whether this thing is workable.

I hope the response we get from the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, gives us a message of hope, reform and change and includes a major dismissal of the events of the past.  We need a new departure in the Department of Justice and Equality, in the appointment of judges and in the appointment of the Garda Commissioner and other top garda&iacute;.  There is very little doubt that there is a contaminated culture in the Garda.  It is evident in the review the Minister has already ordered.  I have proposed this Bill, which relates to the appointment of top garda&iacute;, in the full knowledge that such appointments may be flawed and that the contaminated culture to which I refer has unfortunately spread beyond the people this Bill actually addresses.<\/p><p>  The reason for the crisis of confidence in the Garda has been clearly illustrated by recent events.  This Bill begs certain questions.  I refer not only to the questions of why the Commissioner resigned or was sacked, why the Minister resigned or why the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, Mr. Purcell, is now under a cloud, but also to the question of how these people, specifically the top garda&iacute;, were actually appointed.  Is this part of the cause of the crisis we are now facing in the administration of justice in this country?  The Minister should make no mistake - there is no point in pretending otherwise - about the fact that the people have lost confidence in this country's top garda&iacute; because of the behaviour of garda&iacute; in recent times.  It is no less a crisis than that. It is one which the Minister now faces.  Part of this is due to the fact that there is an atmosphere of paranoia at the top of the Garda.<\/p><p>  I would like to refer to some of my own experiences.  I would be very sympathetic with the role of garda&iacute; and what they have done.  My own experience of contact with garda&iacute;, as a journalist and as a politician, is that they immediately flee to the bunker when they are asked questions.  I have experienced that over many years.  I have experienced it even more recently in my role as a Deputy.  When I asked the garda&iacute; how much it costs to fund the Garda Commissioner's office, they pleaded security reasons and all sorts of bogus camouflage to explain why they could not answer that question.  When I rang the Department of Justice and Equality today to ask about the process for the appointment of the new Garda Commissioner that is required, the first answer I got was &quot;hold on, we will ring you back and we will see if we can reply&quot;.  Why could the Department not reply to such a simple question?  We have a right to know the answer.  When they did reply, they said they wanted the question in writing.  They knew and I knew that I needed an answer to the question by 7.30 this evening.  It is now 7.30 p.m. and they have still not replied to this simple question.  Where is the process?  What is happening?  We have a vacancy at the top of the Garda.  We are entitled to know what the process is.  We are entitled to a reply from the Department of Justice and Equality on it.  I do not know what they thought I was asking - perhaps they thought there was hostility involved - but they went back into their bunker.  Unfortunately, that is the attitude of the press office in the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>  I received a similar type of response, one of hostility and paranoia, when I rang the Garda press office today.  The person to whom I spoke was pretty defensive and referred me pretty quickly up to the Garda Commissioner's office.  I got hold of a garda there who was anonymous.  I was told it was an inappropriate question and I was referred to someone else who was more pleasant but did not give me an answer.  That person referred me back to the Department of Justice and Equality, which has yet to reply.  What is going on in justice in this country?  One cannot get a response when one asks about the process being used to fill the most important position in the Garda.  They cannot do it.  They will not give an answer because they cannot get out of their bunker mentality.  We should get answers to all of these questions now, when there is an actual vacancy to be filled.  We should know what the process is, what the timetable is and how we will get a new Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p>  I have introduced this Bill, which relates to appointments at the top of the Garda, because it is extremely opportune that legislation of this sort should be in place to reform the appointments of people at the top of the force before the next Garda Commissioner is appointed.  I would like to know whether that process is already in train.  We do not know what process is being followed.  If a Bill like this were passed, we could quite easily have a new Commissioner by September.  I do not know what the process is, but I do know there seems to be a problem.  The cancer of cronyism at the top of this country's justice system is continuing.  I say that with conviction and without appearing to engage in sensationalism.  Several Bills relating to the appointment of judges have already been introduced in this House.  The continuing cronyist culture in that regard in this country has not been addressed for many years.  Every single judge is politically appointed.<\/p><p>  It is only just emerging, on foot of the crisis we discovered in the Garda, that the top 200 - not the top two or three - garda&iacute; are politically appointed.  We have a kind of silence about it at the top.  We need to see a dramatic and immediate change in order that people at the top of the garda&iacute; are appointed in a new way.  That needs to happen immediately.  We should not countenance any delay in this regard.  I anticipate that the Minister might well reply by saying &quot;we are looking at this, we are very serious about it, we will do something about it, there will be a new system for the new Commissioner but it is going to take a certain amount of time&quot;.  The figure I have just cited, that the top 200 garda&iacute; are politically appointed, is pretty staggering, but I think it is worse than that.  The system to which I refer is governed by the 2005 Act.  How are all the other promotions decided?  Are external interviews conducted?  Is there a kind of incestuous relationship in which people who have done the right thing and who know the right people are appointed by their pals from above?  It is a bit of a mystery, but it should not be.<\/p><p>The appointment of all top garda&iacute; - indeed, all garda&iacute; - should be subject to an open competition.  This Bill seeks to end the absolutely indefensible system of politicians, that is, the Cabinet, appointing the top 200 garda&iacute; and to introduce a new system which, although not perfect and certainly subject to amendment, is far preferable to the current system.  We must have an open contest, which this Bill introduces, that is open to outsiders and will ensure the independence of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Garda&iacute;, and top garda&iacute; in particular, must be appointed on merit.  As it stands, we have a system which was described in a recent <i>Garda Review<\/i>editorial as involving the selection of a winner by a hidden hand in what amounted to a three ball lottery system.  This Bill attempts, in a constructive and cost neutral way, to address this problem by removing the Garda from public control.  The result will be that garda&iacute;, for the first time, will be appointed on merit.<\/p><p>The structure of appointments proposed in the Bill is very simple.  At the top is the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, which, after carrying out advertising and interviews, will recommend three individuals to a subsidiary board comprising three members of the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, and two newly appointed members.  This five member board will then recommend one individual to the D&aacute;il.  The beauty of this is that the TLAC is comprised mostly of civilians or outsiders.  The D&aacute;il, in turn, can accept or reject the recommended person, in which case a second individual will be recommended through the same process.  A D&aacute;il committee will be able to interview these candidates and make its own recommendation.<\/p><p>The advantage of this system is that the appointment is not a matter for decision by the Minister for Justice and Equality or any other member of the Cabinet.  In other words, it does not become a nakedly political appointment.  The procedure I have outlined applies in the case of the top three members of the Garda.  Other top appointments, namely, those of chief superintendents and superintendents, will be made by the appointments board.  Again, there is no ministerial involvement.  In fact, it is a Minister-free zone.  This takes the appointments process out of the political arena and puts it into an area far removed from the type of criticism directed towards it recently.<\/p><p>My reason for bringing forward this Bill is, quite simply, the huge controversies that have emerged recently.  There can be no doubt whatsoever, from the controversies we have heard about, that there is something rotten in the Garda.  The force needs, above all, to be removed from the political arena, and that is the essential principle upon which this Bill is pitched.  The appointments process must be removed totally and utterly from the political arena and given to an external body which enjoys the public's respect.  There is a difficulty here in that so many of those bodies have some element of political influence.  It is very difficult to avoid that entirely, but this Bill represents a start.  Its acceptance would be a recognition by the Minister that there is a terrible crisis at the top of the Garda.  I hope and pray she does not come back with the response that this issue is being addressed by various bodies and we must await the outcome of this process.  There is, at this very moment, a vacancy at the top of the Garda.  This Bill could easily be passed by the House, with or without amendment, by the end of July.  I ask the Minister to consider it and to consider also the issue of dismissals, which is included in the Bill.  The dismissal of a Commissioner should only be possible with the permission of the D&aacute;il.  That function should not be in the political power of a Minister, because situations like this have been abused too much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700043#QQ00400","speaker":"953","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403036700,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I propose to share time with Deputy Mattie McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700044#RR00200","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1403036700,"counter":540,"content":"<p>That is agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700044#RR00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1403036700,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I commend my colleague, Deputy Shane Ross, on bringing forward this legislation.  It is always refreshing to see Independent Deputies not only holding this Government to account but also putting forward new ideas and proposals to the House.  The Bill is about Garda reform and I urge all Deputies to support it.  It is about introducing new structures for the management of the Garda and safeguarding the professionalism of the force.  Above all, it is about restoring public confidence and trust in our Garda service.  I emphasise the word &quot;service&quot; here, because it is all about serving the public.  We must ensure citizens have a professional police service in which they can trust.<\/p><p>The Bill sets out its purpose as follows:<blockquote>[T]o provide for the independent appointment of Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner and senior members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to make the removal of such members more transparent and accountable, to amend the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 and 2013 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote>The reforms it proposes are urgently needed.  It is about ensuring the best garda&iacute; get to the top of the force on merit, not on the basis of political connections or strokes.  We must not duck and dive on this issue.  Hard work, quality policing and dedication to our citizens must be the considerations that apply when it comes to the promotion of garda&iacute;.  The old ways must change so far as promotions are concerned, but we can retain some of the old values as represented by the hard-working garda on the beat who engages with his or her community.  A good police officer never demands respect but earns it.  This Bill will help us to shape the future of the force.<\/p><p>It is helpful to consider some of the data on crime that are available to us.  There were 66 homicide offences in 2011, increasing to 79 to 2012 and 80 in 2013.  Fear and intimidation are a major tool in ensuring gangs maintain their hold on communities.  Threats of murder have increased dramatically in the past decade, from 45 in 2004 to 348 in 2013.  International data on intentional homicide from gun crime are difficult to compare due to different countries reporting in different ways.  However, the rate of crime per thousand of population shows Ireland at 1.2 per 1,000, putting us ahead of England, France and China at 1.0, New Zealand at 0.9, Spain, Germany and Luxembourg at 0.8, and Sweden at 0.7.<\/p><p> The garda&iacute; in Limerick led an offensive against gang related crime there.  In the past decade, they have arrested more than 60 leading gang members who have been imprisoned.  In 2002, John Connolly of the Health Research Board showed that the statistics of crimes carried out by drug users tallied with the strong link between drugs and crime in the public mind.  They are intertwined but many gangland killings are carried out by non-drug users and people attracted to gangland crime for other reasons.  Studies from the USA and Sweden have shown that environmental factors have much greater impact in lower socioeconomic groups and this means that the nurture rather than nature factor is a bigger contributor to gang membership.  I raise these issues because they are connected to the broader debate on gangland killings and on having top quality garda&iacute; at the top of the Garda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700044#RR00400","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403037300,"counter":543,"content":"<p>Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Aire nua.  I wish the new Minister for Justice and Equality all the best.  I compliment Deputy Ross on bringing forward the Public Sector Management (Appointment of Senior Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) Bill 2014.  He has been preparing it for quite some time and it is not a knee-jerk reaction to recent events in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  I have said umpteen times in this House that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, or any police force for that matter, cannot police without the full support of the public.  That is what it is all about; it is a two-way process.  I have been a member of Muintir na T&iacute;re and community alert for many years, encouraging communities to support the Garda.  It is very important the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the trust of the people.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, what has happened in recent times has besmirched the good name of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A very small number of events have really done damage to the people whom I salute and who have put their lives on the line day in, day out to maintain peace and stability in our country, and they need our support.  Every member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, from the newest recruits right up to the Garda Commissioner, needs trust and respect.  If they do not have that, things will not be right.<\/p><p>  I have many contacts and good friends in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have supported community alert, rural Ireland and the town of Clonmel.  I mention two recently retired superintends, Superintendents Courtney and Duggan.<\/p><p>  My feeling is that appointments are political.  That is known and I hope the Minister will make a clean sweep with a new brush because we need to clean out that culture of political appointments and to be able to say without fear or favour that it is the people's and the Garda's Commissioner and not someone acting at the behest of a Minister or a Government.<\/p><p>  What happened recently with the Commissioner and the Minister, who are both gone and which came about under a cloud of darkness, was very unsavoury.  We will never know about the trip that fateful night by the Secretary General of the Department to the Commissioner's home.  We must have openness and transparency.<\/p><p>  We must go abroad to make appointments because this country is too small.  I have little faith in the Public Appointments Service because, along with two colleagues from this House, I had to appoint a number of people to the fisheries board as the former Minister, Eamon Ryan, had a new idea.  However, we were not welcome there.  It had its own shortlist of people it wanted who were all retirees from other Departments.  I happened to be chair of the appointments group and I gladly turned the list upside down and started from the bottom up.  We need that culture in the public service to change.  We will have to look for people from abroad when making appointments.  I wish the acting Commissioner well and do not know what will happen to her but we need people from abroad to come here to clean up whatever mistrust is at the top.  There is a feeling in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the detective branch has had too much sway.  I know it does important work but one cannot have cliques in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is one force serving the public at all times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700045#SS00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1403037300,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I support the aim of this Bill brought forward by Deputy Ross, which is to de-politicise An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by providing for the independent appointment of the Garda Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner and other senior members of the Garda.<\/p><p>  The Garda Act 2005 gives the Government very wide latitude and discretion as regards the appointment and removal of senior garda&iacute;.  It allows for Government to make appointments of superintendent and above and does not specify any qualifications or criteria that must be considered.  Under section 11 of the Act, the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner and assistant commissioners can be removed for a range of flimsy reasons.  The Garda Commissioner alone can be removed for failing to have regard to section 26, which sets out the functions of the Garda Commissioner.  These additional grounds for removal mean that the Commissioner's position is the most vulnerable of all to Government whim, as the last Commissioner found out to his peril.<\/p><p>  In the past few months alone, we have seen several scandals which highlight the dangers of politicisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We had called for the removal of the former Garda Commissioner on several occasions for different reasons but his eventual removal was to provide a public scapegoat for political problems.  This was an unfair attempt to try to salvage the Government's reputation.  A politicised Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the bias of the Government towards it resulted in the vitriolic and unfair treatment of the Garda ombudsman in the GSOC bugging scandal, a bias which continues with the unfair and untrue allegations that it has breached a statutory duty.<\/p><p>  Although the Government has confirmed that the next Garda Commissioner will be selected by open competition, it has not made any commitment to changing the legislation permanently in this regard.  This is another short-term reaction to the recent series of Garda scandals rather than any meaningful and permanent reform of the manner in which the Garda Commissioner is appointed.<\/p><p>  Recent events have demonstrated the acute need for immediate reform to address the unhealthy nexus that exists between the Commissioner, the Minister and the Government.  The findings of the Guerin report, including the Minister's acceptance at face value of the Garda Commissioner's investigation into a complaint against himself, reinforces the irrationality of the current structure.  It is this direct and centralised Government control of a single, hierarchical national organisation which has been identified by Professor Dermot Walsh as &quot;rendering the police vulnerable to being used by dominant interests as a vehicle for protecting their privilege, through the suppression of minority views and lifestyles&quot;.  There must be a dilution of the current partisan political control over the Garda to ensure that too much police power is not left over-concentrated and under-accounted for in the hands of any party.<\/p><p>  Some other examples of over-politicisation in the Garda Act 2005 include section 40(2) referred to by Professor Dermot Walsh as an &quot;alarming provision&quot; which provides that the Minister or the Government can demand any record or documents from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The ministerial power under section 25 to issue directives to the Garda Commissioner &quot;concerning any matter relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&quot; should also be removed.  The direct accountability of the Commissioner to the Minister is very unhealthy.<\/p><p>  A rebalancing is particularly necessary in light of the extensive functions and powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in providing both civil policing and security to the State.  A Minister for Justice and Equality's reputation is too closely linked to that of the Garda Commissioner's under the current legislative structure.  Section 26(3) of the Garda Act 2005 provides that the Garda Commissioner is solely accountable to the Minister in the performance of his functions.  Criticising a Garda Commissioner's performance in a public forum would thus be akin to the Minister criticising himself and his own performance.  Any holding to account is impossible in these circumstances.<\/p><p>  Using the medium of Parliament to provide democratic accountability allows the Minister and the Garda Commissioner to escape any parliamentary requests to explain policy with the excuse that something is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner, which we have heard many times.  As the Garda Commissioner's conduct and performance is also exempt from GSOC's remit and due again to the exclusivity of accountability provided for under section 26(3), there is no further avenue or no other method of holding the Garda Commissioner, and by extension the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to account once this operational matter excuse is provided to a parliamentary question.<\/p><p>  This difficulty was clearly demonstrated by our efforts to raise by way of parliamentary question the issue of Garda racial profiling of Travellers on PULSE.  The then Minister was content to tell us that the Garda Commissioner said that racial profiling did not exist, so that was good enough for him.<\/p><p>  The over-politicised nature of our police force is also powerfully illustrated by many aspects of the Cooke report.<\/p><p>The 64 page report was published by Government at 8.45 p.m. on Tuesday last.  Fifteen minutes later, the headlines on the RTE news at 9 o'clock could only repeat the selective quotes that had already been leaked by Government sources to certain journalists who are widely recognised to be uncritical of the Garda.  The tactic was previously employed by the Government press office on the publication of the Garda Inspectorate report into penalty points.  Despite a handful of exceptions, the Government line has generally been accepted by the media establishment, without question or serious analysis.<\/p><p>The Government has praised the report both in the D&aacute;il and on &quot;Prime Time&quot; for being &quot;comprehensive&quot; and for reaching &quot;evidence-based&quot; conclusions following &quot;rigorous&quot; investigation.  I wonder whether it has considered any of the following points.  The former judge concluded that there was no evidence of Garda involvement.  However, he did not seek any evidence, he did not question a single garda, nor did he request a report from the Garda Commissioner regarding, for example, the storage and log books of IMSI catchers, or the possibility of the involvement of rogue garda&iacute;.  He did not seek to question the senior garda&iacute; who were the subject of two highly sensitive GSOC investigations, investigations which the retired judge admitted led to the heightened tension and paranoia between GSOC and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the time.  The retired judge admitted that the most significant &quot;anomaly&quot; identified by Verrimus &quot;remains unexplained&quot;.  That was the ring-back to a telephone which bypassed the main switch at 1.30 a.m. and which occurred immediately after a TALAN test.  The absence of any explanation for that mysterious occurrence is inconsistent with the report's conclusions.<\/p><p>The possibility of lawful surveillance was never investigated at all.  Although the terms of reference cleverly require an examination only of unlawful surveillance, the elimination of the possibility of lawful surveillance would appear to be a basic requirement if the priority was to establish the truth.  The former justice Minister refused to answer that question both at committee and in my parliamentary question to him in this Chamber in February.  A senior garda can bypass judicial supervision completely and internally authorise another garda to conduct covert surveillance.  That is entirely lawful if it is done in accordance with the exceptional circumstances set out in section 7 of the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009.  If lawful surveillance by the Garda, the Army or Revenue was at issue, the retired judge could then have examined whether it was in fact lawful, that is, whether those exceptional circumstances did in fact exist.  Rogue garda&iacute; could have received permission from other senior garda&iacute; and bugged GSOC without breaking the law, but the matter has not been examined by Mr. Justice Cooke.<\/p><p>The report asserts a breach of statutory obligation by GSOC in its failure to report the results and progress but fails to mention that section 103 allows for exemptions if, in GSOC's opinion, that were necessary in the public interest.  That has been repeated <i>ad nauseam<\/i>by Government speakers.  Such a selective and incomplete reading of the relevant legislation is a strange omission for a former judge of Mr. Justice Cooke's experience and stature.<\/p><p>The report does not assess any evidence of an attempted security breach at GSOC, as requested by paragraph 3 of the terms of reference, preferring to focus on whether &quot;actual surveillance&quot; took place.  The judge appeared to accept that ordinary surveillance of the Verrimus personnel took place, but does not view that as corroborating evidence nor does he consider it alongside the three technical &quot;anomalies&quot;.  That type of surveillance is unregulated in Ireland and that may be the reason the retired judge did not consider it.  He did not appear overly concerned that Verrimus was the subject of ordinary surveillance while conducting the GSOC operation, nor was he curious about the identity of those who carried out the surveillance, although he stated that could only be examined by a statutory investigation.<\/p><p>In fairness, the retired judge went to some lengths to set out in his introduction that the report has &quot;no authority to make binding findings of fact, much less definitive ones&quot;, that it does not have &quot;authority to adjudicate on disputes of fact&quot;, and that it has been reliant on the &quot;voluntary co-operation&quot; of the parties concerned.  The report also states that its conclusions are &quot;based upon my personal evaluation and opinion&quot;.  He stated they were not judicial, nor the result of a statutory inquiry by a sitting judge with powers of compellability.  That is in contrast to the disingenuous efforts of Government to impart a sheen of legitimacy by emphasising at every opportunity that this paper review was conducted by a retired judge.  It was by and large a paper review of secondary evidence already available rather than an investigation from first principles.  Had the impossible happened and incontrovertible proof been provided and established on the unlawful Garda bugging of GSOC, that would have resulted in huge upheaval within some of the more sacred institutions of the State, and yet another possibly fatal blow for the party of law and order in the run-up to the next general election.<\/p><p>If there was an appetite for the truth, we would get an independent inquiry and nothing less.  If we want to have a police force that we can be proud of, one that operates in a transparent manner, and is accountable for everything it does, we will also need to begin the process of depoliticising An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700045#SS00300","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403037900,"counter":546,"content":"<p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 explicitly allows the Government to make appointments at superintendent level and above.  There is no specification of any qualifications or criteria.  The Government can literally appoint whoever it likes without any accountability.  In addition, the grounds on which the Government of the day can also seek to remove the senior officers that are at the heart of Deputy Ross&rsquo;s Bill are flimsy.  One could ask whether it is really any wonder that we have such a dysfunctional system, as has been exposed recently, when such a system prevails at the higher echelons.  It is perfectly understandable that anyone who wants to rise to those ranks must, in order to get there, curry favour with the political establishment of the day so that they might end up in the right place to get the nod when the time is right.  The other side of the equation is that once they get there, the tendency is to reward their masters, those who put them there in the first place.  That is incredibly unhealthy in any system which purports to be democratic.<\/p><p>  We made the point many times during the recent controversies that much of what happened could not have happened without the dysfunctional relationship - a lawful one - between the former Minister for Justice and Equality and the former Garda Commissioner.  It is not that the former Minister for Justice and Equality did nothing when he received the complaints &ndash; he did.  He went to the Commissioner, asked him what was the story and the Commissioner said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it Alan.  There is nothing to worry about,&rdquo; and the former Minister said: &ldquo;That is grand.&rdquo;  That was a hugely contributing factor to the problem.  The politicised nature of the relationship between the Government, and the Garda Commissioner being only accountable to the Minister, was very much epitomised by the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; debacle with the former Minister revealing information about Deputy Wallace in order to score political points.  It was information he could not have come by accidentally and which could only have been found by a trawl at the behest of the Minister.  Deputy Shatter has been found guilty of breaking data protection law in that regard but it is worth making the point.<\/p><p>  Accountability is at the heart of the Bill.  That is an issue on which we have all focused.  Nobody disputes that is necessary.  The Government&rsquo;s response to that is at last we will get an independent Garda authority which will oversee the functioning of the force.  I put it to the Minister that such a move on its own is not enough.  If we simply put an authority at the top of the force as it is now, rely on those who are currently in management positions to continue to rule the roost and do not have a change in the mechanism for appointments, the problems will replicate themselves.  When we say what is necessary is a Patten-style commission, we do so not because we think the Patten inquiry was brilliant and that there are no problems in the police force in Northern Ireland &ndash; there absolutely are &ndash; but because we need to go back to the drawing board and look at what are the objectives of a modern police service.  Now is a completely different time from when the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was selected.  One could ask how people should be recruited to the force.  The top echelons set the scene and are very influential in picking those who are further down the ladder in terms of who can go forward for promotion.  Recruitment and training must be addressed if we are to have an acceptable police force.<\/p><p>  I tried to raise the issue of politicised policing with the Taoiseach in the context of the policing of the Corrib gas site.<\/p><p>He either was unable to or did not understand the point or was unwilling to answer it.  Instead, he tried to divert the issue by talking about the merits or otherwise of the Shell project, when the question I posed to him was about the policing of it.  He spoke about local people protesting as if there was a difference between what the former justice Minister, Deputy Shatter, called tourist protestors and locals.  The point, however, was there were no local protestors but local residents who got in the way of a multinational.  There is something utterly wrong in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na basically being an organisation for hire to act at the behest of a multinational.  There is something utterly wrong in up to 30 garda&iacute; intimidating an elderly woman and her husband to get a pipe down a narrow road when there was no one objecting.  All human rights organisations have pinpointed these problems exist.<\/p><p> This Bill is a positive contribution and brings our attention to the top echelons of the force.  We have been on record, and will do so again, as stating very few of those in the senior ranks of the Garda will make the grade of a reconstituted force, given that many of them have been involved in some of the most appalling miscarriages of justice and have stood over bad practices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700046#TT00200","speaker":"1192","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403038500,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I call the Minister for who is sharing time with Deputies Durkan, Kyne and Harris.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700047#UU00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1403038500,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the Public Sector Management (Appointment of Senior Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) Bill 2014, introduced by Deputy Ross.<\/p><p>  The House will not need reminding of the many issues which have arisen in recent months relating to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the administration of justice.  Last week, we saw the publication of the Cooke report; last month, the Guerin report was published.  We know of the many various allegations by Garda whistleblowers, as well as the public disquiet regarding the penalty points system.  Regrettably, as a result, we have witnessed an erosion of public confidence in the work of the Garda.  It is essential in a democracy that the public has full confidence in how the Garda carries out its functions.<\/p><p>  The Government has, therefore, rightly taken action to ensure these issues are dealt with in an independent and impartial manner that commands public confidence.  The allegations about penalty points have been referred to GSOC, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, for independent investigation.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate has prepared a report on reform of the fixed-charge penalty system and its recommendations are now being implemented.  I acknowledge the contribution made by Deputies opposite tonight to raising these issues.  Today, the Garda announced it has commenced implementation of the inspectorate's short-term recommendations which will be welcomed by the public because they provide far greater clarity than there has been before.  The inspectorate's report highlighted the significant changes necessary in this regard.  A commission of investigation, headed by Mr. Justice Fennelly, has commenced work in examining the issues relating to the recording of telephone calls at Garda stations and associated matters.  The Government commissioned a report by Sean Guerin into the way in which Garda whistleblower allegations regarding crime investigations were handled.  The Government also commissioned a further, now-published, report by Mr. Justice Cooke into the claims of unlawful surveillance of GSOC.  We will discuss that report in the House on Thursday and I look forward to having a detailed opportunity then to address matters raised about it tonight.<\/p><p>  One by one, in each case, the Government has put in place a mechanism for an authoritative examination of claims and allegations, so the facts can be discovered, the truth established and necessary action taken.  The Government also recognises, however, the issues and failings identified are resolved is more critical.  A whole process to implement these recommendations is required to deal with this wide range of issues.  We need not only to address specific difficulties that arise, but also to identity the kind of longer-term reforms that will ensure continued public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as in the vital policing and security service it provides.  The Government has, therefore, initiated a comprehensive programme of reform to address the wider systemic failings in the areas of policing and the administration of justice, including those which have emerged from the Guerin report.  I reject the claim by some Members opposite that it is only piecemeal reform.  Any fair analysis of the range of actions taken by the Government will agree it is a comprehensive programme of reform.<\/p><p>  The spectrum of issues that must be addressed is complex and deep-rooted ranging from high-level issues such as oversight, change management and the role of whistleblowers to local administration and internal communication, as well as matters of basic policing, performance and human resources.  The Guerin report identified clearly a wide and disturbing range of issues such as the supervision of probationary garda&iacute; and the taking of evidence.  These serious issues demand a response from the Garda.<\/p><p>  A new Cabinet committee on justice reform has been established, the first time such a high-level committee has been established.  It is headed by the Taoiseach and comprises the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, myself, as Minister for Justice and Equality, and the Attorney General.  This committee is overseeing this comprehensive programme of policing reform.  As part of this programme of reform, an independent Garda authority is to be established by the end of this year.  Future appointments to the position of Garda Commissioner will be by way of open competition.  I remind Deputy Ross that I have stated in several fora, including the D&aacute;il, that this position will be advertised in July as an open competition and advertised internationally.  I also hope the new Garda authority will have a role to play in that appointment.<\/p><p>  The Garda inspectorate is to carry out a comprehensive inquiry into serious crime investigation, as well as management and operational issues arising from the findings of the report by Mr. Guerin.  As was acknowledged on the radio this morning, I had a long meeting with the Garda inspectorate in the work it is doing.  It will work on the issues identified in the Guerin report and report back to me.<\/p><p>  The Government has agreed to establish a further commission of investigation as recommended in the Guerin report.  On foot of last week's publication of the Cooke report, the Government will now proceed to consider the terms of reference and formally establish the commission.  An independent expert review of the performance, management and administration of the Department of Justice and Equality has been established.  No one can question the credentials of the range of expertise I have appointed to the review group.  It has begun its work.  Amendments to the Protected Disclosures Bill will be enacted to enable a Garda whistleblower to report his or her concerns to GSOC.  New legislation will be introduced shortly to strengthen the remit and powers of GSOC.  While the then Government in 2005 responded to the findings of the Morris tribunal, it is clear the subsequent legislation introduced then is inadequate and its failings have come to the fore.  While I do not have time to go into it tonight, I have outlined several areas where the GSOC legislation will be reformed in the near future.<\/p><p>When the Garda authority is established later in the year we will have an opportunity to examine further changes to how GSOC operates.  For the first time we will establish an independent Garda authority.  This will undoubtedly be the most significant change in oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since its foundation.  As I stated, I acknowledge change was introduced in 2005, but deeper reform is now necessary and the Garda authority will be central to this.<\/p><p> I set out the background to the Government's programme of reform because the Bill put forward by Deputy Ross seeks to address one single aspect of reform, namely, the way in which appointments are made to the top ranks in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is important to appreciate how individual reforms, such as the way in which the most senior members of the force are appointed, must be designed to fit properly in the new policing regime and oversight architecture.  Anybody examining this topic this evening would have to agree we should not be bringing forward reform in a piecemeal manner but in a way in which the various aspects of reform compliment each other.  This is the general difficulty I have with the Bill.  It puts forward a proposal on the appointment of senior members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but does not take into account how this might fit the wider reforms under way.<\/p><p> Taking the proposed independent Garda authority as a key example of these reforms, as far as I can tell from comments to date it enjoys a broad measure of support across the House.  I intend to bring forward the necessary legislative changes later this year so the authority can be in place by the end of the year.  This is a very challenging timetable but I intend to make it a top priority.  While the details of its functions will need to be fully worked out as part of this legislative process, and I look forward to discussing the details in the House, one of its more obvious potential roles will be to have involvement in the process of appointment of the most senior members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In saying this I do not anticipate any decisions by the Government and still less of the House and serious consideration will need to be given to the issue and precisely what the nature of the involvement of the new Garda authority will be, but broadly comparable bodies, such as the police authorities in the North or in Scotland, have an important role in senior police appointments.  I note the study trip undertaken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to examine the police authority models in these areas and their role in senior police appointments.  The joint committee has also held hearings.  We await the outcomes of these hearings, on which I will receive a report shortly.  We also await the deliberations of the committee following its trip to examine how police authorities operate in other countries.<\/p><p> The issue of the functions of a new Garda authority and the question of its role in appointing senior Garda members will also be the subject of discussion at the consultation event which I will convene on Friday in Farmleigh, where key stakeholders will spend the morning discussing the new Garda authority.  A wide range of stakeholders will attend the event and all of the members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality have been invited.  The outcome will certainly form part of a very important consultative process with a wide range of relevant stakeholders.<\/p><p> The Bill takes no account of the forthcoming Garda authority or the extensive consultations under way involving a wide range of voices.  Instead the Bill proposes a prescriptive approach to a singular area of reform, isolated from consideration of other reforms.  The Bill proposes a free-standing system of appointment to the senior Garda ranks by a new public appointments board, following an open competition conducted by the Top Level Appointments Committee, and involving the approval of this House in the case of the Garda Commissioner or a recommendation by an Oireachtas committee in the case of other senior ranks.  I find it very difficult to see how the House could be asked to establish such a system on the eve of the introduction of proposals for an independent Garda authority.  The Bill effectively states that the new independent Garda authority will have no role in the most senior Garda appointments.  Leaving aside the detail of the Bill, it is premature to ask the House to take a decision now which would anticipate its decision on the role of the authority, and to take this decision in advance of considering the outcome of the substantial process of consultations now under way, including the valuable and important work of the joint committee, the consultation event taking place on Friday and the other work I have referenced.<\/p><p> If we look at the detail of the Bill, there is also the question as to whether a key element of it, namely a requirement for the approval of the House for the appointment of a person to the post of Garda Commissioner, is in any event the right approach.  At the outset of my remarks I recalled the controversies which had arisen about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the potential damage which the resulting political controversies could inflict on what is a vital public service.  I explained how the Government had taken decisive steps to resolve these controversies in a way which was evidently independent and impartial, and which would command public attention and respect.  However, one could argue that the Bill, in requiring the approval of the House for the appointment of a Garda Commissioner, would put politics right back into policing as opposed to an independent Garda authority taking the decision.  By all means let us debate this at the proper time when the legislative proposals for the Garda authority are before the House, but surely we cannot introduce such a measure, with such potentially far-reaching consequences, in the Bill.<\/p><p> I also find it odd that the Bill, although it is designed to deal with senior Garda appointments, provides for the extension of the remit of the proposed public appointments board to other sectors within the public service.  We should recall there is already a structure set out in the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act for appointments to large parts of the public service.  It is also the case that the 2004 Act, which provides for the Public Appointments Service and the Commission for Public Service Appointments, can be extended to other public sector bodies by ministerial order.  I would have thought that proposals for such a major change to public service appointments generally should be debated fully in their own right and not tagged on as a single section in a Bill dealing with Garda appointments.<\/p><p> The Bill deals with an important issue, which is the process of making appointments to the most senior positions in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I welcome the debate, but I cannot welcome or support a proposal which is premature and being put forward in isolation to the other vital reforms which I mentioned are taking place.  I want to emphasise this is not because I wish to avoid reform; it is quite the contrary, and the point is that significant reforms are under way.  As I stated, and I will not go into the detail again, the Government has already announced that there will be an open competition for the post of Garda Commissioner.  The Government has already announced plans for a new independent Garda authority, to be in place very shortly.  By any measure I believe these are some of the most important reforms to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ever proposed.<\/p><p> I look forward to the debate on these proposals, and the contribution of all Deputies, but the discussion on the process of Garda appointments needs to be part of a wider debate.  We need the process of Garda reform to be comprehensive and cohesive.  We need to consider all aspects of this reform.  We need to ensure, as far as we possibly can, that we get it right.  This Bill does not achieve this and I therefore regret that I cannot support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700047#UU00300","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403039100,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  I welcome the announcement by the Minister in her speech to the effect that the various reforms put forward in Deputy Ross's Bill are being acted upon by the Government.<\/p><p>  It goes without saying that if one examines the activities of various police forces throughout the world in recent years there have been numerous occasions where reform was required and this is no exception.  This should not be taken as a blanket overall castigation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is hugely important that the general public, wherever it may be, has absolute confidence in its police force at all levels.  At all times the general public needs to be reassured that the police force acting on its behalf acts with its full authority and support and is independent of any type of manipulation from any quarter.  This is not to suggest for one moment that the Garda has been manipulated in any fashion by anybody.<\/p><p>Certainly, during my time in this House I have seen members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work solidly on behalf of the State to protect it and as I have stated previously, on many occasions they paid the ultimate price for so doing.<\/p><p> In a number of situations over the past 25 or 30 years, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the front line or the front row had no option except to do their duty and when called upon to do their duty, they did it.  Moreover, they did it without fear or favour and many were injured or maimed and many paid the ultimate price.  Members should not have a debate of this nature without recording their appreciation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the tremendous work it has done in difficult times over a difficult era when there were many challenges both within and without.  Consequently, it goes without saying that the reforms now proposed are not by way of criticism but are by way of consolidation and by way of providing confidence among the public on the extent to which the modern police force must be independent and in respect of what is required in the modern era.<\/p><p> It also is no harm to remember that in recent years, almost every aspect of society has been challenged.  Every profession, including politics and elsewhere, has been challenged and various issues have arisen that have not shown various professions in a good light.  As a result, it has been necessary to undertake reforms that are taking place.  Moreover, it is appropriate that they should, because without such reforms there will be a continued lack of confidence in the system.  While it is easy for everybody to point his or her finger and to state everything was meant to be changed, things have changed fairly dramatically within a short time.  Although the extent of the change has not yet been fully perceived, it is taking place.  As for those who suggest the changes did not take place quickly enough, I note the resources necessary to bring about all those changes are not as evidently available as they appear to be in some quarters of the House.<\/p><p> I refer to the reforms required in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na back in 2005 and as the Minister has just indicated, those reforms did not go to the extent they should have gone at that time.  In fairness to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at all levels who did the job at huge personal cost to themselves many times over those years, Members should not fail to recognise the sacrifices they made.  They made huge familial and personal sacrifices and did their jobs well.  Members have often spoken about those people who intoned to Members privately the things they perceived to be wrong within the administration.  Sometimes they were right and perhaps sometimes they were wrong but the time now has come for an overall evaluation of the structures, which is good.  Moreover, it should be and will be comprehensive to restore public confidence in the administration of justice.  There are many other aspects of the system that require reform.  While I have no doubt but that this will happen, in my short contribution I can only express my hope that at the end of the day, confidence will be restored in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and those garda&iacute; who have done their jobs selflessly throughout the years will be vindicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700048#VV00200","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403039700,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication of the Bill, as I would welcome the publication of any Bill that generates debate, and I congratulate Deputy Ross on its publication.  I welcome the Minister and wish to take this first opportunity to congratulate her officially on her appointment as Minister under challenging circumstances in the year that is in it.  One could say that 2014 will go down as the year of Garda scrutiny.  I wish to take this opportunity to commend those who have brought issues to the fore within the Garda over the past six months and earlier, some within this House as well as the whistleblowers themselves, who have done the State justice in speaking out and highlighting their issues of concern within their serious and challenging occupation in the context of the protection of the State and one of its most important institutions, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  It is right for the Garda, as for any State body, to have standards and that every effort is made to hold up garda&iacute; to those standards.  It also is right for Members to acknowledge the majority of excellent members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who do an excellent job day in and day out in difficult circumstances and challenging environments throughout the country.  They have become demoralised by all that has gone on in recent times and it is important to acknowledge the role they play in protecting families and the State on a daily basis.  I also wish to acknowledge the changes enacted in 2014 with regard to the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I refer to the publication of the Guerin report on whistleblowing, the Cooke report on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, bugging, the Finlay commission on taping and the proposed establishment by the Government of an independent police authority.  The latter will deal with many of the items and issues highlighted and detailed in the Bill that is being drafted at present.  I certainly will welcome the publication of that Bill, what it entails and the overall establishment of the independent police authority.<\/p><p>  The Government has stated previously that the new Garda Commissioner is to be appointed by way of open competition, which is a welcome, progressive and inclusive step.  As to whether this should be extended to other roles, as outlined in the Bill before Members, is a question for debate.  As for suggesting the existing structures are not fit for purpose, however, one must consider what evidence there is that a new system would be different.  Second, one must consider whether all the fault that has been experienced in the past six or 12 months can be put down to the existing structure or the appointment system in place at present.  The Garda Commissioner has a difficult job and has a responsibility to the public ultimately, as well as to the rank-and-file members of the Garda.  It is a challenging balancing act between ensuring one has the public's full confidence and having that responsibility to members of the Garda.  I will not say it is a responsibility to protect them but to ensure that where allegations arise, members are not hung out to dry.  Any Commissioner is only human and whether appointed through the existing structures, the system outlined by Deputy Ross or the planned open recruitment system that is to be initiated for the new Commissioner, ultimately he or she will have decisions to make.  Like any human, mistakes can be made and perhaps he or she could say or do something he or she will regret.<\/p><p>  However, there is no reason to believe that any of the actions that took place over the past six months would have been different under a Commissioner appointed by a different system.  Decisions are made by humans.  I could make a decision that would be different to that made by Deputies O'Mahony and Harris or anybody else.  Ultimately, it is the individual himself or herself, the role he or she plays and the powers he or she has.  A Commissioner should have a good working relationship with the Minister.  They should not necessarily be best friends but should have a good healthy regard for each other's positions and roles.  A Commissioner must be willing to investigate complaints from the public and from the Garda.  I have spoken previously in this Chamber with regard to my hope for whistleblowers, which is that any future whistleblower will be treated properly by any future Garda Commissioner.  I commend the Bill on its publication in terms of the debate Members are having.  I certainly welcome the setting up of the independent Garda authority, as well as the initiatives taken by the Minister and her predecessor in recent months to sort out many of the problems that have arisen within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700049#WW00200","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1403039700,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and on the debate generated by its publication and tabling in this Chamber.  I welcome and it is important to acknowledge - as sadly, others have failed to do - the work that already has been undertaken by the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, in her short period as Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Minister has a record of reform that can be seen clearly in her work in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the passage of the children's referendum and the establishment of the Child and Family Agency.  I have no doubt but that she is continuing that reforming attitude in her new role.  It is important, however, that any debate should take place with a holistic view of the issues and challenges facing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and broader society in terms of how it interacts with the justice system.  A root and branch examination of the matters that have come to public light is clearly needed and action is needed on foot of those examinations.  Hence, there is the Guerin report and the Cooke report, as well as agreement by the Government on a commission of inquiry into various serious allegations.  In addition, an expert review of the Department of Justice and Equality is under way, as well as agreement to establish a new Garda authority for the first time in the history of the State.<\/p><p> I have heard accusations in this House tonight and in recent days and weeks that the Government's approach is piecemeal.  That does not stand up to any level of fair and objective scrutiny.  In fact, it lowers the standard of debate and it demeans it to a soundbite rather than substance.  The Government is addressing all issues in a methodical and thorough manner.  Many Members on all sides of the House have shown a constructive attitude, an acknowledgment that things need to change and an acknowledgment that there is a significant body of work to be done.<\/p><p> To simply pick off one issue of how senior garda&iacute; are appointed and to endeavour to deal with it in isolation from the many other necessary developments, most particularly the establishment of a new Garda authority, would be foolhardy.  We need to look seriously at how senior Garda appointments are made and to that end I welcome Deputy Ross's debate on the issue and the decision by the Government that the next Garda Commissioner will be appointed by way of open competition.  However, we need to look at issues of oversight, appointments and transparency together.  We need to work constructively to ask how a Garda authority would function, what is best international practice and what is best for Ireland and our culture.  The stakeholders consultation this week on Friday is an extremely useful and important event.  We have to bring the broad range of stakeholders with us.  It is a much more inclusive and thorough way of going about business than stand-alone legislation which attempts to place the issue of appointments in a silo.<\/p><p> To deal with appointments alone in this Bill in the full knowledge of the reality that the establishment of a Garda authority is under way makes a mockery of consulting stakeholders and it also has an implication with which I am not comfortable.  Deputy Kyne touched on this in his contribution.  It has an implication that appointments and the appointments structure is at the root of the problems and the challenges.  I say to Deputy Ross that there is no evidence to support that argument.  There is no evidence to suggest that if another group of human beings, if another group of politicians around a table or another Commissioner or grouping or body of individuals had arrived at a different appointment that the culture in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the systems and the safeguards, would have been different.  The Guerin report is a compelling read and one must presume it indicates some systemic issues within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The issues to which the report refers are very basic ones relating to training, education and facilities in Garda stations.  They have very little, if anything, to do with the manner in which a person is to be appointed.  It is not to suggest that the appointments system does not need to be examined but rather it is an acknowledgment that they will be looked at and an acknowledgment that we must examine all the issues facing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our justice system in a holistic fashion.  That is why I think the Garda authority is a really exciting development.  The justice committee has begun undertaking work and consultation on how such an authority works in other jurisdictions, and this is to be welcomed.<\/p><p> Sadly, there have been some slurs made in this House that have cast an aspersion on all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am sure that is not the intention of any Member of this House.  It must be remembered that in the history of the State, 85 garda&iacute; have died in the line of duty.  We must remember that while not perfect and no different from this institution, and while An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has had bad apples in it, this does not take away from the work of its members who get up every day and keep our society safe and tackle subversiveness.<\/p><p> It is a difficult time to be a garda.  We owe it to citizens of this country, including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to deliver a thorough, comprehensive, fair and thought-out inclusive response to the issues that have emerged rather than having a knee-jerk reaction.  We must get this right because we owe it to every citizen, including every member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and every courageous whistleblower who has come to the fore in recent weeks and months.  I commend the Minister on her work.  I welcome the debate on this Bill but in my view its approach is one of isolation rather than inclusiveness and it needs to be looked at in the context of the Garda authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700049#WW00300","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403040300,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this timely debate.  The Minister has outlined the significant issues which have arisen in the administration of justice.  This Bill deals with a central proposed reform of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is to be welcomed.<\/p><p>  I agree with the principle of an independent system for appointments but Deputy Ross's Bill misses the point which has been debated in this House over recent months.  The Members of this House all agree on the need for the establishment of an independent policing authority.  The provisions in Deputy Ross's Bill would deny an independent policing authority the main function to support and sustain its independence which is the appointment of the most senior person in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and his or her senior management team.  The Bill does not make any sense.  I was pleased to hear the Minister say that she will oppose it because my party will also oppose it.<\/p><p>  There are currently a number of vacancies in the highest ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na: the Garda Commissioner, Deputy Garda Commissioner, an assistant Garda commissioner vacancy and three chief superintendent vacancies.  There is spare capacity at the top of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the right people must be found to fill those vacancies.  The Minister addressed the issue of the appointment of a Garda Commissioner.  This is the subject of my priority parliamentary question to the Minister next week and the Minister in her contribution tonight has addressed my question in part.  I suggest the Minister should consider delaying the appointment until an independent policing board is established.  The Minister has an ambitious timeline for the establishment by the end of the year of a fully independent and functioning policing board and it is good to aim for targets.  However, what we learned on our trip last week is that Scotland established an interim independent policing board and this policy has some merit which the Minister may wish to consider.  It may not be helpful to the person who is appointed as Garda Commissioner for a four or five year period if he or she is appointed in advance of the new independent policing authority.  Either position might be weakened in that situation.<\/p><p>  I agree with previous contributors that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has experienced a battering, so to speak.  We all interact with garda&iacute; every day of the week and they are looking to us for hope.  We must give them that hope and we must support them.  I have always tried to temper my remarks.  I agree we have to hold them to account and I agree we must criticise them - God knows they do not like taking criticism, just as none of us likes taking criticism.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in particular does not like taking criticism.  There needs to be a cultural change in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it is beginning to acknowledge the need for such a change.  However, I do not agree with some of the points of view of other speakers who have thrown a wet blanket over the entire force, such as that there is a cancer of cronyism and that lots of things are rotten in the force.  This is not helpful.  I agree there have been problems with issues relating to whistleblowers and with meeting standards and malpractice.  Debating those issues all over again will not move the situation forward.  We have learned from them but some of the language in this debate is ill-tempered and is not justified.  The message some people are trying to send in this debate is that those who have been promoted in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did not merit their promotions.  I did not hear any of those speakers offering any examples.  They have no working knowledge of the system of promotion in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na nor of the competition process which brings candidates to the stage whereby they are politically appointed.<\/p><p> This brings me to my next point.  Deputy Ross's Bill proposes that the Oireachtas appoint the Garda Commissioner, which is farcical.  The Deputy should give us a break, especially as it coincides with the proposal to establish an independent policing board and remove politics from the appointment of senior Garda officers.  We know where the sensationalism and populism starts on this issue but where does it end?  On the one hand, it is suggested it is wrong for the Executive to appoint a Garda Commissioner, notwithstanding that the Government is accountable and may be, and often is, turfed out of office by the electorate.  On the other hand, it is suggested that it would be right for 166 Deputies, or 158 Deputies in the next D&aacute;il, to appoint the next Garda Commissioner.  That position does not make sense. <\/p><p> We must adopt a model in which civic society, interest groups and people with appropriate qualifications sit on an independent policing board and drive forward the organisation.  These individuals should recruit the chief executive officer of the board and the Garda Commissioner.  This model would be in line with practice in the North and in Scotland and the majority of other countries where independent policing authorities appoint the chief of police.  This is the model we should adopt.  It does not make sense that Deputy Ross, who campaigns against quangos, is seeking to establish a new quango. <\/p><p> The Bill proposes the establishment of a system similar to the Top Level Appointments Commission, TLAC, which appoints senior civil servants.  Deputy Ross has been vocal in describing the TLAC process as one in which insiders promote insiders.  The hypocrisy evident on this issue shows no bounds.  We must learn from the experience in Northern Ireland and Scotland.  Last week, I and other members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality visited both jurisdictions where we met representatives of the independent policing boards of Northern Ireland and Scotland.  Before last week, I had not taken part in a single junket since entering local politics in 2004.  However, I was so interested in trying to ensure this matter is dealt with correctly that I decided to take part in the visit to Belfast and Edinburgh and of course I lived it up during the two-day trip.  We packed six meetings into one and a half days, during which we learned with great interest how the Northern Ireland and Scottish independent policing boards operate.  Highly structured and transparent systems are in place in both jurisdictions for the appointment of senior police officers.  As with Oireachtas committees, the independent policing boards hold regularly public and private meetings and meet as full committees and sub-committees.  They are able to challenge and hold the respective heads of their police forces to account.  Further, because they made the appointment they cannot outsource blame for problems that may arise to a quango. <\/p><p> I am highly critical of the local appointments commission, which appoints powerful, influential but untouchable local authority managers who have substantial reserve functions.  It is wrong that no one can query or criticise the work of city and county managers.  They should be appointed by the members of the local authority they serve, just as an independent policing authority should appoint the Garda Commissioner. <\/p><p> While I am unable to attend the worthwhile consultation exercise planned for Farmleigh, I will send my researcher to the event.  On our visit to Northern Ireland and Scotland last week, members of the joint committee learned that the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Dr. Michael Maguire, had previously been the Chief Inspector of Criminal Justice in Northern Ireland.  In this State we have the Inspector of Prisons and Garda Inspectorate, while Northern Ireland and other jurisdictions have an inspectorate that covers the entire criminal justice system, including the courts and office of director of public prosecutions or equivalent.  Problems have arisen in this jurisdiction with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  We do not have transparent oversight of the office, nor do we know to what standards it operates.  Rather than having separate inspectorates such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and Inspector of Prisons, there would be merit in establishing an overarching inspectorate for the entire criminal justice system.  Such an entity would also tie in nicely to the proposed independent policing authority.<\/p><p> I do not hold any brief for any of the incumbents or individuals who wish to be appointed to positions in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I wish the acting Garda Commissioner, Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, well in her current capacity.  There was a small hiccup at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and in fairness to the acting Garda Commissioner, having been blind-sided, she put the matter right.  She also made a positive start with the whistleblowers.  Ms O'Sullivan and all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deserve credit for the fact that crime statistics are moving in the right direction.  Unfortunately, recent events have shown that crime is ravaging the streets of parts of Dublin.  The shooting of a six year old child shot in a botched, gangland hit in Ballyfermot and an attack on a 16 year old in Clondalkin at the weekend were unbelievable incidents for which there is no justification or excuse.  Communities must not tolerate such acts and must support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> I ask the Minister to address one point made in a report published today by the Chief Inspector of the Garda Inspectorate, Mr. Bob Olsen.  Garda transport is an old chestnut about which Deputies hear regularly because we meet garda&iacute; every day.  A multi-annual dedicated budget for fleet management is required in order that the Garda knows how much will be available for capital expenditure on the Garda fleet, which is currently not fit for purpose.  As the Minister is aware, with the exception of Dublin and the east coast generally, the population is dispersed and predominately rural.  We need a mobile police service to keep people safe.  <\/p><p> The Bill is ill thought out and does not make sense given that those who support it also support the establishment of an independent policing authority.  One cannot support this legislation while supporting the establishment of an independent policing authority without the most important function of a policing authority, namely, the power to appoint the most senior police officer. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700050#XX00200","speaker":"1057","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403040900,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I concur with many of the points made by Deputy Niall Collins.  If the establishment of an independent policing authority were not imminent, the Bill would certainly deliver an improvement on the current position of having appointments made at Cabinet level by the Minister.<\/p><p>What is being proposed in this Bill is the establishment of a body where nominations would come before 158 Deputies following the next election and then there would be either agreement or not.  If there were no agreement, there is another process to follow which is laid out in the Bill.  If we were in a situation where there was no intention to establish an independent policing authority, one could certainly say that the Bill is a marked improvement on the current process.  However, we are looking at the establishment of an independent policing authority.<\/p><p> It is the view of my part that an independent policing authority is the best way to deal with the issue of appointments of senior garda&iacute;, whether Commissioners or assistant commissioners.  We have seen it working successfully in the Six Counties.  We have seen it working in Scotland.  One only has to look at last week where a new Chief Constable was appointed to the PSNI who received unanimous support across both communities because of the independent and transparent way in which that process is outlined.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn will focus more tomorrow evening on the particular thrust of the Bill which is the appointment of the Garda Commissioner and assistant commissioners.<\/p><p> Deputy Ross desires that this could be extended to appointments in other public areas and that would be done by ministerial order if the Minister so approves.  That is not the correct way to do it.  If we want senior appointments to public bodies to be free from political influence, what is proposed in this Bill will not do that.  What Deputy Ross proposes in sections 3 and 4, in terms of possibly extending it to other bodies, would no doubt strengthen public accountability and transparency but the fact that it would still be up to 158 Members of this Chamber to ultimately vote and hire that particular person does not fully remove it from the political process, which is what we need to do.<\/p><p> My party wants to see public sector governance being completely modernised.  Everyone is in favour of that.  It must be fully transparent.  It must be absolutely independent in all aspects of public appointments.  Such appointments must be made on the basis of objective merit and qualifications following an open and public process, and it must be made entirely free of public control or interference.  What this Bill proposes does not meet those standards.<\/p><p> The way to go is the establishment of a new public appointments commissioner to regulate a fully independent and impartial public appointments process, including not only senior public service positions but also positions in the management of other areas of the State, whether semi-State or public bodies, based on criteria which are agreed and in the public domain.  Unfortunately, this Bill is putting the cart before the horse.  The Minister has outlined that we will see the establishment of an independent Garda authority which will be fully independent from all political control and which will oversee the appointment of a Garda Commissioner and assistant commissioners.  We need to see that sooner rather than later.  I note there is a consultation day on Friday and it is the Minister's wish to see that legislation brought forward and established as soon as possible.  For those reasons, this Bill is ill-timed and, unfortunately, there are aspects of it which my party considers to be ill-thought-out as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700051#YY00200","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1403041500,"counter":560,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Seanad","time":1403041500,"counter":561,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700052#ZZ00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1403041500,"counter":562,"content":"<p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann has passed the Public Health (Sunbeds) Bill 2013, without amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700052#ZZ00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014: Report Stage (Resumed)","time":1403041500,"counter":563,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700052#ZZ00500"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1403041500,"counter":564,"content":"<p>Debate resumed on amendment No. 35:In page 62, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:&quot;52.

RAS was supposed to be short-term fix.  The implementation of HAP, as regards what landlords will get it, is very much based on RAS where one can work when paying with rent allowance.  The landlord will get the money directly paid to him or her.<\/p><p>  However, there is a real problem that there is the same supply.  What landlord will go into the HAP when they already have the RAS?  Landlords are pulling out of the RAS anyway.  It is impossible for tenants who are in RAS to get alternative RAS provision.  That is the problem that we have to address.  I do not understand why we are not doing so.  Even though it formed part of the programme for Government, it did so when the parties in government did not realise the extent of the housing crisis.  As Fr. Peter McVerry has said, it is a tsunami.  If we had a tsunami tomorrow, we would have to find the money to build infrastructure again to rebuild the city.  We are seeing the same in the homeless crisis.  It is a tsunami.  Where there is a tsunami, we have to find the funding to rebuild homes for those who have lost the roof over their heads.<\/p><p>  The idea of holding a review in six months is important so that we see whether this HAP is having any impact, as I do not think it will.  At the end of the day, the Government is still relying on the market where Mr. Wilbur Ross is pumping money in to supply investment for housing land.  He would not be going into that market if he did not think he would get a big return on it.  We must be wary about what has happened in the last period of time.  Unless the Government addresses the question of housing being market driven rather than there being a strategy and it being provided as a need, we will be looking at more hapless situations, such as this, or further legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700052#ZZ00700","speaker":"1193"},{"type":"speech","time":1403041500,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I support the principle of the amendment which proposes a review of the implementation of various sets of proposals.  Everything that has been said to date indicates that there is a need to be able to review the position to see that it is working effectively because of the consequences for individuals and families if the proposals in the Bill do not have the desired effect the Minister set out.<\/p><p>  I refer in particular to paragraph (1)(c) of Deputy Catherine Murphy's amendment, which refers to &quot;the number of local authority staff required by each housing authority for the optimal administration of the measures under this Part&quot;.  I repeat the point I made on Second Stage and subsequently, that in my experience local authorities do not dedicate sufficient staff to housing departments in order for them to achieve the optimal outcome in terms of either construction programmes when there was funding being provided or the general effective administration of housing.  I put it to the Minister that housing is not a priority for the Government and it has not been a priority for previous governments.<\/p><p>Although I am particularly proud of my own party's achievements in government, I have to say that when we were in government we did not give sufficient priority to housing.<\/p><p> As managers and potential managers look at their career paths and how they might build on them, they will see how the number of miles of motorway built through their county may enhance those career paths.  The number of community development organisations that are established may also enhance their career paths, as will the number of artistic programmes mounted in a particular county.  However, building local authority houses or working on the housing agenda does not seem to positively affect county managers' career paths.<\/p><p> The Minister of State should call in county managers and tell them in clear terms that her Department requires a level of achievement and output, as envisaged in the amendment before us which refers to a six-monthly review.  Without that level of enforcement, we will not see the sort of results we want.  It is more than just a problem for local authorities, it is also a problem for us as politicians.  I am convinced that one of the reasons housing is not a priority is because a large percentage of those on the housing list do not vote.  Many of them are not included on the electoral register because they move from place to place regularly.  They would have to make an effort above and beyond that made by other citizens to ensure they remain on the electoral register.  That is one of the reasons they are not the political priority they should be.<\/p><p> We hear much more talk about homelessness than about those on the housing list.  One reason for this is because many good, worthwhile and admirable agencies, such as the Fr. Peter McVerry Trust, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Threshold, have a particular focus on homelessness.  It is their focus that causes the issue to be prioritised to some extent in the national media, whereas the problem of the mainstream of people who require and depend on local authorities to provide housing supports for them does not get the same level of priority.<\/p><p> The Minister of State has an empathy and understanding of the issue but there is nothing in this legislation to indicate that sort of feeling is being given effect to.  The Minister of State should look positively on the amendment before us and give it the support it deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700052#ZZ00800","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403042100,"counter":568,"content":"<p>The Minister of State would be well advised to accept the amendment.  The idea of a review might be a handy way to get her off the hook because there is no question that the housing assistance payment or HAP scheme will not work.  This might be a good way for it to be reviewed in six months and then quietly ditched.<\/p><p>  I will not labour the points that others have made, but the private landlord class in this country is motivated by profit, not by housing social tenants.  At the moment, private landlords have absolutely no interest in taking on HAP, RAS - the rental accommodation scheme - or any other acronymic scheme.  That is because there is a lucrative queue of people elsewhere who are not on social welfare and who can outbid for rent.<\/p><p>  I disagree with the previous speaker that homelessness is a priority.  The priority is to hide it away, sweep it under a carpet and keep people out of sight.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State should drop her proposal because HAP will accelerate the demise of the Labour Party.  She may shrug her shoulders but it used to be a tenet of Labour Party thinking that social housing would be provided for working class people who could not afford to buy a house.  The Minister of State is now throwing people off housing waiting lists and putting them onto a HAP scheme.  It seems to be a crude way of eliminating potentially 70% to 80% of the housing list at the stroke of a pen.<\/p><p>  It was argued at the committee meeting earlier that there was some sort of parity between people on HAP and those in a council home, but there is none.  People want security of tenure to avoid having to move their children from school to school at the whim of a landlord a year later.  It is wrong, therefore, to suggest that it is a decent home.<\/p><p>  The Bill should be scrapped for another reason.  It is appalling to include deduction at source from the social welfare of council tenants and HAP participants.  It is high-handed, insulting and penalises the poor.  Apart from council tenants and social welfare recipients, no other group has a bill deducted from their income.  People are getting into rent arrears due to austerity, all the cuts that have taken place and the increase in fuel prices.<\/p><p>  It is sad to see a Labour Minister bringing in such a measure.

An ongoing review is built in during the course of the pilot phase which is a learning process.  On Committee Stage, I gave a commitment to report to the committee at the end of the pilot phase.  I will also be reporting back to Government, and generally, on the outcome of the pilot phase.  I will be examining it to see if elements need to be changed, including legislative change if necessary.  I can give Deputy Murphy an undertaking that at that point, if we need to put an ongoing review process into the relevant legislation, I will do so.  The next six months will be a learning process.

We are not moving towards reliance on private landlords.  We are actually reforming the system for people who are already, at least temporarily, reliant on private landlords because of the shortage of supply.  I fully acknowledge that there is a shortage of supply.  This is not moving a pile of people into a private landlord situation.  It is addressing the existing situation, which is that people are living in houses owned by private landlords.  They are in receipt of rent supplement with all the negativity attached in that if they are lucky enough to get a job, they will lose their rent support.<\/p><p>  When we debated this on Second Stage, there was a positive welcome for that element.  I hope some people will see some merit in this legislation.  I think there is quite a lot of merit in all three elements of the Bill.  It is not about moving towards privatising any system; it is about dealing with the current reality, largely because there is an under-supply.<\/p><p>  I have already acknowledged that there needs to be more regulation of the private rented sector to give more security for tenants.<\/p><p>We want to improve the situation for people who are currently in private rented accommodation by bringing it under the local authorities and giving them better rights, particularly with regard to the amount of money they have to pay, and relating it to their income.

I established the oversight group shortly afterwards.  It reported and we are acting on its recommendations.  This was not because the media highlighted the issue.  There was practically no media coverage of the establishment of the oversight group and the earlier stages of its works.  It was only in recent months that the media began to highlight this area.  I am not acting because of the media coverage; I am acting because it is the right thing to do.  We should not tolerate homelessness in a civilised society and a republic.  That is something I am determined to address.

She tried to cover over that by saying they can apply for a transfer but one can only apply to a local authority for a transfer if one is deemed to be in overcrowded accommodation or to have a medical priority.  One cannot apply for a transfer because one wants to move from private rented accommodation to a council house.  It is not even possible to apply for a transfer from one council house to another.  That was done away with ten or 15 years ago.  In reality, once a tenant is in a HAP scheme - he or she will not have any choice about it in the unlikely event that the council can come to an arrangement - his or her ten year wait on the list will be extinguished.  The only basis on which he or she will be able to get a transfer is medical priority or overcrowded accommodation.<\/p><p>  That is enormous and the consequences need to be monitored.  I appeal to the Minister of State, even at this late stage, not to proceed with this provision.  In the absence of rent control it is going to be an unmitigated disaster.  The disaster has already been unfolding but it will accelerate over the coming weeks.

Essentially, they are worse off where the entry level for employment is quite low.  I can understand why it becomes an issue.  There is no doubt, therefore, that this is a positive aspect of the legislation.  However, the biggest negative is that people will be taken off housing waiting lists.  I have encountered people who contacted the council because their landlords pulled out of RAS only to be told they had to source their own accommodation.  That will be the experience with this Bill.  The application of housing policy varies around the country depending on the local authority.  The biggest fault line in this legislation is that a tenant is deemed to be adequately housed and will be forced to source his or her own accommodation if the lease concludes.<\/p><p>  I have asked officials in my own local authority how they think this will play out.  There is no transfer list in Kildare County Council.  A tenant who is seeking a transfer is on the housing list.

I am not clear on how people will transfer from rental supplement to HAP.  Many of the 78,000 people who are in receipt of rent supplement are making top up payments.  What problems will we face when we come to assessing that in the local authorities?  I can see major problems in this regard because some of the rents being paid are over and above what is allowed.  Has this problem been encountered in the trial version of HAP in Limerick?  Have people reported receiving rent supplement payments that they had to top up?<\/p><p>  To deem people under HAP as having adequate housing is absolutely mad.  It is similar to what happened in 2011, when a rule was introduced stating that anyone signing up to RAS was to be regarded as adequately housed.  The same people are now being made homeless.  They cannot even find a local authority place because they have been made homeless.  <\/p><p>  We are doing all of this in the absence of rent control.  I do not understand how we are supposed to keep rents at a certain level, and monitor them, when two of my amendments on rent control were ruled out of order.  Whether it is tied to inflation or the cost of living, we must develop a mechanism for rent control.  It is done in other European countries.  The Minister of State's officials and officials from the Department of Social Protection acknowledged that people will end up off the housing list but she has not once acknowledged that people will be taken from the housing list if they avail of HAP.  She needs to have the honesty to acknowledge that is going to happen.   People will then start to wake up to what is happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700054#BBB01000","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1403043300,"counter":580,"content":"<p>This is the first time I have spoken on this Bill but I have followed the debate as much as possible on this and Committee Stage, as I have much interest in the issue.  My area has a high level of social housing and people dependent on rent supplement.  Other Deputies have spoken about rent supplement and I also cannot see how this Bill will help the problem, given our current economic climate.  The amendment would have the Government examine, after six months of operation, the effectiveness of this new process.  It would not tie the Government to an onerous amount of work or contradict the Bill.  It would seek to determine if the Bill has the effect that the Minister of State and her officials have spoken about.  I do not believe it can do so and the proposed process is not in a format to have such an effect.  It is another example of further entrenching the subsidisation of private landlords in this country.  Rather than doing this we should try to ensure an increase in supply of social housing and we should undo the lack of investment evident for quite a number of years with social housing in the country.  Spending did not keep pace in the good times or even in bad times, and in the past 20 years we have not properly addressed the social housing issue in a way that dealt with increasing housing lists.  That has definitely not been evident in the past three years.<\/p><p>  I agree with my colleague about rent control, an issue that can and should be considered very quickly so as to address a major problem in this city and, as far as I know, other locations on the island where private landlords are creaming it.  The proposed changes will not necessarily attract landlords into a system.  This process is modelled on the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and a pilot was implemented in Limerick.  Examination of the RAS operation in this city demonstrates that it has been a basket case, with the council now encouraging people to stay in accommodation despite it being sold from under them by a landlord.  Not only is the city council in breach of its agreement but it is encouraging the tenant to be compliant in such a position.  Tenants are frightened that in the morning either bailiffs or other parties could put them out on the street, despite the fact there is a legal agreement between tenant and the council.  The council has not been able to find landlords to take up the RAS in the past few years in this city.<\/p><p>  This new proposal for a housing assistance payment, HAP, will go the same road, creating more nightmares along the way.  It is a disgrace that anybody in these schemes could be taken off a housing waiting list as these are temporary measures.

The reasons for the transfer would have to be serious anti-social behaviour, violence, overcrowding or some major health issue.  One does not have a snowball&rsquo;s chance in hell of getting a transfer anywhere at the moment because the housing departments are inundated and their priority is to get people into houses rather than transfer people from one house to another.<\/p><p>The Minister of State was a bit unsure the last day we debated this Bill but has admitted today that people who go on to the HAP scheme will be knocked off the council housing list.  Officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government confirmed this at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Those people will be council tenants but without the rights of other council tenants who have secure tenure.  The Minister of State is right to say they will apply for a transfer because that is all they will be entitled to when they are regarded as being adequately housed.  The Minister of State is creating a second tier, yellow pack council tenant.<\/p><p>I take exception to the Minister of State&rsquo;s remark, one that I have heard from council housing officials, that many people are happy where they are and do not want a council house.  The people I deal with would give their right arm for a council house.  If somebody does not want a council house he or she will be offered two or three houses and will then be knocked off the list.  They will not be offered another and will not get rent supplement.  I do not know where these people are.  Maybe the housing officials actually believe that people want this form of housing.  They do not.  Many people who would not have seen themselves living in a council house some years ago would now be happy to do so.<\/p><p>I was brought up in a council house that was built in the 1970s.

It stems from the short-term measures included in this Bill, which we welcome.  We acknowledge the need for them but they are short-term solutions for many people who need a long-term solution.  The Minister of State has acknowledged that those accommodated by this scheme will come off the housing list.  Where they go from there is the problem.  The Minister of State says they will go on a transfer list.  In all the counties we represent there are fiefdoms, which have different rules and regulations and management structures for the control of lists and how people are transferred.  Some people cannot get a transfer unless they have been in a house for a year or two.  Some local authorities do not operate a transfer system at all because of the costs associated with it.  The Minister of State says she will apply a ministerial order to effect this.  How in heaven&rsquo;s name can she be in her office every second day writing ministerial orders for people who wish to apply for a transfer, when their local authority does not have a system that might accommodate that process in the first instance? <\/p><p>  The Minister of State knows well that there is nothing in this Bill to acknowledge the fact that a long-term solution needs to remain available to those accommodated on a HAP scheme.  We are all on the same wavelength in respect of this Bill and our amendment.  The Minister of State has acknowledged that she wants to get those people on a list.  The only way to do that is by accepting an amendment or at least by acknowledging, when she brings the Bill to the Seanad, the efforts many of us have made here today to ensure that long-term housing remains available to anybody on a HAP scheme. <\/p><p>  We all know the difficulty the Minister of State has had heretofore in raising funds to address this problem as it was historically addressed, through the provision of housing units.  Until local authorities can address the existing difficulties in a meaningful way we will not solve this problem.  Meanwhile, there are short-term solutions, as there have been for the past three or four years.  We acknowledge the Minister of State&rsquo;s efforts in that regard.  In the interests of conciliation and of serving our purpose here, to help those in need, the Minister of State must play her part in this process and accept some of these amendments in the good faith in which they are proposed.<\/p><p>  I did not want to have to say what other speakers have said but the Minister of State seems to deny outright and try to disregard everything and anything put before her.  I believe she does want to solve this problem and she is disappointed that many local authorities have taken the liberty of taking people off housing lists when short-term solutions are provided.  Rather than make ministerial orders, the Minister of State and the officials in the Department should put their heads together and either accept some of these amendments or take cognisance of what we have said because we represent many constituents around the country.  We are not making this up.  We are all interested in providing solutions.  The Minister of State has put forward short-term solutions in the hope of finding long-term solutions soon, through various means.  In the meantime, however, she should not deny these people the right and opportunity to have a long-term solution, as everybody on the housing list does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700056#DDD00300","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1403043900,"counter":622,"content":"<p>I will reiterate what I said in my first contribution on this issue.  The HAP is a temporary measure.  It is a temporary housing support mechanism.  It is a Dublin City Council tenancy with a private landlord who owns the house.  It is not social housing because it is not controlled by a local authority or a voluntary housing agency.  We are here because there has not been sufficient investment in social housing.  The response to the crisis which has been building up in the past five or so years has not been quick enough.  There has been a failure to act, to control the market, to ensure adequate supply, or at least some supply that would address the problems.  This Bill does not, in any shape or form, address the problems that emerged during the experiment with RAS in this city.  In fact, the legislation compounds those problems.<\/p><p>I accept the Minister of State's assurance that she will deal in regulations with the whole question of allowing people to get onto the transfer list.  Is she giving a commitment that every rental scheme, or every scheme of lettings in every local authority, will address the fact that regardless of whether one is in local authority housing or in the rental accommodation scheme, one must have already passed two years' tenancy before one is allowed to get onto the transfer list?  That is the current situation in Dublin City Council.  I think it is reflected elsewhere.  If the Minister is guaranteeing that people who have been housed with a housing assistance payment will continue on the housing list in their current situation, her approach differs from what is contained in the Bill.  In such circumstances, rather than promising that this will be done by means of regulation, it would have been better for her to ensure it is contained in the legislation itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700056#DDD00400","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403044500,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I mentioned earlier that Kildare County Council does not operate a transfer list.  A person who goes on the transfer list because he or she is unsatisfactorily housed essentially goes on the council waiting list.  If they go on that list today, they get the number for today.  If a person who has been taken off the list because he or she is deemed to be satisfactorily housed needs to be placed on that list again two years later, he or she will be placed at the bottom of it.  Some of these people may well have been on the housing waiting list for seven, eight, nine or ten years.  The fairness associated with the scheme of letting priorities is really going out the window under this approach, which means that people are constantly going to the bottom of the list.  I suggest that a transfer list should be introduced.  As I have said, not every local authority has a transfer list.  Such a list has certainly not been maintained in County Kildare for many years.  A variety of things will continue to happen throughout the country unless the Government sets a particular standard for them all to follow.<\/p><p>  I will explain why this matters hugely to people.  If the Minister of State asks someone who has been on the housing waiting list since 2005 or 2006 whether going off the list and getting a housing assistance payment would compensate them for losing the hope of ever having a home, she will be told that would make them feel like they are renting someone else's property without retaining the hope of ever having a home.  There is a world of difference there.  Not all of the consequences of the ongoing use of a system that moves children around frequently can be counted from a financial point of view.  The consequences for children of having to move away from the support of schools and things like after-school activities that would be normal in most children's lives cannot be quantified in monetary terms.  One of the reasons people in this country buy houses is that they really have no other option if they want security of tenure.  We need to have a rental option - a third way - that provides security of tenure for people who can afford it.  That is a whole other day's work.  I do not think this has been thought out.  It has certainly not been thought out from the point of view of the 90,000 people on the housing list, the 30,000 people on the rental accommodation scheme and the people who are going to enter the list when they have their houses repossessed.  This particular aspect of the Bill is certainly not acting in their interests.  I am not disputing it in so far as it relates to the poverty trap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700057#EEE00200","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1403044500,"counter":625,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1403044500,"counter":626,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 36 and 37, in the name of Deputy Ellis, are out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700057#EEE00400","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1403044500,"counter":627,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 36 and 37 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1403044500,"counter":628,"content":"<p>As amendments Nos. 38 to 43, inclusive, are related, they may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700057#EEE00600","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1403044500,"counter":629,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 38:<blockquote>In page 63, to delete lines 31 to 34 and substitute the following:&quot;(2) (a) A housing authority may, if a tenant has refused to pay rent for a specified period of no less than 3 months and has refused to engage with the relevant authority, make a request to the Minister for Social Protection to deduct from net scheme payments the amount of rent payable to the authority by the relevant recipient concerned and to transmit the amount deducted to the authority.&quot;.<\/blockquote>These amendments seek to deal with the hardship that results when rent deductions are made from social welfare payments.  They set out what should happen if tenants refuse to engage and call on the Department of Social Protection to give tenants ten days notice before any deduction is made.  I am also proposing that a report should be compiled within six months of any deduction.  I am very uncomfortable with the idea of moneys that are owed being mandatorily deducted from social protection payments.  I recognise that tenants must pay their rent.  Evictions on the grounds of rent arrears or non-payment of rent should be avoided at all costs.  This method of retrieving owed rent moneys should not be availed of other than in the most extreme cases.  I refer, for example, to a case in which someone has owed rent and has refused to engage with the council over a sustained period.  This method should not be used to end the practice of councils working with tenants who have fallen behind to reschedule payments through mediation.  These issues should be dealt with by means of this very positive process in the first instance.<\/p><p>Many tenants have fallen behind on rent at one time or another.  Due to the very small supply of social housing, it is the preserve for the most part of the most disadvantaged communities in our society.  It can be very difficult for many tenants, especially older tenants, to manage their money.  This has increasingly been the case during the recent years of austerity.  Many families have had to choose between paying the rent and keeping the light on or food on the table.  Countless heads have been kept above water in bad times because such decisions have been facilitated by councils that have shown flexibility.  Amendment No. 39 provides that: &quot;No single deduction ... may be made if it would reasonably cause undue hardship or suffering to the tenant concerned or their dependents.&quot;<\/p><p>Many other deductions are being made by the Department of Social Protection at present.  Deductions are being made for the purposes of the household charge and they will be made when water charges come along.  Now they are to be made for rent arrears.  It goes against all my principles to make this mandatory.  People need flexibility when bills come in.  They do not know when they are going to come in.  They have to make a little sacrifice every now and again, before catching up later.  That is the way many people work, whether we like it or not.  They have no choice other than to act in this manner.<\/p><p>The concept of giving someone the power to make a deduction from a social welfare payment is alien to me.  However, it has increasingly been a part of the way this Government has operated.  It crept under the radar when it was first brought in and used in the cases of the household charge and the other charges that were introduced.  It is very offensive to people to have their control of their own moneys taken from them.  The Department is taking more and more control of their moneys.  I think it is a really bad way of doing business.  This was brought in by the Labour Party, along with its colleagues.  I think they got away with murder when they did this in the first place.  That is why I am proposing these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700057#EEE00700","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1403044500,"counter":630,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 41 in this grouping is in the name of Deputy Catherine Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700057#EEE00800","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1403044500,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I know the Department of Social Protection has the ability to make a deduction from a social welfare payment if there has been an overpayment at some point in the past.  In some cases, the Department goes back very long distances.  This section of the Bill allows for a 15% deduction.  Can this be applied in addition to another deduction?  If there has also been a social welfare overpayment, for example, is it possible that two deductions would be made in such a scenario?  Is there a bottom line in terms of the amount of money that people are likely to be left with in terms of a social welfare payment?<\/p><p>I referred on Committee Stage to the constituent who approached me regarding his property tax bill and the cheapest method of paying it.  If he paid it in the post office, he discovered, it would cost him &euro;1 per month on top of the tax itself.  Having concluded that the best approach was to ask for the tax to be deducted from his social protection payment, he was told that this could not be done because it would leave him with less than the supplementary welfare rate to live on.  There is something of a paradox here in the context of what is set out in the provisions we are discussing.<\/p><p> We are all agreed that people should pay their rent.  Moreover, there certainly are people who have a poor record in this regard and must constantly be chased.  There are others, however, who inadvertently find themselves in rent arrears.  I made the point on Committee Stage that there must be a change in the situation whereby people lose their job in January but their rent payment is calculated on the basis of what they earned in the previous year.  Such a person is very likely to run up a debt.  While people in that situation might well be in arrears on paper, when it comes to doing a reconciliation the following year and taking into account the reduction in income for the time they are out of work, they may not, in fact, end up with the stated arrears.  Nevertheless, it is very difficult to manage money in that situation and for people to estimate what the arrears might be.  Instead of an annual review, a quarterly or half-yearly review might be more appropriate.  A clarification is required in terms of how rent payments are calculated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700057#EEE00900","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403045100,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I am very concerned about these provisions.  I have argued with the Minister for Social Protection in the past regarding the provision in legislation to deduct up to 15% of a person's social welfare payment in the case of overpayments.  Now we have a Minister of State in another Department, who also is a member of the Labour Party, seeking to allow for deductions from social welfare moneys in a way which denies people control.  The vast majority of adults are able to manage the few pennies they get from social welfare, but these provisions take any degree of control over their payments from them.  There is often a situation where a person faces an exceptional payment such as a particularly high ESB bill, as many people faced following the particularly cold winter the year before last.  In those circumstances, some people will put off paying their rent until the following week or month.  It is not a practice one would like to see happening all the time but, in the main, people are clever enough to manage their own affairs and willing to endure a degree of suffering on the second or third month to ensure their rent is up to date.<\/p><p>  The vast majority of local authority tenants have good rent payment records.  On the other hand, there are those who make a hames of it and cannot manage their money.  Help is available in that situation, and successive Governments have encouraged people to go to the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.  It is a good thing to assist people in managing their finances and put in the types of orders the Minister of State is providing for here to help them.  What is not acceptable, however, is to not write into legislation a provision for a compulsory deduction from social welfare payments.  That is very much in the realm of Big Brother and it leads one to ask where it will stop.  For example, would the value of food or butter vouchers, if they are ever reintroduced, be deducted at source?  Will the Government continue deducting until those on social welfare are left without a penny?<\/p><p>  It is important to note that not all persons dependent on social welfare are in receipt of &euro;188 or more per week - anybody under the age of  22 receives only &euro;100.  If anybody on this lower rate is in the HAP scheme, will the &euro;30, &euro;40 or &euro;50 rent payment be deducted from their social welfare?  What will they be left with to feed themselves and pay the electricity bill?  These provisions have not been properly thought out.  There must be some degree of control left to those who are reluctantly dependent on social welfare.  It is a sad indictment of this State that we have so many in that situation, unwillingly dependent on social protection payments and the provision of social housing.  It shows what a basket case the country has become.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700058#FFF00200","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1403045100,"counter":634,"content":"<p>The Deputy can blame Fianna F&aacute;il for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700058#FFF00300","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1403045100,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I did not suggest these problems were caused solely by the current Government.<\/p><p>  This provision is a step too far and the Minister of State should take the opportunity to withdraw it.

Arrangements are made to assist them and when people break those agreements, the council will help them again.  It is very rare that people are evicted for non-payment of rent because local authority officials understand the circumstances which render people dependent on this type of assistance.  They are the same people who seem set to end up dependent on the HAP scheme because of the failure of the State to provide adequate social housing.  Under the new scheme, however, they will not have Dublin City Council to fall back on because the money will be taken at source and they will end up in arrears somewhere else.  We have already seen the magnitude of arrears to electricity and gas suppliers.  How many people have been cut off in the past two to three years?  These numbers are a reflection of the type of crisis and chaos in which people are finding themselves.

If the Minister of State, as she indicated, wants to reach a solution over which we can all stand and which deals with this crisis, the Government would be well advised to put back the reconvening of Report Stage for a quite a while and convene some sort of forum, which is not time limited or strictly controlled, where we can sit down and try to come up with something that would work, including discussions about how we could finance long-term social housing provision but also the short-term issues, because we might actually get somewhere.  There have been some useful exchanges in this debate and some understandings and illuminations to which all of us have contributed.  If we could take that forward instead of being dragooned into accepting this legislation in a few days' time or whatever, we might actually get somewhere.  That is just an appeal to the Minister of State.  <\/p><p> I would like to make three points on the issue of direct deductions.  It is effectively punishing people who are victims of the recession and the economic crisis which have impacted on families in manifold ways - in a whole diverse range of ways into which I cannot even begin to go now where people may fall into arrears.  Of course, there are cases of people who are just negligent, who are abusing the system or whatever, but they are a minority.  There is, however, a very significant problem of rent arrears which has escalated in recent years and one can absolutely see the correlation between that escalation of the rent arrears crisis and the impact of recession, austerity and cuts in other areas on families and their capacity to pay rents.  Therefore, the fact people get into arrears is often because of circumstances completely outside their control.  I will give a few examples.<\/p><p> One very common example is that many council tenants actually pay their rent ahead.  They pay more than their rent as a safeguard against anything ever going wrong.  This is very common among council tenants.  They pay their rent plus a bit just in case anything ever goes wrong, where they have exceptional needs, a death in the family, an illness or some difficulty which will mean they may not be able to meet their normal rent commitments.  Those sort of emergencies and crises hit almost every family at some point in their lives, if not a couple of times.  Suddenly, they can find themselves, for a period of six, eight or ten months, not able to meet their normal rent commitments which they have done religiously for all of the period of time they have been council tenants.  However, they will be punished under this measure because of circumstances outside their control.  That happens often.<\/p><p> I will give another common example before I get to specific examples, where somebody faithfully pays his or her rent and declares all income, earnings and all relevant circumstances to the housing department, in terms of the assessment of his or her rent, but the council makes a mistake.  This happens all the time.  The council assesses the person's rent as being at such a level but a year or even two years down the line, it says, &quot;Sorry, we made a mistake&quot; and although the tenant answered all the questions faithfully, when it looked at their assessment, it saw it should have been charging a higher rent.  Over night, through no fault of the tenant, he or she is suddenly told that although they thought they were in the black, they are actually in the red to the tune of &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000.  This happens all the time.  I deal with rent sections which say they are sorry they made a mistake but the person has to pay for the mistake and that they will take it directly out of the person's money even though it is through no fault of the person's.<\/p><p> I will give another example of a family where somebody in the house has a problem - say one of the principal earners has a problem with drink or something like that but his wife and children believe he is paying the rent and are giving him money to pay it but he is not doing so and they do not know about it.  He is culpable and the council has a legitimate case against him.  In one particular instance, a couple subsequently separated but the whole family was evicted for rent arrears.  Some &euro;12,000 of rent arrears had built up through no fault whatsoever of the children or the wife but they were all evicted.  In this case, the money would have been directly deducted from their income even though it had nothing to do with them.  That is not fair and this is the problem with what the Minister of State proposes.  There will be innocent victims of all sorts of situations which are not the fault of those tenants.  Of course, we should help and assist people who may have difficulty paying their rent but the best way to do that is to make sure people are not pushed into poverty.<\/p><p> I will give another example, of which I should have thought and which is coming up all the time now.  The different quality of council housing means that many tenants, in particular those in older council houses, have to pay much more on heating than tenants in new council houses because there is chronic damp and the houses were built a long time ago and are substandard.  A tenant, through now fault of his or her own, has to buy an electric heater because the place is damp.  It is really the council's responsibility, and often the council will say it is its responsibility but it does not have the money to dry line the house or to put in insulation, so people have to fork out a much higher proportion of their meagre income on heating the place than somebody who happens to be in a new council house.  As a result of the need to keep warm during the winter, people find themselves in arrears and unable to meet all of their rent commitments.  They will be hit on the double because the council will say it is now going to grab the money from them, making a bad situation worse.  That is not uncommon.  There is a lot of housing stock in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, and I am sure elsewhere, where there are chronic problems of damp, lack of insulation, cold and so on and where people are forced to spend massive amounts of their meagre incomes on just keeping the place warm, in particular during winter, and let us not forget the fuel allowance has been cut, making that situation worse.  <\/p><p> Under this measure, these people will be punished and told that the council will grab a portion of their social welfare payment, pension or whatever.  It is absolutely not fair.  We must have measures to deal with people who are abusing this but if people are having difficulties, we need compassion, flexibility and housing departments which have the flexibility to actually recognise where some people have got into difficulty through no fault of their own and should not be punished as a result.  On those grounds, I ask the Minister of State to seriously reconsider this measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700058#FFF00500","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403045700,"counter":638,"content":"<p>This section of the Bill is totally Dickensian.

It is an absolute cheek to dip into people's social welfare payments to pay rent.  This seems to be the Government's latest response if people cannot pay.  It has introduced deduction at source for the property tax, but it seems only for the poorest in society.  <\/p><p>  Others have said why people get into arrears.  People are in arrears because they are suffering from six years of austerity.  These people are at the absolute margins of society.  The largest single group in poverty in this country is lone parents.  Most of the people on the councils' waiting lists and in council housing are lone parents.<\/p><p>A sure-fire way of landing in poverty is to rear a child on one's own.  That is why people struggle with rent.  Fuel has been mentioned also.  Disputes should be also part of the equation.  A lot of council tenants in our council area had pyrite problems in their homes.  Does the Minister of State consider it right that they had to pay their council rent all through the years of waiting for the problem to be fixed?  I do not.  A person in private rented accommodation would not have to do so.  The people concerned did pay the rent but they would have been justified in withholding it.<\/p><p> The key point is that we should not under any circumstances allow such an infringement of people&rsquo;s civil liberties, namely, that their incomes could be deducted to pay a bill.  It is redolent of Big Brother that the local authority and the Department of Social Protection can connive and conspire in that way.  I contrast the approach to the treatment given to Denis O&rsquo;Brien that was publicised last week.  He was struggling with his debts and the bank wrote them off to the tune of &euro;300 million.  While council tenants will have their deductions taken away from them, the rich at the very top of society escape scot free, as they normally do.  The proposal is an outrageous infringement of civil liberties.  I am surprised that it is legal for a person to have his or her income cut to pay a bill.

In terms of social welfare recipients, I do not believe they should be singled out but two basic principles should be at play.  First, where tenants consider it would be advantageous and would assist them in their overall financial management and where they are willing to agree to a deduction at source, that should be facilitated.  I would welcome the inclusion of a such a provision in the legislation because it would help many people who have difficulty in managing their finances.  When we look at the work of MABS, for example, we realise that there are many people who find it extremely difficult to manage the very scarce financial resources available to them.  Whether that is the result of austerity or circumstances that prevailed prior to the advent of austerity is perhaps a moot point.<\/p><p>  On the proposed amendment which addresses deductions of 15% or 5%, I believe the 5% proposal is reasonable in all circumstances and I urge the Minister of State to take that on board.

The deduction of 15% would be excessive and would be likely to give rise to real and sustainable hardship in most families who are in receipt of social welfare payments.  The Minister of State has not accepted any amendments to date.  I hope she will make a name for herself with this legislation and be brave enough to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700060#HHH00200","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1403046300,"counter":641,"content":"<p>The introduction of systems that will ensure rental contributions due from tenants on social welfare are paid directly to the housing authority is central to the implementation of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  At the end of 2011 the extent of the accumulated rent arrears across all housing authorities was &euro;53.25 million.  By the end of 2012 the figure had risen to &euro;56.4 million.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh in particular referred to the fact that the majority of tenants do pay their rent.  It is a differential scheme so it is based on income.  It is not fair to those people who pay their rent that others on the same income with the same family circumstances are not be obliged to pay their rent.  Some arrears have been written off as bad debts but the problem is very serious and must be addressed.<\/p><p>  The effect of the proposed provisions is to meet a person's housing need on a continuous basis by providing a mandatory rental deduction facility whereby a person does not fall into arrears, which would have the effect of reducing financial liability for local authorities for rent arrears.  Where a mandatory direct deduction facility is not available, this would also have serious consequences in allowing arrears to develop in the context of creating a poverty trap for the households concerned.  In one of Deputy Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s examples he said the man of the house was not paying the rent but the rest of the people in the house thought he was and therefore they fell into arrears.  That would not happen in the case of direct deduction because the money would be deducted at source and the rent would be paid.<\/p><p>  In reply to Deputy Coppinger who has just left the Chamber, it is important to note that the Office of the Attorney General has agreed with the principle of a mandatory deduction of rents.  We did get legal advice.  The requirement for accommodation is a basic human need.  The office has further advised of no legal impediment to deducting a rental payment at source for the provision of social housing support and in making the tenant or HAP recipient pay the full rent amount on the basis that it is the tenant who enters a binding contract on the provision of support and therefore has a legal obligation with respect to the payment of rent.  The same advice also stated that there is no legal requirement to have a limit in place as to the amount to be deducted.  There is a clear basis in law that housing is addressing a basic human need and it is perfectly legal to deduct at source.<\/p><p>  In terms of arrears we also have been advised that there is no legal impediment to the deduction of rent arrears.  In response to Deputy Catherine Murphy&rsquo;s question, the 15% includes the social welfare overpayment so it will not be 15% plus, it will be a maximum of 15%.  The scheme is designed to be realistic rather than punitive in terms of representing what a householder can reasonably be expected to pay.<\/p><p>  In respect of amendments Nos. 39 and 42, in so far as they provide for the Minister for Social Protection to notify the tenant of the authority's request for a deduction in respect of rent or rent arrears, the Minister for Social Protection will facilitate the request for the deduction of rent and-or rent arrears from a social welfare payment on receipt of the instruction from the housing authority.  As the information will already have been provided to the customer by the housing authority, it would not be necessary or administratively efficient for a further notification to issue from the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>  In respect of amendment No. 41, as previously advised on Committee Stage, the ceiling in the Bill of 15% of the weekly personal rate of a social welfare recipient for deductions in respect of social welfare overpayments and rent arrears is the same as the ceiling for recovery of social welfare overpayments only in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  As I indicated, the 15% is the overall amount that can be taken.  The 15% ceiling was set in consultation with the Attorney General's office as a realistic rather than a punitive limit on the deductions concerned and is considered to be the appropriate limit on deductions that would avoid the social welfare recipient falling into destitution.  That is the basis for deductions at source.  I have probably addressed the various issues - the debate ranged more widely &ndash; in terms of what the amendments contain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061700060#HHH00300","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1403046300,"counter":642,"content":"<p>The Minister of State mentioned the Attorney General who gave bad advice previously on upward-only rent reviews.

The same approach has been used in other areas.  People are struggling at the moment.  I do not know if the Government is aware of the high number of people  who are struggling currently.  Many of them have built up rent arrears.  I am not proposing that they should not pay it back or that people should not pay a fair rent.  Every possible means should be used to get people to pay rent but I do not agree with taking it from their social welfare payments.  In some cases people are receiving only &euro;100 a week because they are under a certain age.
