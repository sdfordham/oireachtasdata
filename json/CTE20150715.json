In the interests of brevity - I understand I have about ten minutes - my opening statement will be an abbreviated version of the written statement I made to the inquiry.<br\/><br\/>So, by way of background, the NTMA has a number of diverse functions, all of which are clearly defined in legislation.  A common theme running through all of its functions, with the exception of its State Claims Agency, is its engagement with capital markets.  Its original mission was to fund the Exchequer borrowing requirement and manage the national debt in a cost effective manner.  This mission has been added to by various Governments over the years.  The additional function most relevant to the banking crisis was the NTMA's role as manager of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, and I was the director responsible for the fund up to December 2009.  The NPRF was controlled by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, a body corporate which was independent in how it made its investment decisions.  When I was appointed CEO of the NTMA in December 2009, I became an <i>ex officio<\/i>member of the commission.  The legislation governing the fund was amended in 2009 in the context of the banking crisis to enable the Minister for Finance to direct the commission to make investments in Bank of Ireland and AIB.  In reporting on the fund's investment performance, the commission clearly delineated between the performance of those investments which it had made under its own discretionary powers and the so-called discretionary investments in Bank of Ireland and ... or directed investments in Bank of Ireland and AIB.  The NTMA had no role in relation to the oversight of the banking system and no responsibility in relation to the provision of liquidity to the system.  We believed that the role of lender of last resort fell to the Central Bank and ECB.<br\/><br\/>2007-2008: The function of the interbank money markets became increasingly problematic through 2007, culminating in the UK in September 2007 in the collapse of Northern Rock, a financial institution which heavily relied on non-retail funding in a way not dissimilar to Anglo Irish.  There were sharp falls in 2008 in the share prices of Irish banks with, for example, the share price in Anglo Irish falling by 18% in one day.  These falls reflected concerns about the impact of the continuing fall in Irish property prices on the banks' earnings and also the wider international background of non-functioning money markets.  In September 2008, the NTMA was invited to attend, with the Department of Finance, meetings of the domestic standing group and, depending on my availability, I attended meetings of that group.  The deteriorating liquidity position of the Irish banks, in particular Anglo Irish and INBS, was the group's biggest concern and, on foot of those concerns, the Department of Finance put in hand, as a contingency measure, the drafting of legislation providing for a scheme for bank and building society nationalisation.  <br\/><br\/>On 14 September 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy.  Around that time, the Minister for Finance asked the NTMA to retain corporate finance advisers in the area of bank resolution.  I was involved in procuring the services of Merrill Lynch in that context.  Merrill Lynch subsequently provided advice which formed an input to the deliberations culminating in the Government decision to guarantee the deposits and debt liabilities of six domestic financial institutions, the covered institutions.  As the committee is aware from evidence given by my colleague, Brendan McDonagh, the NTMA was not involved in the deliberations of 29 and 30 September.<br\/><br\/>While the guarantee helped the covered institutions, in particular Anglo Irish, to attract funding through the interbank market and retail deposits, at least in the near time ... term, the share prices of the quoted banks continued to perform poorly, signalling continuing market concerns about their profitability and possible requirements for fresh capital.  In a statement issued on 30 November, the Minister for Finance said that, in certain circumstances, it would be appropriate for the State, through the National Pensions Reserve Fund or otherwise, to consider supplementing privately sourced additional capital for the covered institutions.  On Saturday 13 December 2008, with my colleague Brendan McDonagh, I attended a day-long meeting in the Department of Finance, where the question of bank recapitalisation was considered.  We pressed strongly at that meeting for the nationalisation of Anglo Irish, which was also the approach recommended by Merrill Lynch.  In the event, the view that Anglo should be recapitalised, rather than nationalised, prevailed.  A Government announcement on 21 December 2008 on recapitalisation said that there would be an initial State investment of &euro;1.5 billion in Anglo and that agreement had been reached with Bank of Ireland and AIB that each would issue &euro;2 billion of preference shares to the State.  At the request of the Minister for Finance, I was heavily involved in the discussions with Bank of Ireland and AIB, leading up to that announcement.  <\/p>  <p>         At the outset of those discussions, the banks resisted the suggestion that they needed fresh capital and, in particular, the provision of capital by the State.<br\/><br\/>2009: The proposed recapitalisation of Anglo was abandoned with a statement by the Minister for Finance on 15 January 2009 that it would be taken into public ownership citing &quot;a weakening in its funding position and unacceptable practices&quot;.  In the meantime, there were ongoing discussions with Bank of Ireland and AIB on how their &euro;2 billion capital injections could be achieved.  Against an international backdrop of banks generally increasing their core tier 1 capital, it was agreed in discussions, which I chaired, that the State would provide &euro;3.5 billion core tier 1 capital for each bank through preference shares.  It was the view of the NTMA that, given its bigger balance sheet, AIB was likely to require more capital than Bank of Ireland but AIB stuck to its view that its problem was no bigger than Bank of Ireland and that it would only recommend to its shareholders a deal based on its quantum of additional capital being the same as Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s.  The Minister for Finance decided that the &euro;7 billion of capital was to be provided by the NPRF.  The NTMA engaged PwC and Arthur Cox to undertake due diligence on the two banks.  To help us oversee this exercise we retained Sir Andrew Large, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, as a &quot;trusted adviser&quot;.  In response to a request from the Minister, the due diligence exercise was tasked with forming a judgment with respect to the probability of each bank&rsquo;s core tier 1 capital being above the regulatory minimum at end-2011 and with identifying matters or issues which might reasonably be considered of a &quot;red flag&quot; nature.<br\/><br\/>The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission reported in March 2009 to the Minister on Bank of Ireland.  The due diligence results indicated that there was a reasonable prospect that, allowing for the proposed capital injection of &euro;3.5 billion by way of preference shares, the bank's core tier 1 capital would be above the then current regulatory minimum 4% at end-2011.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission reported the Minister on AIB in May 2009.  The results painted a doubtful picture about whether the bank would be above its regulatory capital minimum of 4% at end-2011.  The Minister directed that both capital injections be proceeded with and the NTMA, on behalf of the NPRF, executed on them.<br\/><br\/>As CEO of the NTMA, I was an <i>ex officio <\/i>member of the NAMA board from its inception in 2009 and, in its early days, was heavily involved with Brendan McDonagh in recruiting its senior management team.  I believe that the decision to set up NAMA was the correct one and, based on the NTMA&rsquo;s engagements with institutional investors and the credit rating agencies.  I am strongly of the view that its success played a huge role in Ireland later regaining access to the debt capital markets.<br\/><br\/>In June 2009, the Minister for Finance invested &euro;3 billion in share capital of Anglo Irish.  The Minister invested a further &euro;1 billion later that year.  These investments were made in cash drawn from the Exchequer and the NTMA was not involved in their execution.  As the committee will be aware, subsequent capital injections were made in the form of promissory notes.  The use of the promissory notes had the advantage that their redemption by the Exchequer was spread out over a 20-year period, thereby easing the pressure on the NTMA to access capital markets.  At end-2009 Ireland remained relatively highly rated by the major credit rating agencies, notwithstanding downgrades over the previous 18 months in response to the deterioration of the public finances and the very evident stress in the banking system.  Ireland was broadly rated AA or equivalent, but generally with a negative outlook.  The NTMA raised &euro;35.4 billion in long-term funding in 2009.<br\/><br\/>2010: In February 2010, the Minister for Finance announced his intention to delegate certain functions in the banking area to the NTMA.  This announcement stated &quot;All of these functions will be carried out on behalf of the Minister, and in close consultation with the Minister and relevant officials in his Department and building on the existing very close co-operation between the two organisations.&quot;  The initiative to delegate the function was the Minister&rsquo;s own and was not in response to representations by the NTMA.  From a policy setting point of view, very little changed in reality with the Department maintaining a tight grip on policy issues, albeit with input from the NTMA, among others.  However, the delegation order brought all of the covered institutions operationally within the remit of the NTMA.  Following the making of the delegation order, the NTMA built up a banking unit staffed by experts in banking, bank analysis and corporate finance.  In March 2010 the Central Bank announced that banks would be required by year-end to meet a base capital ... core tier 1 capital ratio of 8%.  The Central Bank also announced the results of a prudential capital adequacy review, PCAR, which indicated that both Bank of Ireland and AIB had additional capital requirements.  The AIB requirement was further increased in September 2010 based on experience of the actual discount rate or haircut applied by NAMA.  The NTMA banking unit was involved in executing, on behalf of the NPRF, the necessary transactions, which, in the case of Bank of Ireland involved private sector capital, to address the capital shortfalls.  The Central Bank also identified significant additional capital requirements for Anglo, INBS and EBS.  <\/p>  <p>         The extent of the additional capital requirements and, in particular, the huge loss announced by Anglo during this period were major factors in Ireland subsequently having to withdraw from the bond markets.<\/p> <p> The NTMA's funding and debt management unit raised &euro;19.9 billion in long-term funding in 2010.  We concentrated a significant portion of our long-term borrowing programme in the earlier part of the year in order to maximise the advantage to the Exchequer of the good terms for Irish sovereign debt which existed at the start of the year.  As a result, the NTMA had achieved its borrowing target for 2010 before conditions deteriorated markedly during the final quarter of the year and we had to cancel auctions which were scheduled for October and November.  At end 2010, not least because of Ireland&rsquo;s entry into the EU-IMF programme, Ireland&rsquo;s credit rating was barely investment grade and, indeed, one rating agency subsequently marked it down to sub-investment grade.  The tone of eurozone sovereign bond markets was severely damaged in October 2010 when, at an EU summit in Deauville, Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy said that holders of eurozone sovereign debt should be forced to take losses or haircuts as part of any debt restructuring.<\/p> <p> I was a member of the team of Irish officials who were directed by the Minister for Finance to hold discussions with the EU Commission, ECB and IMF in mid-November 2010.  At the time, there were ongoing substantial losses of corporate and retail deposits by the Irish banks.  In response to a request from the Minister for my views on whether Ireland should apply for an EU-IMF programme, citing the severe liquidity strains on the banking system and the risk of a collapse of the system, I wrote to him on 21 November 2010 recommending that an application be made.  I said I envisaged that such assistance would provide for a capital strengthening of the banking system and, although likely to be expensive, would also provide sizable funding to the State.  I stressed that appropriate liquidity support from the ECB would be a necessary complement to a decision to apply.  Unfortunately, such liquidity support was, in my view, only grudgingly provided by the ECB to the extent that their public utterances could have been much more supportive.<\/p> <p> On Saturday 27 November 2010, I wrote again to the Minister, at his request, furnishing comments on the proposed programme of financial assistance with particular reference to its implications for debt sustainability.  I said that the &euro;35 billion earmarked in the proposed programme for proposed ... for potential capital injections in the banking system would, if implemented, substantially increase the risk of sustainability of the national debt.  I recommended that, with a view to mitigating the extra burden on the Exchequer represented by such additional borrowing, the question of a formal bail-in should be considered through aggressive liability management or a resolution regime with respect to the subordinated debt and senior unguaranteed debt on the banks' balance sheets.  Together with the Secretary General, Department of Finance, and the Central Bank Governor, I attended part of the Government meeting held that night where consideration was being given on whether to accept the proposed terms of the programme to be told by the Minister that the question of a formal bail-in, which he himself apparently had favoured, had been flatly rejected at a meeting earlier that day of the G20 in Korea, a fact of which I was not made aware until then.<\/p> <p> 2011-2012: As part of the conditions of the EU-IMF programme, the Central Bank undertook in early 2011, under the supervision of the ECB, a further PCAR exercise.  In the context of mitigating the cost to the State of providing further capital support to the banking sector which was expected to arise for that ... from that exercise, and for which, as I mentioned already, &euro;35 billion had been earmarked, the NTMA commissioned a study to look at a bail-in-burden-sharing scheme involving senior as well as subordinated debt holders in the covered institutions.  The scheme identified substantial potential savings, depending on the level of discount or haircut applied.  For the scheme to proceed, the support of the troika was critical but once again such support was not forthcoming.  Nevertheless, liability management exercises were pursued through 2011, which helped mitigate the cost to the State of the Central Bank's 2011 PCAR, the results of which were announced on 31 March and which identified an additional capital requirement of &euro;24 billion.  During the first quarter of 2011 the NTMA banking unit conducted the sale by auction of the deposit books of both Anglo Irish and INBS.<\/p> <p> Following the entry into the EU-IMF programme and an announcement in February 2011 by the Minister for Finance to second the NTMA banking unit to the Department of Finance, the strategic focus of the NTMA shifted back to what we regarded as one of our core roles - funding and debt management - and the challenge of regaining access to the capital markets so that Ireland would have sufficient funding visibility at end 2013 to exit the programme.  That challenge was made all the more difficult because, in addition to demonstrating that we had enough cash to meet day-to-day Exchequer needs after the end of the programme period, there was an Irish Government bond falling due for repayment in mid-January 2014 in an amount of some &euro;12 billion, which we would have to demonstrate to the market was \"money good\".  Irish sovereign euro denominated bond yields hit record highs in July 2011 with the yield on the two-year bond reaching 22% and that of the benchmark bond hitting 14%, implying huge falls in the market values of those bonds.  <\/p>  <p>         The spiking of Irish bond yields well into double-digit figures, more or less coincided with Moody's downgrading Ireland to sub-investment grade, which meant that part of Ireland's long-standing investor base was no longer open to us.  We therefore embarked in mid-2011 on a vigorous programme of engagement with over 200 existing and potential institutional investors in Ireland, the UK, the rest of Europe, the US and the Far East.  The investor relations programme yielded relatively early results when, in 2012, we raised &euro;5.2 billion on the market in long-term debt, regained regular access to the short-term markets and succeeded in reducing the outstandings on the January 2014 bond to &euro;7.6 billion.  A hugely supportive development in 2012 was the statement by the President of the ECB that the ECB was prepared to do whatever it takes to save the euro.<\/p> <p> 2013: there were two further supportive developments in 2013.  These were the commitment by the EFSF and the EFSM to extend the maturities on their programme loans and the replacement, on the liquidation of IBRC, of the promissory notes provided to IBRC with long-dated floating rate sovereign bonds carrying maturities of up to 40 years.  The combined effects of these two initiatives was to reduce by &euro;40 billion the amount that otherwise would have to be refinanced over the next ten years and to extend the average maturity on Ireland's public debt from seven and a half to 12 and a half years.  The NTMA raised &euro;7.5 billion in long-term debt in 2013 and reduced the outstandings on the mid-January 2014 bond to &euro;2.7 billion.  The Exchequer ended 2013 with sufficient cash and other short-term investments to cover 12 to 15 months' financing needs, facilitating the exit from the programme.<\/p> <p> Conclusion: I believe that the NTMA responded positively to the expectation of the Minister of Finance that we work closely with him and his Department in seeking a resolution of the banking crisis.  Our involvements brought us into areas which were well outside what were our core functions.  The crisis was domestically generated but the complexity of its resolution was added to by the global banking crisis, which had seen the collapse or rescue of household names and the major dislocation of international bank markets.  The apparent absence of crisis management skills in the ECB - in contrast with the IMF - was, I believe, also a complicating factor.  Ultimately, in Ireland's case the crisis resulted in, among other things, capital markets being closed to us.  Forming judgments and making decisions to try to come to grips with the crisis was obviously complicated by a lack of reliable information in a hugely volatile environment.  Decision making in such circumstances can seem like trying to catch a falling knife.  So, for example, it was only on the third attempt and with the benefit of knowing what the NAMA discounts or haircuts were likely to be that the banks were adequately capitalised.  I trust, Chairman, that the committee will find my statement helpful.

And the rolled-up interest was part of the loan conditions made to certain debtors.  And, by definition, with the interest being rolled up, the loans couldn't be in default because there was no interest payable.  But what we found interesting, and again as a non-accountant I found extraordinary, was that the banks were accruing as income the interest in those rolled-up arrangements.  So I remember when we did our due diligence on AIB, we asked them about the extent of the rolled-up interest because with the collapse in the property prices, it was obvious to us that rolled-up interest probably would never be collected, and yet for prior years those rolled-up interests had been treated as income and would have been reflected in the profits of the banks who clearly ... which clearly, therefore, with the benefit of hindsight, would presumably have been overstated.

First, there is the nominal GDP growth rate, second, there is the average cost of funding the stock of that and, thirdly, there is the primary surplus that you have to run in order to sustain the debt.  The growth rate ... there was a lot of uncertainty attaching to the growth rate if you back to 2011.  We had come through the horrors and if, for example, you took the growth rate projected for Ireland by the ECB, you were looking at debt to GDP ratio rising to 160% according to our internal simulations.  So the situation was far from clear and, indeed, one of the issues which I didn't mention in my submission was that the reduction in the interest rates by the external authorities was an important factor in actually bringing about the sustainability of the debt.  That, coupled with the extension of the maturities.

As requested by the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis, I am providing this witness statement in my capacity as CEO of the Irish Banking Federation, the Federation of International Banks in Ireland, a position I held from January 2004 to June 2013.  I'm endeavouring to address the broad themes which the joint committee has requested of me in my capacity as CEO of IBF for the period - the relevant period - to the extent possible in this capacity.<\/p>  <p>  By way of background, IBF was established in 1973 on Ireland's accession to the European Economic Community to represent the Irish banking sector internationally as well as domestically.  FIBI was formed following the establishment of the International Financial Services Centre so as to provide a particular focus for the needs of international banks.<\/p>  <p>  My own appointment as CEO of IBF commenced shortly after the establishment of the Irish Financial Services Authority.  My responsibility was to assist the council of the IBF in formulating strategy for the IBF and implementing that strategy.  The council of the IBF typically consisted of either the group CEO or the head of the Irish retail banking division of the main Irish banks, domestically-focused international banks and the CEO-country managers of several of the internationally-owned, internationally-focused banks.  I represented the sector at European level as a member of the executive committee of the European Banking Federation and I also represented the sector through membership of a number of relevant Irish industry and State-sponsored bodies.  I also represented the sector for certain engagements with the media and in engagements with the State and with public representatives.  Such engagement took place when common themes existed for the IBF&rsquo;s membership, which themes had been endorsed by the council of the IBF.<\/p>  <p>  My tenure covered two quite distinct, separate phases.  The first phase was the period 2004 to 2008 which saw a significant increase in the number of financial services companies and banks operating in the domestic Irish consumer banking markets, culminating in, for example, over 13 providers of mortgages.  This was a period of rapid but, as subsequently proved, unsustainable economic growth, with overseas banks entering the market - either directly or through acquisition - and with the established banks seeking to grow their business and\/or responding to this wave of intense competition.  At the same time, there was also considerable growth in the number of banks establishing internationally-focused activities to operate from Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The second phase involved the aftermath of the international and domestic banking crisis from mid-2008.  The impact of this crisis and its aftermath on the stakeholders of the IBF&rsquo;s member banks, including their customers, shareholders, staff and the taxpayers of their home countries - including, of course, Ireland - is well documented.  The aftermath included some of the following outcomes - retrenchment, insolvency, restructuring, nationalisation and exit for a significant number of banks operating in or from Ireland.  In some cases, this reflected the fact that entire banking groups' business model and activities were fatally or fundamentally flawed or a recognition that the business models for their Irish activities were either flawed or could not be maintained as they sought to preserve capital, liquidity and reduce costs.  The designs of the group business models for these banks and of the business models for the Irish activities of these banks had a number of different features and they responded in a number of different ways to the challenges these business models faced.  However, common business model flaws were: under-capitalisation; over dependence on wholesale funding; aggressive pricing; and loosening of credit standards coming into the crisis, followed subsequently by rapid retrenchment to core - often home country franchises - post the crisis.  The burdens on the Irish taxpayers and on the shareholders of the domestic Irish banks from the flaws in their business models has been the subject of a wide range of reports and investigations, including this inquiry.<\/p>  <p>  Noteworthy has also been the in excess of approximately &euro;50 billion which has been borne by the shareholders-home taxpayers of overseas banks, who had to recapitalise their subsidiaries competing in the domestic Irish market, and\/or losses they actually incurred as they retrenched from the Irish market.  This retrenchment-exit also caused significant difficulties for Irish consumers as they sought to make alternative banking arrangements away from the products-product providers which proved to have been unsustainable and\/or customers finding that their loans-mortgages had been sold to entities where the customer had no choice in the matter.  I should also say that, as a member of the executive committee of EBF, I witnessed similar pre and post-crisis features across the banking industry to differing degrees of severity.  Given the role of IBF as described above, we were not privy to, and did not have a role in adjudicating on, the funding or liquidity policies, the risk management models or the composition, skills and experience of the boards of individual banks.<\/p>  <p>  My term as CEO of IBF commenced shortly after the formation of IFSRA, as I've said, and I noted early on that the consumer director sat on IFSRA's board whilst the prudential regulator did not.  In the period up to September 2008, the primary interaction I had with IFSRA was on consumer-orientated regulatory matters and initiatives and this was the focus of the agreed strategy of interaction agreed with me by the council of the IBF for the domestic banks.  For example, during my tenure the IBF had the responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of a range of consumer focused initiatives such as the Dormant Accounts Act, interbank switching codes, IBF-money advice bureau - known as MABS - debt protocol, promotion of electronic payments, consumer protection codes and the establishment of the Social Finance Foundation.  For the international banks, there was considerable focus on taxation-related issues and skill shortages in the Irish market.  I sought on several occasions to have broader dialogue with the Central Bank on general banking issues but was given the clear message that IFSRA was the primary conduit for engagement.  There was also a focus for the IBF on engagement, through the EBF, with the European integration agenda in terms of payments, consumer protection and other initiatives to complete the EU Single Market in financial services.  From time to time, we also submitted technical papers prepared by members in response to regulatory consultations both locally and at EU level.  To my recollection, business model discussions and general issues of prudential regulation in areas such as capital, liquidity or credit standards were not a notable feature of agenda discussions within the IBF or between IBF and regulatory or other authorities.<\/p>  <p>  As CEO of late ... of IBF, I was, in late 2004, appointed by the Minister for Finance as a member of the financial services consultative industry panel, which was in existence up to June 2010.  The role and mandate of the panel was to act in an advisory capacity to the newly-established Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.  Its role was similar to panels operating in other jurisdictions, such as the practitioners panel which operates in the UK under the aegis of the Financial Conduct Authority.  The panel published five annual reports covering the period 2005 to 2009, inclusive, the broad themes of which were as follows: a critical focus on the balance struck between the prioritisation and allocation of resources to the conduct of business - i.e. consumer - and the prudential regulation roles of IFSRA; a request that the regulator deepened its understanding of individual firms' business models given the diversity and complexity of regulated firms operating in Ireland; consideration be given to having a designated senior executive focused on IFSC supervision; with reference to EU legislative and regulatory agendas, it proposed the appointment of a dedicated senior executive with responsibility for co-ordination of the Irish engagement and response; it proposed reviews of competition barriers in retail banking; we called for extensions of provisions of consumer codes to non-deposit-taking entities then operating as mortgage lenders; and sought the application of regulatory impact assessments to major regulatory and legislative initiatives; called for investment in HR and IT support services and review of the associated shared services model which then in place between the Central Bank and IFSRA; we commented on proposed industry levies and methods of allocation and general commentary on IFSRA's annual budgeting process; and the promotion of benchmarking against best practice regulation in comparable jurisdictions.  <\/p>  <p>           In the interests of time, Chairman, I'm going to summarise the verbatim piece from the report.  But the panel in its final annual report of 2009 noted that the panel was to ensure a meaningful participation in the debate around the reform then under way of the regulatory structure.  We published a paper in that regard, and it was acknowledged subsequently as a significant contribution to that debate, and that culminated in the Central Bank Reform Bill of 2010.  And among the things that we had stressed and that we found reassuring in the actual publication of the Bill, was that the single most important ingredient required for successful reform was the quality of the people.  There was a very good beginning made with the appointment of Central Bank Governor, Patrick Honohan, and Financial Regulator, Matthew Elderfield.  The regulator's strategy was proposed to the ... or presented to the panel prior to its public announcement and we noted very positively the fact that a lot of the recommendations we had made previously in relation to the critical importance of an appropriate skills mix in the regulator, an understanding that the regime should be risk based and not &ldquo;one-size-fits-all&rdquo;, and the importance of a strategic policy unit was all broadly contained within the strategy, so we were very pleased about that.  <\/p> <p> As the crisis unfolded during the second half of 2008 the various members of the IBF became increasingly focused on their own specific issues and it became apparent that for some of the subsidiaries of international banks the key decisions were being taken outside of Ireland.  The members of the IBF had different senses of priorities, were reluctant to show their hands, for obvious reasons, and had differing degrees of mandates to articulate to the IBF as to what they wanted the IBF&rsquo;s mandate to be in engaging with relevant authorities and regulators on solvency and liquidity issues.  Engagement with the Central Bank, IFSRA and the State during this time tended to be focused on issues such as bank support mechanisms for customers, including those in mortgage arrears, and IBF obligations arising from the introduction of the credit institutions scheme.  <\/p> <p> Prior to 29 September 2008, IBF had no mandate from the IBF council to discuss specific Government liquidity or solvency support initiatives for the sector with the authorities and was not a party to considerations by the authorities on such matters.  During 2009, and particularly after the arrival of Professor Honohan as Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland and Matthew Elderfield as regulator, there was increased evidence of cross-stakeholder working groups involving the Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland, where IBF was a participant on sector wide issues such as mortgage arrears, codes of practice were ... where codes of practice, etc., were developed and enhanced, and I witnessed a high degree of co-operation and interaction.<\/p> <p> With regard to the troika, we were used by the troika as a source of information, particularly during 2011 and 2012, and views were solicited on a range of themes including: competition-related matters and issues; sectoral initiatives and progress on mortgage arrears resolution.  We had a number of discussions regarding judicial process, legislative and regulatory impediments we believed were exacerbating the problem and presenting barriers to resolution, and our views regarding proposed reform of the bankruptcy regime and the introduction of a personal insolvency framework.  We also discussed access to credit for SMEs and support for firms with a sustainable business who were experiencing financial difficulties.  All such interactions with the troika were either done in conjunction with the Irish authorities, or the details of the engagement were shared with the Irish authorities.  <\/p> <p> That concludes my statement.

There's a number of parts to that question so maybe I might just provide a bit of context first of all.  The Asset Covered Securities Act was introduced in 2001, well before my time as CEO of IBF.  It enabled the sector here to provide covered bonds as a method of funding, principally for the mortgage market.  This is a system that had been in place in Germany for over ... a couple hundred years, same in Denmark, same in France, so what we were doing was merely coming into line with what was a very accepted funding instrument internationally.  The Act of 2007 was an amendment to the original Act of 2001; it was an amendment.  The reason for the amendment of the Act was triggered by the pending introduction of the capital requirements directive, otherwise known as Basel II.  That was the EU's method of giving effect to Basel II.  And, because this concerned capital, it cut across almost all elements of the Asset Covered Securities Act and these instruments.  So, in order for the covered bonds legislation and the instruments to remain compliant, and to remain relevant and to be able to continue to be transacted, there had to be amendments made to the Act in order to align it with the capital requirements directive.  So, that was the principal purpose of the amendments.  It says in the note, and I have it in front of me, that it says we drafted the legislation.  I would feel, and I, you know ... the note is what it is.  We did not draft legislation.  What we would have done was said, in order for the Act to align with the capital requirements directive, these are the areas we believe will require amendment.  At the end of the day - and you will know this as legislators - parliamentary draftsmen, ultimately, frame legislation, Attorney General's office will have significant input and eventual sign-off, and, ultimately, it will go before a committee, and, ultimately, it will be placed before the House.  So, that was the context and that was the actual background to it.  Could I just say, as well, that, you know, it was fairly complex legislation and that may well again explain the rationale for having a third party, because I know, myself, the Department of Finance itself retains external legal advisers from time to time to advise them and support in looking at legislative issues and drafting of legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015071500002#FF01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1436914800,"counter":388,"content":"<p>In your time, the first part of my question was ...

They felt that they were being placed at a disadvantage so they ventilated their concerns to me quite robustly.  Then there were the two banks, Depfa  and WestLB I think, if I recall them correctly, in the IFSC who had been availing of and using the covered bonds programme that I mentioned, which had its origins in the 2001 Act.  They had been using that programme to issue bonds, finance and public sector assets, for quite some time and they were outside of it.  Then there was the added complication that Depfa, and this is well chronicled in the public realm, was for a short period of time seen as an orphan in regulatory terms because it wasn't clear whether it fell within the ambit of the regulatory authorities here or Germany, although I think with the benefit of hindsight it was very clear that it fell within the German responsibility because it had been acquired by a German bank some time previously.

This is my understanding, open to correction: there was an amendment in the updated legislation which included the ability for commercial mortgage to be collateralised and then be issued on the back of a covered bond.  First of all, a covered bond is a very highly rated instrument.  It has huge legal protections in it and it's retained on balance sheet, unlike a securitisation which is off balance sheet.  So a covered bond is a very good instrument.  There's nothing wrong with it.  It's a very, very good instrument for funding.  Let that be on the record.<\/p>  <p>  They asked for the inclusion of commercial mortgages and I think there might have been a general interest more broadly than that.  The fact was, across all competing jurisdictions, peer jurisdictions, the ability to include commercial mortgages in covered bonds, where there were covered bonds legislation was already the norm, so we were just, literally, coming into line.  That was legislation of 2007.<\/p>  <p>  The statutory instrument which gave effect to the element that allowed commercial mortgages to be collateralised was placed before this House, I understand, and I'm subject to correction, in mid-2008.  At that stage, as we know, events had overtaken us and, again subject to correction, but my understanding is that Anglo - you named the institution - didn't do a transaction under that particular mechanism.  I'd also like it to be recorded that, using the covered bonds legislation, it became a vitally important instrument for all of the banks operating here, because it became an acceptable method of collateral to post at the ECB window for liquidity purposes.  And we all know how important that actually became because the ECB had certain criteria for liquidity and one of the types of the liquidity they were prepared to accepted ... or collateral they're prepared to accept at their window for liquidity purposes were covered bonds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015071500002#KK01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1436914800,"counter":561,"content":"<p>Okay.

One of the objectives of the inquiry is to arrive at the understanding at the logic and rationale that underpinned the Irish banking business model.  The people who designed the system, who regulated the system and who lobbied for changes to the system were all intelligent and rational people.

It's also heavily legislated for and then there's all the governances that flow from the fact that it's an internationally-traded service.  I'm not best placed to determine how banking got to the level of opacity and complexity that it did.  The fact is, it did.  I made that statement in Kenmare.  I acknowledge it and, you know, since then the changes that have been undertaken in regulatory frameworks have, to some degree, tried to reduce some of that opacity and simplify it like, for example, the ring-fencing of investment banks from retail banks.  And actually that is probably one that speaks to your question which is that investment banking ... banks developed into situations where they became conglomerates, where they were investment banks and retail banks and, of course, investment banks are notoriously complicated instruments and they are quite a degree of opacity as we learnt through the crisis.

I'll just refer to a particular quote on that and then if I can move on from it.  You said prior to 29 September 2008, the IBF had no mandate from the IBF council to discuss specific Government liquidity solvency support initiatives for this sector with the authorities, and was not a party to considerations by the authorities on such matters.  Now, the note here ... I just want to refer to that, so in that regard ...however in July 2007 the IBF did participate in a liquidity funding workshop, this was attended by the IBF representatives of the major banks, and a representative of CBFSAI Central Bank Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  The summary note of which was sent to Department of Finance, which I think we have here.

And I haven't seen this before, but to the best of my recollection ... first of all I'm not ... to the best of my recollection I don't think I was at the meeting.  I'm, I may ... again I think it would have probably been handled by our prudential director because it would have fallen into that area.<\/p>  <p>  I think the background to it was that at that time, and I did advert to it earlier, there was continuing tensions in liquidity terms across global markets.  And at that stage I think some time in 2007 ... around that time ... the Central Bank introduced a new liquidity regime for all the banks.  And they required a whole new reporting arrangement with the banks for liquidity.  They asked them effectively to put their liquidity requirements as they matured out into different time buckets on a cash flow basis, so that they would have a much clearer line of sight as to what the liquidity requirements of each of the banks were going forward.  And that was understandable, given the heightened situation that existed in liquidity markets generally.  And, my understanding, that meeting would have been one where the banks would have come together collectively to understand ... or to use that form to understand what exactly the nature of the requirements would be and report in terms, tease out any questions they might have, the detail of it, and such like.

What changes did I make?  I go back again to the situation that from the very outset the whole environment, the discourse, the context for everything that happened in regulation was heavily weighted towards consumer conduct of business rules.  In fact, when I think about all of my engagements with Oireachtas committees, I'd say 90% - up to the crisis - were all about consumer conduct of business-related rules.  There was very little, if any, discussion about prudential matters.  So there was a consensus around that the area that the focus was going to be, from a public interest point of view and from the regulator's point of view was consumer, consumer, consumer.  That, kind of, led.  So, as us ... as a representative body having to face off against regulatory authorities and so on in terms of representing members' interests, the majority of our skill sets and the people that we employed were in that space of consumer conduct of business.  And even some of the things we did which we're, you know, probably associated with - like the switching codes, consumer protection codes, the debt relief protocol with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service - they are all testament to the fact that a lot of our output was in that whole space.<br\/><br\/>Post the crisis I was challenged, my team were challenged, to adopt to the change in environment, so we had to re-skill the team that we had.

I think that, without misrepresenting them, I think they all pretty well said that that did not become a barrier to good regulation.  They also ... I think again, it has been said here that we work within an EU-wide framework of regulation so it had to be applied without fear or favour regardless whether it was international or domestic bank.

But the interpretation of principles-based regulation may or may not have been applied in the appropriate way that they may have been in other jurisdictions, given the level of indebtedness and the impact of the financial crash in this country.

It had sectoral concentration limits which were, in their own words, \"in abeyance\"; it had the ability to raise capital limits for certain types of lending; it had the ability to rely on a compliance statement under company law, which was never actually called in; it had the ability to apply sanctions to the administrative sanctions regime for prudential matters, but it only ever applied them in the case of consumer.

I'm sorry there was political momentum and there was momentum within the banks themselves to retrench to their home markets.  In other words, let's stick to the knitting, let's look after the core markets and the customers of those core markets, which meant that a lot of subsidiary activity, IFSC, tended to run down or be closed.  I would say, and I think it's important to say it, like, the IFSC is not an abstract, kind of, concept.  As we speak, like, the IFSC employs about 35,000 people, generates about &euro;2 billion in corporate and payroll taxes, and, just by way of putting that in context, it's the equivalent of the vote for 2015 for the Department of Agriculture, Marine and Food, and for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.

I think where the thing ... I think where it finished up was and I think there is correspondence to this effect and I think it may have been referred to as well in the evidence that's been given thus far by some of the Finance people, was that the Department decided not to proceed with the compliance statements specifically to financial institutions because it was forming the view that there was adequate reliance could be placed on the provision of the compliance statement of the Companies Act and it also directly and pointedly, I think, communicated at the time to the Financial Regulator, that they did have this power, they did have this provision and they could rely on it if they required a compliance statement.

The scale and impact of events which are the subject of this inquiry are such that the work of this committee constitutes an important public service.  I wish to support fully the committee in its work by answering your questions and by furnishing, as I have, a statement regarding 15 lines of inquiry before the committee.  I will seek in my answers this evening to assist the committee as much as I can, as I sought to do in my statement, by setting out matters within my direct knowledge as Secretary General to the Government within the constraints of Cabinet confidentiality and acknowledging that many were matters in respect of which I didn't have expertise or responsibility.  I will summarise my statement under six headings.  In my statement, I indicated that I believed the conclusions of the Nyberg commission of investigation provided a broadly convincing account of the circumstances that led to the crisis.  Nyberg describes serious failings by a wide range of actors, including a number of key elements of the public service.  He notes that, ''Each one is [...] responsible for their own actions and inactions contributing to the accumulation and realisation of risks in financial markets''.  <\/p>  <p>         Everyone who was in a senior position in the public service over the relevant period, including myself, is burdened by these failings, and the deep awareness of their human consequences.  With the knowledge and analysis of that period which is now available, like others I am challenged by the question of whether I could have done more to avert the damaging outcomes from the crisis.  My regret is tempered only by the belief that I have performed my duties to the best of my ability.<\/p> <p> On the regulatory regime, following consideration of the report of an implementation group, the Government approved a proposal to establish a single Financial Regulator within a restructured Central Bank.  The proposed arrangements were altered following consultation with the ECB.  The Government reviewed the provision for a separate board structure for the Financial Regulator as an important focus for accountability and responsiveness to public and consumer concerns.  Following publication of the proposed legislation in 2002, further comments were received from the ECB, as a result of which the Governor's role in relation to the budget and staffing of the regulator was strengthened.  The ECB also welcomed the fact that the Financial Regulator would remain a constituent part of the Central Bank.<\/p> <p> The annual reports of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator were submitted for information to the Government.  These recorded the significant number of inspections of financial institutions carried out, and regulatory returns examined.  The report in respect of 2006 highlighted that international independent reviews of the Financial Regulator's performance contain positive assessments of the regulatory system in Ireland.  In its report of 2007, the IMF supported as appropriate the risk-based framework operated by the Financial Regulator in prioritising supervisory resources.  The Government decided in 2009 to create a new, integrated regulatory system under the direction of the Governor.  The Government was advised that, pending the enactment of new legislation, the boards of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator had made changes to the operation of the existing legislative framework through improved linkages between banking supervision and financial stability.<\/p> <p> On fiscal policy, the budgetary cycle involved the Minister for Finance setting out the broad economic framework within which budgetary decisions should be shaped.  This provided a context for the engagement by the Department of Finance with individual Departments to settle their spending Estimates.  The Department of Finance's proposals were based on securing financial stability and the productive capacity of the economy, while avoiding inflationary pressures and addressing priority needs.  The Department pointed out the potential for reverses, both domestic and international, associated with declining competitiveness, exchange rate movements, increases in commodity prices and the possibility of a downturn in construction activity.  The Department recommended the maintenance of a cyclically-adjusted positive general Government balance and containing the growth in current expenditure to the nominal rate of economic growth.  From 2003 to 2006, the stability programme reports presented to the Government identified a gradual and orderly reduction in housing output to a more sustainable level as a significant factor likely to impact on economic performance, partially offset by growth in other components of investment expenditure.  In the report for 2006, the potential for economy-wide consequences of construction-specific developments, such as rising interest rates, was noted.  The moderation in prices and activity in the property market in 2007 was highlighted.  The absence of a sense of impending crisis was reflected by an assessment by the IMF in 2007, which noted that the banking system was well-capitalised and profitable and that stress tests by the Central Bank indicated that even in an extreme scenario, the major lenders had adequate buffers to cover a range of shocks.  Economic policy was not formulated by Government in the belief that there was a serious risk to financial sector stability.<\/p> <p> The framing of budgetary proposals in Government discussions had regard to the terms of the relevant programme for Government and specific objectives adopted by the Government.  The substantial reduction in the debt-to-GNP ratio, substantial budget surpluses, significant annual transfers to the National Pensions Reserve Fund and an ambitious programme of investment in infrastructure to increase productive capacity, with little or no recourse to borrowing, created a sense of confidence with regard to fiscal matters.  There wasn't a single view about the conduct of policy or the outlook for the economy.  There was of course awareness of contrarian views occasionally expressed in the media regarding the risks of an economic collapse.  It was widely considered that this was improbable, while vulnerabilities were nonetheless acknowledged to exist.<\/p> <p> Most decision-making requires judging the probabilities of events occurring while striking a balance between competing objectives in the context of Government policy.  <\/p>  <p>         Collective responsibility requires members of the Government to support decisions once taken.  The legitimate exercise of its democratic authority by the Government must be respected by officials.  For example, the Department of Finance in its budgetary submissions signalled a preference for a lower rate of expenditure increase than occurred in a number of years.  In the years leading up to the crisis the direction of Government policy was not significantly altered in the light of parliamentary scrutiny.<\/p> <p> On banking matters, the primary relationship between the banking sector and the Government was through the Minister for Finance and the Department.  The banking industry was represented by the Irish Bankers Federation and Financial Services Ireland on general policy matters such as the development of the national payment system.  From the establishment of the IFSC, the Department of the Taoiseach chaired the Clearing House Group whose members included representatives from the Departments of Finance and Enterprise and Employment, the Revenue Commissioners, the Financial Regulator, the IDA and, later, Enterprise Ireland.<\/p> <p> The Clearing House Group and a range of associated working groups provided a forum for exchange of information and suggestions between different categories of participant in the sector.  As its name implies, the group was primarily a vehicle for commercial intelligence gathering in the context of the competition between jurisdictions for investment.  The focus of the group was the identification of opportunities and a variety of specialist activities, the marketing of Ireland and the tackling of barriers to growth, such as availability of skilled personnel.  The operation of a credible regulatory system was seen as critically important in securing the reputation of the industry and attracting appropriate new entrants.  Discussion at the Clearing House Group covered a broad range of public policy.  Concerns voiced at times about proposals which were seen as disproportionate, by reference to international practice, were pursued bilaterally with the relevant agency.  In published strategies for the future of the sector, industry representatives expressed their support for a regulatory system which was effective, consistent and efficient.<\/p> <p> Turning to the bank guarantee, in the period leading up to 29 September 2008 the Government was briefed on liquidity difficulties in the Irish banking system by the Minister for Finance and increased the deposit guarantee to &euro;100,000 on 20 September.  On the evening of Monday, 29 September a meeting attended by the Taoiseach, Minister for Finance and the Attorney General was advised that, unless measures were taken before the financial markets opened on Tuesday morning, irreversible damage could be done to the economy through a banking collapse.  The expectation that no Government would allow a bank to fail, especially in the aftermath of the Lehmans example, was reinforced by the potential consequences outlined to the meeting.  It was made clear that no European or ECB initiative was in prospect which would address the immediate crisis faced by Ireland.  The advice was that the Government had one opportunity to make a decisive intervention, to stabilise liquidity and secure the Irish banking system.  It would have no certainty of success but the alternative was certain disaster.<\/p> <p> A request to meet from the chairs and chief executives of AIB and Bank of Ireland was agreed.  The banks' representatives confirmed the gravity of the funding situation for the Irish banks, with difficulty in getting even short-term funding from the money markets.  The negative sentiment towards Ireland was focused on particular institutions, but all were now impacted.  They argued that effective action was necessary to reassure the markets.  The Taoiseach and the Minister resolved that a broad guarantee would be recommended to the Government.  The option of nationalisation of Anglo was considered, but it was concluded that such action could have more negative than positive effects on market confidence.  It was also understood that a decision to nationalise Anglo could be taken at a later date, should it be appropriate.<\/p> <p> The guarantee would be offered on commercial terms and would provide a framework for any measures required to build market confidence in the Irish banking system.  The approval of the Government was given by an incorporeal meeting which was conducted in the early hours of Tuesday, 30 September.  A particular concern was that the guarantee might be challenged on European state aid grounds.  It was agreed that a formal notification to the European Commission would be made immediately.  A full supporting case, including all of the material considered in the discussion, would be detailed in a submission at the earliest opportunity.  The European Commission subsequently approved the decision as an appropriate means to remedy a serious disturbance in the Irish economy.<\/p> <p> On the programme of assistance, in response to international concerns by mid-2010 about the State's financial position, the Government began the preparation of a medium-term expenditure framework in tandem with the fiscal responsibility framework.  <\/p>  <p>         It was considered that public confirmations for a recovery plan of the adoption of a comprehensive programme of fiscal reforms and specific measures to achieve the necessary deficit reduction by 2014 would improve market sentiment towards Ireland.  The continuing dependence of the Irish banks on ECB liquidity support was evident, as was a market view that further recapitalisation would be necessary.  The ECB Council conveyed to the Minister for Finance that the Government should apply for European financial support.  Department of Finance officials travelled to Brussels for exploratory discussions on the parameters of a possible programme of assistance if the Government were to decide to apply.  The tentative nature of these discussions reflected the Government's concern that the conditionality of any such programme could include unacceptable terms such as changes to the Irish corporation tax regime.  On 19 November the President of the ECB wrote to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Finance stating that ELA could only be continued if Ireland applied to the Eurogroup for financial support and proceeded with a decisive restructuring and adequate recapitalisation of the Irish banks.  The Minister, in consultation with the Governor and the CEO of the NTMA, sought the approval of the Government for a formal request for external assistance, given that the Government could not borrow in the market at current rates and the serious liquidity problems in the Irish banks.  Some days later, the national recovery plan was published by the Government - the programme of external assistance was formally announced on 28 November.  Imposing haircuts on unguaranteed senior bondholders was raised with the international institutions during discussions on the programme of assistance.  The concept was strongly resisted because of their concern about its potential impact on wider financial stability.  In March 2011 the agreement of the ECB was sought but declined for the announcement by the Government of a statement of intent to impose burden-sharing on unguaranteed senior bondholders in Irish banking institutions in wind-down.<\/p> <p> On changes since the crisis, with regard to the conduct of economic policy the establishment of the Fiscal Advisory Council and the oversight by the European institutions as part of the European semester have brought a greater transparency to Irish fiscal policy.  Policy analysis is supported by greater economic expertise within the public service.  The national risk assessment framework is a positive development and the legislation to provide for the registration of lobbyists and lobbying activity should also assist in the monitoring of efforts to influence public policy.  It is clear, however, that irrespective of any structural or capacity developments that may be implemented, Governments will still be faced with a need to exercise judgment in setting fiscal policy and in assessing the risk to be taken into account in framing budgetary decisions.  That concludes my opening statement Chairman and I am happy to answer the committee's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015071500002#NNN00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436914800,"counter":773,"content":"<p>Thank you very much Mr. McCarthy.

I want to speak briefly about what has happened since last Sunday or early Monday morning.  I will place it in the context of successive so-called rescues of Greece and draw a few conclusions about what this may mean for the eurozone going forward.  First, we need to be clear that what emerged at the weekend has not moved Greece any closer to an exit from reliance on official lenders.  The economic situation remains very grim.  The Greek economy looked briefly last summer as if it was beginning to recover.  There was then a political crisis towards the end of the year and things began to turn downwards.  We do not have very recent data but with the banking system closed down, as a result of actions by the ECB, in the middle of tourism season, it is reasonable to guess that economic activity in Greece is declining.<br\/><br\/>A number of forecasts are quoted this morning in the <i>Financial Times<\/i>from people who think that output will be down again this year.  The events of the weekend have also reminded people that there are fundamental design flaws in the eurozone and that these have yet to be properly addressed.  <br\/><br\/>I want to say a few things about this third Greek rescue.  Of course, it has not been negotiated yet.  All that happened at the weekend was that a process was initiated and there will now be discussions and negotiations that may eventually lead to a third so-called rescue programme for Greece.<br\/><br\/>I will give a little bit of background.  When states lose access to the private sovereign debt markets they can no longer run budget deficits, nor can they replace historic borrowings as they fall due.  Unless they can get some form of non-market finance, they will be forced immediately into possibly highly destructive fiscal corrections.  There are international mechanisms to avoid that.  The most important one is the IMF, which is a kind of credit union for governments.  Governments can go there if they can no longer finance themselves on the private debt markets.<br\/><br\/>In Europe we now have a common currency and arrangements have emerged in crisis circumstances in Europe.  As members of the joint committee know, the IMF has been corralled into these.The objective of official lending programmes as traditionally provided by the IMF has been simple - it is to return the distressed country as quickly as possible to credit-worthiness and hence to market access, without unnecessarily severe contractions in economic activity.  That is the objective of these programmes.  Sometimes they work and sometimes they do not, but mostly they have worked around the world.<br\/><br\/>We had a second programme for Greece in 2012.  This is the third one.  A second programmes means that the first programme failed and a third programme means that the second programme also failed.  The third Greek programme remains to be negotiated.  It will have to be implemented against the background of an economy which seems to be contracting again.  The banks are closed for business and will probably require yet another recapitalisation.  Greek government debt is already approaching 180% of GDP.  Some people feel that it will now rise to 200% if the rumoured terms of the third programme are enacted.<br\/><br\/>Of course, Greece has already been in default twice to the IMF.  The summit communiqu&eacute; released on Monday morning indicates that the third programme will have the following features; no early recapitalisation of the banking system that is not provided for in the communiqu&eacute;.  The communiqu&eacute; is only a draft.  It was done in a hurry and is also very badly written.  The detailed programme may fill in some of the gaps.  As of now, however, there is no provision for the early recapitalisation of the banks, or even for the early re-opening of the banking system; a renewed and front-loaded fiscal contraction - this, it should be borne in mind, in an economy that is almost certainly contracting again; and third, no write-down of state debt.<br\/><br\/>Commentators have already warned that a programme along these lines will likely see GDP in Greece not just fail to stabilise but also possibly to contract further.  I have cited two references to short pieces that were published yesterday and which are worth looking at.  There has been a score of other pieces by economic and financial commentators around the world, which are along the same lines.  They identify a high degree of risk that the third programme for Greece will also fail.<br\/><br\/>I would remind members of the committee that there is a third programme because the second one failed and there was a second one because the first one failed.  These people are predicting that there will be a fourth.<br\/><br\/>The communiqu&eacute; lists a series of reform measures, some of which could assist economic recovery in the longer term.  None of them is likely to have sufficient effect inside the programme horizon to offset the negative impact of new expenditure cuts and new tax increases.<br\/><br\/>I want to go back briefly to the first Greek rescue in 2010.<\/p><p>The financial crisis erupted around the world in 2008.  The European sovereign debt crisis started in Greece in 2010.  There had been weakness in various peripheral sovereign bond markets through 2009 and spreads widened and so on.  The first crisis of a country that looked as if it could not borrow at all happened in Greece.  The troika did not exist until the Greek rescue was put together in 2010, which was important and has cast a long shadow.  The background is that the government changed at the end of 2009.  There had been a New Democracy government under a man called Karamanlis, which had fiddled the figures.  The public finance numbers were not correct.  Public debt was much higher than it appeared to be and the budget deficit was much bigger.  The new PASOK government under George Papandreou progressively discovered the scale of the holes in the public finances, Greek prices fell and eventually Greece was forced out of the bond market and had to be rescued. <br\/><br\/>At this stage virtually all of the Greek state debt was debt to private investors in Greek sovereign bonds.  Greece did not have any official debt or none worth talking about.  Briefly, the state debt in the early months of 2010 turned out to be 115% or 120% of GDP.  People had thought it was much lower but the figures were not correct.  The budget deficit was into double digits and the economy was contracting.  In those circumstances, it is unrealistic to argue debt sustainability.  There were economists in the International Monetary Fund, IMF, at that time who argued that the Greek debt was not sustainable and there should be a haircut of sovereign bond holders.  That was not done.  It was overruled by the political leadership of the IMF and pressure from the big European states.  The first so-called rescue of Greece was a rescue of its creditors.  That will be familiar to people who followed what happened here with the creditors of the bust Irish banks.  Many of the problems we are dealing with date back to the failure to handle the first Greek rescue properly. <br\/><br\/>One of the things that disturbed me and many other observers about events last Sunday was the explicit threat to expel Greece from the eurozone.  The manner in which it was delivered was laughable.  Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, the German Finance Minister, referred to a five year time out from membership of the currency union.  That is utterly impractical and could not be done.  The fact that the threat was made was extraordinary.  This is meant to be a currency union, its members have abolished their own currencies.  They do not have any currencies.  People talk about bringing back the drachma as if it was still alive somewhere in a cave on Mount Athos and could be revivified.  It does not exist.  Greece does not have a currency any more than Wexford has a currency.  To threaten a state which has abolished its own currency with expulsion from the common currency is an extraordinary event and it was a first.<br\/><br\/>This in turn means that the risk of an ultimate Greek ejection from the common currency has not gone away.  As for the programme, if a third programme for Greece was being designed by economists rather than politicians who are trying to allocate blame, it would have several features.  It would have to show a clear path back to market entry, that is what financial rescue programmes do.  When the IMF takes the plane south, to Latin America, as it has often done, to Brazil and Mexico and places like that, its <i>modus operandi<\/i>is to find out how bad is it; say the debt is too big; find out who was foolish enough to lend the money, whether the government or the banks; break the bad news; give it a haircut; lend the government enough to get through a few years in which it will have to cut the budget deficit anyway, because it is a structural deficit, and hopefully get the country back into a position where it can borrow money again; and try to do that without deflating the economy too much.  That is what these financial adjustment programmes are supposed to do.  That is what it says in the text book.  That was not done in the first or second Greek rescues.  It looks like it is not being done in the third.  That means that the decisions at the weekend do not merely not address the problems in the Greek economy but they also do not remove the risk of Grexit.  Some of the newspapers on Monday reported this as great news and it means the risk of a country being flung out of the euro has been removed.  I do not think that is the correct interpretation.  That risk has not been removed.<br\/><br\/>As for the programme itself, there have been new reports this morning that the IMF may not participate in the next programme.  The German government tried to make IMF involvement a condition of there being a third programme.  There has been a lot of angst in the IMF about its involvement in 2010.  The IMF was split.  Many people in the IMF did not want to go along with the first Greek programme because they thought it was not properly designed and that it did not pass a test which has been in the IMF rule book for ten or 15 years, since the Argentinian crisis.  The rule is not to lend IMF money to a country unless the programme is going to make its debt sustainable and will get the country back into the sovereign debt market under its own steam within a few years.  That is my paraphrase of the rule.  The rule is known colloquially as the &ldquo;no more Argentinas rule&rdquo;.  The IMF had to ignore that rule, which it did not because the economists wanted to but because the executive board, which is political, and the then managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, wanted to participate in the Greek rescue as a junior partner with the European institutions.  The clock has turned, however, and it looks as if the executive board of the IMF may forbid the board to lend any more money to Greece because the deal does not respect the rule that it shows a plausible way to debt sustainability for Greece.<br\/><br\/>There is a long report in <i>The Financial Times<\/i>this morning, which I find credible but who knows?  The IMF has non-European members.  They are called China, India, Brazil, Australia and all sorts of other people.  It is their money as well.  Greece is in default to the fund and they are all conscious that what they agreed to do in 2010 was a mistake and it is possible that the IMF executive board will decline to participate in the third programme as envisaged.  The Germans have said they will participate only if the IMF does because there is some convoluted argument that they trust the IMF and they do not trust the European Commission or something.  I do not know what it really is about.  I would not assume the IMF is going to participate.<br\/><br\/>If any of the committee members have free time during the summer and want to understand the international politics of what is going on, they should read a paper by Paul Blustein about the first Greek deal.  It is a fantastic paper.  I note it at the bottom of the document I circulated.<\/p><p>This guy used to work for the IMF and he has spoken to all the principal actors.  I regard the May 2010 Greek deal as the original sin in the mismanagement of the eurozone crisis and this guy has nailed it.  If one reads nothing else about the first Greek bailout, this is the thing to read.  He has spoken to all sorts of people.  People retire all the time from the IMF.  Once they retire, they are free to tell the truth, which they are not allowed to do when they are in office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436967000,"counter":1443,"content":"<p>Similar to other institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#D00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436967000,"counter":1444,"content":"<p>It is a phenomenon with which we will all be professionally familiar.  I will finish with a few comments on the implications of all this.  A blame game has been going on for the past six months: the Greeks screwed up;  the Greek Government did not do its negotiations properly; the finance Minister wore a leather jacket; his wife forgot to wear a helmet on her motorbike or whatever.  Similarly, there have been allegations that the Europeans were engaged in blackguardism and blackmailed the Greek Government and all of that.  That is just a blame game.  What is interesting is whether the third programme passes the simple tests for a feasible and plausible rescue effort for a country that is in a mess.  To claim to be involved in the financial rescue business and then for it to say it is really upset because the country it has been sent to is in a mess is kind of weird.  Of course it is in a mess.  That is why the country called it.  Those in the ambulance business tend to find people who are injured when they are called out and they do not expect the callers to be able to drive the ambulance.<\/p> <p>  The explicit and unveiled threat last weekend of expulsion of a member of the eurozone was a pretty extraordinary event.  I can quite understand why the Greek Government felt it had to capitulate.  However, it creates a situation in which this common currency area is no longer seen as irrevocable by its leading member.  I think that will create conditions of instability very quickly the next time some country gets into trouble.  If that country is a big country such as Italy or France, the systems are retrievable but if it is a small country such as Portugal, Slovenia or Ireland, we now know that the small countries are expendable.  It is a fact that every finance Ministry in Europe has prepared contingency plans for what they will do if this thing blows up.  They will all deny it, for good reasons, but they all have them.  If I were involved with one of these smaller countries, I would be dusting off those plans now.  There is an increased risk the currency union will unscramble at some stage.  It is now clear that the smaller countries will be deemed expendable in those circumstances.  It has been a very bad week for Greece but it has been a bad week for the eurozone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436967000,"counter":1445,"content":"<p>The single currency was a political project.  It was not an economic project.  It was not designed by economists and most economists were probably quite antagonistic to it.  I am, therefore, going to be forced to say something about politics and to step outside my own area.  I agree with Mr. Colm McCarthy that no side has come out well over the current impasse.  Syriza had a very weak hand to begin with and played it very badly.  My graduate students were asking me over recent months whether it had not got any diplomatic advice.  Germany has reversed 50 years of hard work developing goodwill on the part of the other peoples of Europe.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has not played its hand well over this impasse either.  I remind the committee of a comment the historian Joe Lee made 30 years ago.  &ldquo;[While] the &lsquo;political&rsquo; skills of Irish representatives in negotiating situations are widely acknowledged ... there seems to be no comparable criterion for assessing the calibre of conceptualisation of the Irish case.&rdquo;  He is suggesting that we have a very good diplomatic service, which I think has stood us in very good stead.  However, the comments my graduate students made about Syriza can also be levelled at the Irish Government.  Traditionally, the Government's comparative advantage has been as arbitrators and facilitators in negotiations.  It did not make any attempt whatsoever to play that role this time round.  We seem to have forgotten a point Garret FitzGerald stressed repeatedly.  Every time he spoke about the European Union, he noted the important role the European Commission played as a defender of the interests of smaller states.  The European Commission has really been sidelined completely over the course of this impasse.  It has been sidelined over the course of the crisis going on years.  It is in our interests and the interests of other small and weaker states to try to resurrect the power and the influence of the Commission.  Instead what we have had over recent weeks is a naked battle of interests.  In these kind of battles, the interests of the strong will always dominate the interests of the weak.  This is something we really need to bear in mind.<\/p> <p>  Let us think back to the logic behind the single currency.  Flexible exchange rate systems lead to dramatic fluctuations in international competitiveness which can lead to conflict between states.  They are, therefore, regarded as undesirable.  The system of fixed exchange rates which we had over several decades or so in the run up to the introduction of the single currency was also regarded as undesirable because it did not prevent speculative attacks against currencies in the fixed exchange rate systems.  I am sure the committee will remember sterling crashed out of the fixed exchange rate very dramatically in 1992.  Then the speculative pressure came on Ireland and we crashed out shortly thereafter.  The single currency was seen as a way to avoid the undesirability of both flexible and fixed exchange rates.  Now, as Mr. Colm McCarthy said, rather than having an irrevocably fixed single currency that prevents speculative attacks, we have returned, under this notion of a Greek timeout from the euro, to that era of fixed exchange rates which are not irrevocably fixed.  We are now back into one of those worlds, which was deemed undesirable to begin with and one of the benefits of introducing a single currency.<\/p> <p>  Economists always view the introduction of a single currency essentially as a European federalist project.  It was known that there were design flaws in the system, but the assumption would be that when cracks appeared, that would lead to closer integration, essentially a united states of Europe.  It is clear there is no appetite for this now.  The people who constructed the euro to begin with were of that kind of federalist disposition and assumed that ultimately we would move in that direction and have something like a big Washington budget that cushions states of the US when they are hit by a shock.  We have no equivalent in Europe.  That is what I mean by euro federalism.  There is clearly no appetite for that now so we are stuck in limbo, or in a worse place.<\/p> <p>  The rigid fiscal rules that have been imposed and strengthened over time in the eurozone were really designed to obviate the need for that sort of Washington-style budget.  The notion was if countries adhered rigidly to these fiscal rules, they would not get into the sort of crisis where a Washington-type budget might be required.  Those fiscal rules were policed by the no bailout clause.  The no bailout clause said, \"If you make mistakes, you suffer.\"  It was designed to ensure mistakes were not made.  The no bailout clause imposes costs on lenders as well as borrowers.  If a company goes bankrupt, lenders suffer as well as the company.  The no bailout clause rule was overturned in the Greek case in 2010 by the troika.  As Mr. Colm McCarthy said, the IMF tore up its own rule book in tearing up the no bailout clause.  If the no bailout clause had been rigidly imposed in 2010, the IMF would have said essentially that Greece was bankrupt and that people who lent money to Greece would have to take a haircut or write off their debts.  That was overturned.  It was very strange that the IMF did it but the IMF, as Mr. Colm McCarthy said, is politicised.<\/p><p>Since then the successive Greek deals have said, in essence, and I will try to put it as pithily as possible: \"We will lend you more money, which you will never be able to pay back, in order to help you pay off your creditors\".  That is what these Greek deals say.  When I say it in that way, it is clear that it cannot work.  These debts will be written off sooner or later.  Ten years hence, when we are out of this crisis, these debts will be written off.  <\/p><p> Essentially, all this talk about reprofiling is a pretence or mirage.  If Colm McCarthy owes me &euro;1,000 and he is supposed to pay it back to me tomorrow, which is like money is my pocket, reprofiling means that I tell him not to mind paying it off tomorrow but I will take it from him 50 years hence.  That is what reprofiling is.  It is really the same as writing off the debts.  It is pushing them out so far into the future that, essentially, it is meaningless.  Governments do this for political reasons, not for economic reasons.  It is essentially the same as a write-off except it does not allow Greece to return to private markets.  Greece is still sitting with this high nominal debt to GDP ratio, so it cannot borrow in private markets.  It is the same as a write-off except it does not achieve the same purpose as a write-off would, which is to allow Greece return to private markets and borrow to get its economy under control.<\/p><p> For Greece, the situation with the current deal is that reforms are mandatory.  Nobody disagrees with reforms.  In the Irish case, to be honest, when the troika came here most economists more or less breathed a sigh of relief thinking that this would enable some reforms to be introduced in Ireland that the politicians could not get through because of the power of vested interests.  The question is whether that has actually succeeded, whether we have seen the legal profession opened up or not and so forth, and whether those reforms have really been achieved.  Reforms are a good thing, but reforms will yield economic benefits only in the long run.  There is no way that a reform will appear in the form of increased GDP over the next year or two.  It is a long run process.<\/p><p> The second element of the Greek deal is more austerity.  Austerity is detrimental in the short run.  It is a great deal more detrimental to Greece.  An equivalent amount of austerity in Greece is much more detrimental to the economy because the Greek economy is so much more closed.  With austerity in Ireland much of the hit is taken by imports.  We are three times more open to imports than Greece is, just as we are far more export oriented.  Being an open economy means that part of austerity is cushioned as the blow is taken by imports.  More austerity for Greece has a more dramatic impact on Greek GDP.<\/p><p> The final point I wish to make concerns the role of the European Central Bank, ECB.  Again, politics comes into play here.  For the last few years Mario Draghi has been the hero of the weaker, peripheral nations in Europe.  When he announced quantitative easing and said the ECB would do whatever it takes, that was to the benefit of the debtor countries.  The creditor countries, such as Germany, did not like it.  In the long term it is like inflating away one's debt.  Mr. Draghi was a godsend to the European periphery.  Politically, he and his cadre have seen that they have moved too far in terms of being in the corner of the weaker, peripheral states and over the current crisis they have reversed position and taken a course of action that has been detrimental to the peripheral states, particularly to Greece.  As Colm McCarthy has been writing, the Greek banks were solvent the last time it was checked, therefore the role of the ECB is to carry out its main function, which is to provide liquidity to banks that are solvent but illiquid.  It has failed in its duty to do that, for political reasons.<\/p><p> We are in a mess and, as yet, no exit strategy has been mapped out from the mess. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Frank Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436967000,"counter":1447,"content":"<p>This has been very interesting.

The trick is to see if there is some way to fix it.  One does not interrogate the patient and ask if they were driving too quickly and the like.

It is like 12 year old children playing football when some fellow gets a kick in the head and they say: \"It was not me, ref, it was him or him\".  That is really what has been happening for the last six months.  Various governments have unwisely got into stuff relating to what was the source of all the problems in Greece.

Debt write-down is a necessary condition.  It is not sufficient.  I will put it this way.  Consider April and May in 2010, a time when the Greeks owed approximately 120% of GDP.  It turned out to be a little more when the final figures were compiled, but everybody thought at the time that it was 115% to 120%.  The Deputy will recall that it was the Papandreou government.  The deficit was thought to be 10% of GDP that year, although it turned out to be a little higher as well if memory serves.  In addition, and very importantly, the economy was in a nose dive.  If one has a high debt and is running a high deficit, which means the debt is increasing, and the economy is sinking, that is debt unsustainability on any reasonable metric.  That is why the first Greek deal was such a mistake.<br\/><br\/>Currently, there are people who are saying that the Greeks owe 180% of GDP, but the repayment terms have been stretched out, some of the loans are now 30 year loans and so forth.  Some of the loans have the feature that the coupons do not have to be paid for the first five or six years, although some of the IMF loans are more up-front.  Some people have been saying that Greek debt is not as bad as it looks because of favourable reprofiling and the other matters Professor Barry mentioned.  That is fine.  However, look at the <i>Financial Times<\/i>supplement today and the page which shows what government debt is trading at in the secondary market.  One should do that from time to time because everything else in the <i>Financial Times<\/i>is some guy's opinion.  The figures show what that debt traded at yesterday, which was an interest rate of 12.26%.  That means Greece has unsustainable debts.  There is not a large amount of Greek Government debt out there at present, but what is out there is trading at an interest rate which is way off the chart of anything that is conceivable.  That is the bond market to which Greece is allegedly going to return.<br\/><br\/>I cannot repeat this often enough - the purpose of these financial rescues is to get the distressed country back to an ability to borrow at affordable rates of interest within two or three years.

If I recall correctly, the initial rate on the European money was 5.8%.  I think the rates on some of the other stuff were even higher.  Subsequently, the Irish Government succeeded, including the via the promissory note deal but separately as well with the European financial stability facility money, as it was called, in getting a lengthening of maturities and a reduction in interest rates.

Is there a body of economists who are looking at a structured route out of the euro in this scenario that would be as safe as possible?  It is the view of many economists that if Greece does not get a write-down, it will not be able to function within the euro.  If that is the choice Greece is facing, it must be the case that a level of work is being done.  What would be the best way?  What would that path look like?

The assumption is that a disorderly unwinding of the euro would be catastrophic.  Greece would not necessarily pull out by choice.  If the ECB was not providing it with the necessary liquidity, presumably the Greek Government would start to issue IOUs which would become the new drachma and would ultimately produce a currency to pay off those IOUs.  The general presumption is that this would be catastrophic for Greece because it would lead to hyperinflation.  The new currency would not hold its value.  It would depreciate rapidly and cause hyperinflation.  Nevertheless, it might be beneficial for Greece in the long run, depending on whether it denominated its debts in this new currency or whatever.<\/p> <p>  The exchange rate has been extremely beneficial for Ireland's recovery over recent years.  I checked the data before I came to this meeting.  In terms of the US dollar, &euro;100 would have translated to $160 in 2008, but now it is closer to $100.  In terms of sterling, &euro;100 would have bought &pound;90 in 2010, but now it buys &pound;70.  The exchange rate has been very important for us.  The weakness of the euro has been a major component of Ireland's recovery.  That is why I lauded Mario Draghi earlier.  It has been hugely beneficial to Ireland.  As Greece is essentially a closed economy, it does not benefit nearly as much from this as Ireland does.  In a way, this has been an unanticipated benefit to Ireland of having the euro.  Of course, there is no way of predicting whether the euro will be weak or strong.  It is a sort of random factor that has worked in our favour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Frank Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1436967000,"counter":1456,"content":"<p>Perhaps Mr. McCarthy might give his view on whether this could be done in a structured manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#F00400","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436967000,"counter":1457,"content":"<p>I would like to begin by reflecting on what it means for a country to join a currency union and to abolish its own currency.  It means the country has no exchange rate policy any more.  That is for sure.  Professor Barry has explained that.  He is quite right when he says that the weakening of the euro over the past while has been particularly beneficial for Ireland.  We are much more likely than the continental European countries to trade in sterling and dollars.  They tend to trade more with one another.  If a country scraps its own currency, it has deeper consequences beyond exchange rate policy.  It means that for all practical purposes, it is using a foreign currency, the creation and destruction of which it has no control over.  If its banks get into trouble, it cannot provide them with liquidity other than with the permission of what is for all purposes a foreign central bank.<\/p> <p>  Down through the years, some countries around the world have chosen not to have a currency.  Montenegro is an example.  When Montenegro was established as an independent state, the Montenegrin authorities decided not to bother having a currency.  The Deutsche mark, which became the euro, had been the popular currency in the Balkans.  As a result, Montenegro does not have a currency; it just uses the euro.  A few other European states, including the Vatican and Kosovo, use the euro without being members of the eurozone or the EU.  It would be fun if the Vatican got slung out.  I thought the Vatican banks had problems a while ago, but the ECB did not seem too bothered about it.<\/p> <p>  I would like to answer the important question that has been asked by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  A country in the position that Greece is in now might not benefit hugely if it had an independent exchange rate.  As Professor Barry has pointed out, Greece does not have a broadly based export sector like we have.  It is a quasi-closed economy.  However, if Greece had an independent currency, it would certainly be able to provide liquidity to its banking system.  In such circumstances, it would not have had to take the sucker punch that has been the closure of its financial system in recent weeks.<\/p> <p>  I was also asked about the practicalities that would arise if countries had to deal with some kind of chaotic break-up of the common currency area.  It could be incredibly messy.  It has happened in the past.  Two currency unions in Europe - the rouble zone and the Yugoslav dinar zone - broke up in the 1990s.  In the case of the rouble zone, each of the 15 constituent states in the Soviet Union retained a local central bank.  The central bank of the Soviet Union was the Bank of Russia in Moscow, but there was a central bank quasi-branch office in Kiev, in Almaty in Kazakhstan, in Belarus and in all the other places.  When Russia resigned from the Soviet Union, the local central banks in places like Kiev decided to start dishing out liquidity to all the new banks that were created there by politicians' chums.  There was a massive creation of reserve money by these new central banks in places like Ukraine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1436967000,"counter":1458,"content":"<p>It was still the rouble.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#F00600","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436967000,"counter":1459,"content":"<p>Yes, the stuff was still regarded as roubles and was used to purchase real goods and services in Russia in exchange for these claims against the central bank money that had been created in Kiev and Belarus, etc.  Needless to say, the Russians got tired of this after a while and said \"that's all over\".  Of course, people got very fond of creating money, as they do.  The region in question ended up with huge hyperinflation.  Brand new currencies had to be established, and were established, in Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and so on.  The whole thing was chaotic.  It was a very costly way to break up a currency union.<\/p> <p>  The circumstances were worse in Yugoslavia because there was a war, which is a really bad way to break up a currency union.  Somewhere I have a 5 billion dinar note that was presented to me with great ceremony by fellows in the central bank in Zagreb.  I might have lost it.  It is worth about sixpence.  There was phenomenal hyperinflation in the region.  There are currency unions that have broken up.  If there is some kind of cataclysmic event that breaks up the eurozone - it would really have to involve Italy or France going bust, rather than expendable places like Portugal - I hope and presume it will be managed.  I think the reason Mr. Tsipras ultimately threw in his hand relates to a problem encountered by individual member states in the system.<\/p><p>I am sure he was advised he did not have any cards.  It is very difficult to create a new currency in competition with an old one that is already in circulation and very credible.  If Texas decided to go independent, it would be up against it in trying to introduce a new currency in competition with the dollar.  It would be a different story if one were to try to introduce a new currency in Croatia in competition with a currency that has 5 billion printed on a note which is the price of a newspaper.  The authorities in Greece would probably not have succeeded in getting their people to hold a new currency.  In all the states around the Balkans that have currencies, the balance sheets of the banking systems are mostly in euros.  That is true is Croatia and in Serbia.  Serbia has a currency called the dinar and Croatia has a currency called the kuna.  Croatians use the kuna for buying newspapers and cigarettes but the currency that is held in banking matters is the euro.  It is similar to a common feature in Latin American, which is called dollarisation where transactions in the economy are largely dealt with in a foreign currency.  <\/p><p> What can countries do that are worried that something like this might happen?  A country can either try and introduce a currency of its own in adverse circumstances, which would be incredibly difficult for a country like Greece - it could use it as IOUs for paying wages but that would be about it - or a country could see if there is an alternative foreign currency it might use, at least temporarily, whose central bank might be more accommodating than the one in Frankfurt.  This country has options in that regard that Greece does not have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436967000,"counter":1461,"content":"<p>Mr. Colm McCarthy and Professor Frank Barry are welcome to the committee and I thank them for coming in.  I listened with interest to the witnesses discuss the reasons bailouts should work, which is to return distressed countries to creditworthiness in order that they can enter private markets, and I agree with them on that.  It is a simple analysis.  Professor Frank Barry said that economists are a forward-looking people, and I agree with him on that, but so are business people.  I come from the world of business, and I am viewing this in a simplistic way as he has profiled it.  I disagree with his analysis of reprofiling debt and pushing it out many years into the future.  The debt is still there as a percentage of GDP and people lending money are not silly.  They carry out due diligence and realise what is at play.  If one pushes debt out a long period into the future, it means one has not crystallised the loss.  One may crystallise it when it can be afforded but it has not been crystallised immediately.  In essence, that allows a country or business that is in debt to have a cashflow, which is what keeps everything afloat.  Reference is often made as to who the wealthiest person in Dublin is today, and it is the person who has the handle on the most liquid cash.  It is not the person who has the most assets because a person may not be able to dispose of them.<\/p><p>What do the witnesses consider is the value of honest engagement?  People in business trade a great deal with people they trust.  So much can be put down on paper but from the financial meltdown we have had, and we have had more experience of it than most, I have noted that it is the people one trusted and worked with who are the ones that have brought us through it .  Any new customers we were getting in that distressed period were coming from a distressed situation and one was very cautious to move in because one could be exposing oneself when one did not need more exposure.  With Greece, it comes down to what is its honest engagement here and what is the general compliance.  We are all meant to be a European community working together.  We cannot say it is terrible and this is a case of the large countries versus the smaller countries when we expect everyone to engage honestly.<\/p><p>I read Mr. Colm McCarthy's article in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal <\/i>last week in which he said something which he mentioned briefly in his presentation, and he can correct me if I am wrong, that the money that has already been lent is lost.  If we were to agree with him that this money is gone, would we not be not daft if we did not ensure the taxpayers' money that is going to this new &euro;80 billion plus bailout is secure?  I cannot stand over money going into a black pit again.  The mistakes of the past have been made but we cannot endorse new mistakes.  There is a simple concept in business: one borrows money, one makes decisions and if one makes bad decisions, one suffers.  However, the minute one runs out of cashflow or out money that has been agreed with one's lending institutions, one has lost control of one's business.  Until one figures out a way to get that cashflow back, one has lost control.  Essentially, Greece has done that; it has lost control.  It finds itself in a desperate position and it needs to work extra hard to ensure it gets itself quickly back to a position where it can borrow again.<\/p><p>As Professor Frank Barry said, the euro was a political venture.  Europeans have embraced the euro.  He and I will have met many people who would say it is great that we can buy items in other countries where we know the cost and the exchange rate.  I have bought many machines and other items I needed for business in the eurozone and the transactions were transparent in terms of currency.  I remember when two of us travelled to France in the early 1990s and when we exchanged &pound;50 or &pound;60 in traveller's cheques, we got different amounts in the local currency.  It was a joke and we were being ripped off left, right and centre.  We should not forget the bad days.  The reason politicians sought to introduce a common currency was that there was a demand for it, and I believe it is worth fighting for despite all its frailties.<\/p><p>There were many reasons for the foundation of the European Union but there were two main ones, one of which was security in Europe because there had been two major wars within a number of years and Europe was decimated.  Thankfully, we have had reasonable security even though it could be argued that there are many threats on the outskirts.  The second main reason for its foundation was food security.  The Union has delivered on that, much to the detriment of many farmers.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I am also engaged in farming and we have seen that the prices paid to farmers for products is the same as the prices they were paid 20 years ago.  However, the EU has kept the food in the consumer's shopping trolley at an affordable price and it has also ensured the food is traceable, which is important.  The European Union has introduced many positive measures.  It guaranteed equal pay for women and it introduced many other good measures that would not be in place without it.  I dislike the spinning of this discussion into one of larger states versus smaller states.  That angle should be kept out of this discussion.  It is not fair.  This is about taxpayer's money and Mr. Colm McCarthy might address that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#G00200","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436967000,"counter":1462,"content":"<p>If the Deputy was upset about what I wrote in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal <\/i>last week----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1436967000,"counter":1463,"content":"<p>I am not but I just want to avoid that happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#G00400","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436967000,"counter":1464,"content":"<p>-----he will have great fun tomorrow morning.  The Deputy was right to raise the question about trust between member states.  It is a type of confederal arrangement of 28 states, 19 of which are in the eurozone.  Clearly, the sight of people on the Greek side running around accusing one another of blackmail and terrorism was not great.  On the other hand, some senior European politicians, including Jean-Claude Juncker, announced a few weeks ago that all those guys who were complaining about the design flaws in the eurozone were an Anglo-Saxon conspiracy.  There has been a great deal of loose talk on both sides.<\/p> <p>  To return to my earlier point, countries get into trouble because they are not being run very well.  To go along to a financially distressed country and start complaining that it is not run as well as Denmark is silly.  By definition, it is not very well run.  Otherwise we would not be there.  I have some familiarity with Greece.  It does not have the breadth of a modern economy we have, nor does it have the public administration we have.  The Greeks have intense problems with low level corruption, which is very common throughout the Balkans.  It is the same in Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia, which are in the EU, and in several other countries such as Macedonia, Albania and so on.  We get bothered because there are very occasional scandals here involving corruption in planning, fiddling around with zonings and all that.  That is in the ha'penny place by comparison with what people take for granted in south-eastern Europe.<\/p><p>People do not have to pay speeding fines; they just slip $10 to the police officer.  If one tried it here, one would be arrested.  They do not pay taxes, but bribe tax officials.  They do not pay customs duties, but do deals with the customs officers.  One can buy examination results in universities and pay for better grades.  One of the scandals in Greece is the waiting lists for the medical system.  People can move up the waiting lists by bribing officials in the public hospitals.  I am not denying that problems exist in Greece or that successive Greek Governments have been slow to address them.  However, Greece is in a mess, and the purpose of a financial rescue programme, which should have been the case in 2010, is to fix it, not to kick it down the tracks.<\/p><p> In 2010, a large amount of money was loaned to Greece which it used to pay off the foolish lenders to previous Greek Governments who should have taken a hit upfront, not as a moral measure but as a practical one.  This is how business people deal with financial no-hope cases.  For example, if they are not getting their money back, they will take 50 cents in the dollar and move on.  It is not business-like to pretend anything different.  If one has loaned money to someone who is not going to repay it, one has lost the money.  It is gone.  One can put it into one's books today or in ten years' time.  The act of putting it into the books is not the source of the loss.  The source of the loss was the lending decision.  Much of the extend-and-pretend that is happening is due to the fact that European governments do not want to tell their taxpayers they loaned their money to Greece, that it was a mistake and they should not have done it.<\/p><p> There is some spin going around that the Greeks have not bothered their barney over recent years making any effort to rectify their situation.  It is not true.  Speaking from memory, while the Greek budget deficit in 2010 was 15% of GDP, last year it was 3%.  In circumstances in which the economy was collapsing, they knocked ten points off the deficit by increasing taxes and cutting public spending.  The idea that the Greeks responded to the 2010 deal by lying on the beach drinking ouzo is incorrect.  There have been shocking caricatures in the Greek newspapers of Germans as Nazis, and in the German newspapers of the Greeks as layabouts.  I have no sympathy with either characterisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436967000,"counter":1466,"content":"<p>In some of Deputy Barry's remarks he seems to conflate the EU with the eurozone.  I am very supportive of the advantages Ireland has derived from being part of the EU, which has been spectacularly crucial to our prosperity.  However, the eurozone is a different matter.  It is a component of the EU.  The benefits to which Deputy Barry referred have derived from our membership of the EU.  There is no element of euroscepticism in what I am saying, given that I have been referring specifically to the eurozone.  However, Deputy Barry is correct to make the point that there have been benefits to our adoption of the euro as well as costs, for example, the transaction cost benefits.  It is wonderful to fly abroad and use one's own currency.  Against that, we must weigh the costs, which we are pointing to.  In Deputy Barry's comments he appears to downplay one of the costs, namely, the political tensions raised, particularly during recent months, by the negotiations essentially between the Germans and the Greeks, although other countries have been involved.<\/p> <p>  Although I do not read the British newspapers very frequently, I have been devouring them during recent weeks to see how it is playing out there.  The British newspapers from right to left have all been supportive of the Greeks and hostile to the German position, which is of interest because it may have an impact on the outcome of the forthcoming referendum in Britain.  If Britain withdraws from the EU, it would be very detrimental to us.  If the eurozone collapses and Greece is forced out of it, it may also force Greece out of the EU.  Mr. McCarthy has spoken about the break-up of previous currency unions that have had a detrimental impact on trade.  Countries exporting to Greece will not be happy to take these new IOUs or whatever new currency is developed there.  When Argentina defaulted, Argentine ships were seized around the world.<\/p> <p>  The great benefit to Ireland of being in the EU, aside from the agriculture sector which I will not talk about, has been that it has allowed us to act as a magnet for foreign direct investment in a way that would not have been possible otherwise.  If trade relations in Europe break down as an outcome of the messy disentangling of the eurozone, it would be catastrophic for us.  I am not a eurosceptic in that regard.  It is beneficial to keep those issues separate from each other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Frank Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1436967000,"counter":1467,"content":"<p>I thank both contributors, who have described very accurately what we are facing and the folly of the line the Eurogroup has taken in dealing with the Greek crisis.  Although Mr. McCarthy said we were different from the politicians, he suggested that for political reasons we must be careful about the use of strong language on either side and that loose language had been used.  I suggest it is time for blunt language.  Mr. Varoufakis said that when he made economic arguments, of the sort Mr. McCarthy has just put, in a measured way to the Eurogroup, he might as well have been singing the Swedish national anthem, and just got blank stares.  They were not interested in the measured, objective economic arguments such as Mr. McCarthy has just reproduced, almost word for word, from the interview with Mr. Varoufakis published in the <i>New Statesman<\/i>.  Almost any economist, left or right, looking at this is saying the same, that the judgments and policies made by the Eurogroup, headed by Mr. Sch&auml;uble, had nothing to do with sound economic management and was purely about politics.  If it is not about sound economic judgment, we must ask what is it and what is motivating it.  I would be interested in hearing Mr. McCarthy's opinion.  We must be honest.  If it is not about sound economic judgment, which it clearly is not, and it is about shoving something unsustainable from every point of view down the throats of the Greeks, we must speculate about the real motive.  It is not about hyperbole.  We must be honest.  Greece was subjected to economic terrorism and political bullying for purely political reasons and our Government went along with it for purely political reasons.  Mr. Varoufakis said the Irish, Spanish and Portuguese Governments were, to his surprise and disappointment, among the most energetic enemies of the Greeks during the negotiations because they were afraid of the political embarrassment that would result if they sided with the Greek Government in saying there had to be debt write-down and a lifting of the austerity.  Was he not right?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#H00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436967000,"counter":1468,"content":"<p>Yes.

In other words, he objected to the 2010 deal along the lines outlined by me, Professor Barry and numerous other people, including those on all sides of the political spectrum.  Whether the deal was more offensive to socialists or capitalists, it is hard to tell.  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to Mr. Varoufakis's interview in the <i>New Statesman<\/i>during the week, which was very interesting.

The process of dealing with the Greek crisis has been incredibly politicised.  I suspect Mr. McCarthy might agree that in many ways it would have been better if the European institutions were not involved with this and if it was actually just determined by the IMF.  The IMF is well used to making these decisions.  It advocated in 2010 that a Greek haircut should be imposed.  We know what the IMF advocated here at the time of our bailout.  The whole process and the participation of the European institutions has made the whole thing messier.  The IMF might well be able to go in now and state it will impose a haircut on Greece's creditors but this would not necessarily be extended to Ireland.  This is how the IMF might well resolve the political difficulties faced by the Irish Government and other governments in feeling unable to adhere to this type of outcome.  We all understand the constellation of political factors in Ireland which caused the Irish Government to take the decisions it has.

Another view states the IMF should have kept out of it altogether and let the Europeans sort out their own mess.  This is an increasingly popular view, needless to say, in China, India, Brazil and other countries which are now exposed.  The critical point is that the no bailout clause means haircuts.  The logical corollary of stating there will be no bailouts is that France or Germany will not pay for Belgium or Greece if it goes bust.  We do not have a united states of Europe.  This is not Texas and we do not willingly transfer tax revenues across international boundaries except in a very small way.  The no bailout clause in the original design of the eurozone made sense.  There was no banking union, which did not make sense, but the no bailout clause did make sense provided everybody understood what it implied.  What is implied was that if one lent money to the Greek Government, the Greek banks or anybody else, one would get a haircut the minute they got into trouble.

We now have this.  What other flaws do the witnesses see that can be rectified?  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked a fair question: name any school of economics that believes that debt sustainability is the outcome in Greece.  It is difficult to find any school of economics or credible economist who thinks that.  The reason behind what Mr. Varoufakis alleges in his piece with regard to Spain, Portugal, Ireland, etc., is that those countries made a pragmatic assessment of what was feasible and cut their cloth to measure.  The write-down was not going to happen in these discussions at the weekend.  If that meant \"Grexit\", that meant \"Grexit\" as far as the German mindset was concerned.<\/p> <p>  Here we have this noble project that has achieved so much, but the practical politics of it at the moment is that, whether it is in the Bundestag or in the ECB, the German mindset is dominant.  We politicians can rail against it all we like and economists can point out what the witnesses have pointed out here today, but what was likely to come out of last weekend's summit that would have addressed this situation in a way that was likely to lead Greece back to market access?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#K00400","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436967000,"counter":1490,"content":"<p>I have nothing to say on that, because that really is a question for the politicians.

Banking union is critical.  The critical flaw in the original design of the eurozone was the absence of banking union and that remains.  Some people are writing about banking union in the past tense as if it was done and dusted.  Until there is a Europe-wide system of bank resolution, probably some system of insurance for bank liabilities and a non-discretionary universally available lender of last resort function for the central bank, then we do not have a meaningful banking union and we do not have those things.<\/p> <p>  It is extraordinary that people can talk about banking union in the past tense as if it had already been achieved.  We witnessed in recent weeks that the gunboat that was sent down the Aegean was not one that floats.  It was the closure of the banks by the European Central Bank which decided not to act as a lender of last resort to the Greek banking system.  That was the design flaw that really mattered.<\/p> <p>  A definition of a monetary union should be one in which the address of the headquarters of the bank does not matter and has no consequences for the solvency of that bank.  I will give an example.  In the United States, Delaware specialises in company secretarial business.  Many people there do company registrations and all that.  People think there are tax deals in Delaware that are better.  That is not really true.  However, many US corporations are headquartered in Delaware, including many banks.  I believe that Lehman Brothers was headquartered in Delaware.  Somebody noted that if Delaware had been a member of the eurozone rather than of the United States of America, when all these banks went bust the Governor of Delaware would have been asked to bail them out using the tax revenue of Delaware to do so.  However, he was not asked to do so because the United States is a monetary union, there is no question about it.<\/p> <p>  The United States also has a no-bailout clause, which has applied to several cities in the US.  Detroit went bust recently.  The people who bought Detroit bonds are getting 50 cents on the dollar.  That is after the substantial fiscal transfers built into the US system, so the US has a banking union and Europe still does not.  That remains the big design flaw.  It is the resolution of bust banks that is critical in all this.<\/p> <p>  Banks go bust in the United States every week.  Every Friday officials from the Federal Reserve arrive to a bank and fire all the management, and the bank opens on Monday with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation taking care of the depositors.  That is not how it worked in Greece because we do not really have a monetary union, just a common currency area.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked the important question of what might have been done last weekend.  What might have been done last weekend could have been done in 2010, namely to show the Greek political system some - even distant - sight of the winning post.  One has to show the horse that there are just two furlongs to go and one might get there.  That is why debt has to be written down.  It is also why we need to avoid frontloading the austerity too much.  It is not possible to wave a magic wand and say that there is no need to balance the budget ever.  That is silly.  However, one must be very careful about the phasing and timing of the fiscal consolidation measures, something that the IMF, in fairness to it, was always careful about in the programme here, as I am sure the Deputy is aware.  However, sadly those things were not done and I am fearful that we will end up with another botched deal for Greece.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436967000,"counter":1492,"content":"<p>The reason I kicked to touch, as Mr. McCarthy has in essence done, is that the Deputy would no doubt say that was politically not a feasible solution to expect out of the weekend.<\/p><p>That is the &euro;64 billion question, a figure with which we are familiar in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Frank Barry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436967000,"counter":1494,"content":"<p>Is that all?

The corollary of that is countries get out of trouble because they are run very well.  I am sorry Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett is not present to hear that comment.  From a politically partisan perspective, much has to be said about the way this country has been run since we entered into a bailout programme and managed to exit it successfully.<\/p> <p>  The point was made that Ireland was the second bailout experiment, the first being Greece.  The difference was that when it came to our turn, we had an adequate amount of financial support.  The IMF had similar concerns and was not happy with the percentage point on our debt but we managed to use the European financial stability facility, EFSF, money to lower the interest rate, did a deal on the promissory notes and so on.  In effect, we reprofiled our debt.  Ordinary people recognise that when one takes out a mortgage on a house, one is reprofiling one&rsquo;s debt, banking on the mortgage going down over time as one&rsquo;s income improves, a reasonable level of inflation which will improve the value of one&rsquo;s income over the long term and the value of that asset increasing over time.  I do not see anything particularly wrong with the idea of reprofiling debt, assuming - I do not want to sound like Margaret Thatcher - a country behaves a bit like a household.

There was light at the end of the tunnel.<\/p><p>There has been a lot of talk about Germany&rsquo;s role in this.  At a conference I attended recently in Europe, I noted it was other small European countries which were unhappy about bailing out the Greeks, like the Baltic states.  A commentator from Latvia said the <i>per capita<\/i>income there was half that of Greece.  The owners of Greek debt now are other European countries.

Mr. McCarthy made the point in an interview on why the ECB pulled liquidity out of the Greek banks.  My proposition is that &euro;2 billion was taken out of Greek banks in a short period.  This was a run on the euro without the Greek Central Bank imposing, or indicating it was even willing to impose any capital controls.

It looked as if the budget deficit, as conventionally measured, was down to about 3% of GDP.  The non-interest deficit was heading down towards zero or even a small primary surplus this year.  However, there was a lot of political uncertainty in the last months of the Antonis Samaras government last year.  Syriza then won the election.  The election of alternative political parties that might be inexperienced and radical is what economists call endogenous.  If one squeezes a country for five years with no-hope programmes, then one cannot predict who will win an election.

This business of believing that the losses are caused by the decision to recognise them is the source of many of the current difficulties.  People lent money to the Greek Government as part of the official lending programmes and much of this money was used to pay off other creditors, which is the way these things go.  At the end of the process, there was a very sharp contraction in the Greek economy and it is probably contracting again.  Greek debt is retailing at interest rates of nearly 12.5% on the secondary market and the country cannot repay the money, which means the debt is not sustainable, as the International Monetary Fund concluded.  This means that when the Prime Minister of Slovakia states his country does not want to give any more money to Greece he is misunderstanding the point.  He or his predecessors decided some years ago in effect to buy Greek Government bonds, although they were not in that form but that is what it amounts to.

Needless to say, there are major structural differences between the two economies, the most crucial of which is the export orientation of the Irish economy.  As Mr. McCarthy indicated, we are highly dependent on sterling and the dollar.  The decline in the value of the euro has been very beneficial to us.  We have also been incredibly lucky in terms of the export sectors in which the economy is concentrated.  This is not a matter of pure luck, however, as it is also the result of Government policy and the policies pursued by public agencies over decades.  Our goods exports are concentrated in pharmaceuticals.  Indigenous industry exports are concentrated in food and agriculture and services exports are concentrated in computer and information technology services.  It has been very beneficial to have an economy that is concentrated in all of these sectors.<\/p> <p>  Let us take pharmaceuticals as an example.  As a sector, pharmaceuticals have increased as a share of overall eurozone, British and US imports.  It has been extremely beneficial to us to have been in these sectors.  Greece has such a different structure from Ireland that imposing austerity in Ireland has been necessary, one would say, because if we run out of money we have no option but to impose austerity.  This has not been sufficient to explain the recovery, however.  One cannot say that imposing equivalent austerity in Greece will have the same result because Ireland and Greece have completely different types of economy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Frank Barry"},{"type":"speech","time":1436967000,"counter":1506,"content":"<p>I do not doubt that.

Last year, only seven - the figure may be even lower at this point - of 129 European banks failed stress tests and we established a bank resolution mechanism which will be backfilled with funds to protect the banking system.

That would have a very bad effect.<br\/><br\/>On the Senator's question about the completion of banking union, there are three components of a proper banking union.  The first is centralised supervision of the banks, the second is centralised <i>ex ante<\/i>rules for the resolution of failed banks and the third is liability insurance for banks, in particular, for small retail deposits.  All that has been achieved in Europe is the first of these components, namely, centralised supervision of, I believe, 123 listed banks.  The European Banking Authority, which is an offshoot of the European Central Bank, did an asset quality review of these banks last year and this review was followed by stress tests and so forth.  The Senator is correct that nearly all the banks passed the stress tests, including the Greek banks.  What we have seen in recent weeks in this so-called banking union is the ECB refusing to act as lender of last resort in the face of a deposit run, thereby closing down four banks that it supervised and to which it gave a clean bill of health last year.  These banks recapitalised themselves to the tune of &euro;8.5 billion last year.<br\/><br\/>While it is very hard to make me feel sympathy for banks, I have sympathy for the four Greek banks because the lender of last resort ran away when it saw a deposit run against them.  Central banks were invented in numerous countries in the last century and even later in the United States - I mean the 19th century.  I apologise for repeatedly referring to the 19th century as the last century despite having 15 years to get used to the change.  The reason for the creation of central banks was largely to create a public good, namely, the ability to stop depositor runs against banks that were solvent.  The actions of the European Central Bank in recent weeks will feature in the textbooks in the years ahead because the ECB helped to accelerate a run against banks which it had deemed to be solvent and had supervised.  It did so by pulling its liquidity support on 28 June last in what was an extraordinary sequence of events. <br\/><br\/>As for bank resolution, one of the reasons the Greek banks were not deemed to have been insolvent was that to have deemed them insolvent would have triggered their recapitalisation by the European Stability Mechanism and no one wanted to do that.  Members will recall the famous proposal for retrospective recapitalisation of the Irish banks which was declined and did not take place.  Klaus Regling and others stated this could not be done because the European Stability Mechanism was to fund future bank insolvencies and would not be used for retrospective recapitalisation.  If it is now believed that the Greek banks are bust, ESM recapitalisation, if it effective, should be triggered because the present is what was then the future.<br\/><br\/>It is simply not the case that a banking union has been agreed to, the reason being that several member states do not want a banking union.  What has been undertaken is centralised supervision.  Supervision has never prevented bank busts, however.  For example, there were big bank busts recently in the United Kingdom, which has had national bank supervision in place for a couple of hundred years and still does not seem to have got the hang of it.  There will always be bank busts because banks are fragile institutions.  Centralised supervision is an improvement, particularly in countries which are bad at doing supervision, as Ireland was, but it is nuts to believe that supervision will prevent future bank busts.<\/p><p>What would prevent them from creating mayhem is a properly funded bank resolution system and a properly funded deposit insurance system for retail customers of banks who have been queueing outside banks in Greece for the past six months.  We do not have those things.  They have not moved to a banking union; they have made some steps in that direction, but it is not complete.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436967000,"counter":1511,"content":"<p>Mr. McCarthy has made some interesting comments.  Does he accept that the Irish bailout programme has worked for any number of reasons and not because of austerity?  <\/p> <p>  I refer to Mr. McCarthy's interesting point about Greece.  He has said that when people see no light at the end of the tunnel, they will eventually vote for a more radical solution.  We are talking about the politics of the crisis.  He makes the point that the Greek people had lost confidence in their own institutions as much as anything else and that Syriza was, in effect, the plan B about which Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett talked.  They were looking for a more radical solution, which seems to have failed miserably, in so far as they are concerned.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McCarthy has referred to our interest payments and profiling the money we borrowed.  We seem to fail to explain that most of the money we have borrowed - a 120% debt-to-GDP ratio - was borrowed to maintain public services; it was not borrowed to manage the banks and it was not a bank bailout.  Profiling means repayments are pushed to be made in the future when it will almost not matter and the repayments are to cover the interest, which is the big one.  For example, we are paying 3.1% of GDP in interest payments.  If I remember correctly, at the beginning of the year Greece's repayments were something like 3.4% or 3.5% of GDP.  The profile of repayments being made by Greece was not far off ours and many of the measures it has taken such as reducing budget deficits are similar to what we did, yet the level of expenditure on pensions in Greece is still at 17.5% of GDP versus 12% in our case.  Considering the state of the Greek economy at the beginning of the year, it could have worked through it over a couple of years in the same way as we did, yet the Greek people chose a solution that has landed them in an incredible disaster zone.  Does responsibility lie with the Greek institutions or the Greece people?  There is an element of delinquency or a refusal to accept that they were living beyond their means.  I am only saying this because much of the conversation this afternoon has focused on the criticisms of the institutions in Europe and individual countries.  Like Senator Aideen Hayden, in travelling around Europe I have not noted huge sympathy for the Greeks because many countries have endured their own cutbacks and changes in how they manage their public services, just as we have.  The picture Mr. McCarthy paints, in which the Greeks have made huge sacrifices, has not been painted very well outside Greece.

However, instead of being put on the dole, many were included in the pensions system.  Therefore, the Greek pensions system provides for a lot of the income distribution which in other European countries is provided for by routine social expenditure.  These cross-national comparisons of public expenditure ratios are very treacherous, unless one knows the details of what each country does.<\/p> <p>  On the broader question, one must be clear on what was the objective in Ireland when the so-called bailout began at the end of 2010.  The Government was two years into a fiscal consolidation programme at the time.  That programme started in July 2008 before the bank bust.  The then Government made a series of expenditure reductions in the middle of the year.  There was an emergency budget in October 2008, another budget in the spring of 2009, followed by another in the autumn of that year.  During all this time the Government was able to borrow.  We were not driven out of the bond markets because our initial public debt was very low.  We also had a bunch of international equities held in the National Pensions Reserve Fund which was not a pension fund but rather a kind of hedge fund.  It included short bonds and long equities, which sounds like a hedge fund to me.  When push came to shove, these assets could be flogged, which we did and the markets knew that we could flog them.  The full extent of the losses in the banking system was not realised.  It came to be realised a little more through 2010.  Therefore, the objective position on the public finances was completely different.  <\/p> <p>  The Greeks were bust; in March or April 2010 the Greek public finances were shot, whereas ours were not.  When we eventually had to have a programme, it was in the context of another run on the banks here.  People will remember the famous radio interview given by the Governor of the Central Bank, which, it was believed, impelled the Government into a rescue package.  He was conscious that there was a run on the banks and that it would accelerate and he believed there was nothing else he could have done.  However, the circumstances were completely different.  As Professor Barry outlined, the negative impact, the deflationary impact of the tax increases and expenditure cuts on aggregate demand here, was much less than in Greece because of the openness of the economy and the broader export base.  We were also lucky that our big trading partners were Britain and the United States which were not doing great, but they were doing less badly than many continental European countries.  Therefore, we had a little luck, which is not to say our programme had been perfectly designed or executed.  The IMF will also stress that the Irish programme was owned by the Irish authorities, that the Irish authorities had embarked on a medium-term programme which involved austerity and cuts in spending and increases in taxes.  However, they embarked on it and had authored it.  The programme in Greece was imposed and there was little or no ownership of it there.<\/p> <p>  The IMF is very big on the question of ownership; if there has to be a difficult macro-economic adjustment, one must show people the exit and persuade them that it will only last for a few years, that everything necessary will be done, including hair cuts for creditors, that the people will have a reasonable chance of getting out inside three years and that those concerned can design the programme.  Both rules were broken in Greece.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1436967000,"counter":1515,"content":"<p>If the Greek interest payments were at the same percentage of GDP as ours-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#N00600","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436967000,"counter":1516,"content":"<p>Is the Chairman saying the Greek debt should, therefore, be sustainable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1436967000,"counter":1517,"content":"<p>At least it should be sustainable in the short term in order that they can work through-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#N00800","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436967000,"counter":1518,"content":"<p>If one believes that, one can buy Greek bonds at 50 cent to the dollar.

The United States is an example.  There are states in the union in which real incomes are half those in the better off states.  Italy was a monetary union using the lira until 1999, but real living standards in Lombardy were two and half or three times what they were in the south.  That is probably still true.

The amount transferred through the federal budget in the United States is less than is typically transferred in this part of the world.  If we had separate statistics for the various counties of Ireland, we would discover Dublin has a very large budget surplus and that most of the rural counties, especially in the west, have large deficits.  Technically, it is feasible to have a durable monetary union including geographical regions with very different levels of economic development.  Whether it is politically a good idea is another story.  There are examples in history.  The Soviet Union was an example, as was the rouble zone.  They can have high or low levels of transfers.  The technical problem with the design of the eurozone is that it is not a banking union.<\/p> <p>  Let me give the Deputy another graphic example.  The state of California nearly went bust three or four years ago.  It ended up paying people with bits of paper, IOUs, because the budget deficit of the state was enormous.  However, nobody started withdrawing bank deposits from bank branches in California because there was no link between the solvency of banks in the state and the public finances of the state.  In other words, the United States is a monetary union with full banking union.  What we have seen in Greece, again in the past few weeks, has illuminated some of the original design flaws in the eurozone.  People started hefting money out of Greek banks for fear of redenomination risk and what had happened in Cyprus where bank accounts had been frozen.  What is now happening in Greece is extraordinary.  People cannot pay bills to Greek people across the road.  It is not that they cannot transfer the money out of the country into dollars or to Switzerland, for example.  A businessman in Athens who owes money to a firm in Thessalon&iacute;ki cannot pay that firm even if he has the cash.  All of the newspapers have been on about pensioners trying to withdraw &euro;50 per day from the ATM.  The SME sector is typically cash positive in the banking system, contrary to what one would expect based on reading the newspapers.  The transactions balances are immobilised.  That does not suggest a monetary union.  It cannot happen in the United States; there would be no chance of it happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015071500002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1436967000,"counter":1525,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee, I thank Mr. McCarthy and Professor Barry for participating.

I believe that Ms Justice Ring will be an excellent chairperson of GSOC.  The Government is proposing Ms Ring to fill the vacancy of chairperson of the ombudsman commission arising from the resignation of the previous Chairman, Mr. Simon O&rsquo;Brien, at the end of January.  Mr. O'Brien resigned to take up an appointment as chief executive of the Pensions Ombudsman Service in the UK.  He had been appointed chairperson of GSOC with effect from 13 December 2011, together with Ms Carmel Foley and Mr. Kieran FitzGerald, as members for a period of five years.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission was set up under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, to provide a system for receiving complaints and dealing with allegations of misconduct by garda&iacute;.  The ombudsman is required to carry out its investigations in a manner that is efficient, effective and fair to all concerned and to promote public confidence in the process for resolving these complaints.  Independence is the cornerstone of GSOC&rsquo;s existence and is statutorily guaranteed.  Consequently, its investigators are given similar powers to those given to Garda members, including the power to arrest, detain and question.  In addition to investigating complaints against Garda members, GSOC may also initiate investigations in the public interest, including in situations where no complaints have been made.<\/p>  <p>  I recently laid the GSOC annual report for 2014 before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The year 2014 was a particularly challenging year for GSOC in which it was the subject of much political and media commentary and some controversy.  Notwithstanding these pressures, 2014 was also a busy year for GSOC.  The annual report states that GSOC received 11% more complaints in 2014 over 2013 and concluded 8% more cases in 2014, compared with 2013.  I have discussed on previous occasions with the Opposition spokespersons the question of the co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC.  I was particularly pleased to note that there was a marked improvement in efficiency, in dialogue and co-operation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This would suggest that the revised 2013 protocols between GSOC and the Garda Commissioner are working.  While there may be room for further improvements in the turnaround of investigations, I have every confidence that this is now a shared objective of both organisations.  The powers of GSOC have been reformed and further reforms are included in the Policing Authority Bill.  Section 65 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, provides that appointments to the ombudsman commission are made by the President on the nomination of the Government and the passage of resolutions by D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann recommending the appointments.  The section also states that a judge of the High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court, may be appointed as chairperson.  The section further provides that where a judge is appointed to this role, he or she will not be required to carry out his or her judicial functions while chairperson of the commission.<\/p>  <p>  The Government, at its meeting of 30 June, 2015, decided to nominate Judge Mary Ellen Ring to be chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission following her nomination for appointment to the High Court.  Ms Justice Ring was appointed a judge of the High Court by the President on Thursday, 9 July 2015.  Her swearing-in ceremony before the Supreme Court took place on Monday, 13 July 2015.  Ms Justice Ring has extensive experience as a practising barrister and as a judge of the Circuit Court which experience makes her very well qualified for the position of chairperson of the ombudsman commission.  She has also served in positions on the National Crime Council between 1999 and 2005 and as chair of the Irish Women Lawyers Association in 2008.  She has been a member of the Irish Penal Reform Trust and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  I reiterate that I believe she will make an excellent chairperson of GSOC and I have no hesitation in recommending her accordingly.  Ms Justice Ring will work alongside the other members of the commission, Ms Carmel Foley and Mr Kieran Fitzgerald.  I believe that the combination of the skills and experience of the three commissioners will provide the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission with strong and effective leadership. <\/p>  <p>  Society looks to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the guardians of the peace, to create and maintain an environment where people can go about their daily lives free from threats of criminality.  Where such criminality arises, we look to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate and bring the perpetrators to justice.  This is an onerous task and to carry it out, citizens give powers to the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which are in some cases extensive powers, to carry out those tasks, including powers of arrest and detention.  However, these powers, although used in challenging and often dangerous circumstances, must be exercised in a lawful and proportionate manner.  Where there is a question about whether members have used those powers properly, they must be held to account.  Therefore, it is vital that we fully address allegations of Garda misconduct or wrongdoing in the interest of maintaining public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in protecting the professional standing of the overwhelming majority of dedicated and conscientious members of the force.  It is equally important that the public need to have confidence in the system of oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is the fundamental challenge for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission which is a vital part of our policing infrastructure.  It must secure and maintain the trust and confidence of the public and of the force.  To do this it needs to be led by a team of skilled and competent commissioners.  I believe that Ms Justice Ring will bring the appropriate level of leadership and skill and, together with her fellow commissioners, will ensure that the ombudsman commission will carry out its work effectively.  On behalf of the Government I recommend Ms Justice Ring for appointment as chairperson of GSOC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015071500002#B00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1436965200,"counter":1532,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and her team to the meeting.

One of the issues I have been pursuing with both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC, is whether a mechanism could be developed - which both sides would like to see - but we have not come up with a mechanism yet.  Every complaint is serious but I have raised with the representative associations a proposal for a more informal resolution process of some of the less serious complaints.  I think it is recognised both nationally and internationally, that some complaints will turn into formal complaints that could be dealt with in a more procedural way at an earlier stage.  We do not have that process in place.  There has been some discussion with both sides as to how it might be developed.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na point of view is that it is very keen to preserve the integrity of the process and that members will not be asked to resolve something informally where there might be a question of the garda's behaviour.  They would not wish an informal process to cast doubt on the integrity of a garda or his or her behaviour.  GSOC is very keen to have this process as the commission believes it would be a much more efficient and effective way of managing complaints.  This remains under discussion.  In reply to Deputy McGrath, it is a good sign that the public is aware that GSOC exists.  <\/p>  <p>               Equally, there might be quite a number of complaints that would be capable of perhaps more informal resolution.

This visit had its beginnings in the visit Deputy David Stanton made to the project a number of weeks ago.  He was quite impressed by what he saw and especially by what he heard from the lads whom he met and who spoke freely to him.<\/p>  <p>  We work with ex-offenders, ex-prisoners and people on the edges of the criminal justice system.  The men who present to us were, at one stage, small boys who were hurt and had to manage very difficult situations in their home environments and communities.  The journey to where they are now was quite difficult.  When we speak about ex-prisoners and ex-offenders, we conjure up a mental picture of what somebody like that looks like, but, from our experience, that mental picture is not the whole truth.  They started out in their families and with parents just as we started out in ours and their parents had hopes and dreams for their children like we have for ours.  The men in question had links across many Departments and agencies from a very young age and even their mothers and fathers were clients of the Department of Social Protection.  They had an involvement with the HSE and the Department of Justice and Equality and, very early in their lives, were already on the edges of the education system.  In terms of social disadvantage, they are a targeted group.  A lot of transgenerational issues come into play in the lives of these men and we work in a very creative way to address some of these needs and issues.  A core part of our work is to cut across these difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  Addiction plays a big part in underpinning mid-range crime.  It is a lonely, isolated and vulnerable place, even though it is not always seen on the outside.  In the work we do we see the underbelly of addiction.  Recovery is very tough, often lonely and very challenging and all of the men in our project are either recovering from addiction or making steps towards recovery.  We, the footsoldiers on the ground, meet the raw reality of their lives.  We look into their eyes and see the results of the difficulties in their lives.  We are in direct contact with their struggle as they try to stay clean, sober up and stay out of trouble in order that they can manage themselves and their families.  Many of them are fathers.<\/p>  <p>  We work from a relationship model based on the Servol model piloted in the West Indies and brought to us through the congregations that are our trustees.  We do not try to tell these guys how to be or what to do but support them to be self-reflective and self-determining and seek their own answers.  We try to bring them into contact with their own goodness and potential.  In the future we hope to continue to be resourced to do more of this work in an holistic way.  One of the things we hope for from the meeting is that the committee will support new ways of working in this field.  We believe what we do works really well and that there is a lot of evidence to show this.  There is great potential for the model to be used in other areas because the difficulties we are meeting in Cork city are to be found in all communities across the country.  We have met various challenges along the way and if any member of the committee wishes to ask questions about how we have overcome and met these challenges, we would be more than willing to answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015071500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436965200,"counter":1565,"content":"<p>I will speak about social enterprise at Churchfield Community Trust and about the garden caf&eacute; which is widely regarded as Cork's greenest caf&eacute;.  It is situated on the grounds of Cork Foyer in Blackpool and located in a beautiful Victorian glasshouse which is open to the public Monday to Friday each week, 12 months a year, providing morning coffee, freshly baked scones and home baking.  An exciting lunch menu is on offer daily using the finest seasonal produce sourced from our community allotment and local producers.  It is important to note that this is a non-profit initiative.  The social enterprise came about because of a difficulty in sourcing work experience and employment opportunities when the economic downturn was at its peak.  Funding has been sourced from a number of organisations to which we are grateful, including the statutory and non-statutory funders which are shown on page 9 of the document.  A full detailed breakdown is given on page 10 and a further breakdown is available on request.<\/p>  <p>  At first glance, our caf&eacute; aspires to the highest standards of many other restaurants.  However, there is a wider picture which focuses on the promotion of social reintegration through formal and informal training in several contexts.  Participants receive experiential on-site training, while also receiving formal training in electronic point of sale training, food hygiene which is HACCP certified, food preparation, customer service and communication skills and basic bookkeeping skills.  Our staff team comprises a team leader who is employed through the JobsPlus initiative of the Department of Social Protection and two part-time staff members sourced from the local community.  We have one JobBridge intern who has completed her nine-month placement and one part-time jobs incentive scheme staff member working up to 23 hours per week.  A staff member who was formerly participating in a community employment initiative works on a casual basis and we have two community employment scheme special category substance misuse support placements.  We also have one community service placement who works the complete hours in co-operation with us and the Probation Service.<\/p>  <p>  The continued development of the garden caf&eacute; initiative is, in no small way, attributable to a partnership approach involving the Churchfield Community Trust, Cork City Council which provides the garden caf&eacute; glasshouse under a licence agreement, the Department of Social Protection initiatives, the Cork City Education and Training Board, local businesses which provide experiential training and other businesses which provide sponsorship for the new website we recently developed.  The continuing success of the initiative can be attributed to the unique community spirit and goodwill in Blackpool which is in the heart of Cork city.  It is essentially about bringing out the best in people and helping them to realise their true potential.<\/p>  <p>  I draw the committee's attention to our successful record in terms of progression to further training and employment, including the full-time employment of a team leader, a catering assistant who has now gained employment in a nursing home, a former trainee who is now training as a chef at Cork Institute of Technology and a catering assistant who is now completing a catering course at Cork College of Commerce.  <\/p>  <p>         We have facilitated temporary release from Loughan House of somebody who is interested in catering.  We also facilitate work placements on requests.<\/p> <p> I would also like to speak about new initiatives.  At our workshop which is based at Churchfield, a range of bespoke early-era furniture and garden products are currently being developed by our workshop manager and team.  The craftsmanship is of an extremely high standard.  We would also draw attention to the co-operation with local businesses, such as Akzo Nobel, where we received a contract for Bloom, which involved the assembly and painting in an assortment of colours of picnic tables and also the designing, construction and finishing of garden benches, which took place in June of this year.<\/p> <p> The committee may be interested to know the following about our outreach initiative.  Over a period of time, it became evident that there was an emerging need locally to give support to persons in the areas of substance misuse and offending behaviour.  This cohort could not access community employment or, indeed, our garden caf&eacute; initiative due to limited availability of places.  I would refer the committee to the briefing document which depicts a list of issues and challenges that need addressing for clients in our outreach category.  These include accommodation, addiction, mental health, methadone involvement, finance and debt, literacy, low self-esteem, difficult life experiences, unemployment and education deficits.<\/p> <p> This initiative includes the continuous development of a programme which includes horticulture, stonework and landscaping.  It also would include one-to-one key working.  This aspect of our service is not fully resourced and ongoing efforts are made to secure sustainable funding.<\/p> <p> Networking with external agencies is of vital importance.  I acknowledge the support of the HSE through the health action zone through suicide awareness training which would include SafeTALK, Cork Simon, Ables literacy support and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.<\/p> <p> As an organisation, we remain flexible to new Irish Prison Service sentence management approaches.  While engaging with persons in both pre-release and post-release contexts, through a relationship model Churchfield Community Trust facilitates a shift in attitudes, values and beliefs sustained by new social and economic opportunities.  Referral sources re potential outreach participants include self-referrals, the Probation Service, the Irish Association for the Social Integration of Offenders through Cork Prison, Portlaoise Prison and the Midlands Prison, IASIO, training and employment officer, the Cork Alliance Centre and addiction services.<\/p> <p> We respond to challenges which present through engaging with the person in a respectful way while empowering decision-making through collaborative practice.  This process is active, participatory, mutual, respectful and transparent.  This places the individual at the centre of the change process rather than programmes or procedures.<\/p> <p> Our outreach programme acts as a signposting service for other services, such as addiction services, Money Advice and Budgeting Service, counselling, addiction counselling, the training and employment office I mentioned previously, the alcohol and offending behaviour programme which will be piloted on 27 July, and literacy support in terms of filling out applications and general forms.<\/p> <p> In the five-year period between 2008 and 2014 Churchfield Community Trust worked with a total of 168 clients referred through the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service, IASIO and other agencies.  Some 2.49% of clients re-offended while engaging with Churchfield Community Trust.  In 2014, 66 persons engaged re support.  The breakdown here would include: 13 community employment places, 16 outreach placements, 19 brief interventions, four persons who did not engage, two community service persons who would have completed community service hours, one person who we redirected, one JobBridge intern who I mentioned previously and a part-time job incentive scheme person who I also mentioned previously.  I would also mention our nine garden caf&eacute; team.  The referral agency statistics for 2014-15 show we had 25 probation referrals, 16 IASIO referrals, seven self-referrals and nine other agency referrals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015071500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Donnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436965200,"counter":1567,"content":"<p>Deputy Ferris, who indicated first, will begin the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015071500002#F00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1436965200,"counter":1568,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses here today.

It would be good.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. O'Donnell mentioned the 12 issues that need addressing for clients in the outreach category.  It is important to put them on the record again as there are so many of them and they are all diverse.  The list is accommodation, addiction, mental health, methadone involvement, relationship issues, anger management, finance and debt, literacy, low self-esteem, difficult early life experiences, unemployment and education deficits.  In trying to get an idea of those 12 issues, would there be some more prevalent than others in participants of the programme?  Would any of those 12 issues with which they would present be more serious than the others or would they present with a bit of all of them?  To what extent do any of those issues impede persons going on the programme?  These are all serious difficulties and one, in itself, would be a problem.  If they are experiencing a lot of these issues, it must be really tough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015071500002#F00500","speaker":"1105"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436965200,"counter":1571,"content":"<p>It certainly is.  When one thinks about the early difficulties, there are a lot of developmental deficits, even between age nought and age 5, and in middle childhood and into the teens the educational deficits play a part.  If I was say what presents across the board, addiction is what brings them to the door.  In recent years, because of the polydrug use, there are associated mental health difficulties because the cocktails of chemicals cause various mental disturbances.  Therefore, mental health issues are very much to the fore as well.  <\/p>  <p>         It can be taken that there are some levels of literacy difficulties, especially with guys in their 30s.  The younger lads are benefiting from some of the early interventions that have been in place in the educational system in the past 15 years or so.  However, before that those interventions were not available so we come across lads in their 30s with numeracy and literacy difficulties.  The low self-esteem is par for the course.<\/p> <p> In recent times accommodation is becoming more of an issue.  Young men on their own are way down the priority for housing.  We sometimes get support from Cork Simon Community or perhaps from other supported living situations where, following treatment, sometimes there is a phase two treatment where they might get accommodation for three or four months.  The Simon Community has some independent houses - dry houses - and the lads can stay there for up to six months.<\/p> <p> Mr. O'Donnell might like to add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015071500002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436965200,"counter":1573,"content":"<p>Regarding unemployment, the garden caf&eacute; initiative provides stability for persons who have completed our programme.

We seek what we tend to call sympathetic employers, but they are very few and far between.  Our lads will always be at the end of the list in terms of qualifications and readiness for work.  They also have gaps in their careers.  It is hard for a person who has been inside for three or four years to account for that in a CV.<\/p>  <p>  As Mr. O'Donnell mentioned, we opened the garden caf&eacute; in response to the lack of opportunities in employment for our lads as they were leaving.  Especially during the downturn there was no hope of placements or getting work.  As we had to respond in some way, we created our own opportunities for employment.  We sometimes get together with other community employment schemes.  We might take a placement from another scheme and that service would take a placement from us.  Some placements are worked through networking and whom one knows.  However, getting jobs is difficult.  We have a few lads who are driving and delivering pizzas, but it is really difficult.  That is why we want to progress the social enterprise.<\/p>  <p>  We have a very good skill base.  We have an excellent workshop that was funded through the Probation Service.  We are making really good furniture and we have some good ideas about doing some work with the Department of Social Protection so that instead of a lad going back on the dole, with some seed capital and some conversations we might be able to set up a more work-orientated workshop where they could be employed and generate income.<\/p>  <p>  A core part of progression and integration into mainstream life is for these men to actually work.  Men need to work.  It brings an additional set of feel-good factors to be able to provide for one's family.  I am not saying it is not important for women too, but for the man in the house it is really important to have regained his ground in the house and be able to work.  It has a big impact on the children and the whole family.  We struggle equally with trying to find employment.<\/p>  <p>  As Mr. O'Donnell mentioned we would really like to see something happening with apprenticeships.  Coming from the lower levels of the academic system, many of these lads would have learnt woodwork and mechanical drawing.  In their own families they are good with their hands and they do not struggle as much in those sorts of settings.

At times, they are just out of treatment or have just completed a day programme and they are put back into prison.  It can often set them back for another year or more.  Sometimes the sentence needs to stand, but there might be some discernment in order that when they go into prison, they may have the option of being in a drug-free unit or a setting where their recovery could be supported in a more holistic way.  Unfortunately, some of the prisons cannot offer that option but it is worth exploring.

It was completely independent.  It was prior to us receiving funding from the Dormant Accounts Fund, before we built our workshop and the trustees purchased the house next door, and it was at a significant time in the development of the project.  The cost does not come to mind straight away, but I remember her saying to us that it might not be cheap, but it was certainly effective.  At the time, we only had space for six people.  <\/p>  <p>         We only had very small facilities.  Since then we have expanded threefold, despite the downturn and reductions in funding.<\/p> <p> What has kept us so focused is the model we are using, which underpins our success.  Deputy McFadden asked a little while ago about the Servol model.  Servol came from two words, \"serve\" and \"all\".  It was pioneered in the West Indies by the Presentation Brothers, I think.  There are three main components to the method.  The first is attentive listening.  Unless I truly listen to someone's experience, I cannot really respond.  The second is a philosophy of ignorance.  I do not know what it is like to put my head down in a prison cell or to be at the raw end of life, homeless, addicted and all that.  I am ignorant about those experiences.  The third is that I have to be really aware of my cultural arrogance.  As a professional, I can come into any disadvantaged area and put myself on higher ground by saying I know the answer to your problems.  It is such a subtle relationship and requires subtle judgement sometimes.  When we meet the lads, we see them as other human beings.  We do not judge them for what they have done.  They are so used to being judged, they have their antennae up and out like stalks.  They will know in a flash.  It is non-verbal and that is how a lot of stuff is communicated.  It is so important that we do not judge.<\/p> <p> There also has to be respectful intervention.  It is all about respect and acceptance, accepting where people are at and starting from there.  The Servol model underpins the work.  Even with the garden cafe, we could not run it like a commercial enterprise.  It is a beautiful place but we have to keep the clients in the centre of the picture all the time - their needs, their journey.  We are here to serve, and for us, it is a service to them rather than some sort of profit-making idea.  If there is ego involved, we are on the wrong page.  That might give a bigger understanding of the approach.  Sometimes it is difficult to stay loyal to one's approach because one can be led in other directions with certain funding criteria and other influences.  We have tried to stay loyal to the model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015071500002#H01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436965200,"counter":1596,"content":"<p>Thank you.

Once we had the respect of the community, we got massive support from families and extended families.<\/p>  <p>  Going back to the addiction issue, the witnesses' report says the common denominator to all mid-range crime by 18 to 30 year olds is addiction.

I thank our guests for their patience.<\/p><p>The items for today is No. P00072\/2012 from Dr. Edward Horgan and others relating to the landings at Shannon Airport and a discussion of Ireland's neutrality and the difference between Irish neutrality and political neutrality.  I ask people to be careful with their mobile phones as they interfere with the reception here and broadcasting.  It is frustrating for people watching.  <\/p><p>We are pleased to welcome Dr. Karen Devine, lecturer in international relations at the school of law and government at Dublin City University.  Following a Fulbright scholarship at Columbia University in New York from 2012 to 2013, Dr. Devine's current research is a book on the impact of patriotism on public attitudes to foreign policy in the US and Ireland.  We also welcome Mr. Paddy Smyth, foreign policy editor at <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  Mr. Smyth is the former foreign correspondent at the newspaper, having served as both Washington and European correspondent.  Since his return from the US in 2002, he has been opinion editor and foreign policy editor.  He is currently working as a leader writer in the editor's office and co-ordinates the newspaper's Century project - the coverage of the 1912-1922 decade of centenaries.<\/p><p>The invitation to address the committee arose as a result of ongoing investigations by the committee relating to No. P00072\/2012 regarding US military and CIA use of Shannon Airport and Irish airspace.  The petitioner is Dr. Edward Horgan.  I welcome the witnesses and thank them for forwarding their presentations. <\/p><p>I will now read the standard information regarding parliamentary privilege.  We will then have a scene-setter, setting the context for the witnesses' contributions.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>We will talk about some of the work we have done to set the scene.  The witnesses will probably be familiar with it but I will provide it for people viewing today and to have it on the record.  I will recap our work to date on this petition for members and the witnesses.  We have had public hearings with the petitioner and completed a visit to Shannon Airport where a delegation met the Shannon Group, which was formerly the Shannon Airport Authority.  We met Ms Rose Hynes, chairman; Mr. Neil Pakey, CEO; Mr. Niall Maloney, head of operations; and Ms Mary Considine, company secretary at the Shannon Group.  The delegation met members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including Chief Superintendent John Kerin, Superintendent Derek Smart and Inspector Tom Kennedy.  Finally, the delegation met with the petitioner, Dr. Edward Horgan, in Shannon Airport.  <\/p><p>During the visit to Shannon Airport, members were advised that there are three types of landings.  They are civilian charter flights with transport military personnel who may have personal weapons or side arms which are maintained on board under lock and require prior approval from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The second type is military aircraft which require a diplomatic note commonly referred to as a dip note.  It is standard on the dip note that such aircraft do not carry any weapons or ordnance.  The third type is other military aircraft where a sovereign state seeks permission to land or over fly Irish airspace where the aircraft is transport for a head of state visiting Ireland or stopping <i>en route<\/i>to another destination.  Granting the right to land or over fly Irish airspace is vested in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The procedure is that the relevant authorities of a sovereign state apply to the relevant Irish authority, which is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, for permission to land or over fly.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has no role in the granting of the dip note.  This is under the sole authority of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The dip notes do not allow weapons on board the aircraft and aircraft with dip notes have the same status as an embassy.  It was a very useful series of clarifications around the respective roles of the persons we met.  <\/p><p>As a follow-up to the visit to Shannon Airport and to gain a greater understanding of the dip note or prior approval system, members invited Mr. Niall Burgess, Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport; and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to address the committee.  These public hearings were important in giving a focus to what members consider to be a key issue, namely, what is Irish neutrality.<\/p><p>Today's hearing is the final one in the series.  When it is completed, we will conclude our deliberations.  The witnesses' contributions are very important in terms of their perspectives on neutrality.  I have read some of their perspectives delivered in the past.  Former Senator Maurice Hayes wrote the foreword to the conference papers presented at a conference on 8 and 9 May 2009 entitled &quot;Neutrality: Irish Experience, European Experience&quot; organised by the Irish School of Ecumenics and the Dublin Monthly Meeting Quakers Peace Committee and edited by Iain Atack and Se&aacute;n McCrum.  I was not present at the conference but I have read the transcripts.  It was a really excellent and though-provoking series of engagements.  Dr. Devine and Mr. Smyth were present at the conference and would have presented to it.  The next issue is important in setting the scene for our discussion.<\/p><p>In his foreword, Maurice Hayes stated:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>Neutrality has for so long been a given in Irish foreign policy and has taken such a firm hold on the Irish imagination that it has come to be regarded almost as a constitutional imperative - which is far from the case.  The Constitution merely reserves the right to wage war to the government of the day with the approval of the D&aacute;il, and this has been further restricted by the requirement of Oireachtas consent and Security Council approval &ndash; the famous &quot;triple lock&quot; of the Nice Treaty endorsement.  <br \/><br \/>How and why such a policy developed is lost in the mists of time &ndash; linked as it has been at various times to an anxiety not to get involved in World War II, to partition, to a preference for peace-keeping and conflict resolution, and at others to reservations about a European Common Security and Defence Policy.<br \/><br \/>The question arises therefore whether neutrality, as professed and practised, is pragmatism masquerading as moral principle, ideology which is not fully explained, or a well-thought-out ethical position which has not yet found the language and methodology for practical application.<br \/><br \/>There does, it seems, need to be a serious attempt to define neutrality, to spell out what it means in modern circumstances, especially since other traditionally neutral countries in Europe seem to be changing their stances in response to changed realities and relationships and new perceptions of threat and national interest. The changes in global political alignments too, where old enemies become, if not friends, at least partners in a new struggle against emerging common threats, make it all more difficult, and a less than Manichean differentiation of good and evil raises the question of which side, if any, we should be on.<br \/><br \/>There must be a question too whether real neutrality implies a capacity for self-defence, and whether there is any half-way house between neutrality in this sense and having no defence at all; whether neutrality is a negative concept, or whether a more positive formulation can be found within the structures of international treaties by which the Irish polity has bound itself.<br \/><br \/>There are, indeed, two views of the status of the neutral state: that of the state declaring its neutrality (which has little relevance except in time of war) and that of other states who may be potentially belligerent. These perspectives may not necessarily be the same, and it is hard to see what guarantees can be assumed by a small and isolated state which is not part of some larger arrangement for mutual assurance and protection &ndash; which in itself carries the implication of some sort of premium being required for membership.<br \/><br \/>This brings into the debate the implications of membership of the European Union, and the degree of commitment required to a common security and defence policy, whether this can be limited in practice (or indeed in conscience) as current Irish policy requires.<br \/><br \/>Questions then, more than answers at this stage. There may well not be clear answers which will satisfy everyone in a field redolent of fudge and ambiguity at the best of times even for the most self-confident of states. This is an area in which accommodation needs to be found by examining cases and their implications, by honestly facing up to difficulties, and by openly debating the issues.<\/blockquote>That was the foreword or scene setter for the transcript and we thought it would be useful to reiterate it today.  I invite Mr. Smyth to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015071500002#D00200","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436973300,"counter":1618,"content":"<p>I do not know if I can cast any light on this subject.  I thank the committee for the invitation to address it on the issue of Dr Horgan's petition and specifically on the question of Irish neutrality.  I am currently the foreign policy editor of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and what limited expertise I have on the subject comes from years of reporting and commenting on issues around neutrality and most specifically this State&rsquo;s engagement with the idea and the institutions of the emerging European defence union.  I am not a lawyer.  My reflections will be mainly on the doctrine and political assumptions underlying the State&rsquo;s foreign and security policy.<br\/><br\/>The committee's Chairman has on a number of occasions sought legal and political definitions of neutrality from its witnesses, somewhat unsuccessfully I suspect.  Both the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Niall Burgess, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, have argued that definitions of neutrality in international law relate specifically to &ldquo;time of war&rdquo;, and that Ireland&rsquo;s own operational, not legal, peacetime definition consists straightforwardly in &ldquo;non-participation in military alliances&rdquo;.  It arises from political aspirations and only from the most general of constitutional commitments to peace and peacekeeping.<br\/><br\/>In the context of Ireland&rsquo;s EU membership, the State&rsquo;s neutrality, its &ldquo;non-participation in military alliances&rdquo;, is taken to mean more precisely a refusal to become involved in any North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, Article 5-like &ldquo;one for all, all for one&rdquo; promises, that is, promises automatically to come to the defence of any member state that is attacked or threatened. <br\/><br\/>That the EU in many respects is becoming what most people would see as a military alliance is beyond doubt &ndash; it does peace-enforcing, humanitarian missions, pursues international criminals, confronts pirates, shares arms purchasing and research and, increasingly, in ways that, like the proverbial walking duck, walks and talks like an alliance.  Unlike NATO, it does not do territorial collective defence.  It is not, yet anyway, a &ldquo;defence union&rdquo;.  Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; remains inviolate. <br\/><br\/>The Seville Declarations on the Treaty of Nice and subsequent declarations acknowledge and accommodate Ireland's &quot;traditional policy of military neutrality&rdquo;, whatever that may mean.  The principle of not signing up to &ldquo;common defence&rdquo; is constitutionally enshrined, following both Nice and Lisbon treaties, in Article 29.4. 9&deg;.  It has to be said, however, that given Ireland&rsquo;s political commitment to the EU and its integrity, it seems to me inconceivable that Ireland would not voluntarily join in the defence of any member under attack, just as it has seen the extension of loans to a bankrupt Greece as an essential imperative arising from the solidarity on which the union is based and from which this country too has benefitted.<br\/><br\/>The idea of military neutrality so-defined, Mr Burgess and Deputy Charles Flanagan argued, and I agree, is not in any way incompatible with a political and legal commitment to the primacy of multilateral collective security cooperation under the auspices of the United Nations which is seen, as Mr Burgess put it as &quot;primarily responsible for international peace ... We support actions of the UN Security Council in accordance with the UN Charter&quot;.  That may, and has, involved Ireland in recent years in peace-enforcing missions that are far more robust than traditional peacekeeping.  It has also involved Irish troops in small numbers in the UN operation in Afghanistan.  It has involved Ireland in what might be described as UN-mandated operations regionally subcontracted, under the aegis of NATO.<br\/><br\/>Clearly, Irish neutrality does not mean in principle eschewing the use of force, or assistance in its use, at the behest of the UN or in UN-sanctioned operations.  Chapter 7 of the Charter, Article 43.1, requires that &ldquo;All Members of the United Nations, in order to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security, undertake to make available to the Security Council, on its call and in accordance with a special agreement or agreements, armed forces, assistance, and facilities, including rights of passage, necessary for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Dr. Horgan&rsquo;s insistence that &ldquo;it is clearly in breach of international law to allow a planeload of troops on the way to a military operation or on its way to war to pass through Shannon Airport or a neutral country&rdquo; would appear in this light to make Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the UN incompatible with its neutrality.  That is not, I would suggest, his intention.  What matters , however, is the nature of the military operation and its political and legal standing. <br\/><br\/>Arguably, Ireland&rsquo;s UN commitment, this State&rsquo;s central strategic security doctrine, makes its facilitation of Shannon&rsquo;s use in UN-mandated operations not only compatible with its security doctrine but <i>prima facie<\/i>appears to require it, politically as well as legally, although the Charter does provide a case by case opt-out opportunity.  The specific mandates with which we are concerned are for the United States, US, roles in Afghanistan and Iraq.  The former is pretty straightforward, a unanimous resolution of the UN Security Council, 1368, and Ireland was a member at the time, was agreed in the immediate aftermath of terrorist attacks in the US on 11 September 2001 and which concluded with the council expressing its readiness to take &ldquo;all necessary steps&rdquo; to respond to the attacks and combat all forms of terrorism in accordance with the Charter.  In December 2001 the Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution authorising a peacekeeping force in Afghanistan under Chapter 7 of the Charter.  In late 2001, the Security Council authorised the US to overthrow the Taliban government.<br\/><br\/>Iraq is considerably more problematic.  Ireland in November 2002 voted yes to Resolution 1441 which threatened &quot;serious consequences&quot; if Iraq did not comply with weapons inspectors.  When the US insisted Iraq was in material breach of the resolution and the invasion went ahead in 2003, unsanctioned by the UN, Ireland refused to support it, although the D&aacute;il agreed to a Government proposal that Shannon could be used by coalition planes.<\/p><p>The ambiguous UN mandate was later repudiated clearly by the then Secretary General, Kofi Annan, when he said, in 2004, regarding the invasion:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>I have indicated it was not in conformity with the UN Charter.  From our point of view, from the charter point of view, it was illegal.<\/blockquote>Permission to use Shannon for the Iraq operation seems, therefore, not to have been a UN-based imperative, although the D&aacute;il vote certainly gave it a degree of democratic legitimacy.  While facilitating both the Afghan-related and Iraq-related troop-transporting flights seems to be consistent politically and legally with the spirit both of our neutrality and our commitment to multilateral security through the UN, whatever we may think about the wisdom of both operations, the same cannot be said of facilitating rendition flights, if it happened.  Rendition flights are clearly illegal in international law, and clear evidence of their existence must put an extra onus on Ireland routinely to inspect flights, however diplomatically embarrassing that may prove.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015071500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Smyth","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436973300,"counter":1620,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Smyth.

At the outset, I thank Dr. Edward Horgan, author of public petition No. P00072\/12, and his peace activist colleagues, Dr. John Lannon and Ms Margaretta D'Arcy, for their work in bringing the attention of the Oireachtas to this vital aspect of Irish foreign policy.<br\/><br\/>By way of background, I hold a bachelor of arts degree in politics and Spanish from UCD, a masters of arts in European integration from the University of Limerick, a postgraduate diploma in statistics from the University of Dublin, Trinity College, and a PhD in political science from Trinity.  I wrote my PhD dissertation on public opinion and Irish neutrality.  I am a lecturer in international relations at Dublin City University, where I teach Irish foreign policy, European Union policy and politics, and international relations and political science theories and research methodologies at bachelor, master and doctoral levels.  My scholarship on Irish foreign policy, neutrality in Europe and public opinion on foreign policy is published in the top-ranked Institute for Scientific Information journals in the world, including Cooperation and Conflict, which is ranked 21st in the world for international relations scholarship, and regularly features in those journals' most-read and most-cited indexes.  Despite the fact that Ireland is seen as one small state among the 193 in the world and its neutrality is a foreign policy orientation that is not a focus of attention in the global foreign policy realm, I manage to publish on the subject of Irish foreign policy in the top 100 scholarly journals in the world because I use innovative theories such as critical constructivism, elite socialisation, Europeanisation and the rational public hypothesis to analyse our foreign policy.  I enhance the relative importance of Irish foreign policy by drawing comparisons with other states' foreign policies.<br\/><br\/>I do not mean to bore members with these seemingly mundane details.  I am saying all this to highlight that my work is double-blind peer reviewed by the best scholars in the world, frequently undergoes an additional round of special &quot;hostile&quot; peer review and is subject to a further final round of editorial review.  That is to say, it has been interrogated in minute detail and found to have met the highest scholarly standards of quality and academic credibility.  The rigour and veracity of my research on Irish foreign policy is also seen through my receipt of several prestigious national and international scholarships, including a Chevening scholarship, funding from the Irish Research Council and Fulbright awards.  The scholarly work I will present today is different in many ways from that published by think tanks funded by the European Union or the Government for political purposes.  I will return to this point at the end of my presentation.<br\/><br\/>I am honoured to address the question of the difference between political neutrality and military neutrality.  As members can see, I have focused in my paper on three main themes.  The first concerns the fact that there are two concepts of neutrality in the debate on and formulation of Irish foreign policy, namely, neutrality and military neutrality.  However, only the first of these concepts exists in international law, has been practised by states over centuries and is recognised as a bona fide foreign policy norm.  There are no adjectives or prefixes associated with the term; it is simply &quot;neutrality&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The second point is that Irish people support the concept of neutrality, not the concept of &quot;military neutrality&quot;.  In a democracy, any Irish Government is obliged to implement this preferred neutrality policy in the international sphere as Irish foreign policy.  The third point has to do with the domestic and European environment in which neutrality exists, which is dominated by EU-funded agents that are quite hostile to the truths about neutrality.  The Irish people have a right to have full transparency in regard to the moneys received by those agents, which enable them to achieve dominance of anti-neutrality discourses in the media in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>I will now deal in more detail with the concept of military neutrality, a concept that does not exist in international law.  It is not a recognised practice of states and is not considered a traditional foreign policy norm in the international system.  &quot;Military neutrality&quot; is a term created by governments of neutral states which sought membership of the EEC-EU as a way to agree at the EU level to the progressive framing of a common defence policy leading to a collective EU defence and the eradication of neutrality while, at the same time, telling their electorates at home that the neutrality of the state is retained.  The definition of the term has changed over time.  For example, on <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">11 March 1981<\/font>, as main Opposition finance spokesperson, Garret FitzGerald referred to it as meaning non-participation in a military alliance and not being a member of NATO, the Western European Union or any other alliance.<br\/><br\/>Various Ministers and leaders have proffered different definitions since then, reflecting the variation in responses to developments in EU security and defence policy ambitions.  On 18 January 2003, the then Minister for Defence, Michael Smith, stated, &quot;There is no such thing as, if you like, complete military neutrality.&quot;  That same year, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Brian Cowen, defined military neutrality as &quot;non-membership of military alliance, and specifically, non-membership of an alliance with a mutual defence commitment&quot;.  In 2004, then Government adviser, Martin Mansergh, stated that military neutrality is defined as non-membership of &quot;pre-existing military alliances with mutual automatic obligations&quot;, and asserted that Ireland's foreign policy tradition is only &quot;partly described as neutrality&quot;.  The Irish Government, post-Lisbon treaty ratification, effectively redefined the concepts of &quot;military neutrality&quot; and &quot;non-participation in military alliances&quot; to mean, first, Irish membership of the WEU military alliance through the back door of a merger with the EU and, second, Ireland's assumption of the WEU's Article V mutual defence clause.  In figure 1 of my paper, I have mapped the EU mutual defence clause and the changes in regard to that clause over time versus corresponding changes to the Government's concepts of military neutrality.<br\/><br\/>Scholars have concluded that the term &quot;military non-alliance&quot; has been defined in such a way as to have &quot;close to no meaning at all&quot;.  The decision to aid belligerents in war is against neutrality-based foreign policy and incompatible with Article 2 of the Fifth Hague Convention on the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land of October 1907.  The Irish Government's decision to permit the transit of hundreds of thousands of US soldiers through Shannon Airport on their way to the Iraq war from 2003 onward violated the international law on neutrality and set this State apart from other European neutrals, which refused such permission.  Mr. Cowen insisted at the time that &quot;Irish neutrality is a policy choice and is not defined exclusively on the basis of international legal instruments such as the Hague Convention of 1907&quot;.  Mr. Cowen maintained, moreover, that the Government had to &quot;define neutrality in a very complex set of circumstances, the value of international friendships and the expectations that come with those friendships&quot;.  He reiterated the new mantra that &quot;neutrality policy has also been informed by the view that military neutrality on its own is not sufficient to maintain conditions of peace and security internationally.&quot;<br\/><br\/>I move now to the second point examined in my paper, which is to do with Irish public opinion and neutrality.  The first point to make is that the Irish public does not define neutrality as non-membership of a military alliance.  The assertion by Irish Government elites that their narrow definition of &quot;military neutrality&quot; is likewise held by the Irish public is wrong.  That elite view is reflected in the claim by the then Minister for State, Tom Kitt, in 2003 that &quot;the central and defining characteristic of Irish people in this area ... is our non-participation in military alliances&quot;.  On the contrary, surveys conducted in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s show that an average of just 2.5% of Irish people define neutrality as staying out of NATO or non-membership of military alliances.  The Irish public's concept of neutrality is clear-cut and broadly consistent over time, with the top three substantive elements being &quot;not getting involved in war&quot;, &quot;independence or staying independent&quot; and &quot;not taking sides in wars, that is, impartiality&quot;.  Table 1 in my paper sets out the rank order of neutrality definitions offered by the Irish public and the percentage of people who adhere to the concept of military neutrality.<\/p><p>The public concept accords with neutrality in international law and the most strongly supported public concepts closely resemble the wider, &ldquo;active&rdquo; concept of neutrality that embodies characteristics such as peace promotion,<font color=\"#FF0000\"><\/font>non-aggression, the primacy of the UN, and the confinement of State military activity to UN peacekeeping, not being involved in wars, and maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s independence, identity, and independent foreign policy decision-making, especially in the context of &ldquo;big power&rdquo; pressure.  This is from the 2001-2002 Irish Social and Political Attitudes Survey, ISPAS.  The results of 13 surveys from 1981 to 2013 show that Irish public attitudes towards neutrality are also consistent over time.  Depending on the question wording and response options available, between roughly two in three and four in five people support neutrality and one in five rejects it.  Table 2 in my paper shows these data in detail, grouped by question type.  Contrary to the mistaken claims of academics, which are due to the misinterpretation of data, public concepts of neutrality are neither &ldquo;inconsistent&rdquo; nor &ldquo;limited&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/>Public opinion on neutrality is based on values of independence and patriotism.  The results of a structural equation model analysing ISPAS data, shown in table 3 in my paper, indicate that the more an individual values Irish independence and the prouder an individual is to be Irish, the more that person favours the maintenance of Irish neutrality.  The relationship between independence and patriotism is symbiotic.  As historian Ronan Fanning surmises, &ldquo;by the end of the Second World War neutrality had become what it largely remains in the popular mind until today: the hallmark of independence, a badge of patriotic honour inextricably linked with the popular perception of Irish national identity&rdquo;.  Table 3 shows the regression weights of a structural equation model showing the results of this.<br\/><br\/>Normative democratic theory supports the view that citizens are a wise source of foreign policy, preventing foreign policy designed solely in the interests of elites and even restraining leaders&rsquo; war-making proclivities.  Gaps between the policy preferences of leaders and citizens are seen as problematic and reflecting different values and interests rather than levels of attention or information.  Where public opinion is structured and informed, democratic theory calls for responsiveness by policy-makers.  In other words, the Irish Government needs to heed public opinion on neutrality because it is coherent, consistent and based on important and relevant political values and identity.<br\/><br\/>The third part of my presentation concerns the domestic and international environment in which neutrality is discussed and defined.  Irish public opinion on foreign policy is extremely politicised because treaties that extend the scope of the objectives of the European Community, EC, or European Union, EU, are subject to a ratification device of a binding referendum in Ireland.  Opinion polls have shown that Irish neutrality is the top substantive policy reason given by Irish people who voted against the Single European Act and the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice treaties in referendums.  As the gap between the &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; votes has narrowed in parallel with the expansion of EU foreign, security and defence policy, referendum campaigns in Ireland have become increasingly contentious and fraught because a ratification failure in one or more EU member states means the treaty in question cannot come into force.<br\/><br\/>In June 2008, the Irish people rejected the Lisbon treaty by a substantial margin of 53.4% against, 46.6% in favour, based on a healthy turnout of 53.1%, and another phase of European integration was brought to a grinding halt.  Neutrality was the most divisive issue in the Lisbon treaty referendum campaign.  Research showed that &ldquo;strengthening neutrality&rdquo; was a major driver of people&rsquo;s decision to vote &quot;no&quot;.  Irish voters who rejected the Lisbon treaty to safeguard neutrality were correct because neutrality is incompatible with the European Union's defence provisions enacted through the Lisbon treaty.  Table 4 in my paper compares the various elements of neutrality with the EU's common security and defence policy, CSDP.  I will not go into detail on that, because it will be made available in the paper.<br\/><br\/>On the power structure of discourses on Irish and European neutrality, there is evident bias in the research and reporting of public attitudes to neutrality and other European security and defence options.  Irish scholars have criticised the &quot;sizeable body of feeling, innuendo and unargued comment in the writings of some politicians, journalists and historians who are clearly unhappy with Ireland&rsquo;s ambiguous position&quot;.  One of the many financial instruments at the disposal of the EU is its external relations budget for information programmes, amounting to &euro;10.7 million in 2008.  These moneys are expended on &quot;the organisation of visits for groups of journalists&rdquo; and &ldquo;support for the information activities of opinion leaders that are consistent with the European Union&rsquo;s priorities&rdquo;.  These journalist &quot;opinion leaders&quot; dominating the discourses on the EU and neutrality in Irish newspapers and broadcast media shows co-ordinate their positions with the EU's specially funded &quot;academics&quot;, the so-called &quot;Jean Monnet&quot; lecturers.<br\/><br\/>Officially, Jean Monnet chairs are teaching posts with a specialisation in European integration studies.  Unofficially, these posts, co-financed by the EU up to a level of 75%, are to encourage &ldquo;associations of professors and researchers to communicate, teach and [I emphasise] promote European Integration Process&rdquo;.  The public are largely unaware of the extent to which the seemingly objective academics dominating the media discourses in Ireland are, in fact, on the EU's payroll and tasked with promoting the EU's CSDP and concomitant hostile discourses on neutrality.  Such agents also dominate board positions in bona fide academic institutions such as the Royal Irish Academy, RIA.<br\/><br\/>These EU-sponsored journalists and so-called Jean Monnet academics also benefit from further financial resources through EU-funded think tanks such as the Institute of International and European Affairs in Ireland.  I am given to understand the European Commission also finances the State broadcaster's European correspondent position based in Brussels.  The list goes on.  Suffice to say that the truly academic and objective voices on neutrality and EU CSDP are rarely heard and actively suppressed by these agents.  The media have a responsibility to ask contributors to declare their affiliations with the EU and the amount of funding they have received over the years for their work on behalf of the EU.<br\/><br\/>In this final section of my presentation, I highlight some portraits of public preferences that are clearly coloured by the political and policy preferences of the authors who are part of the EU-funded elite.  Examples include the omission of key public preferences in the realm of foreign policy from Eurobarometer surveys, and inaccurate reporting of Eurobarometer-type questions by academics in the media.  Rabin argues that <blockquote>... the Eurobarometer has truly become an instrument of governance, as they say nowadays ... it is a tool that, I believe, researchers trust ... The Eurobarometer has now become a tool that we can describe as practical, indispensable and incontestable.<\/blockquote>Eurobarometer can only be considered a tool of governance if it does indeed capture the true policy preferences and foreign policy concepts of the publics in the EU.  Does it?  In a review of EC polling from 1962 to 1982, I found evidence that the balance between the Eurobarometer functions of evaluating public opinion and acting as a tool of politics is skewed towards the latter, evinced through the generalisation of claims as to the truth of &quot;European&quot; peoples&rsquo; preferences based on the omission of several cases of populations, in particular Ireland, and the universalisation of claims to knowledge of public foreign policy preferences based on a seemingly politically motivated omission of evinced preferences from the list of options presented to respondents.  For example, Richard Eichenberg claims that &ldquo;the 'neutralist option', so enthusiastically researched by the pollsters, never exceeded 20% in any country&rdquo; but it is clear from the data I present in table 5 that neutrality was favoured by a majority of 31% in France, sizeable minorities of 29% each in Italy and Belgium, and in figures that greatly exceeded 20%.  Anton DePorte volunteered that &ldquo;reports of neutralism and pacificism in European public opinion&rdquo; were of concern to elites that feared that &ldquo;the domestic base of support for the Alliance had been eroded&rdquo;.  Unsurprisingly, given EC's horror at the support for neutrality among NATO member state populations, the neutrality response option was dropped from the questionnaire wording in Eurobarometer surveys conducted after 1979.<br\/><br\/>Another classic case drawn from media discourse in Ireland involves a pseudo-academic analysis of an <i>Irish Times<\/i>poll carried out by TNS-MRBI in an article entitled &quot;Poll Reveals a Canny Electorate&quot;.  The author of the piece, a Jean Monnet, stated that &ldquo;68 percent of us are quite happy for Ireland to join some form of a common European defence&rdquo;.  In fact, the question asked people to consider the statement, &ldquo;Ireland should consider joining a future European Union common defence&rdquo;.<\/p><p>The question definitively did not ask people whether they would have Ireland join a European Union common defence.  Instead the respondents of the survey were asked to consider a statement about considering this idea and 68% replied that they would be okay if Ireland considered such a hypothetical scenario.<\/p><p> These EU agents define neutrality in purely negative terms, that is, \"notions of pacifism and isolationism\", or deny the content of the concept altogether and demand the erasure of neutrality from all discourses, for example, \"Neutrality is not a foreign policy and does not even give content or orientation to a foreign policy ... There is no correlation between a position of military neutrality and the content and substance of a foreign policy\" and \"the content of Irish foreign policy has nothing whatsoever to do with neutrality\".  Thus \"we must, as individuals, stop using the word 'neutrality', which has nothing to do with our foreign policy\".  These agents could not be more wrong.  Despite the EU demands for its removal and the fact that political parties have placed neutrality in a zone of meaningful silence in political discourse, from Wolfe Tone's clearly stated manifesto for Irish neutrality in 1790 up to the present day, the Irish people have consistently advocated a legally correct and normatively vital concept of neutrality and associated it with signifiers of independence, self-determination, global cosmopolitanism, anti-colonisation and anti-imperialism.<\/p><p> I suspect that the names of the three petitioners lobbying the committee today will be added to the list of those luminaries known for advocating the same approach to Irish international relations, following, as they do, in the wake of Daniel O'Connell, Se&aacute;n Lester, P&aacute;draig Pearse, James Connolly, Frank Aiken and Eamon de Valera.  The Irish and Iraqi people owe them a debt of gratitude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015071500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen Devine","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436973300,"counter":1624,"content":"<p>Thank you.

Let us be clear - the people's understanding is that we do not get involved in wars and we do not wish to be involved in military alliances.  That is not from a parochial basis but from the opposite basis.  It is from the basis of being good internationalists who wish to side with people who may be subject to the bullying of big powers.  That is really the people's understanding of neutrality and why, for example, the facilitation of the war in Iraq flies in the face of the notion the people of this country have of neutrality.  That was clearly demonstrated in opinion polls that were carried out on the matter by the Peace and Neutrality Alliance, PANA, and in the massive mobilisations against that war.  One of the major reasons that people voted against the various EU treaties was precisely on this basis.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Devine agrees on that but what does Mr. Smyth think about it?  If we wish to have a notion of neutrality that is in line with the opinions of the people, is that not the opinion of the people in the first place?  Linked to that, is the refusal of the Government to define neutrality due to the fact that it knows that is what the people believe neutrality to be and it does not want it pinned down because it knows what the answer is?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015071500002#H00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436973300,"counter":1626,"content":"<p>The problem is that what the public sense is neutrality is a very complicated issue.

Therefore, it is necessary to dig into that to see what it means in practice.  That is why I placed much emphasis in my contribution on the positive security doctrine of the State, which is to see that international conflict would be resolved through the UN.  That necessarily means, perhaps, getting involved in wars, which necessarily involves the use of military force, and an automatic commitment by us to support and assist UN-mandated operations, regardless of whether we like them.  I believe our public understanding of neutrality is more sophisticated than just saying that we want to be on the side of the good guys and that we are anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist.

Certain sections of the Irish neutrality lobby definitely try to associate neutralism with military pacifism, but that is not our foreign policy position.<\/p> <p>  To get back to how the Government defines it, the Government has a precise definition of military neutrality.  It is non-involvement in Article 5 type commitments.

The point I was making is that there does not appear to be any inconsistency there.<\/p> <p>  In terms of defining political neutrality, Governments over time have said that Ireland has never been politically neutral.  We did not join the Non-Aligned Movement, for example, when that was a big deal in the 1960s.

This is about how the international community tries to regulate security on an international level.

Is it a war?  What is going on in other operations where we have been involved in peace enforcing, which is taking one side and policing a situation on behalf of the international community very robustly?

There are so many definitions of neutrality under international law that it becomes irrelevant in the sense that a country defines its own neutrality by how the people choose.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett has said, there was overwhelming opposition to the Iraq war, yet we are complicit in assisting one country to bomb parts of Iraq, or send troops and weapons there.<\/p> <p>  I think Dr. Devine said either that neutrality cannot be defined under international law or that it is not accepted.  I do not know but I would imagine that neutrality is self-defined within the nation that wants to become neutral and not take part in a conflict.<\/p> <p>  I want to come back to Mr. Smyth.  There is an absolute difference between a peace initiative and taking part in preventing conflict, and taking part in a conflict or helping that conflict by supplying weapons or rhetoric.  The Irish people are quite clear if they decide, believe and agree with Irish troops being sent as peacekeepers to some area where the confrontation may have stopped for a period.  They are there to see that it does not recur.<\/p> <p>  All of this essentially comes back to how we participate, and have participated, in helping the Americans both in Iraq and Afghanistan.

I agree that refuelling planes and the transit of US troops through Shannon on their way to a theatre of war does breach the international law of neutrality.  It means we are not neutral.  When the Government agreed to do that, it broke the law on neutrality.  Given that neutrality is not in the Irish Constitution, there is nothing anyone can do about that.  It is a government decision.  Dr. Horgan did take a case against the State for these actions, claiming it was a breach of international law.  The judge agreed that it was a breach of the customary international law on neutrality but, because it is not in the Constitution, as a judge his hands were tied.  Dr. Horgan was right.  Allowing the transit of troops is specifically prohibited in the Hague Convention of 1907, the international law on neutrality.<\/p> <p>  It is important to differentiate.  There is a lot of talk about the United Nations and Ireland's participation in it.  Transit of troops through Shannon has nothing to do with a United Nations mandate.  It is a bilateral agreement between the Irish and US Governments.  Talking about the UN is a red herring in that respect.  The UN does not force states to provide troops or get involved in wars.  The point of the UN is to regulate the use of force.  The UN does not mandate a war; it mandates a response to a threat of war or a war that has broken out.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Smyth is right in saying that Ireland is moving towards participation in peace enforcement missions, which are very distinct from peacekeeping missions.  Peacekeeping is when we are asked by parties who are in conflict to come in and maintain a truce.  The parties involved in the conflict want our presence to keep the peace so that negotiations can continue and the conflict can be resolved.  There are very important, though subtle, differences between this and peace enforcement.<\/p> <p>  One could say that the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, to which Ireland contributes about five troops, is basically a way for the Government to fly the flag.  Once one member of the Defence Forces is involved in an operation, our flag gets hoisted and we are considered to be present in that mission.  The ISAF peace enforcement mission in Afghanistan does not involve Irish soldiers in actual peace enforcement activities.   Irish soldiers are carrying out bomb disposal there.  There is also an administrative individual in the operation's headquarters.  Ireland has never been involved in actual peace enforcement in practice.  That is a distinction that should be made.<\/p> <p>  I may have gotten it wrong or been unclear in terms of what Deputy Halligan picked up from what I was saying.  As a scholar who has been studying neutrality for 20 years, to me, what neutrality means is very clear cut.  It means not participating in wars, maintaining independence so as to be able to resist any great power pressure to get involved in wars, and being impartial in respect of the sides involved in a war.  This is an established norm in international law.  The Irish public's concept of neutrality correlates very well with this international legal concept and its associated rights, duties and obligations.

Mr. Smyth said that he does not believe the same can be said of facilitating rendition flights if that has been done.  We should consider the role of a neutral country, particularly in a space like Shannon, in the policing of planes coming through.  It was clear from the Ministers who spoke to us that there is an understanding or gentlemen's agreement between ourselves and the US.  If they tell us everything is hunky dory and there is no rendition happening on a plane, we do not touch the plane or check it out.

I agree with Mr. Smyth in that it is certainly not in the Hague conventions.  Rendition was not a concept that existed in the early 1900s.  However, the question must be asked whether rendition is part of the war effort or something that just happens because individuals in a government do not like particular individuals or that they discriminate against or are racist towards particular individuals, and that they are violating their human rights.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Smyth is right.  Rendition violates a number of international laws in terms of the rights of individuals.  George Bush was explicit in saying that the use of what effectively amounted to torture until just before organ failure was the basis of the methods they were using in Guantanamo as part of the war on terrorism.  If it is argued that those individuals are being renditioned because it is part of the war on terrorism, as such, and part of the illegal war against Iraq, then it could be considered that there is an obligation to ensure that a country is not aiding that particular aspect of the war effort, if it is considered part of the war effort.<\/p> <p>  It is very rare that war is declared in the modern world.  Very few people declare that they are going to war against state X or Y.  George Bush's war was a war on terrorism, so it was a war on a concept.  It was not a war against specific states, even though he invaded the states of Iraq and Afghanistan.  <\/p> <p>  For me, neutrality is an inter-state type of concept that exists in international law.  However, it is also a normative concept and there are moral considerations involved in states that do not want to get involved in war.  It is not just about survival.  It is primarily about security and survival, which is what Irish neutrality was about during the Second World War, but it has become increasingly informed by a normative dimension because of the development of arms and technology.  The military power of certain super states in the international system has meant that it is difficult for ordinary, non-super states to be able to resist some of the war making proclivities of the larger powers in the system.  If it is the case that Ireland is considered a neutral state and that there is a normative dimension to that, Ireland would have an obligation to search those planes to make sure that rendition is not happening, if it is considered part of the war effort.  We should bear in mind that George Bush declared war in Iraq in March 2003 and declared the war had ended in May 2003, but it continued for at least ten years after that.  The official declaration of war is one aspect but what we consider warfare, in terms of the killing of civilians and soldiers, is another.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015071500002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen Devine"},{"type":"speech","time":1436973300,"counter":1668,"content":"<p>A final question, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015071500002#L00300","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1436973300,"counter":1669,"content":"<p>In other states internationally which declared themselves neutral, does Mr. Smyth find anything like the Shannon stopover?

Mr. Smyth's perspective is that it is a more fluid concept than that defined in international law.  I will not go into that because both witnesses have given their perspectives but should we have a referendum on enshrining neutrality in the Constitution?  The case was taken by the petitioner, Dr. Horgan, but it could not be successful because there is not a clear legal definition in this State that represents what has been the stated political imperative for decades.  What is the opinion of the witnesses?  Would it be helpful to have a clear legal definition of neutrality to clear up the confusion?  Should we just leave it to the interpretation by a government in a given period or do we put it to the people and allow them decide?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015071500002#L00900","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436973300,"counter":1675,"content":"<p>I repeat that there is a very clear legal concept of neutrality.  States do not get to make up what they think neutrality is.  It is a legal concept that is enshrined in the Hague Convention.  The manner in which states have actually put it into practice has generally accorded with these international laws.  If the behaviour of a state did not accord with international law, the concept would lose its significance and there would be no point in having an international law on neutrality.  International laws are in place to regulate the behaviour of states and set expectations regarding their behaviour, particularly in matters of war and peace that are so vital.<br\/><br\/>The question of whether neutrality should be enshrined in the Constitution is an interesting one.  I wrote a paper published in <i>Irish Political Studies<\/i>, which was published in 2009.  I have e-mailed six or seven of my articles to the members of the joint committee.  In my 2009 article I looked at the positions of Irish political parties on neutrality and European Security and Defence Policy in successive decades from the 1960s through to the 2000s.  One of the things that struck me was how the political parties had moved across a matrix from being in favour of and supporting active neutrality - the legal concept of neutrality and the normative values about what I have spoken - towards a maximalist EU defence policy involving signing up to the mutual defence clause, which is what we did when we ratified the Lisbon treaty.  Interestingly, I found that as the decades progressed, the Labour Party which had stated neutrality should be enshrined in the Constitution and made a number of interventions in the Houses of the Oireachtas to propose a Bill to that end had joined Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il in leaving real, active or positive neutrality aside and moving to the minimalist concept of not being a member of a military alliance.  The Labour Party knew that it would eventually agree to maximalist EU defence.  The mantle then transferred from the Labour Party to the Green Party.  In the 1990s the Green Party stated we should have neutrality enshrined in the Constitution.  When it formed a coalition with Fianna F&aacute;il, it changed its stance on neutrality and went the way of the Labour Party.  I concluded that in the 2000s Sinn F&eacute;in had adopted the idea of including neutrality in the Constitution.  It is interesting how the idea of including it in the Constitution has been transferred over the decades through the political parties.<br\/><br\/>The Government is not in favour of holding a referendum on this issue because it would then be constrained by international law on neutrality.  In other words, if neutrality were to be enshrined in the Constitution, Edward Horgan would have won his case because the judge would have found that the Government had violated the constitutional provisions on neutrality.  As I have said, neutrality is clearly defined in the Hague Conventions.  It is a legal concept.  There is no fuzziness about what it requires.  There is a debate around it because many of the political parties - certainly, the mainstream political parties and the parties of the right - want all member states of the European Union to eventually become member states of NATO, to be involved in collective defence arrangements and to sign up to mutual defence clauses.  That is why it is claimed that the concept of neutrality is somehow fuzzy.  As I have argued, it is not.  Saying it is fuzzy is a political device or strategy used by the Government to continue to do what it wants to do.  In the case we are discussing it wants to facilitate US warplanes landing at Shannon Airport en route to a theatre of war.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015071500002#M00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen Devine"},{"type":"speech","time":1436973300,"counter":1676,"content":"<p>Clearly, Dr. Devine believes it is important to hold a referendum on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015071500002#M00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436973300,"counter":1677,"content":"<p>I did not specifically say that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015071500002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen Devine"},{"type":"speech","time":1436973300,"counter":1678,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015071500002#M00400","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436973300,"counter":1679,"content":"<p>I said it is interesting.

The Lisbon and Nice treaties both refer specifically to respecting Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.  Article 29.4.9&deg; of the Constitution specifically states the State will not sign up to a common defence policy.  It is very clear to me that we do not regard ourselves as committed to a common defence policy.  The overall treaty certainly contains clauses on a defence union, but we are clearly exempt from these clauses by virtue of the Constitution and the wording of the treaties I have mentioned.<\/p> <p>  The point has been made that the Hague Convention refers to neutrality in times of war.  We need an operational definition of times of peace, but this is much more complicated.  Although I believe in neutrality in the sense that we should not join any military alliance, I do not believe holding a referendum would be a good idea.  We have had bad experience with referendums.  I do not believe they are the best way of ascertaining the people's will or inserting something into the Constitution.  We end up amending amendments and amendments to amendments.  We are now discussing amending the article on abortion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015071500002#M01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1436973300,"counter":1692,"content":"<p>I want to make a couple of quick points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015071500002#N00100","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1436973300,"counter":1693,"content":"<p>At this late stage we will not take points, only supplementary questions.

If Irish soldiers are protecting a refugee camp and it is attacked, should they open fire, essentially taking military action against the country?  Although in nine out of ten situations it is peacekeeping rather than peace enforcement, there is a grey area in which it is unclear whether we would be breaching our neutrality.<\/p> <p>  Does Dr. Devine think the difficulty with enshrining anything in the Constitution regarding neutrality is not that it would be constrained by EU laws but by international events?  There is a view that Ireland should not have stayed neutral during the Second World War.  Does she think the view is that we have a right to remain neutral in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan?  It appears to be the Government's view and that of countries that have not enshrined their neutrality in law that we cannot foretell what will happen internationally and that there could be some horrific case which the people of the country might say they cannot tolerate and must deal with such as the Second World War.  Perhaps we need to concentrate on it.  I would value Dr. Devine's view.<\/p> <p>  The United States was technically at war with the Government of Afghanistan which it had accused of orchestrating terrorist acts against it.  Does Dr. Devine agree that we are in breach of neutrality if we take an Afghan citizen and fly him into Ireland on his way to America?

While clearly we disagree, the weight of international legal and academic opinion is on my side.  In 2011 I published a paper in a journal entitled, Cooperation and Conflict, in which I recounted in minute detail how Ireland had acceded to the Western European Union, WEU, military alliances Article 5 guarantee because the European Union had decided it wanted to subsume and absorb the WEU military alliance from approximately the 1950s.  When we reached the stage of the Maastricht Treaty on the European Union which allowed for an eventual common defence, it was going to be based on absorbing the WEU into the European Union.  The merger was due to happen and there is documentation that shows it.<\/p> <p>  In December 1999 in Helsinki a European Council meeting was held which authorised the merger.  The merger was completed once the Article 5 guarantee was inserted into an EU treaty.  At the time it was being inserted into the constitution which was being drafted from 2002 to 2004 the Irish Government tried to stop the Article 5 guarantee being cut and pasted wholesale into the constitution which became the Lisbon treaty which amended the two previous treaties, the Treaty on European Union and the EC treaties.  Brian Cowen, in a letter to Franco Frattini, Vice President of the European Union at the time, said we could not agree to it.  Germany and France had previously tried to have it inserted into the Amsterdam treaty and were foiled because Britain was not in favour.  However, by 2002, it was in favour and the three big powers got in a room and discussed what they were going to do about letters from Brian Cowen and the Foreign Ministers of the other neutral states, namely, Austria, Finland and Sweden.  The big three powers said the move had always been in the plans and was the completion of the European common defence policy and that they would not allow any dilution of it.<\/p> <p>  The Article 5 guarantee was transplanted in wholesale.  We have signed and ratified the treaty and are obliged under it to provide aid and assistance by all means in our power.  The words \"military and other\" were deleted in order to demilitarise the clause.  The line is that we are not obliged, given that there is a further statement in the treaty clause that it does not prejudice the \"specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states\".  However, the treaty goes on to talk about how NATO member states' desire for NATO primacy is protected, but it does not refer to neutral states.  If it were supposed to protect neutral states and neutrality, it would have.  The Constitution has no prohibition that protects neutrality and does not mention neutrality.  The Seville Declaration, a political statement, states military neutrality is not affected.  As I outlined in my presentation, \"military neutrality\" is whatever the Government decides it means on any given morning.  While it used to mean non-membership of a military alliance, now it effectively means membership of a military alliance.  It has no legal standing and is just a political and discursive device invented by governments.  It does not apply in international relations as a foreign policy phenomenon and Mr. Smyth and I disagree on it.<\/p> <p>  We should hold a referendum on including neutrality in the Constitution, given that it has been part of so many political parties' agendas and the fact that the Government is violating the law on neutrality through the facilitation of US troops through Shannon Airport on the way to a theatre of war.  It would help us to get a better understanding of what neutrality means to the people.  As an academic, I can see very clearly through successive opinion polls what it means to them.  While there is no question about it, a referendum might help to clarify it.  Generally, the Government will not be in favour of it and I do not think it will happen.  I can speculate that if Sinn F&eacute;in got into government, perhaps it might happen.  We will see.  <\/p> <p>  The Chairman has said we have already covered the question of the grey area between peace enforcement and peacekeeping.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015071500002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen Devine"},{"type":"speech","time":1436973300,"counter":1697,"content":"<p>I will not allow this.
