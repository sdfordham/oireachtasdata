In the interests of brevity - I understand I have about ten minutes - my opening statement will be an abbreviated version of the written statement I made to the inquiry.<br\/><br\/>So, by way of background, the NTMA has a number of diverse functions, all of which are clearly defined in legislation.  A common theme running through all of its functions, with the exception of its State Claims Agency, is its engagement with capital markets.  Its original mission was to fund the Exchequer borrowing requirement and manage the national debt in a cost effective manner.  This mission has been added to by various Governments over the years.  The additional function most relevant to the banking crisis was the NTMA's role as manager of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, and I was the director responsible for the fund up to December 2009.  The NPRF was controlled by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, a body corporate which was independent in how it made its investment decisions.  When I was appointed CEO of the NTMA in December 2009, I became an <i>ex officio<\/i>member of the commission.  The legislation governing the fund was amended in 2009 in the context of the banking crisis to enable the Minister for Finance to direct the commission to make investments in Bank of Ireland and AIB.  In reporting on the fund's investment performance, the commission clearly delineated between the performance of those investments which it had made under its own discretionary powers and the so-called discretionary investments in Bank of Ireland and ... or directed investments in Bank of Ireland and AIB.  The NTMA had no role in relation to the oversight of the banking system and no responsibility in relation to the provision of liquidity to the system.  We believed that the role of lender of last resort fell to the Central Bank and ECB.<br\/><br\/>2007-2008: The function of the interbank money markets became increasingly problematic through 2007, culminating in the UK in September 2007 in the collapse of Northern Rock, a financial institution which heavily relied on non-retail funding in a way not dissimilar to Anglo Irish.  There were sharp falls in 2008 in the share prices of Irish banks with, for example, the share price in Anglo Irish falling by 18% in one day.  These falls reflected concerns about the impact of the continuing fall in Irish property prices on the banks' earnings and also the wider international background of non-functioning money markets.  In September 2008, the NTMA was invited to attend, with the Department of Finance, meetings of the domestic standing group and, depending on my availability, I attended meetings of that group.  The deteriorating liquidity position of the Irish banks, in particular Anglo Irish and INBS, was the group's biggest concern and, on foot of those concerns, the Department of Finance put in hand, as a contingency measure, the drafting of legislation providing for a scheme for bank and building society nationalisation.  <br\/><br\/>On 14 September 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy.  Around that time, the Minister for Finance asked the NTMA to retain corporate finance advisers in the area of bank resolution.  I was involved in procuring the services of Merrill Lynch in that context.  Merrill Lynch subsequently provided advice which formed an input to the deliberations culminating in the Government decision to guarantee the deposits and debt liabilities of six domestic financial institutions, the covered institutions.  As the committee is aware from evidence given by my colleague, Brendan McDonagh, the NTMA was not involved in the deliberations of 29 and 30 September.<br\/><br\/>While the guarantee helped the covered institutions, in particular Anglo Irish, to attract funding through the interbank market and retail deposits, at least in the near time ... term, the share prices of the quoted banks continued to perform poorly, signalling continuing market concerns about their profitability and possible requirements for fresh capital.  In a statement issued on 30 November, the Minister for Finance said that, in certain circumstances, it would be appropriate for the State, through the National Pensions Reserve Fund or otherwise, to consider supplementing privately sourced additional capital for the covered institutions.  On Saturday 13 December 2008, with my colleague Brendan McDonagh, I attended a day-long meeting in the Department of Finance, where the question of bank recapitalisation was considered.  We pressed strongly at that meeting for the nationalisation of Anglo Irish, which was also the approach recommended by Merrill Lynch.  In the event, the view that Anglo should be recapitalised, rather than nationalised, prevailed.  A Government announcement on 21 December 2008 on recapitalisation said that there would be an initial State investment of &euro;1.5 billion in Anglo and that agreement had been reached with Bank of Ireland and AIB that each would issue &euro;2 billion of preference shares to the State.  At the request of the Minister for Finance, I was heavily involved in the discussions with Bank of Ireland and AIB, leading up to that announcement.<\/p><p>At the outset of those discussions, the banks resisted the suggestion that they needed fresh capital and, in particular, the provision of capital by the State.<br\/><br\/>2009: The proposed recapitalisation of Anglo was abandoned with a statement by the Minister for Finance on 15 January 2009 that it would be taken into public ownership citing &quot;a weakening in its funding position and unacceptable practices&quot;.  In the meantime, there were ongoing discussions with Bank of Ireland and AIB on how their &euro;2 billion capital injections could be achieved.  Against an international backdrop of banks generally increasing their core tier 1 capital, it was agreed in discussions, which I chaired, that the State would provide &euro;3.5 billion core tier 1 capital for each bank through preference shares.  It was the view of the NTMA that, given its bigger balance sheet, AIB was likely to require more capital than Bank of Ireland but AIB stuck to its view that its problem was no bigger than Bank of Ireland and that it would only recommend to its shareholders a deal based on its quantum of additional capital being the same as Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s.  The Minister for Finance decided that the &euro;7 billion of capital was to be provided by the NPRF.  The NTMA engaged PwC and Arthur Cox to undertake due diligence on the two banks.  To help us oversee this exercise we retained Sir Andrew Large, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, as a &quot;trusted adviser&quot;.  In response to a request from the Minister, the due diligence exercise was tasked with forming a judgment with respect to the probability of each bank&rsquo;s core tier 1 capital being above the regulatory minimum at end-2011 and with identifying matters or issues which might reasonably be considered of a &quot;red flag&quot; nature.<br\/><br\/>The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission reported in March 2009 to the Minister on Bank of Ireland.  The due diligence results indicated that there was a reasonable prospect that, allowing for the proposed capital injection of &euro;3.5 billion by way of preference shares, the bank's core tier 1 capital would be above the then current regulatory minimum 4% at end-2011.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission reported the Minister on AIB in May 2009.  The results painted a doubtful picture about whether the bank would be above its regulatory capital minimum of 4% at end-2011.  The Minister directed that both capital injections be proceeded with and the NTMA, on behalf of the NPRF, executed on them.<br\/><br\/>As CEO of the NTMA, I was an <i>ex officio <\/i>member of the NAMA board from its inception in 2009 and, in its early days, was heavily involved with Brendan McDonagh in recruiting its senior management team.  I believe that the decision to set up NAMA was the correct one and, based on the NTMA&rsquo;s engagements with institutional investors and the credit rating agencies.  I am strongly of the view that its success played a huge role in Ireland later regaining access to the debt capital markets.<br\/><br\/>In June 2009, the Minister for Finance invested &euro;3 billion in share capital of Anglo Irish.  The Minister invested a further &euro;1 billion later that year.  These investments were made in cash drawn from the Exchequer and the NTMA was not involved in their execution.  As the committee will be aware, subsequent capital injections were made in the form of promissory notes.  The use of the promissory notes had the advantage that their redemption by the Exchequer was spread out over a 20-year period, thereby easing the pressure on the NTMA to access capital markets.  At end-2009 Ireland remained relatively highly rated by the major credit rating agencies, notwithstanding downgrades over the previous 18 months in response to the deterioration of the public finances and the very evident stress in the banking system.  Ireland was broadly rated AA or equivalent, but generally with a negative outlook.  The NTMA raised &euro;35.4 billion in long-term funding in 2009.<br\/><br\/>2010: In February 2010, the Minister for Finance announced his intention to delegate certain functions in the banking area to the NTMA.  This announcement stated &quot;All of these functions will be carried out on behalf of the Minister, and in close consultation with the Minister and relevant officials in his Department and building on the existing very close co-operation between the two organisations.&quot;  The initiative to delegate the function was the Minister&rsquo;s own and was not in response to representations by the NTMA.  From a policy setting point of view, very little changed in reality with the Department maintaining a tight grip on policy issues, albeit with input from the NTMA, among others.  However, the delegation order brought all of the covered institutions operationally within the remit of the NTMA.  Following the making of the delegation order, the NTMA built up a banking unit staffed by experts in banking, bank analysis and corporate finance.  In March 2010 the Central Bank announced that banks would be required by year-end to meet a base capital ... core tier 1 capital ratio of 8%.  The Central Bank also announced the results of a prudential capital adequacy review, PCAR, which indicated that both Bank of Ireland and AIB had additional capital requirements.  The AIB requirement was further increased in September 2010 based on experience of the actual discount rate or haircut applied by NAMA.  The NTMA banking unit was involved in executing, on behalf of the NPRF, the necessary transactions, which, in the case of Bank of Ireland involved private sector capital, to address the capital shortfalls.  The Central Bank also identified significant additional capital requirements for Anglo, INBS and EBS.<\/p><p>The extent of the additional capital requirements and, in particular, the huge loss announced by Anglo during this period were major factors in Ireland subsequently having to withdraw from the bond markets.<\/p><p> The NTMA's funding and debt management unit raised &euro;19.9 billion in long-term funding in 2010.  We concentrated a significant portion of our long-term borrowing programme in the earlier part of the year in order to maximise the advantage to the Exchequer of the good terms for Irish sovereign debt which existed at the start of the year.  As a result, the NTMA had achieved its borrowing target for 2010 before conditions deteriorated markedly during the final quarter of the year and we had to cancel auctions which were scheduled for October and November.  At end 2010, not least because of Ireland&rsquo;s entry into the EU-IMF programme, Ireland&rsquo;s credit rating was barely investment grade and, indeed, one rating agency subsequently marked it down to sub-investment grade.  The tone of eurozone sovereign bond markets was severely damaged in October 2010 when, at an EU summit in Deauville, Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy said that holders of eurozone sovereign debt should be forced to take losses or haircuts as part of any debt restructuring.<\/p><p> I was a member of the team of Irish officials who were directed by the Minister for Finance to hold discussions with the EU Commission, ECB and IMF in mid-November 2010.  At the time, there were ongoing substantial losses of corporate and retail deposits by the Irish banks.  In response to a request from the Minister for my views on whether Ireland should apply for an EU-IMF programme, citing the severe liquidity strains on the banking system and the risk of a collapse of the system, I wrote to him on 21 November 2010 recommending that an application be made.  I said I envisaged that such assistance would provide for a capital strengthening of the banking system and, although likely to be expensive, would also provide sizable funding to the State.  I stressed that appropriate liquidity support from the ECB would be a necessary complement to a decision to apply.  Unfortunately, such liquidity support was, in my view, only grudgingly provided by the ECB to the extent that their public utterances could have been much more supportive.<\/p><p> On Saturday 27 November 2010, I wrote again to the Minister, at his request, furnishing comments on the proposed programme of financial assistance with particular reference to its implications for debt sustainability.  I said that the &euro;35 billion earmarked in the proposed programme for proposed ... for potential capital injections in the banking system would, if implemented, substantially increase the risk of sustainability of the national debt.  I recommended that, with a view to mitigating the extra burden on the Exchequer represented by such additional borrowing, the question of a formal bail-in should be considered through aggressive liability management or a resolution regime with respect to the subordinated debt and senior unguaranteed debt on the banks' balance sheets.  Together with the Secretary General, Department of Finance, and the Central Bank Governor, I attended part of the Government meeting held that night where consideration was being given on whether to accept the proposed terms of the programme to be told by the Minister that the question of a formal bail-in, which he himself apparently had favoured, had been flatly rejected at a meeting earlier that day of the G20 in Korea, a fact of which I was not made aware until then.<\/p><p> 2011-2012: As part of the conditions of the EU-IMF programme, the Central Bank undertook in early 2011, under the supervision of the ECB, a further PCAR exercise.  In the context of mitigating the cost to the State of providing further capital support to the banking sector which was expected to arise for that ... from that exercise, and for which, as I mentioned already, &euro;35 billion had been earmarked, the NTMA commissioned a study to look at a bail-in-burden-sharing scheme involving senior as well as subordinated debt holders in the covered institutions.  The scheme identified substantial potential savings, depending on the level of discount or haircut applied.  For the scheme to proceed, the support of the troika was critical but once again such support was not forthcoming.  Nevertheless, liability management exercises were pursued through 2011, which helped mitigate the cost to the State of the Central Bank's 2011 PCAR, the results of which were announced on 31 March and which identified an additional capital requirement of &euro;24 billion.  During the first quarter of 2011 the NTMA banking unit conducted the sale by auction of the deposit books of both Anglo Irish and INBS.<\/p><p> Following the entry into the EU-IMF programme and an announcement in February 2011 by the Minister for Finance to second the NTMA banking unit to the Department of Finance, the strategic focus of the NTMA shifted back to what we regarded as one of our core roles - funding and debt management - and the challenge of regaining access to the capital markets so that Ireland would have sufficient funding visibility at end 2013 to exit the programme.  That challenge was made all the more difficult because, in addition to demonstrating that we had enough cash to meet day-to-day Exchequer needs after the end of the programme period, there was an Irish Government bond falling due for repayment in mid-January 2014 in an amount of some &euro;12 billion, which we would have to demonstrate to the market was \"money good\".  Irish sovereign euro denominated bond yields hit record highs in July 2011 with the yield on the two-year bond reaching 22% and that of the benchmark bond hitting 14%, implying huge falls in the market values of those bonds.<\/p><p>The spiking of Irish bond yields well into double-digit figures, more or less coincided with Moody's downgrading Ireland to sub-investment grade, which meant that part of Ireland's long-standing investor base was no longer open to us.  We therefore embarked in mid-2011 on a vigorous programme of engagement with over 200 existing and potential institutional investors in Ireland, the UK, the rest of Europe, the US and the Far East.  The investor relations programme yielded relatively early results when, in 2012, we raised &euro;5.2 billion on the market in long-term debt, regained regular access to the short-term markets and succeeded in reducing the outstandings on the January 2014 bond to &euro;7.6 billion.  A hugely supportive development in 2012 was the statement by the President of the ECB that the ECB was prepared to do whatever it takes to save the euro.<\/p><p> 2013: there were two further supportive developments in 2013.  These were the commitment by the EFSF and the EFSM to extend the maturities on their programme loans and the replacement, on the liquidation of IBRC, of the promissory notes provided to IBRC with long-dated floating rate sovereign bonds carrying maturities of up to 40 years.  The combined effects of these two initiatives was to reduce by &euro;40 billion the amount that otherwise would have to be refinanced over the next ten years and to extend the average maturity on Ireland's public debt from seven and a half to 12 and a half years.  The NTMA raised &euro;7.5 billion in long-term debt in 2013 and reduced the outstandings on the mid-January 2014 bond to &euro;2.7 billion.  The Exchequer ended 2013 with sufficient cash and other short-term investments to cover 12 to 15 months' financing needs, facilitating the exit from the programme.<\/p><p> Conclusion: I believe that the NTMA responded positively to the expectation of the Minister of Finance that we work closely with him and his Department in seeking a resolution of the banking crisis.  Our involvements brought us into areas which were well outside what were our core functions.  The crisis was domestically generated but the complexity of its resolution was added to by the global banking crisis, which had seen the collapse or rescue of household names and the major dislocation of international bank markets.  The apparent absence of crisis management skills in the ECB - in contrast with the IMF - was, I believe, also a complicating factor.  Ultimately, in Ireland's case the crisis resulted in, among other things, capital markets being closed to us.  Forming judgments and making decisions to try to come to grips with the crisis was obviously complicated by a lack of reliable information in a hugely volatile environment.  Decision making in such circumstances can seem like trying to catch a falling knife.  So, for example, it was only on the third attempt and with the benefit of knowing what the NAMA discounts or haircuts were likely to be that the banks were adequately capitalised.  I trust, Chairman, that the committee will find my statement helpful.

And the rolled-up interest was part of the loan conditions made to certain debtors.  And, by definition, with the interest being rolled up, the loans couldn't be in default because there was no interest payable.  But what we found interesting, and again as a non-accountant I found extraordinary, was that the banks were accruing as income the interest in those rolled-up arrangements.  So I remember when we did our due diligence on AIB, we asked them about the extent of the rolled-up interest because with the collapse in the property prices, it was obvious to us that rolled-up interest probably would never be collected, and yet for prior years those rolled-up interests had been treated as income and would have been reflected in the profits of the banks who clearly ... which clearly, therefore, with the benefit of hindsight, would presumably have been overstated.

First, there is the nominal GDP growth rate, second, there is the average cost of funding the stock of that and, thirdly, there is the primary surplus that you have to run in order to sustain the debt.  The growth rate ... there was a lot of uncertainty attaching to the growth rate if you back to 2011.  We had come through the horrors and if, for example, you took the growth rate projected for Ireland by the ECB, you were looking at debt to GDP ratio rising to 160% according to our internal simulations.  So the situation was far from clear and, indeed, one of the issues which I didn't mention in my submission was that the reduction in the interest rates by the external authorities was an important factor in actually bringing about the sustainability of the debt.  That, coupled with the extension of the maturities.

As requested by the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis, I am providing this witness statement in my capacity as CEO of the Irish Banking Federation, the Federation of International Banks in Ireland, a position I held from January 2004 to June 2013.  I'm endeavouring to address the broad themes which the joint committee has requested of me in my capacity as CEO of IBF for the period - the relevant period - to the extent possible in this capacity.<\/p> <p>  By way of background, IBF was established in 1973 on Ireland's accession to the European Economic Community to represent the Irish banking sector internationally as well as domestically.  FIBI was formed following the establishment of the International Financial Services Centre so as to provide a particular focus for the needs of international banks.<\/p> <p>  My own appointment as CEO of IBF commenced shortly after the establishment of the Irish Financial Services Authority.  My responsibility was to assist the council of the IBF in formulating strategy for the IBF and implementing that strategy.  The council of the IBF typically consisted of either the group CEO or the head of the Irish retail banking division of the main Irish banks, domestically-focused international banks and the CEO-country managers of several of the internationally-owned, internationally-focused banks.  I represented the sector at European level as a member of the executive committee of the European Banking Federation and I also represented the sector through membership of a number of relevant Irish industry and State-sponsored bodies.  I also represented the sector for certain engagements with the media and in engagements with the State and with public representatives.  Such engagement took place when common themes existed for the IBF&rsquo;s membership, which themes had been endorsed by the council of the IBF.<\/p> <p>  My tenure covered two quite distinct, separate phases.  The first phase was the period 2004 to 2008 which saw a significant increase in the number of financial services companies and banks operating in the domestic Irish consumer banking markets, culminating in, for example, over 13 providers of mortgages.  This was a period of rapid but, as subsequently proved, unsustainable economic growth, with overseas banks entering the market - either directly or through acquisition - and with the established banks seeking to grow their business and\/or responding to this wave of intense competition.  At the same time, there was also considerable growth in the number of banks establishing internationally-focused activities to operate from Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The second phase involved the aftermath of the international and domestic banking crisis from mid-2008.  The impact of this crisis and its aftermath on the stakeholders of the IBF&rsquo;s member banks, including their customers, shareholders, staff and the taxpayers of their home countries - including, of course, Ireland - is well documented.  The aftermath included some of the following outcomes - retrenchment, insolvency, restructuring, nationalisation and exit for a significant number of banks operating in or from Ireland.  In some cases, this reflected the fact that entire banking groups' business model and activities were fatally or fundamentally flawed or a recognition that the business models for their Irish activities were either flawed or could not be maintained as they sought to preserve capital, liquidity and reduce costs.  The designs of the group business models for these banks and of the business models for the Irish activities of these banks had a number of different features and they responded in a number of different ways to the challenges these business models faced.  However, common business model flaws were: under-capitalisation; over dependence on wholesale funding; aggressive pricing; and loosening of credit standards coming into the crisis, followed subsequently by rapid retrenchment to core - often home country franchises - post the crisis.  The burdens on the Irish taxpayers and on the shareholders of the domestic Irish banks from the flaws in their business models has been the subject of a wide range of reports and investigations, including this inquiry.<\/p> <p>  Noteworthy has also been the in excess of approximately &euro;50 billion which has been borne by the shareholders-home taxpayers of overseas banks, who had to recapitalise their subsidiaries competing in the domestic Irish market, and\/or losses they actually incurred as they retrenched from the Irish market.  This retrenchment-exit also caused significant difficulties for Irish consumers as they sought to make alternative banking arrangements away from the products-product providers which proved to have been unsustainable and\/or customers finding that their loans-mortgages had been sold to entities where the customer had no choice in the matter.  I should also say that, as a member of the executive committee of EBF, I witnessed similar pre and post-crisis features across the banking industry to differing degrees of severity.  Given the role of IBF as described above, we were not privy to, and did not have a role in adjudicating on, the funding or liquidity policies, the risk management models or the composition, skills and experience of the boards of individual banks.<\/p> <p>  My term as CEO of IBF commenced shortly after the formation of IFSRA, as I've said, and I noted early on that the consumer director sat on IFSRA's board whilst the prudential regulator did not.  In the period up to September 2008, the primary interaction I had with IFSRA was on consumer-orientated regulatory matters and initiatives and this was the focus of the agreed strategy of interaction agreed with me by the council of the IBF for the domestic banks.  For example, during my tenure the IBF had the responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of a range of consumer focused initiatives such as the Dormant Accounts Act, interbank switching codes, IBF-money advice bureau - known as MABS - debt protocol, promotion of electronic payments, consumer protection codes and the establishment of the Social Finance Foundation.  For the international banks, there was considerable focus on taxation-related issues and skill shortages in the Irish market.  I sought on several occasions to have broader dialogue with the Central Bank on general banking issues but was given the clear message that IFSRA was the primary conduit for engagement.  There was also a focus for the IBF on engagement, through the EBF, with the European integration agenda in terms of payments, consumer protection and other initiatives to complete the EU Single Market in financial services.  From time to time, we also submitted technical papers prepared by members in response to regulatory consultations both locally and at EU level.  To my recollection, business model discussions and general issues of prudential regulation in areas such as capital, liquidity or credit standards were not a notable feature of agenda discussions within the IBF or between IBF and regulatory or other authorities.<\/p> <p>  As CEO of late ... of IBF, I was, in late 2004, appointed by the Minister for Finance as a member of the financial services consultative industry panel, which was in existence up to June 2010.  The role and mandate of the panel was to act in an advisory capacity to the newly-established Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.  Its role was similar to panels operating in other jurisdictions, such as the practitioners panel which operates in the UK under the aegis of the Financial Conduct Authority.  The panel published five annual reports covering the period 2005 to 2009, inclusive, the broad themes of which were as follows: a critical focus on the balance struck between the prioritisation and allocation of resources to the conduct of business - i.e. consumer - and the prudential regulation roles of IFSRA; a request that the regulator deepened its understanding of individual firms' business models given the diversity and complexity of regulated firms operating in Ireland; consideration be given to having a designated senior executive focused on IFSC supervision; with reference to EU legislative and regulatory agendas, it proposed the appointment of a dedicated senior executive with responsibility for co-ordination of the Irish engagement and response; it proposed reviews of competition barriers in retail banking; we called for extensions of provisions of consumer codes to non-deposit-taking entities then operating as mortgage lenders; and sought the application of regulatory impact assessments to major regulatory and legislative initiatives; called for investment in HR and IT support services and review of the associated shared services model which then in place between the Central Bank and IFSRA; we commented on proposed industry levies and methods of allocation and general commentary on IFSRA's annual budgeting process; and the promotion of benchmarking against best practice regulation in comparable jurisdictions.<\/p><p> In the interests of time, Chairman, I'm going to summarise the verbatim piece from the report.  But the panel in its final annual report of 2009 noted that the panel was to ensure a meaningful participation in the debate around the reform then under way of the regulatory structure.  We published a paper in that regard, and it was acknowledged subsequently as a significant contribution to that debate, and that culminated in the Central Bank Reform Bill of 2010.  And among the things that we had stressed and that we found reassuring in the actual publication of the Bill, was that the single most important ingredient required for successful reform was the quality of the people.  There was a very good beginning made with the appointment of Central Bank Governor, Patrick Honohan, and Financial Regulator, Matthew Elderfield.  The regulator's strategy was proposed to the ... or presented to the panel prior to its public announcement and we noted very positively the fact that a lot of the recommendations we had made previously in relation to the critical importance of an appropriate skills mix in the regulator, an understanding that the regime should be risk based and not &ldquo;one-size-fits-all&rdquo;, and the importance of a strategic policy unit was all broadly contained within the strategy, so we were very pleased about that.  <\/p><p> As the crisis unfolded during the second half of 2008 the various members of the IBF became increasingly focused on their own specific issues and it became apparent that for some of the subsidiaries of international banks the key decisions were being taken outside of Ireland.  The members of the IBF had different senses of priorities, were reluctant to show their hands, for obvious reasons, and had differing degrees of mandates to articulate to the IBF as to what they wanted the IBF&rsquo;s mandate to be in engaging with relevant authorities and regulators on solvency and liquidity issues.  Engagement with the Central Bank, IFSRA and the State during this time tended to be focused on issues such as bank support mechanisms for customers, including those in mortgage arrears, and IBF obligations arising from the introduction of the credit institutions scheme.  <\/p><p> Prior to 29 September 2008, IBF had no mandate from the IBF council to discuss specific Government liquidity or solvency support initiatives for the sector with the authorities and was not a party to considerations by the authorities on such matters.  During 2009, and particularly after the arrival of Professor Honohan as Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland and Matthew Elderfield as regulator, there was increased evidence of cross-stakeholder working groups involving the Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland, where IBF was a participant on sector wide issues such as mortgage arrears, codes of practice were ... where codes of practice, etc., were developed and enhanced, and I witnessed a high degree of co-operation and interaction.<\/p><p> With regard to the troika, we were used by the troika as a source of information, particularly during 2011 and 2012, and views were solicited on a range of themes including: competition-related matters and issues; sectoral initiatives and progress on mortgage arrears resolution.  We had a number of discussions regarding judicial process, legislative and regulatory impediments we believed were exacerbating the problem and presenting barriers to resolution, and our views regarding proposed reform of the bankruptcy regime and the introduction of a personal insolvency framework.  We also discussed access to credit for SMEs and support for firms with a sustainable business who were experiencing financial difficulties.  All such interactions with the troika were either done in conjunction with the Irish authorities, or the details of the engagement were shared with the Irish authorities.  <\/p><p> That concludes my statement.

There's a number of parts to that question so maybe I might just provide a bit of context first of all.  The Asset Covered Securities Act was introduced in 2001, well before my time as CEO of IBF.  It enabled the sector here to provide covered bonds as a method of funding, principally for the mortgage market.  This is a system that had been in place in Germany for over ... a couple hundred years, same in Denmark, same in France, so what we were doing was merely coming into line with what was a very accepted funding instrument internationally.  The Act of 2007 was an amendment to the original Act of 2001; it was an amendment.  The reason for the amendment of the Act was triggered by the pending introduction of the capital requirements directive, otherwise known as Basel II.  That was the EU's method of giving effect to Basel II.  And, because this concerned capital, it cut across almost all elements of the Asset Covered Securities Act and these instruments.  So, in order for the covered bonds legislation and the instruments to remain compliant, and to remain relevant and to be able to continue to be transacted, there had to be amendments made to the Act in order to align it with the capital requirements directive.  So, that was the principal purpose of the amendments.  It says in the note, and I have it in front of me, that it says we drafted the legislation.  I would feel, and I, you know ... the note is what it is.  We did not draft legislation.  What we would have done was said, in order for the Act to align with the capital requirements directive, these are the areas we believe will require amendment.  At the end of the day - and you will know this as legislators - parliamentary draftsmen, ultimately, frame legislation, Attorney General's office will have significant input and eventual sign-off, and, ultimately, it will go before a committee, and, ultimately, it will be placed before the House.  So, that was the context and that was the actual background to it.  Could I just say, as well, that, you know, it was fairly complex legislation and that may well again explain the rationale for having a third party, because I know, myself, the Department of Finance itself retains external legal advisers from time to time to advise them and support in looking at legislative issues and drafting of legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015071500002#FF01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1436914800,"counter":388,"content":"<p>In your time, the first part of my question was ...

They felt that they were being placed at a disadvantage so they ventilated their concerns to me quite robustly.  Then there were the two banks, Depfa  and WestLB I think, if I recall them correctly, in the IFSC who had been availing of and using the covered bonds programme that I mentioned, which had its origins in the 2001 Act.  They had been using that programme to issue bonds, finance and public sector assets, for quite some time and they were outside of it.  Then there was the added complication that Depfa, and this is well chronicled in the public realm, was for a short period of time seen as an orphan in regulatory terms because it wasn't clear whether it fell within the ambit of the regulatory authorities here or Germany, although I think with the benefit of hindsight it was very clear that it fell within the German responsibility because it had been acquired by a German bank some time previously.

This is my understanding, open to correction: there was an amendment in the updated legislation which included the ability for commercial mortgage to be collateralised and then be issued on the back of a covered bond.  First of all, a covered bond is a very highly rated instrument.  It has huge legal protections in it and it's retained on balance sheet, unlike a securitisation which is off balance sheet.  So a covered bond is a very good instrument.  There's nothing wrong with it.  It's a very, very good instrument for funding.  Let that be on the record.<\/p> <p>  They asked for the inclusion of commercial mortgages and I think there might have been a general interest more broadly than that.  The fact was, across all competing jurisdictions, peer jurisdictions, the ability to include commercial mortgages in covered bonds, where there were covered bonds legislation was already the norm, so we were just, literally, coming into line.  That was legislation of 2007.<\/p> <p>  The statutory instrument which gave effect to the element that allowed commercial mortgages to be collateralised was placed before this House, I understand, and I'm subject to correction, in mid-2008.  At that stage, as we know, events had overtaken us and, again subject to correction, but my understanding is that Anglo - you named the institution - didn't do a transaction under that particular mechanism.  I'd also like it to be recorded that, using the covered bonds legislation, it became a vitally important instrument for all of the banks operating here, because it became an acceptable method of collateral to post at the ECB window for liquidity purposes.  And we all know how important that actually became because the ECB had certain criteria for liquidity and one of the types of the liquidity they were prepared to accepted ... or collateral they're prepared to accept at their window for liquidity purposes were covered bonds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015071500002#KK01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1436914800,"counter":561,"content":"<p>Okay.

One of the objectives of the inquiry is to arrive at the understanding at the logic and rationale that underpinned the Irish banking business model.  The people who designed the system, who regulated the system and who lobbied for changes to the system were all intelligent and rational people.

It's also heavily legislated for and then there's all the governances that flow from the fact that it's an internationally-traded service.  I'm not best placed to determine how banking got to the level of opacity and complexity that it did.  The fact is, it did.  I made that statement in Kenmare.  I acknowledge it and, you know, since then the changes that have been undertaken in regulatory frameworks have, to some degree, tried to reduce some of that opacity and simplify it like, for example, the ring-fencing of investment banks from retail banks.  And actually that is probably one that speaks to your question which is that investment banking ... banks developed into situations where they became conglomerates, where they were investment banks and retail banks and, of course, investment banks are notoriously complicated instruments and they are quite a degree of opacity as we learnt through the crisis.

I'll just refer to a particular quote on that and then if I can move on from it.  You said prior to 29 September 2008, the IBF had no mandate from the IBF council to discuss specific Government liquidity solvency support initiatives for this sector with the authorities, and was not a party to considerations by the authorities on such matters.  Now, the note here ... I just want to refer to that, so in that regard ...however in July 2007 the IBF did participate in a liquidity funding workshop, this was attended by the IBF representatives of the major banks, and a representative of CBFSAI Central Bank Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  The summary note of which was sent to Department of Finance, which I think we have here.

And I haven't seen this before, but to the best of my recollection ... first of all I'm not ... to the best of my recollection I don't think I was at the meeting.  I'm, I may ... again I think it would have probably been handled by our prudential director because it would have fallen into that area.<\/p> <p>  I think the background to it was that at that time, and I did advert to it earlier, there was continuing tensions in liquidity terms across global markets.  And at that stage I think some time in 2007 ... around that time ... the Central Bank introduced a new liquidity regime for all the banks.  And they required a whole new reporting arrangement with the banks for liquidity.  They asked them effectively to put their liquidity requirements as they matured out into different time buckets on a cash flow basis, so that they would have a much clearer line of sight as to what the liquidity requirements of each of the banks were going forward.  And that was understandable, given the heightened situation that existed in liquidity markets generally.  And, my understanding, that meeting would have been one where the banks would have come together collectively to understand ... or to use that form to understand what exactly the nature of the requirements would be and report in terms, tease out any questions they might have, the detail of it, and such like.

What changes did I make?  I go back again to the situation that from the very outset the whole environment, the discourse, the context for everything that happened in regulation was heavily weighted towards consumer conduct of business rules.  In fact, when I think about all of my engagements with Oireachtas committees, I'd say 90% - up to the crisis - were all about consumer conduct of business-related rules.  There was very little, if any, discussion about prudential matters.  So there was a consensus around that the area that the focus was going to be, from a public interest point of view and from the regulator's point of view was consumer, consumer, consumer.  That, kind of, led.  So, as us ... as a representative body having to face off against regulatory authorities and so on in terms of representing members' interests, the majority of our skill sets and the people that we employed were in that space of consumer conduct of business.  And even some of the things we did which we're, you know, probably associated with - like the switching codes, consumer protection codes, the debt relief protocol with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service - they are all testament to the fact that a lot of our output was in that whole space.<br\/><br\/>Post the crisis I was challenged, my team were challenged, to adopt to the change in environment, so we had to re-skill the team that we had.

I think that, without misrepresenting them, I think they all pretty well said that that did not become a barrier to good regulation.  They also ... I think again, it has been said here that we work within an EU-wide framework of regulation so it had to be applied without fear or favour regardless whether it was international or domestic bank.

But the interpretation of principles-based regulation may or may not have been applied in the appropriate way that they may have been in other jurisdictions, given the level of indebtedness and the impact of the financial crash in this country.

It had sectoral concentration limits which were, in their own words, \"in abeyance\"; it had the ability to raise capital limits for certain types of lending; it had the ability to rely on a compliance statement under company law, which was never actually called in; it had the ability to apply sanctions to the administrative sanctions regime for prudential matters, but it only ever applied them in the case of consumer.

I'm sorry there was political momentum and there was momentum within the banks themselves to retrench to their home markets.  In other words, let's stick to the knitting, let's look after the core markets and the customers of those core markets, which meant that a lot of subsidiary activity, IFSC, tended to run down or be closed.  I would say, and I think it's important to say it, like, the IFSC is not an abstract, kind of, concept.  As we speak, like, the IFSC employs about 35,000 people, generates about &euro;2 billion in corporate and payroll taxes, and, just by way of putting that in context, it's the equivalent of the vote for 2015 for the Department of Agriculture, Marine and Food, and for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.

I think where the thing ... I think where it finished up was and I think there is correspondence to this effect and I think it may have been referred to as well in the evidence that's been given thus far by some of the Finance people, was that the Department decided not to proceed with the compliance statements specifically to financial institutions because it was forming the view that there was adequate reliance could be placed on the provision of the compliance statement of the Companies Act and it also directly and pointedly, I think, communicated at the time to the Financial Regulator, that they did have this power, they did have this provision and they could rely on it if they required a compliance statement.

The scale and impact of events which are the subject of this inquiry are such that the work of this committee constitutes an important public service.  I wish to support fully the committee in its work by answering your questions and by furnishing, as I have, a statement regarding 15 lines of inquiry before the committee.  I will seek in my answers this evening to assist the committee as much as I can, as I sought to do in my statement, by setting out matters within my direct knowledge as Secretary General to the Government within the constraints of Cabinet confidentiality and acknowledging that many were matters in respect of which I didn't have expertise or responsibility.  I will summarise my statement under six headings.  In my statement, I indicated that I believed the conclusions of the Nyberg commission of investigation provided a broadly convincing account of the circumstances that led to the crisis.  Nyberg describes serious failings by a wide range of actors, including a number of key elements of the public service.  He notes that, ''Each one is [...] responsible for their own actions and inactions contributing to the accumulation and realisation of risks in financial markets''.<\/p><p>Everyone who was in a senior position in the public service over the relevant period, including myself, is burdened by these failings, and the deep awareness of their human consequences.  With the knowledge and analysis of that period which is now available, like others I am challenged by the question of whether I could have done more to avert the damaging outcomes from the crisis.  My regret is tempered only by the belief that I have performed my duties to the best of my ability.<\/p><p> On the regulatory regime, following consideration of the report of an implementation group, the Government approved a proposal to establish a single Financial Regulator within a restructured Central Bank.  The proposed arrangements were altered following consultation with the ECB.  The Government reviewed the provision for a separate board structure for the Financial Regulator as an important focus for accountability and responsiveness to public and consumer concerns.  Following publication of the proposed legislation in 2002, further comments were received from the ECB, as a result of which the Governor's role in relation to the budget and staffing of the regulator was strengthened.  The ECB also welcomed the fact that the Financial Regulator would remain a constituent part of the Central Bank.<\/p><p> The annual reports of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator were submitted for information to the Government.  These recorded the significant number of inspections of financial institutions carried out, and regulatory returns examined.  The report in respect of 2006 highlighted that international independent reviews of the Financial Regulator's performance contain positive assessments of the regulatory system in Ireland.  In its report of 2007, the IMF supported as appropriate the risk-based framework operated by the Financial Regulator in prioritising supervisory resources.  The Government decided in 2009 to create a new, integrated regulatory system under the direction of the Governor.  The Government was advised that, pending the enactment of new legislation, the boards of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator had made changes to the operation of the existing legislative framework through improved linkages between banking supervision and financial stability.<\/p><p> On fiscal policy, the budgetary cycle involved the Minister for Finance setting out the broad economic framework within which budgetary decisions should be shaped.  This provided a context for the engagement by the Department of Finance with individual Departments to settle their spending Estimates.  The Department of Finance's proposals were based on securing financial stability and the productive capacity of the economy, while avoiding inflationary pressures and addressing priority needs.  The Department pointed out the potential for reverses, both domestic and international, associated with declining competitiveness, exchange rate movements, increases in commodity prices and the possibility of a downturn in construction activity.  The Department recommended the maintenance of a cyclically-adjusted positive general Government balance and containing the growth in current expenditure to the nominal rate of economic growth.  From 2003 to 2006, the stability programme reports presented to the Government identified a gradual and orderly reduction in housing output to a more sustainable level as a significant factor likely to impact on economic performance, partially offset by growth in other components of investment expenditure.  In the report for 2006, the potential for economy-wide consequences of construction-specific developments, such as rising interest rates, was noted.  The moderation in prices and activity in the property market in 2007 was highlighted.  The absence of a sense of impending crisis was reflected by an assessment by the IMF in 2007, which noted that the banking system was well-capitalised and profitable and that stress tests by the Central Bank indicated that even in an extreme scenario, the major lenders had adequate buffers to cover a range of shocks.  Economic policy was not formulated by Government in the belief that there was a serious risk to financial sector stability.<\/p><p> The framing of budgetary proposals in Government discussions had regard to the terms of the relevant programme for Government and specific objectives adopted by the Government.  The substantial reduction in the debt-to-GNP ratio, substantial budget surpluses, significant annual transfers to the National Pensions Reserve Fund and an ambitious programme of investment in infrastructure to increase productive capacity, with little or no recourse to borrowing, created a sense of confidence with regard to fiscal matters.  There wasn't a single view about the conduct of policy or the outlook for the economy.  There was of course awareness of contrarian views occasionally expressed in the media regarding the risks of an economic collapse.  It was widely considered that this was improbable, while vulnerabilities were nonetheless acknowledged to exist.<\/p><p> Most decision-making requires judging the probabilities of events occurring while striking a balance between competing objectives in the context of Government policy.<\/p><p>Collective responsibility requires members of the Government to support decisions once taken.  The legitimate exercise of its democratic authority by the Government must be respected by officials.  For example, the Department of Finance in its budgetary submissions signalled a preference for a lower rate of expenditure increase than occurred in a number of years.  In the years leading up to the crisis the direction of Government policy was not significantly altered in the light of parliamentary scrutiny.<\/p><p> On banking matters, the primary relationship between the banking sector and the Government was through the Minister for Finance and the Department.  The banking industry was represented by the Irish Bankers Federation and Financial Services Ireland on general policy matters such as the development of the national payment system.  From the establishment of the IFSC, the Department of the Taoiseach chaired the Clearing House Group whose members included representatives from the Departments of Finance and Enterprise and Employment, the Revenue Commissioners, the Financial Regulator, the IDA and, later, Enterprise Ireland.<\/p><p> The Clearing House Group and a range of associated working groups provided a forum for exchange of information and suggestions between different categories of participant in the sector.  As its name implies, the group was primarily a vehicle for commercial intelligence gathering in the context of the competition between jurisdictions for investment.  The focus of the group was the identification of opportunities and a variety of specialist activities, the marketing of Ireland and the tackling of barriers to growth, such as availability of skilled personnel.  The operation of a credible regulatory system was seen as critically important in securing the reputation of the industry and attracting appropriate new entrants.  Discussion at the Clearing House Group covered a broad range of public policy.  Concerns voiced at times about proposals which were seen as disproportionate, by reference to international practice, were pursued bilaterally with the relevant agency.  In published strategies for the future of the sector, industry representatives expressed their support for a regulatory system which was effective, consistent and efficient.<\/p><p> Turning to the bank guarantee, in the period leading up to 29 September 2008 the Government was briefed on liquidity difficulties in the Irish banking system by the Minister for Finance and increased the deposit guarantee to &euro;100,000 on 20 September.  On the evening of Monday, 29 September a meeting attended by the Taoiseach, Minister for Finance and the Attorney General was advised that, unless measures were taken before the financial markets opened on Tuesday morning, irreversible damage could be done to the economy through a banking collapse.  The expectation that no Government would allow a bank to fail, especially in the aftermath of the Lehmans example, was reinforced by the potential consequences outlined to the meeting.  It was made clear that no European or ECB initiative was in prospect which would address the immediate crisis faced by Ireland.  The advice was that the Government had one opportunity to make a decisive intervention, to stabilise liquidity and secure the Irish banking system.  It would have no certainty of success but the alternative was certain disaster.<\/p><p> A request to meet from the chairs and chief executives of AIB and Bank of Ireland was agreed.  The banks' representatives confirmed the gravity of the funding situation for the Irish banks, with difficulty in getting even short-term funding from the money markets.  The negative sentiment towards Ireland was focused on particular institutions, but all were now impacted.  They argued that effective action was necessary to reassure the markets.  The Taoiseach and the Minister resolved that a broad guarantee would be recommended to the Government.  The option of nationalisation of Anglo was considered, but it was concluded that such action could have more negative than positive effects on market confidence.  It was also understood that a decision to nationalise Anglo could be taken at a later date, should it be appropriate.<\/p><p> The guarantee would be offered on commercial terms and would provide a framework for any measures required to build market confidence in the Irish banking system.  The approval of the Government was given by an incorporeal meeting which was conducted in the early hours of Tuesday, 30 September.  A particular concern was that the guarantee might be challenged on European state aid grounds.  It was agreed that a formal notification to the European Commission would be made immediately.  A full supporting case, including all of the material considered in the discussion, would be detailed in a submission at the earliest opportunity.  The European Commission subsequently approved the decision as an appropriate means to remedy a serious disturbance in the Irish economy.<\/p><p> On the programme of assistance, in response to international concerns by mid-2010 about the State's financial position, the Government began the preparation of a medium-term expenditure framework in tandem with the fiscal responsibility framework.<\/p><p>It was considered that public confirmations for a recovery plan of the adoption of a comprehensive programme of fiscal reforms and specific measures to achieve the necessary deficit reduction by 2014 would improve market sentiment towards Ireland.  The continuing dependence of the Irish banks on ECB liquidity support was evident, as was a market view that further recapitalisation would be necessary.  The ECB Council conveyed to the Minister for Finance that the Government should apply for European financial support.  Department of Finance officials travelled to Brussels for exploratory discussions on the parameters of a possible programme of assistance if the Government were to decide to apply.  The tentative nature of these discussions reflected the Government's concern that the conditionality of any such programme could include unacceptable terms such as changes to the Irish corporation tax regime.  On 19 November the President of the ECB wrote to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Finance stating that ELA could only be continued if Ireland applied to the Eurogroup for financial support and proceeded with a decisive restructuring and adequate recapitalisation of the Irish banks.  The Minister, in consultation with the Governor and the CEO of the NTMA, sought the approval of the Government for a formal request for external assistance, given that the Government could not borrow in the market at current rates and the serious liquidity problems in the Irish banks.  Some days later, the national recovery plan was published by the Government - the programme of external assistance was formally announced on 28 November.  Imposing haircuts on unguaranteed senior bondholders was raised with the international institutions during discussions on the programme of assistance.  The concept was strongly resisted because of their concern about its potential impact on wider financial stability.  In March 2011 the agreement of the ECB was sought but declined for the announcement by the Government of a statement of intent to impose burden-sharing on unguaranteed senior bondholders in Irish banking institutions in wind-down.<\/p><p> On changes since the crisis, with regard to the conduct of economic policy the establishment of the Fiscal Advisory Council and the oversight by the European institutions as part of the European semester have brought a greater transparency to Irish fiscal policy.  Policy analysis is supported by greater economic expertise within the public service.  The national risk assessment framework is a positive development and the legislation to provide for the registration of lobbyists and lobbying activity should also assist in the monitoring of efforts to influence public policy.  It is clear, however, that irrespective of any structural or capacity developments that may be implemented, Governments will still be faced with a need to exercise judgment in setting fiscal policy and in assessing the risk to be taken into account in framing budgetary decisions.  That concludes my opening statement Chairman and I am happy to answer the committee's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015071500002#NNN00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436914800,"counter":773,"content":"<p>Thank you very much Mr. McCarthy.

I believe that Ms Justice Ring will be an excellent chairperson of GSOC.  The Government is proposing Ms Ring to fill the vacancy of chairperson of the ombudsman commission arising from the resignation of the previous Chairman, Mr. Simon O&rsquo;Brien, at the end of January.  Mr. O'Brien resigned to take up an appointment as chief executive of the Pensions Ombudsman Service in the UK.  He had been appointed chairperson of GSOC with effect from 13 December 2011, together with Ms Carmel Foley and Mr. Kieran FitzGerald, as members for a period of five years.<\/p> <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission was set up under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, to provide a system for receiving complaints and dealing with allegations of misconduct by garda&iacute;.  The ombudsman is required to carry out its investigations in a manner that is efficient, effective and fair to all concerned and to promote public confidence in the process for resolving these complaints.  Independence is the cornerstone of GSOC&rsquo;s existence and is statutorily guaranteed.  Consequently, its investigators are given similar powers to those given to Garda members, including the power to arrest, detain and question.  In addition to investigating complaints against Garda members, GSOC may also initiate investigations in the public interest, including in situations where no complaints have been made.<\/p> <p>  I recently laid the GSOC annual report for 2014 before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The year 2014 was a particularly challenging year for GSOC in which it was the subject of much political and media commentary and some controversy.  Notwithstanding these pressures, 2014 was also a busy year for GSOC.  The annual report states that GSOC received 11% more complaints in 2014 over 2013 and concluded 8% more cases in 2014, compared with 2013.  I have discussed on previous occasions with the Opposition spokespersons the question of the co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC.  I was particularly pleased to note that there was a marked improvement in efficiency, in dialogue and co-operation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This would suggest that the revised 2013 protocols between GSOC and the Garda Commissioner are working.  While there may be room for further improvements in the turnaround of investigations, I have every confidence that this is now a shared objective of both organisations.  The powers of GSOC have been reformed and further reforms are included in the Policing Authority Bill.  Section 65 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, provides that appointments to the ombudsman commission are made by the President on the nomination of the Government and the passage of resolutions by D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann recommending the appointments.  The section also states that a judge of the High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court, may be appointed as chairperson.  The section further provides that where a judge is appointed to this role, he or she will not be required to carry out his or her judicial functions while chairperson of the commission.<\/p> <p>  The Government, at its meeting of 30 June, 2015, decided to nominate Judge Mary Ellen Ring to be chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission following her nomination for appointment to the High Court.  Ms Justice Ring was appointed a judge of the High Court by the President on Thursday, 9 July 2015.  Her swearing-in ceremony before the Supreme Court took place on Monday, 13 July 2015.  Ms Justice Ring has extensive experience as a practising barrister and as a judge of the Circuit Court which experience makes her very well qualified for the position of chairperson of the ombudsman commission.  She has also served in positions on the National Crime Council between 1999 and 2005 and as chair of the Irish Women Lawyers Association in 2008.  She has been a member of the Irish Penal Reform Trust and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  I reiterate that I believe she will make an excellent chairperson of GSOC and I have no hesitation in recommending her accordingly.  Ms Justice Ring will work alongside the other members of the commission, Ms Carmel Foley and Mr Kieran Fitzgerald.  I believe that the combination of the skills and experience of the three commissioners will provide the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission with strong and effective leadership. <\/p> <p>  Society looks to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the guardians of the peace, to create and maintain an environment where people can go about their daily lives free from threats of criminality.  Where such criminality arises, we look to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate and bring the perpetrators to justice.  This is an onerous task and to carry it out, citizens give powers to the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which are in some cases extensive powers, to carry out those tasks, including powers of arrest and detention.  However, these powers, although used in challenging and often dangerous circumstances, must be exercised in a lawful and proportionate manner.  Where there is a question about whether members have used those powers properly, they must be held to account.  Therefore, it is vital that we fully address allegations of Garda misconduct or wrongdoing in the interest of maintaining public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in protecting the professional standing of the overwhelming majority of dedicated and conscientious members of the force.  It is equally important that the public need to have confidence in the system of oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is the fundamental challenge for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission which is a vital part of our policing infrastructure.  It must secure and maintain the trust and confidence of the public and of the force.  To do this it needs to be led by a team of skilled and competent commissioners.  I believe that Ms Justice Ring will bring the appropriate level of leadership and skill and, together with her fellow commissioners, will ensure that the ombudsman commission will carry out its work effectively.  On behalf of the Government I recommend Ms Justice Ring for appointment as chairperson of GSOC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015071500002#B00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1436965200,"counter":1438,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and her team to the meeting.

One of the issues I have been pursuing with both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC, is whether a mechanism could be developed - which both sides would like to see - but we have not come up with a mechanism yet.  Every complaint is serious but I have raised with the representative associations a proposal for a more informal resolution process of some of the less serious complaints.  I think it is recognised both nationally and internationally, that some complaints will turn into formal complaints that could be dealt with in a more procedural way at an earlier stage.  We do not have that process in place.  There has been some discussion with both sides as to how it might be developed.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na point of view is that it is very keen to preserve the integrity of the process and that members will not be asked to resolve something informally where there might be a question of the garda's behaviour.  They would not wish an informal process to cast doubt on the integrity of a garda or his or her behaviour.  GSOC is very keen to have this process as the commission believes it would be a much more efficient and effective way of managing complaints.  This remains under discussion.  In reply to Deputy McGrath, it is a good sign that the public is aware that GSOC exists.<\/p><p>Equally, there might be quite a number of complaints that would be capable of perhaps more informal resolution.

It follows a tough and analytical procedure in which people and events are investigated.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, many garda&iacute; will raise with me how time-consuming these complaints can be.

I want to express my thanks to the outgoing GSOC chairperson, Mr. Simon O&rsquo;Brien.  We always read that GSOC is fraught with difficulties.  It is an organisation that has a difficult task.  In fairness, if there were not working tensions between it and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there would be something wrong.  If one surveyed police oversight agencies across the world, one would find that GSOC is not too dissimilar to some of its counterparts elsewhere.  I suggest that the committee write a note of thanks to Mr. O&rsquo;Brien.<\/p> <p>  I support the appointment of Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring, who will be a positive addition to GSOC.  She has an impressive curriculum vitae, having spent 27 years as a barrister and judge in the Circuit Court, as well as being involved with the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the National Crime Prevention Council, the Irish Penal Reform Trust and many other organisations.  What was the process used to headhunt Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring and what criteria were followed?  I do not have a problem with it, but there is the small anomaly that she was a judge of the Circuit Court and was only appointed to the High Court last week.  This just about qualifies her for the appointment.  Does the process leave itself open to criticism or a challenge because of this?  Has she taken any High Court cases over the past week?  Does she now formally retire as a judge or does she take leave of absence?  She is serving out the remainder of Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s term, which is until December 2016.  Why does she not get her own term of appointment?  What remuneration does she receive?  Does she receive remuneration as chairperson of GSOC or does she also receive a High Court judge&rsquo;s salary?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015071500002#C00400","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1436965200,"counter":1444,"content":"<p>The reply to many of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions is actually what is laid down in the legislation.

This visit had its beginnings in the visit Deputy David Stanton made to the project a number of weeks ago.  He was quite impressed by what he saw and especially by what he heard from the lads whom he met and who spoke freely to him.<\/p> <p>  We work with ex-offenders, ex-prisoners and people on the edges of the criminal justice system.  The men who present to us were, at one stage, small boys who were hurt and had to manage very difficult situations in their home environments and communities.  The journey to where they are now was quite difficult.  When we speak about ex-prisoners and ex-offenders, we conjure up a mental picture of what somebody like that looks like, but, from our experience, that mental picture is not the whole truth.  They started out in their families and with parents just as we started out in ours and their parents had hopes and dreams for their children like we have for ours.  The men in question had links across many Departments and agencies from a very young age and even their mothers and fathers were clients of the Department of Social Protection.  They had an involvement with the HSE and the Department of Justice and Equality and, very early in their lives, were already on the edges of the education system.  In terms of social disadvantage, they are a targeted group.  A lot of transgenerational issues come into play in the lives of these men and we work in a very creative way to address some of these needs and issues.  A core part of our work is to cut across these difficulties.<\/p> <p>  Addiction plays a big part in underpinning mid-range crime.  It is a lonely, isolated and vulnerable place, even though it is not always seen on the outside.  In the work we do we see the underbelly of addiction.  Recovery is very tough, often lonely and very challenging and all of the men in our project are either recovering from addiction or making steps towards recovery.  We, the footsoldiers on the ground, meet the raw reality of their lives.  We look into their eyes and see the results of the difficulties in their lives.  We are in direct contact with their struggle as they try to stay clean, sober up and stay out of trouble in order that they can manage themselves and their families.  Many of them are fathers.<\/p> <p>  We work from a relationship model based on the Servol model piloted in the West Indies and brought to us through the congregations that are our trustees.  We do not try to tell these guys how to be or what to do but support them to be self-reflective and self-determining and seek their own answers.  We try to bring them into contact with their own goodness and potential.  In the future we hope to continue to be resourced to do more of this work in an holistic way.  One of the things we hope for from the meeting is that the committee will support new ways of working in this field.  We believe what we do works really well and that there is a lot of evidence to show this.  There is great potential for the model to be used in other areas because the difficulties we are meeting in Cork city are to be found in all communities across the country.  We have met various challenges along the way and if any member of the committee wishes to ask questions about how we have overcome and met these challenges, we would be more than willing to answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015071500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436965200,"counter":1471,"content":"<p>I will speak about social enterprise at Churchfield Community Trust and about the garden caf&eacute; which is widely regarded as Cork's greenest caf&eacute;.  It is situated on the grounds of Cork Foyer in Blackpool and located in a beautiful Victorian glasshouse which is open to the public Monday to Friday each week, 12 months a year, providing morning coffee, freshly baked scones and home baking.  An exciting lunch menu is on offer daily using the finest seasonal produce sourced from our community allotment and local producers.  It is important to note that this is a non-profit initiative.  The social enterprise came about because of a difficulty in sourcing work experience and employment opportunities when the economic downturn was at its peak.  Funding has been sourced from a number of organisations to which we are grateful, including the statutory and non-statutory funders which are shown on page 9 of the document.  A full detailed breakdown is given on page 10 and a further breakdown is available on request.<\/p> <p>  At first glance, our caf&eacute; aspires to the highest standards of many other restaurants.  However, there is a wider picture which focuses on the promotion of social reintegration through formal and informal training in several contexts.  Participants receive experiential on-site training, while also receiving formal training in electronic point of sale training, food hygiene which is HACCP certified, food preparation, customer service and communication skills and basic bookkeeping skills.  Our staff team comprises a team leader who is employed through the JobsPlus initiative of the Department of Social Protection and two part-time staff members sourced from the local community.  We have one JobBridge intern who has completed her nine-month placement and one part-time jobs incentive scheme staff member working up to 23 hours per week.  A staff member who was formerly participating in a community employment initiative works on a casual basis and we have two community employment scheme special category substance misuse support placements.  We also have one community service placement who works the complete hours in co-operation with us and the Probation Service.<\/p> <p>  The continued development of the garden caf&eacute; initiative is, in no small way, attributable to a partnership approach involving the Churchfield Community Trust, Cork City Council which provides the garden caf&eacute; glasshouse under a licence agreement, the Department of Social Protection initiatives, the Cork City Education and Training Board, local businesses which provide experiential training and other businesses which provide sponsorship for the new website we recently developed.  The continuing success of the initiative can be attributed to the unique community spirit and goodwill in Blackpool which is in the heart of Cork city.  It is essentially about bringing out the best in people and helping them to realise their true potential.<\/p> <p>  I draw the committee's attention to our successful record in terms of progression to further training and employment, including the full-time employment of a team leader, a catering assistant who has now gained employment in a nursing home, a former trainee who is now training as a chef at Cork Institute of Technology and a catering assistant who is now completing a catering course at Cork College of Commerce.<\/p><p>We have facilitated temporary release from Loughan House of somebody who is interested in catering.  We also facilitate work placements on requests.<\/p><p> I would also like to speak about new initiatives.  At our workshop which is based at Churchfield, a range of bespoke early-era furniture and garden products are currently being developed by our workshop manager and team.  The craftsmanship is of an extremely high standard.  We would also draw attention to the co-operation with local businesses, such as Akzo Nobel, where we received a contract for Bloom, which involved the assembly and painting in an assortment of colours of picnic tables and also the designing, construction and finishing of garden benches, which took place in June of this year.<\/p><p> The committee may be interested to know the following about our outreach initiative.  Over a period of time, it became evident that there was an emerging need locally to give support to persons in the areas of substance misuse and offending behaviour.  This cohort could not access community employment or, indeed, our garden caf&eacute; initiative due to limited availability of places.  I would refer the committee to the briefing document which depicts a list of issues and challenges that need addressing for clients in our outreach category.  These include accommodation, addiction, mental health, methadone involvement, finance and debt, literacy, low self-esteem, difficult life experiences, unemployment and education deficits.<\/p><p> This initiative includes the continuous development of a programme which includes horticulture, stonework and landscaping.  It also would include one-to-one key working.  This aspect of our service is not fully resourced and ongoing efforts are made to secure sustainable funding.<\/p><p> Networking with external agencies is of vital importance.  I acknowledge the support of the HSE through the health action zone through suicide awareness training which would include SafeTALK, Cork Simon, Ables literacy support and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.<\/p><p> As an organisation, we remain flexible to new Irish Prison Service sentence management approaches.  While engaging with persons in both pre-release and post-release contexts, through a relationship model Churchfield Community Trust facilitates a shift in attitudes, values and beliefs sustained by new social and economic opportunities.  Referral sources re potential outreach participants include self-referrals, the Probation Service, the Irish Association for the Social Integration of Offenders through Cork Prison, Portlaoise Prison and the Midlands Prison, IASIO, training and employment officer, the Cork Alliance Centre and addiction services.<\/p><p> We respond to challenges which present through engaging with the person in a respectful way while empowering decision-making through collaborative practice.  This process is active, participatory, mutual, respectful and transparent.  This places the individual at the centre of the change process rather than programmes or procedures.<\/p><p> Our outreach programme acts as a signposting service for other services, such as addiction services, Money Advice and Budgeting Service, counselling, addiction counselling, the training and employment office I mentioned previously, the alcohol and offending behaviour programme which will be piloted on 27 July, and literacy support in terms of filling out applications and general forms.<\/p><p> In the five-year period between 2008 and 2014 Churchfield Community Trust worked with a total of 168 clients referred through the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service, IASIO and other agencies.  Some 2.49% of clients re-offended while engaging with Churchfield Community Trust.  In 2014, 66 persons engaged re support.  The breakdown here would include: 13 community employment places, 16 outreach placements, 19 brief interventions, four persons who did not engage, two community service persons who would have completed community service hours, one person who we redirected, one JobBridge intern who I mentioned previously and a part-time job incentive scheme person who I also mentioned previously.  I would also mention our nine garden caf&eacute; team.  The referral agency statistics for 2014-15 show we had 25 probation referrals, 16 IASIO referrals, seven self-referrals and nine other agency referrals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015071500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Donnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436965200,"counter":1473,"content":"<p>Deputy Ferris, who indicated first, will begin the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015071500002#F00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1436965200,"counter":1474,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses here today.

It is important to put them on the record again as there are so many of them and they are all diverse.  The list is accommodation, addiction, mental health, methadone involvement, relationship issues, anger management, finance and debt, literacy, low self-esteem, difficult early life experiences, unemployment and education deficits.  In trying to get an idea of those 12 issues, would there be some more prevalent than others in participants of the programme?  Would any of those 12 issues with which they would present be more serious than the others or would they present with a bit of all of them?  To what extent do any of those issues impede persons going on the programme?  These are all serious difficulties and one, in itself, would be a problem.

When one thinks about the early difficulties, there are a lot of developmental deficits, even between age nought and age 5, and in middle childhood and into the teens the educational deficits play a part.  If I was say what presents across the board, addiction is what brings them to the door.  In recent years, because of the polydrug use, there are associated mental health difficulties because the cocktails of chemicals cause various mental disturbances.  Therefore, mental health issues are very much to the fore as well.<\/p><p>It can be taken that there are some levels of literacy difficulties, especially with guys in their 30s.  The younger lads are benefiting from some of the early interventions that have been in place in the educational system in the past 15 years or so.  However, before that those interventions were not available so we come across lads in their 30s with numeracy and literacy difficulties.  The low self-esteem is par for the course.<\/p><p> In recent times accommodation is becoming more of an issue.  Young men on their own are way down the priority for housing.  We sometimes get support from Cork Simon Community or perhaps from other supported living situations where, following treatment, sometimes there is a phase two treatment where they might get accommodation for three or four months.  The Simon Community has some independent houses - dry houses - and the lads can stay there for up to six months.<\/p><p> Mr. O'Donnell might like to add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015071500002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1436965200,"counter":1479,"content":"<p>Regarding unemployment, the garden caf&eacute; initiative provides stability for persons who have completed our programme.

We seek what we tend to call sympathetic employers, but they are very few and far between.  Our lads will always be at the end of the list in terms of qualifications and readiness for work.  They also have gaps in their careers.  It is hard for a person who has been inside for three or four years to account for that in a CV.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. O'Donnell mentioned, we opened the garden caf&eacute; in response to the lack of opportunities in employment for our lads as they were leaving.  Especially during the downturn there was no hope of placements or getting work.  As we had to respond in some way, we created our own opportunities for employment.  We sometimes get together with other community employment schemes.  We might take a placement from another scheme and that service would take a placement from us.  Some placements are worked through networking and whom one knows.  However, getting jobs is difficult.  We have a few lads who are driving and delivering pizzas, but it is really difficult.  That is why we want to progress the social enterprise.<\/p> <p>  We have a very good skill base.  We have an excellent workshop that was funded through the Probation Service.  We are making really good furniture and we have some good ideas about doing some work with the Department of Social Protection so that instead of a lad going back on the dole, with some seed capital and some conversations we might be able to set up a more work-orientated workshop where they could be employed and generate income.<\/p> <p>  A core part of progression and integration into mainstream life is for these men to actually work.  Men need to work.  It brings an additional set of feel-good factors to be able to provide for one's family.  I am not saying it is not important for women too, but for the man in the house it is really important to have regained his ground in the house and be able to work.  It has a big impact on the children and the whole family.  We struggle equally with trying to find employment.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. O'Donnell mentioned we would really like to see something happening with apprenticeships.  Coming from the lower levels of the academic system, many of these lads would have learnt woodwork and mechanical drawing.

At times, they are just out of treatment or have just completed a day programme and they are put back into prison.  It can often set them back for another year or more.  Sometimes the sentence needs to stand, but there might be some discernment in order that when they go into prison, they may have the option of being in a drug-free unit or a setting where their recovery could be supported in a more holistic way.  Unfortunately, some of the prisons cannot offer that option but it is worth exploring.

The cost does not come to mind straight away, but I remember her saying to us that it might not be cheap, but it was certainly effective.  At the time, we only had space for six people.<\/p><p>We only had very small facilities.  Since then we have expanded threefold, despite the downturn and reductions in funding.<\/p><p> What has kept us so focused is the model we are using, which underpins our success.  Deputy McFadden asked a little while ago about the Servol model.  Servol came from two words, \"serve\" and \"all\".  It was pioneered in the West Indies by the Presentation Brothers, I think.  There are three main components to the method.  The first is attentive listening.  Unless I truly listen to someone's experience, I cannot really respond.  The second is a philosophy of ignorance.  I do not know what it is like to put my head down in a prison cell or to be at the raw end of life, homeless, addicted and all that.  I am ignorant about those experiences.  The third is that I have to be really aware of my cultural arrogance.  As a professional, I can come into any disadvantaged area and put myself on higher ground by saying I know the answer to your problems.  It is such a subtle relationship and requires subtle judgement sometimes.  When we meet the lads, we see them as other human beings.  We do not judge them for what they have done.  They are so used to being judged, they have their antennae up and out like stalks.  They will know in a flash.  It is non-verbal and that is how a lot of stuff is communicated.  It is so important that we do not judge.<\/p><p> There also has to be respectful intervention.  It is all about respect and acceptance, accepting where people are at and starting from there.  The Servol model underpins the work.  Even with the garden cafe, we could not run it like a commercial enterprise.  It is a beautiful place but we have to keep the clients in the centre of the picture all the time - their needs, their journey.  We are here to serve, and for us, it is a service to them rather than some sort of profit-making idea.  If there is ego involved, we are on the wrong page.  That might give a bigger understanding of the approach.  Sometimes it is difficult to stay loyal to one's approach because one can be led in other directions with certain funding criteria and other influences.  We have tried to stay loyal to the model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015071500002#H01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1436965200,"counter":1502,"content":"<p>Thank you.

We do not have that.  Clearly there are groups of people working together in Cork, but it has not come to the fore.  In our experience it does not present as an issue.  I think the lads are often lured back into the world of addiction, perhaps not necessarily gangland crime.  Once they are back in the world of addiction, they are at risk of all that goes with it.<\/p> <p>  We encourage almost an alternative community.  Once one goes into recovery, one says goodbye to what one did before, and who one was with and where one went before.
