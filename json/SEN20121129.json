These were to help those not in severe mortgage difficulties but those who are about to go over the cliff.  Since then, AIB, which is a covered institution and effectively fully owned by the taxpayer, Bank of Ireland, which is still a covered institution have and ICS Mortgages have increased their variable interest rates by 0.5% so that the standard variable rate now stands at just short of 4.6%.  The Personal Insolvency Bill is not the game changer; it is the nuclear button where people must give up everything they own, including their houses, and it does not resolve the mortgage crisis.  In the absence of the Government bringing forward any mortgage resolution measures, I say to people to pay the banks what they can afford and no more.  People have had four years of paying the banks despite interest rate increases.  The Government has failed miserably to bring forward any solution to those struggling and living just to pay their mortgage repayments to the banks.  The banks must come forward with proper solutions, such as extending mortgage terms and zeroisation of interest, and not just moratoriums that will pile on the interest at the end of the term.  People should be allowed to live a bit and have a life.  Members of the public should take a stand and say that this is what they can afford to pay and that is it.<\/p><p>Governments must come up with something.  I have a high regard for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.

Where are the mortgage resolution measures that were supposed to be granted to the Central Bank on 30 September?

I want to highlight an issue of utmost importance to the country and its recovery, which relates to the banking system and the SME sector.  The latest news from the Department of Finance is that 24% of SMEs who were refused finance were not given reasons.  Almost half of all applications take 15 days or longer to turn around.  The period of 15 days was indicated by the Government as acceptable but, unfortunately, the banks are in flagrant disregard of our directions.  This makes me fear for a lost decade in Irish society.  It must be adequately addressed so that we do not have continuing deep-seated problems with regard to this sector.  The SME sector makes up 99% of businesses in Ireland yet the loan rejection rate, at 24%, is second only to Greece in the eurozone.  We also have the second highest level of discouraged borrowers.  If SMEs are lucky enough to get finance, they have the worst terms and conditions of all EU member states.<\/p><p>We must compare SME lending Ireland to best practice in the western world.  Bank lending in most First World countries is based on cash flow rather than bricks and mortar security, as was the case in Ireland and continues to be so.  We have gone through a property crash and bricks and mortar security is not a proper basis on which to proffer loans.  AIB and Bank of Ireland gave an undertaking that they would allocate \u20ac3.5 billion worth of lending to the SME sector in 2012.  However, it seems we have been duped in this regard because in their calculations the banks include restructuring, renewal of seasonal loans, renewal of overdraft facilities and all agricultural, retail and service loans for their interpretation of SME lending.  This will not help Ireland and its economy to recover.  We need proper banking competition.  We must look at what happened in England recently, with Metro Bank being granted a new licence so that it could lend almost half of its capital to the SME sector.  We need to do this because we need to target entrepreneurs and Irish businesses and ensure they can continue despite the recession.  We will not be able to rebuild Ireland unless we have a thriving SME sector.  It is critical to economic development.  I would like to invite the Minister for Finance to the House to discuss lending and the SME sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900003#B00400","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1354185000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health to clarify the situation regarding the brand new cystic fibrosis unit in St Vincent's University Hospital, the first designated cystic fibrosis unit for a nation with the world's highest incidence of this lethal genetic disorder.  Over several years, when plans were being made to build a cystic fibrosis unit in the new block at St Vincent's University Hospital, it was intended to have 34 beds.  Ms Orla Tinsley is well known to Members as a very brave young survivor of cystic fibrosis and a tireless advocate and campaigner for the rights of those with cystic fibrosis and for the health service in general.  She appeared on a programme a year and a half ago and immediately before the programme went on air it was announced that the unit was being built and the contracts had been signed.  Instead of the necessary 34 beds, the commitment was for 20 beds with a flexible provision that additional special rooms that could be isolated, washed and sterilised, which were not specifically designated for cystic fibrosis, would also be available in addition to the 20 ring-fenced beds.  Ms Tinsley has written about this and spoke on the broadcast media yesterday.<\/p><p>This week, it transpires that she required inpatient care with a serious, potentially life-threatening, lung infection.  The condition means the risk of acquiring additional infections if she is exposed to other patients is quite high.  That is one of the reasons the isolation unit was developed.  She was told the 20 beds were full and she was offered a shared four-bed ward.  She found out that five other patients were at home waiting admission to the specialist unit.  She was finally offered a nonspecialist, quasi-isolated bed in the old St Vincent's private hospital, which has been taken over by the St Vincent's University Hospital.  While the room contained only one bed, the bathroom was shared and this was not a designated isolated room.  The situation is unacceptable and it is terribly disappointing that, within four months of the opening of the long promised, long-awaited new unit, it is not fit for purpose in terms of its requirements.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify this for us.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to bring it to the attention of the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance a matter that could be, at this late stage, rectified in the budget.  I refer to the absurd situation whereby sun creams and sun blocks are levied with VAT at 23%.  They are charged the same rate of VAT as luxury cosmetic items.  This takes place in a country where the incidence of malignant melanoma in the decade following 1998 doubled from 400 to 800 and the number of cases of fatal malignant melanoma virtually doubled from 100 to nearly 200, with every projection showing it is likely to continue on an upward trajectory at least through the next decade.  We are genetically unsuited to sunny weather and designed by God to live under the grey misty skies of Ireland.  We do not do well in the sun but we now know that we can protect ourselves against it.  A critical component of this is wearing adequate sun protection and it is absurd that we are charging 23% VAT.  I have suggested it should be brought to 0% and that sunblock and sun cream be considered medicinal products.  Instead, a tax should be levied on sunbeds in the short term pending the banning of sunbeds.  People can work out the arithmetic.  What we receive from the VAT charged on sun creams should be charged as a tax on sunbeds to recoup the exact amount.  I ask the Leader to bring these matters to the attention of the learned gentlemen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900003#B00500","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1354185000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Two years and seven months ago, a Bill was introduced in this House by my esteemed colleague, Senator Feargal Quinn.<\/p> <p>It was the Construction Contracts Bill.

The survey shows there are 1,770 unfinished housing estates in the State, which is down from more than 2,800 a number of years ago.  The Minister of State should come to the House to discuss this survey given that it reports that more than 1,100 unfinished housing estates are in a seriously problematic condition.  The Gathering next year has been mentioned and Ireland is known as the island of saints and scholars but we also have many unfinished housing estates and vacant properties, especially in rural areas.  Leitrim, Cavan, Roscommon, Longford and Sligo have the highest number of vacant dwellings in the country.  Every Member of the House is aware of this issue.  I am anxious that we discuss the report in further detail and the progress made to date.  The Department has made \u20ac3.5 million available to make these unfinished developments safe.  We must push that process forward.  Not only are these estates unsightly but there are also concerns about their safety.  Unfortunately, there have been accidents and loss of life on some unfinished estates, as has been documented.

He called on the government to draw up a list of Jews, whom he believes constitute a threat to national security.  This was part of a criticism of Israel's policy relating to the Gaza Strip.  For anybody who has studied the history of the Holocaust, to hear somebody from Hungary, of all places in Europe, and particularly an elected member of the parliament, revisit the past in such a vile and contemptuous manner must be a cause of serious concern, especially to the European Union.<\/p><p>As any commentator could point out, there is real danger with increasing austerity policies being implemented by various governments.  I have raised the issue of our democratic traditions in Europe and the increasing popularity of far right parties.  The Greek election is a typical example, where a party with strong links to neo-Nazis was elected to parliament for the first time.  Will the Leader ask the T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, in his capacity as chair of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, of which Hungary is a member, to issue a public statement on behalf of the Irish people condemning without reservation this vile statement by the Hungarian member of parliament?  He should go even further and call in the Hungarian ambassador to Ireland to express his disapproval.<\/p><p>The reason I say this is that there is a very small Jewish community in this country, so this does not necessarily resonate with most people in Ireland.  Also, Ireland was neutral during the Second World War, so many Irish people have no real comprehension of what happened in Europe with regard to the Holocaust.  However, it is clear to anybody who has served in a European body.  Senator Colm Burke will share his views with me on this, having served in the European Parliament.  I served in the Council of Europe for several years and Senator Norris was to the fore in highlighting the plight of Raoul Wallenberg who, ironically, helped to save Jews in Hungary in the closing days of the war.

That draft report stated that during the internal consultation meetings it was very clear that many experienced people within the organisation below senior management level felt that the Irish Coast Guard service could be run better.  A common observation from external and internal stakeholders was the apparent lack of direction due in part to the director's time spent abroad.  All of this was removed from the report presented to the Minister.  What we see is manipulation of draft reports by senior management in the Irish Coast Guard service.

On top of all the other difficulties those in business have in the current climate, there are people accosting shoppers and others going about their business in the town's main street and square when dropping relatives to the GP and taking their children to school.  With the depletion of Garda resources, there are no garda\u00ed on the street or in patrol cars.  We will discuss the Europol Bill later today, but there is hardly any point in discussing security and policing co-operation across Europe when we cannot keep the main streets of our town safe.  I am fearful that something serious will happen and somebody will be seriously injured in Mountmellick unless Garda resources for the town are improved.<\/p><p>The Minister for Justice and Equality confirmed before the joint committee this week that a further 1,200 garda\u00ed are scheduled to retire.  This will bring the Garda personnel levels below a sustainable and safe level.  I support Senator Landy's call for the Minister to consider re-opening the Garda training centre in Templemore because it will be two years at the earliest before any new Garda can be put on the beat.  It is welcome that the Minister has made resources available to the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na to purchase 212 new patrol cars, which will become available in December and January.

People have no money and cannot afford to spend any additional moneys on the household charge or the property tax.  Whatever one's political philosophy on the household charge, it was unsuccessful, very badly handled and the money that was to come in was already removed from local authorities.  One cannot blame the local authorities.  It was the decision of the Government of the day to remove that fund.

There are currently 29 CF inpatients and of the five concerned who were refused access when they presented at St. Vincent's on Monday, four have been admitted and one has declined a bed but that patient's treatment is being managed by the hospital.

The hospital is, as always, trying to ensure no CF patients are exposed to the risk of such infection during their treatment.<\/p><p>A protocol for the treatment of CF patients at St. Vincent's hospital was signed off with the HSE, the hospital and the Cystic Fibrosis Association in July 2012 which provided for up to 34 beds to be available for CF patients at the hospital and that a ten bed day unit would be used effectively to help ensure patients were treated in the optimum setting.  The agreement was for up to 34 beds to be available in the new wing of the hospital for CF patients but this did not involve the structured use of ten day beds as well as the 20 single occupancy inpatient beds in the new wing of the hospital.  Infection control issues can make bed management difficult and require that everyone in the hospital operates to all agreed protocols to ensure the facilities involved are used to the optimum level at all times.

Amendment No. 1 is designed to bring more coherence to the treatment of certain types of debt hitherto dealt with in the Bill as being excluded from the new debt resolution processes.  All of the debts mentioned in these amendments, with the exception of the reference to any \"debt or liability arising under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005\", are already mentioned in the Bill.<\/p> <p> I am now providing for the concept of excludable debts.  Essentially, these are seven types of debt, mostly owing to the State in some form, that require the express consent of the creditor to be included in either a debt relief notice, a debt settlement arrangement or a personal insolvency arrangement.  The personal insolvency practitioner must contact the creditor and if their consent is forthcoming, these debts can be proposed in the arrangement.  The creditors will then be able to vote at the creditors' meeting.  If the creditor does not consent, the debt remains excluded and must be paid or resolved outside any of the new arrangements.  With the co-operation offered by the Revenue Commissioners, this can offer certain additional flexibility in seeking to agree debt resolution.  Excluded debts fall into four categories.  These debts cannot be proposed for resolution in a debt relief notice, a debt settlement arrangement or a personal insolvency arrangement.  They must be resolved outside the new processes.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 13 is essentially a drafting amendment and proposes the deletion of the reference to excluded debt from the interpretation section of the debt relief notice.  This is required as a consequence of amendment No. 1, which inserts new definitions in respect of excluded debts and excludable debts in section 2.  Amendment No. 14 is a drafting amendment connected to the amendments concerning the proposed changes in section 2 relating to certain categories of debt.  It makes clear the position regarding the status of an excludable debt, the context of the definition of qualifying debt for a debt relief notice.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 38 proposes the insertion of a new section providing for the explicit consent of a creditor to have his or her excludable debt as defined in section 2 included in a debt relief notice.  The new section would provide that a debt relief notice shall be issued in respect of an excludable debt only where the creditor concerned has consented or is deemed to have consented in accordance with this section to the issue of a debt relief notice.  In circumstances where the debtor has an excludable debt and wishes to have that debt included in his or her debts for the purpose of a debt relief notice, the approved intermediary is required to contact the creditor in question and request his or her confirmation in writing as to whether he or she consents to a debt relief notice being issued in respect of the excludable debt.  The creditor is required to comply with the approved intermediary's request within 21 days and failure to respond within the specified time is deemed, under subsection (4), to be a consent to the inclusion of the excluded debt in the debt relief notice.  The proposed debts in this regard are also subject to the aggregate amount of qualifying debt for the debt relief notice of &#8364;20,000.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 39 is required as a result of the amendments relating to the new treatment of excludable debts in the debt relief notice process.  It would add a new section 26(2)(<i>d<\/i>)(<i>iii<\/i>), requiring the schedule of the debtor's debts to include with regard to an excludable debt a statement on whether the creditor has consented to the issue of a debt relief notice in respect of that debt.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 53 inserts a new section providing for certain creditors to consent to the inclusion of their particular debts in a debt settlement arrangement in respect of excludable debt as defined in section 2.  The new section 54 provides that an excludable debt should be included in a proposal for a debt settlement arrangement only where the creditor concerned has consented or is deemed to have consented in accordance with the provisions of the section to the inclusion of that debt in such a proposal.  It provides that where a personal insolvency practitioner proposes to include an excludable debt in a debt settlement arrangement, he or she is required to notify the creditor concerned of that fact without delay.  The notification is to be accompanied by information about the debtor's affairs, including his or her creditors, debts, liabilities, income and assets as may be prescribed, as well as a request in writing that the creditor confirm in writing whether the creditor consents for the purpose of this section to the inclusion of the debt in a debt settlement arrangement.<\/p><p> As in the case of a debt relief notice, the creditor concerned is required to comply with the request within 21 days of receipt of the notification under the appropriate subsection.  Failure to comply within the specified time results in there being a deemed consent to have the debts included in the arrangement.  Where a creditor consents or is deemed to have consented to the inclusion of an excludable debt in a proposal for a debt settlement arrangement, the creditor is entitled to vote at a creditors' meeting called to consider that proposal.  Where the debtor concerned is the subject of a protective certificate and a creditor to whom this section applies brings an application to the court under section 51(1) that the terms of the protective certificate should not apply to them, the time period for consent should not commence until the date on which the appropriate court determines the application.  Subsection (7) provides that in this chapter, a permitted debt means an excludable debt to which subsection (1) applies, that is, where consent is given or deemed to be given.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 59 is a drafting amendment arising as a consequence of amendment No. 60.  Amendment No. 60 proposes the deletion of paragraphs (<i>c<\/i>) and (<i>d)<\/i>of section 60(2) as the references to certain types of excluded debt are now dealt with in section 2.  The deletion of the paragraphs means the cross-reference in paragraph (<i>b<\/i>) is no longer necessary and accordingly should be deleted.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 94 would insert a new section providing that if a certain creditor is to consent to the inclusion of particular debts in a personal insolvency arrangement in respect of excludable debt, as defined in the new section 2, its provisions are contained in a similar architecture to that proposed in amendment No. 53 relating to the debt settlement arrangement process.  Amendment No. 120 provides for the replacement of section 115(3)(<i>a<\/i>).  The amendment essentially improves the text by making clear how the debtor's income is to be calculated.

I see them as an important roadmap to what I am saying but we will see if we can do something in that regard for tomorrow.<\/p><p>  I come back to these amendments.  They provide a more succinct terminology for the different types of debts that were already addressed in a particular way within the legislation.  On the issue Senator Norris raised, as Members will see in regard to amendment No. 1, the excludable debts of a debtor referred to means: liabilities of debtors arising out of any tax, duty, levy or other charge of a similar nature owed or payable to the State; amounts payable by debtor under the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009; amounts payable by debtor under the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011; the liability of a debtor arising out of any rates due to a local authority; debt or liability of a debtor in respect of moneys advanced to the debtor by the Health Service Executive, HSE, under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme 2009; debt due by the debtor to any owner's management company in respect of annual service charges; and a debt or liability of the debtor arising under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.<\/p><p>  What is the purpose of that?  If people owe taxes or money to a local authority, the HSE or a property management company it is of great importance they meet their obligations.  If those debts exist they are debts that are part and parcel of the overall financial profile of an individual whether they are trying to receive the assistance of a debt relief notice or trying to enter into a debt settlement arrangement or a personal insolvency arrangement.  They are very specific debts.  Most of them in the list I mentioned, and I will come to one that is an exception, are debts owing to the State.  The State has a duty in the interests of other citizens to recover moneys due but there are circumstances in which the reality may be that money is not recoverable and it may be to the benefit of the State and therefore to taxpayers generally and the citizens of this State that if a full sum is not recoverable a portion be recovered that may not otherwise be recovered, even if that portion is paid over a period of years.  It envisages a process that these debts cannot automatically be included in any arrangement or under a debt relief notice, DRN, they cannot be automatically written off but it creates a possibility that the State or a State agency may decide to engage in the matter and participate.  It also gives them an entitlement to simply say:<ul> No.  This is a debt.  It must be paid.  If there is to be an arrangement make an arrangement with all other creditors but remember in the background that our debt has some degree of priority and will not be included in that.<\/ul>  Members will see that included within the list is a debt due by the debtor to any owner of a management company in a multi-unit development.  That is the only one referred to as an excludable debt that is not owed to the State or a State agency.  At one stage we were excluding that debt in its entirety.  I am interested in what Members of the House may say on that issue.  We excluded it from being a settleable debt because if someone is an owner-investor in a multi-unit development it is not that he or she owes the money to one person.  If it is going towards the management of that unit the money such people owe is to facilitate the management and upkeep of the unit in which they maintain their apartment and if they do not pay up, it impacts not on the State but on every other apartment owner.  <\/p><p>  Often there are management companies administering these matters on behalf of the apartment owners within a multi-unit development.  In some instances a committee is set up by two or three of the apartment owners who take that job onto themselves and do not involve a management company.  The concern was that if we included that debt within it, it could unfairly impact on others in the multi-unit development who might, as a consequence of some individual's failure to make payments, find themselves having to make a higher payment which might impact on their own financial circumstances.  It also could be difficult, where there are many owners within a multi-unit development, to get their agreement that a debt can be settled in this way but it would be open to them, where there is an appointed committee or an agent, to authorise them to engage in this way.<\/p><p>  There is a case for making that an excludable debt which may, in cases where &#8364;3,000 or &#8364;4,000 is owing because someone has not paid their management charges for two or three years, give rise to a greater possibility that some of the arrears due will be paid over a period of time or it may not.  It is debatable whether that should be in the excludable or the excluded category but on balance we thought we should put it in the excludable category.<\/p><p>  Senator Norris is right in saying that the Bill is providing a new mechanism for debt settlement by the State or State agencies should they choose to opt into it in circumstances where there is money due.  In effect, that is what it is doing and it is a new mechanism that falls short of taking an individual into bankruptcy, for example, should there be assets there and money due and an individual's failing to make payment.<\/p><p>  The excluded debts are of a particular category.  Liability of the debtor arising out of a domestic support order effectively envisages where a court order is made in family law proceedings for the support of a spouse, a child, a cohabitee or a civil partner in circumstances under the 2010 Act.  Once the court has made an order that order cannot be compromised.<\/p><\/a> <p>There are usually court mechanisms if people are in financial difficulty or their financial circumstances have changed and they are unable to meet their obligations.  There are usually provisions within legislation, such as the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1996, the Family Law Act, the Family Law (Divorce) Act of 1996 or what I call the civil partnership and cohabitees Act.  I would have had a row with the person who added the long spiel at the end of the title if I had been the Minister.  Within those Acts, where financial orders can be made there are mechanisms for variations in changing circumstances.  There is also the constitutional matter that when courts make an order it cannot be compromised externally.<\/p><p>On Report Stage, I want to give consideration to the need to define more exactly what is meant by domestic support order.  We tend to call them maintenance orders, periodical payment orders or financial relief orders.  There is a range of terminology in the family law area and we do not use the term domestic support order.  We may need a definition of domestic support order.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 1 refers to &quot;the liability of the debtor arising out of damages awarded by a court&quot;.  That is a court order and people are bound by it.  The courts are independent and we cannot interfere with individuals' obligations pursuant to a court order.  The amendment refers to &quot;debt or liability of the debtor arising from a loan (or forbearance of a loan) obtained through fraud, misappropriation, embezzlement or fraudulent breach of trust;&quot;.  I do not think that anyone would suggest that type of debt should not be met if assets or funds are available to meet it.  It should not be compromised.  If a court order is made under the Proceeds of Crime Acts, pursuant to proceedings taken by the Criminal Assets Bureau, it should not feature in the debt relief notice or debt settlement arrangement or a personal insolvency arrangement.  Every criminal in the country who has had an order for the seizure of assets made would suddenly announce they were insolvent and wanted the benefit of a debt relief notice and personal insolvency arrangement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900013#M00700","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354191000,"counter":170,"content":"<\/a> <p>There would be mass liquidation of riding stables.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900014#N00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1354191000,"counter":171,"content":"<\/a> <p>That is the delineation and much of it is a tidying up process.

Regarding Senator Bradford's point, Revenue Commissioner debt remains a priority debt.  Such debt remains in its current position but the provision enables someone in serious financial difficulty and trying to conclude a debt settlement or personal insolvency arrangements, who has a Revenue Commissioner debt, to ask the personal insolvency practitioner to write to the Revenue Commissioner to propose that whatever settlement is entered into should include the Revenue Commissioner debt.  The Revenue Commissioners can refuse and say that it wants the full sum due and will not participate.  Before making that decision, it will receive the financial profile of the individual.  The Revenue Commissioners may receive that and decide the individual will go bankrupt and that there may not be enough assets to recover a large portion of the debt and that there is no downside to agreeing to some settlement.  It provides an option but the Revenue Commissioners debt still has the same importance and the same obligation exists to discharge it.<\/p><p>Loan sharks are a particular type of animal and do not apply here.

There may be certain disreputable individuals whom Senator Norris believes should never be paid.  I cannot deal with that in this Bill.  <\/p><p>What is boils down to is quite simple.  If a debt settlement or personal insolvency arrangement is proposed the personal insolvency practitioner, of whom we will say more later, organises a meeting between a debtor and a number of creditors.  The debtor may not be happy with the arrangements being proposed.  For example, he may believe some individual is particularly disreputable and should not get paid or should not get paid as much as they are looking for because, perhaps, their interest rates are exorbitant.  In that case the debtor may not agree to the arrangement being put in place.

Will the Minister explain what happens to the records?  Is there a danger this removal of a stigma could alter somebody's employment records?

It is worth spending a few minutes discussing it.  The amendment is about debt relief notices, debt settlement arrangements and personal insolvency arrangements.  It is designed to ensure that somebody who enters into one of them is not removed from their employment or their employment status is not jeopardised nor is that of their spouse, and to render it unlawful for an employer to terminate a contract of employment for entering into such an arrangement.<\/p><p>A number of basic things can be said about this.  The debt relief notice, debt settlement arrangement and personal insolvency arrangement do not exist at present in our legal system.  We will give birth to them when the Bill is enacted.  It is highly unlikely that, at present, anybody would have a contract of employment which makes a specific reference to those mechanisms.  It would also be very unusual for a contract of employment to make reference to somebody entering into some &quot;debt settlement arrangement&quot; of an unspecified nature which would result in them being rendered unemployed or give an employer a right to terminate their employment.  What we have at present is bankruptcy legislation; we do not have the debt settlement resolutions.  What the Senator is proposing does not relate to bankruptcy, and I will refer to bankruptcy presently.<\/p><p>I share the sentiments expressed.  Part of the backdrop to the debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement is an understanding that an individual has financial resources that will be available to them and primarily that the individual is in employment, be it self-employment or employed by an employer, whether that is a limited liability company or a sole trader, and that the employed individual has a stream of income.<\/p> <p>Without a stream of income a person will not be able over a period of years, as the debt settlement arrangement or the personal insolvency arrangement envisages, to pay off the debt.  This envisages that a person is currently insolvent and does not have the income to discharge his or her debts in full, but has some income in practical terms and that, on the basis that he or she will not be sued for those debts and that his or her creditors are providing some accommodation, which may involve either or both debt forbearance and debt forgiveness, he or she will over a period of years be in a financial position to pay off all or a portion of his or her debt and then exit the debt settlement or personal insolvency arrangement.  It would be a contradiction of the whole ethos of what is being proposed that, by virtue of entering into it, a person would be fired.<\/p><p>We do not have these models at the moment - there are not contracts of employment that would give the employer the right to fire.  Let us remember that we have in existence very good legislation in the Unfair Dismissals Act, which contains various protections for employees.  I have not looked at the unfair dismissals legislation for some time but it was an area in which in years gone by I would have done some work.  As far as I can recall, it does not contain a provision that a person entering into a debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement can be fired over a debt relief notice.  It could not be in our domestic legislation because these things did not exist and were not in anyone's head when that legislation was enacted.  An employee who enters into any such arrangement has very basic and direct protection under the unfair dismissals code.<\/p><p>When the legislation is enacted it is important that we do not have people entering into contracts of employment which of themselves allow someone to be dismissed because he or she is party to such an arrangement.  As Senators Cullinane and Bradford said, many people who enter into these arrangements will be people who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in financial difficulties.  They are in good faith entering into arrangements in the hope that they can resolve their debt problems.  Of course not everyone will be in that category - let us not be na\u00efve about it.  Some people will enter these arrangements having led a profligate lifestyle, spent excessively and not cared where they were going to get the money from, and have entered this arrangement as the least worst alternative because for them bankruptcy is the other alternative.  Not everyone who enters these types of arrangements will necessarily be the innocent individuals who fell on hard times.  Some people will have made bad decisions which had nothing to do with the Celtic tiger and nothing to do with the misbehaviour of banks.  They simply led a profligate lifestyle and decided they did not have obligations to their creditors and their life has caught up with them.  There are also people in that category.  However, I do not believe that applies to most people.  In the context of the economic and fiscal difficulties that have hit this State and impacted unexpectedly on so many people's lives, the vast majority will be people in good faith trying to resolve their problems.<\/p><p>The manner in which these amendments are drafted gives some cause for concern.  Given existing provisions in the unfair dismissals legislation, I do not believe we need these provisions at all.  I emphasise that the purpose is to help people who have some prospect of a stream of income to resolve their debt circumstances while benefiting creditors to the degree that they recoup some of the debt owed to them.  Between now and Report Stage I will consult the Attorney General or Parliamentary Counsel on the Senator's proposal and get further advices on whether such a provision is necessary and, if so, how it might be better framed because there are certain difficulties with it.  I do not want to be pedantic.  When I was in opposition I always hated it when I had a good idea and Ministers went on at length as to how some proposal was marginally technically defective because 50% of the time it was nonsense and the other 50% of the time it was true.  Often instead of talking about substance people got lost down that particular tunnel.  I want the Senator to understand that I am dealing with this in good faith.<\/p><p>Section 134(1) makes reference to someone having entered into an arrangement.  It does not define what that arrangement involves.  Section 134(2) refers to the personal insolvency arrangement and debt settlement arrangement but does not deal with the debt relief notice.  While I understand the Senator's intention, it does not quite work in a legal sense in the way it is framed.  I would like to raise that issue with the Parliamentary Counsel and get some further advices before Report Stage as to whether a provision is necessary.  While there is no particular reason many employers would do this, I would not like to find after the enactment of this legislation that employers have some generic provision in future employment contracts giving them a right to sack someone who entered into one of these arrangements.  I believe there would be certain problems regarding the implementation of that type of provision and I would like us to look at that issue in more detail.<\/p><p>While the Senator does not deal with this, for the sake of completeness it is worth referring to the bankruptcy area.  It is not widely appreciated that the current Bankruptcy Act 1988 contains no prohibition on continuing to employ someone who has been rendered bankrupt.  Such prohibitions are imposed by sectoral legislation or in the regulations of professional bodies.  In the context of bankruptcy, it is not within my authority to address or delete provisions in other legislation.  In so far as they exist in the area of bankruptcy, that is an area that should also be visited.  For example, professional bodies exclude certain people from continuing in employment who are bankrupt.  I am very familiar with the legal profession where one of the bases for being struck off or ceasing to practise as a solicitor is if one is rendered bankrupt.  Within the codes of practice for the bar, barristers' rights to practice are terminated if they are rendered bankrupt.<\/p><p>I do not want to engage in special pleading for the legal profession, but it is a good example.  If there is a competent lawyer, who was well representing his or her clients and who has never done anything fraudulent and there is no question surrounding his or her legal expertise and capacity, but that person has made bad personal financial decisions and has become bankrupt, there is no public benefit in telling that lawyer, whether it be a solicitor or a barrister, that in the one area in which he or she has skill and expertise to make a living, he or she will be prevented from earning that living because he or she has been rendered bankrupt and by stopping him or her from practising, he or she will be stopped from generating any stream of income from which any outstanding creditors may benefit, if that was a possibility.  It makes absolutely no sense.  Those sorts of provisions in codes of conduct in the past were based on an assumption that if a professional individual was rendered bankrupt in some way, it posed a risk to funds held on behalf of the client or - because bankruptcy was so disapproved of - it was some indication that there might be a hint or a whiff of criminality of some description, or if not that they were clearly not people of &quot;appropriate reputation&quot; to be engaged in that type of professional work.  We live in a different world and where there is no legislation on this issue, it would be important for professional bodies to revisit the codes of conduct.<\/p><p>In this regard in the context of the legal profession, it is not appropriate in the insolvency legislation to pick out a particular profession and detail which profession should not do this.  If we did that we would be at risk of leaving out some profession that has these sorts of rules.  Next term, the D\u00e1il Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality will deal with Committee Stage of the Legal Services Bill.<\/p> <p>There is an issue on whether provision should be made in legislation that requires that it be unlawful to have a provision in the code of conduct of either of the professions that restricts somebody from practising for no reason other than being rendered bankrupt.  That is an interesting issue.  <\/p><p>I thank Senator Barrett for raising this issue.  On the basis of saying that I want to consult further with the Parliamentary Counsel, I ask him not to put the amendments to a vote.<\/p><p>I thank Senators for their very constructive contribution on these proposals.  We will have another look at this on Report Stage to get definitive advice whether there is a need to do this.  If the advice is that because of provisions in the unfair dismissals legislation that currently exists, there is no need to do this, I will not come back with an amendment.  If there is a risk that despite the content of the legislation, employers could think they have an absolute right under the terms of their employment contracts to terminate the employment of an employee who enters into these arrangements, we will need to address it.  It could effectively defeat the implementation of arrangements entered into for debt settlement resolution to the benefit of both debtors and creditors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900016#P00800","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354193400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister's openness and I thank him for considering the amendments I tabled.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 4 is in my name only and I will not press it as the Minister indicated he will seek the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel and act on it.<\/p><p>I have used the phrase &quot;or otherwise impair the employment status of&quot; which is more difficult to determine than why Mr. or Mrs. Bloggs was not promoted.

Of course, there are people engaged in this process because of their irresponsibility.  Irresponsibility is not confined to the members of society who find themselves in this situation because they made bad personal debt-incurring decisions but may extend to those who gave them advice concerning it.  We are very fond of blaming the bankers but the reality is that there were many self-interested parties other than self-interested bankers who were complicit in this national conspiracy to fling debt around like snuff at a wake.  They included self-interested lawyers who often stood to gain from conveyancing and from self-interested politicians who refused to acknowledge the possibility that short-term corrections in the economy might have forestalled or prevented the disaster which occurred, but which might have been politically unpopular and were not taken because of the next election.

When it comes to people being promoted, there is a whole range of reasons they may or may not get promoted and whether or not their employment may be \"impaired\".  However, we do have anti-discrimination legislation which exists, for a whole range of reasons delineated within it, so that people are not discriminated against in their employment.  In a sense, however, that is another area.<\/p><p>The additional element that Senator Crown introduced is that of international contracts.  There is a problem in that respect.  Let us assume that an individual works for an American multinational.  He is contracted under US law to work for that multinational and as part of that he is posted to Ireland for two or three years and the contract says what Senator Crown referred to.  Irish law cannot interfere with that because it is a private contractual matter.  It is a contract made under American law which will apply.  One can assume that if it is a multinational and a contract is entered into, the contract will specify the law of which country is applicable to the terms of the contract.  That is a regular provision.  If the home-parent location is the US, it is highly unlikely they would say that Irish law would apply.  However, we can make provision, if need be, for contracts to which Irish law is applicable.  It will not solve the problem of multinational companies posting people around the world with provisions particular to that situation.  At the end of the day, it is for individuals to enter into contracts with their eyes open, knowing what is in the provisions.  In the context of addressing the issue raised by both Senators, however, I will be happy to get further advice from the Parliamentary Counsel.<\/p><p>On the issue of a broad range of legislation or regulations that may apply, for which my Department or others have responsibility, and that would impact on individuals, at the moment they would apply to bankruptcy but would not apply to the debt settlement process.  The position of prison officers and garda\u00ed has been raised.  I will obtain greater clarity on that for Report Stage and will examine the matter.  I thank Senators for raising what was an issue of importance and is worth teasing out further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900018#R00700","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354194000,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I understand Senator Barrett will withdraw the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900019#S00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1354194000,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Yes.

We promised that we would provide for those provisions.<\/p><p>Senator Daly raised the issue of contacts with financial institutions.  The Government has had substantial contact with financial institutions dealing with debt to discuss their approach to debt issues, including the enormous difficulties impacting on those in mortgage arrears.  In that context, over 80,000 people are currently benefiting from debt forbearance arrangements that the financial institutions have entered into.  Despite the enormous fiscal and economic cataclysm that has hit the country, including the collapse in property values since the Celtic tiger and - taking heed of Senator Crown's comment earlier - the encouragement given by financial institutions and previous Governments to people to purchase properties at exorbitant prices, there has been a surprisingly small number of cases of repossession of homes.<\/p><p>We are anxious to ensure that the architecture provided in this legislation is properly worked by the financial institutions.  As I mentioned on Second Stage, there is express provision in the personal insolvency arrangement to try to protect people living in reasonable family homes to ensure that if they are insolvent, arrangements can be agreed and mechanisms entered into that create the possibility for them to retain their homes.  All these issues have been the subject of conversation with the financial institutions to ensure that they properly prepare themselves for the workings of this legislation.  It is very important that they either retrain existing staff or acquire staff who have the skills to engage in the sort of processes that the legislation envisages in the context of the debt settlement resolution provisions.

The motion before us was passed earlier by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann and I believe Senators will also see the justification for approving the scheme the Government has placed before the House.  What is proposed is a practical step whereby the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) (Amendment) Scheme will be extended into 2013, although it is intended to wind down the scheme as soon as is practicable.  While the details are still being worked out and finalised, the scheme must be kept in place to ensure the transition is smooth.<\/p><p>Events in the European Union continue to be of concern to the Government.  Notwithstanding that the agreement reached this week with respect to Greece has been helpful, macro-financial conditions are not as settled as we would like them to be.  Nevertheless, they have improved to the point where the argument for the necessity of the eligible liabilities guarantee is no longer compelling.<\/p> <p>We consider the next phase in the normalisation of the banking industry to be the prudent disengagement from the eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, scheme, commencing in the first quarter of next year if possible, subject to conditions remaining favourable.<\/p><p> In these circumstances, it is important that this motion be recognised for what it is, namely, a sensible step that, notwithstanding the fact that it provides the legal basis for the continuation of the ELG scheme, will facilitate bringing closure to an unwelcome episode in our financial history and constitute another element in restoring our domestic banking system to full health.<\/p><p> Therefore, I will turn to the motion before the House to approve the draft statutory instrument, entitled the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) (Amendment) Scheme 2012.  I shall give some details of the scheme and the reasons for its proposed continuation.  The guarantee in its original form was known as the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme, or CIFS, and was introduced by the then Government on 20 October 2008 following on from the declaration of the blanket guarantee on 29 September.  Subsequently, a successor scheme - the ELG - was introduced on 9 November 2009 and has since been extended a number of times from its original conclusion on 29 September 2010, most recently to the end of the current year.  The ELG scheme is narrower in scope than its predecessor and does not guarantee asset-covered securities or dated subordinated debt.  The scheme covers eligible liabilities as defined in paragraph 11 of the Schedule to the scheme.  These liabilities are deposits, senior unsecured certificates of deposit, senior unsecured commercial paper, other senior unsecured bonds and notes, and other forms of senior unsecured debt specified by the Minister for Finance and approved by the European Commission.<\/p><p> Regarding deposits, it needs to be emphasised that, as qualifying retail deposits of up to &#8364;100,000 are already guaranteed under another scheme, namely, the deposit guarantee scheme, DGS, the ELG scheme only guarantees sums above this figure in such cases.  Other deposits, mainly corporate, in participating institutions are normally guaranteed exclusively under the ELG scheme.  The distinction between the two schemes is important because, for most people classified as falling within the customer base of the retail banking sector, the DGS is the only scheme of relevance.  This is due to the fact that it covers qualifying bank, building society and credit union accounts of up to &#8364;100,000, an amount that is well in excess of the average cash holdings of the majority of people.  Furthermore, this coverage is per institution.  The potential amount of an individual's money that may be guaranteed in this fashion is only constrained by the number of qualifying credit institutions operating in the State.  This serves to illustrate the rather limited nature of the ELG scheme as it applies to most individuals and the importance of not exaggerating the significance of its role.<\/p><p> As a banking guarantee scheme, the ELG scheme falls within the scope of state aid and is subject to six-monthly approvals by the European Commission.  Since its inception, it has been reviewed on a regular basis and, if appropriate, renewed for six months at a time as befits what was only ever intended as a temporary measure, albeit one designed over the years to help provide certainty of security to a particular category of depositors and holders of unsecured bank debt in the participating credit institutions.<\/p><p> Some 16 institutions are participating in the ELG scheme, the main ones being AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB and the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, formerly Anglo Irish Bank.  Participating institutions benefit from the Government guarantee provided under the scheme, which covers deposits taken or debt issued by them, provided those liabilities qualify as eligible.  The scheme is a time-limited one and requires that any proposal to extend it in law be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.  The relevant legislation governing this matter is section 6 of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, as amended.<\/p><p> Last December, the scheme was extended in national law for one year to run from 1 January 2012, with the result that the scheme would expire at the end of next month were no further action taken.  If the scheme is to be prolonged, it needs to be amended in two respects to effect a date change in each case.  In addition, this opportunity is being taken to make a technical amendment to the scheme to update a cross-reference made in the ELG scheme to the CIFS scheme in 2008.<\/p><p> Beginning with the latter, the three amendments set out in the draft statutory instrument are as follows.  The first will amend Article 3 of the scheme so that the reference there to section 6(3B) is replaced by section 6(4A) following on from changes to the CIFS Act made by the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010.  The reference in question is to the provision in the CIFS Act concerning the legal basis for the making of a financial support period order.<\/p><p> The second will amend paragraph 3.1(<i>b<\/i>) of the Schedule to the scheme, which sets out the period within which institutions may apply to join it.  The amendment will extend this period of application so that the current date of 31 December 2012 will be replaced by 31 December 2013, subject to the continuing approval of the European Commission.<\/p><p> The third will amend paragraph 11.1(<i>c<\/i>)(ii) of the Schedule to the scheme, which deals with the period during which eligible liabilities will be incurred if they are to be considered eligible under the scheme.  This amendment would replace the current end date of 31 December 2012 with 31 December 2013, subject to the continuing approval of the European Commission.<\/p><p> The condition relating to the second and third amendments of the approval of the European Commission is necessary because all banking guarantee schemes are subject to EU state aid rules, which provide that such schemes must be approved for a maximum period of six months in advance only.  Therefore, in accordance with established practice, the ELG scheme will remain subject to six-monthly Commission approval, notwithstanding the proposed one-year extension in national law.  Approval from the Commission has already been sought and is expected to be formally given shortly.  When given, this will mean explicit EU approval for the scheme until 30 June 2013.  It is also necessary to seek the opinion of the European Central Bank in these matters.  That opinion is awaited.<\/p><p> The participating institutions to which I referred are those credit institutions that joined the ELG scheme after its commencement.  They may take deposits and issue debt of the type described as eligible liabilities, with a maximum maturity date of five years, provided the liabilities have been incurred during what is called the issuance period.  This runs from the date that the institutions joined the scheme to the scheme's end date, currently 31 December 2012.<\/p><p> In comparison with the liabilities covered by the CIFS scheme at its inception, which totalled &#8364;375 billion, liabilities outstanding at the date that the new ELG scheme began to operate alone in the second half of 2010 had reduced to &#8364;147 billion.  At the beginning of 2012, this figure had decreased further to &#8364;102 billion and has since fallen again to &#8364;78 billion.  When one considers the historical import of the guarantee, one can see the incremental progress that has been made in shrinking the umbilical cord - the State guarantee - since the height of the crisis.<\/p> <p> One can see the type of sustained progress that has been made in trying to breathe life back into the Irish banking sector.  Among the factors accounting for this fall during 2012 are the following.  First, in the normal course, bank debt held by the banks has matured and has not been replaced by new issues, which is good news.  Second, as a consequence of Irish banks' UK subsidiaries reducing their participation in the ELG scheme, deposits under guarantee have fallen by approximately \u20ac11 billion.  The EU subsidiaries do not have access to a guarantee because they are EU banks with subsidiaries in Ireland.  Third, there has been the welcome success of some of the participating institutions, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, in raising unguaranteed deposits totalling approximately \u20ac11 billion, as well as the recent opening up to the banks of access to the international debt markets.<\/p><p>On that point, it is worth mentioning that for a sustained period, because of the difficulties that have emerged across the eurozone, the pillar banks had no access to the interbank lending markets that are normally in place.  As those difficulties subsided and normality returned, these opportunities in terms of accessing money on the interbank markets are presenting for the pillar banks, which is a significant development which the Government welcomes.<\/p><p>Effectively, the scene has been set to push on from these developments, in particular the mechanism used in the case of the participating institutions in the UK whereby the Minister for Finance, under paragraph 13 of the Schedule to the ELG scheme, allowed certain categories of deposits to fall away from guarantee coverage from a given date in the future.  Together with the power given to banks by the Minister in November 2011 to issue unguaranteed deposits in certain cases, these two approaches to reducing liabilities under guarantee have been instrumental in laying some of the groundwork for a more comprehensive strategy to winding down the scheme.<\/p><p>The Governor of the Central Bank is of the view that an extension of the ELG scheme until June 2013 is necessary and would facilitate an orderly withdrawal from the scheme when macro financial conditions are conducive to such a step.  The operator of the scheme, the National Treasury Management Agency, has also been consulted in this matter and is of a similar view.  While it believes the removal of the guarantee would be seen as a further positive step in restoring normal market conditions in Ireland in the context of its sustained return to the capital markets, it believes it is important the ELG scheme would be renewed until conditions are judged appropriate by the authorities to move to end the scheme.<\/p><p>In return for the guarantee provided by the Minister for Finance in respect of liabilities deemed eligible under the scheme, the participating institutions pay fees to the Exchequer.  The fee structure is set down under recommendations which apply to all EU bank guarantee schemes and which are based, first, on recommendations of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank on government guarantees for bank debt and, second, on subsequent recommendations from the European Commission.  The latest changes to the pricing regime were introduced on 1 January 2012.<\/p><p>The cost of the fees and its effect on the profitability of the banks is significant and has been one of the driving factors behind their anxiety to try to move away from dependence on the guarantee for their funding.  While initially fees were quite low, at 25 to 50 basis points, the cumulative effect of the Commission recommendations on fees was a gradual increase in average fees payable by the institutions over the course of 2010, with the actual level of fee applicable dependent on the type and maturity of the debt concerned and on the credit rating of the institutions involved.  Subsequently, in 2011 and during the course of this year, the average fee payable levelled off at around 110 basis points.  In monetary terms, for example, this meant that in respect of average monthly liabilities under guarantee of about \u20ac112 billion during 2011, annual fees of some \u20ac1.23 billion were paid.  This is effectively the amounts the banks give us for providing the guarantee.  Total fees generated by the participating institutions last year for the purposes of providing the guarantee was approximately \u20ac1.23 billion and this year will be just over \u20ac1 billion.<\/p><p>Currently, the fee structure applicable to eligible liabilities is as follows.  For debt or deposits with a maturity of 90 days or less, the guarantee fee is generally 160 basis points.  As the debt maturity increases, so too does the number of points.  The total of fees arising from the ELG scheme and paid to the Exchequer to date is some \u20ac2.83 billion.  Approximately \u20ac741 million has been incurred in respect of the first three quarters of 2012 as compared with \u20ac951 million paid for the corresponding period in 2011.  When one compares the first three quarters of this year with the first three quarters of last year, there is a natural weaning away of the fees as a consequent reality of the amount which is held under the guarantee reducing because of the ability of the institutions to obtain funding in the normal way.<\/p><p>I should mention that there are also two amending orders of a consequential, technical nature which will have to be made if the statutory instrument amending the scheme before this House is passed.  These are called financial support orders and will be made in exercise of the powers conferred on the Minister for Finance under section 6 of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, as amended.  These orders do not have to be placed before the House as they are consequential on the proposed amendment to the scheme being passed in the first instance.  I have explained the first order and will take questions on the second order at the end of the debate.<\/p><p>The motion before the House is one which warrants the full support of this House.  It should prove to be an essential last step which maintains support for the domestic banking system for the present while facilitating a timely exit from the scheme in the very near future.  It must be borne in mind that it was never intended that this scheme would be maintained indefinitely and that it would last only for as long as was considered necessary for financial stability reasons.  This is reflected in the regular assessments that have had to be carried out by the Irish authorities and the state aid criteria that have had to be met to persuade the European Commission that prolongation of the scheme to date has been warranted.  The Commission and the ECB are fully aware of the Government's intentions to move to end the scheme.  They also accept that the timing needs to be as right as it reasonably can before a winding-down process can be initiated.  This is being worked on at present by the relevant authorities.<\/p><p>It would, of course, be better if there were no need to extend the ELG scheme beyond the end of this year, but we need to be practical.  Preparations, in operational terms, will need to be made by the participating institutions and reasonable notice given to customers that the guarantee will be ending for new deposits made or debt issued after a given date.  The guarantee remains for existing maturity up to five years.  That is an important point.  At the same time, a decision will need to be taken that market conditions and the macro financial environment at that point are conducive to withdrawal of the scheme.  A measured, well-thought out approach is required, therefore, in reaching this point, and the prolongation of the scheme into next year will ensure the maximum flexibility can be availed of in implementing these plans.<\/p><p>I do not believe there is any doubt about the fact that we are now moving towards the end of the guarantee.  This will be an important step towards normal market conditions and another staging post towards this county coming out of the very severe difficulties it has faced as a consequence of the appalling banking mess that emerged in 2008 and 2009.<\/p> <p>We are asking for the approval of this House - we received that of the Lower House today - to allow us to extend this scheme.  As famously stated by a former Member of the D\u00e1il, in looking for approval, we are hoping that this scheme will come to an end in the shortest possible time next year.  If this is possible for the participating institutions and the Government to achieve, it will be another milestone along the road towards recovery for this country.<\/p><p>This has been a difficult chapter for our people, our country and our taxpayers, who have committed significant sums of money to the banking sector for the purpose of propping it up while the banks return to profitability.  The task in all of this has been to see the new banking sector, with the newly configured pillar banks, as a means through which we can obtain economic recovery.<\/p><p>In seeking the support of Senators for this motion to extend the scheme, we do so in the firm and honest belief that the life of this scheme is coming to an end and to tell the world and domestic audiences that we have done a good day's work and taken another step on the road to recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900021#U00400","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354196400,"counter":264,"content":"<p>The Government has a hard neck and some cheek to ask the Parliament to renew this bank guarantee.

Through this guarantee for the banks, the State was taking on a liability of \u20ac375 billion.  No matter how one views it, though, it is turning out to be a success because the liability has been reduced to \u20ac78 billion.  That is some reduction.<\/p><p>However, it has come at a price.  According to the Minister of State's figures, the liabilities outstanding under the eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, scheme was \u20ac147 billion in the second half of 2010.  It fell to \u20ac102 billion and again to \u20ac78 billion.  This reduction of almost \u20ac70 billion occurred during a 24 or 27-month period.  As anyone who has been in business knows, if one pays off one debt, something else gets left behind.  In this case and as I have often stated, that something is the effective lending to businesses.  One cannot pay down at that rate and loan money while still owing the emergency liquidity assistance, ELA.  Although the scheme is proving to be a success for the Government in terms of removing the liability from the State, as is appropriate, it has a cost, namely, the difficulties being faced by businesses of every type.

It was a disaster for Ireland.  Many of those responsible have managed to escape.  Today, we are finally catching up with the accountants.  Did they sanction money going into a bank at 11.50 p.m. and exiting at 12.10 a.m. for years?  We have asked questions.  When will the Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board, CARB, break into a trot and do something about these matters?  Too many of the people who caused our problems have managed to escape scot free.<\/p><p>We sleepwalked into the euro.  Design faults were well known at the time and highlighted by people such as Milton Friedman.  For example, there was no banking regulation, nothing to defend a small country from tsunamis of credit from large countries, the loss of the interest rate as an instrument of economic policy - when we needed higher interest rates, Germany gave us lower ones - the loss of the exchange rate, which we used fairly effectively in the 1990s, and no fiscal federalism.  We need to increase the level of economic expertise available to governments.<\/p><p>I do not know whether incorporeal Cabinet meetings still exist, but the case in question was disastrous.<\/p> <p>Some Ministers were in Sandymount and not told the meeting was on and another would have come from Limerick had he known there was a meeting.  We should do our business properly in governing the country.<\/p><p>There are very enthusiastic Europeans in the Government and the public service and we tend to be na\u00efve.  The euro, as a product, should have been properly analysed, and we have a chance to remedy much of that when we take on the Presidency.  We are not there to cheer defective European institutions and policies as we have paid a significant price for some of those policies.  Better business, including the same reforms that are to be implemented in this country, may have to be put in operation in Europe.<\/p><p>There should be control of lobbying.  Bankers were able to do this and the record of the construction industry in this area does not do much when we are trying to promote fiscal responsibility, as the Minister is trying to do.  There must be better control of public finances.  Yesterday we heard that \u20ac1.5 billion is being spent on a rail safety budget, with over \u20ac200 million on new railway signals between Lansdowne Road and Howth Junction.  Do some Departments still not analyse projects properly?  Are the Houses allowed to analyse such issues?  There are too many redacted documents issued by big spending Departments.<\/p><p>I wish the Ministers and Minister of State every success but even if we had not got into trouble with our banks, there was a tendency to overspend in the country.  As others have said, we can see the consequences now with 14% unemployment where the rate was 4%, as well as the problem of massive negative equity that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is trying to tackle.  We must learn many lessons from the period between 2008 and 2010.  Sometimes people have got away scot free and we have papered over cracks.  There has been a tendency to hire more public relations personnel and take laps of honour.  All Members of the Oireachtas, including those in this House, were elected to change a system that had run onto the rocks.  We must never lose sight of the need for that reform agenda.<\/p><p>I compliment the Minister on decreasing those debts which came about under the guarantee scheme but what defence will we have when another industry goes broke?  Is it too easy to achieve regulatory capture of the Government?  What defences do citizens have, as we were powerless for many of those years?  The people made the decision in the spring of 2011, and the previous Government with 85 seats was reduced to an opposition party of 19 seats.  Too many of the other institutions which got us into this problem are still there and acting with impunity.

How long will the process of disengagement take?  If we start it in June 2013, how long does the Minister of State believe it will take to complete and under what conditions will it be deemed appropriate to end the scheme?  The Minister of State said it is being worked on but can he give the House more detail on that?<\/p><p>Last Friday, I attended a conference in Dublin Castle on the Irish Presidency and the first session was on the economic and monetary union, EMU, and the banking union.

I may be going off on a tangent and there is little point in rehashing old arguments but I ask the Minister of State to outline how the extension of that scheme would fall into the moves being made at EU level towards a central banking system.

As a member of the Fine Gael Front Bench I recall that meeting and there is an inevitability when an Opposition party, particularly the principal Opposition party, is asked by the Government party to support an emergency measure, be it a defence or financial emergency measure or whatever.  The natural inclination is to support that because some urgent issue has arisen and the immediate advice open to Government is to advance this particular policy.  For the sake of the country, one feels a natural patriotic duty to stand by the Government in what it has to do in the circumstances it faces, albeit without all the information.  I recall the discussion we had in the Fine Gael Front Bench meeting on that occasion and, despite our reservations, which were articulated in the D\u00e1il, we believed the right thing to do for the country was to support the guarantee on the basis of the information available to us.<\/p><p>This goes back to the point Senator Gilroy made, and this is the crucial issue.  We should never have been in that position.  The country should never have been in that position.  This decision was foisted on the people without any consideration at an EU level by our significant EU trading partners.  With the greatest respect to the people who made that decision, and I am not casting any aspersions on their character, at the heart of that latent decision they wanted to make, and asked us and the D\u00e1il to make, was an internal arrogance because of their closeness to the banking circles in this country.  That is the problem we faced.  We did not take advice.  When all the great generals of the Irish banking sector, with their arrogance and sense of entitlement, rolled up that evening to the Department of Finance and gave information to the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, and the then Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, a man for whom I still have the greatest admiration and respect, the natural inquisition that should have taken place did not because of the closeness between the political system and the banking sector that had developed over a generation and a half.  Senator Gilroy made an excellent point.  Those who knew better and could advise better consequently felt that they could make this enormous decision on behalf of all of us without any consultation with our colleagues in Europe and, as they say, the rest is history.<\/p><p>To come back to the point Senator Barrett made, at the heart of this is enormous political failure added to the dreadful banking failure because of the policies upon which the banking model was pursued in this country.  I refer to the boom to bust cycle of support for the construction sector, representing up to 20% of GDP at one stage in our economy, added to the regulatory failure.  This was a collapse of authority in Ireland and a political, regulatory and banking failure.<\/p><p>What we must do now is restore the country after this collapse.  Fianna F\u00e1il has taken its hit for this in that its vote has collapsed.  That regulatory system is no longer in place.  We have a new regulator and a more robust system, and we now have a new banking system, but whether we have a new culture in that banking system is the question that must be posed and answered by colleagues on all sides.  There is this triumvirate of failure - political, regulatory and banking - and one of the prerequisites in terms of recovery is to wean our new banking sector off the original guarantee that was put in place in 2009 and the subsequent eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, scheme.<\/p><p>To take the point my colleague, Senator Reilly, made, what we are talking about here has nothing to do with the EU-wide bank deposit guarantee which is in place up to \u20ac100,000.  What we are talking about here is approximately 2% of the total, that is, above that amount and the great majority of corporate cases.<\/p><p>In terms of what the Government has attempted to do, within a month of coming into Government our first big decision was to restructure the entire Irish banking sector around two pillar banks in a statement made to the other House and to this House in March 2011 by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  That was the first major decision taken by the new Government in March 2011 based on the results we obtained from the Blackrock assessment in terms of the loan to liquidity that exists in the Irish banking sector.<\/p><p>In terms of what followed that, there was a commitment from the pillar banks, built on the traditional AIB and Bank of Ireland, that, over a three-year period, \u20ac21 billion would be invested in the Irish economy by way of new or existing lending to businesses that needed lending to retain jobs; a radical deleveraging of those businesses; a sell-off of their successful components in third countries as a means of helping the capital ratios within those banks; a new banking unit in the Department of Finance which was to lead bilateral and multilateral discussions among the banks, the Central Bank and the Government on behalf of a smaller, more focused Department of Finance whose task would be banking recovery; new directors; entirely new management within those pillar banks - we have flushed out all those who were there at the time of the collapse and replaced them with new people to lead the new banking sector; and a new regulatory structure which would oversee the way in which the new banking operations and culture would act.<\/p> <p>If someone told me in March 2011, when 100% of AIB and Bank of Ireland was owned by the State, that by December of that year, 15% of Bank of Ireland would be in the ownership of the State and the other 85% in private ownership, I would have thought the person was a lunatic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900026#Z00800","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354198200,"counter":308,"content":"<p>That is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900027#AA00200","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1354198200,"counter":309,"content":"<p>How impossible that seemed, yet it happened as a result of the decisions taken by the Government in March 2011.

The new banking structure we have put in place is a key policy difference, and it will hold this country in good stead.<\/p><p>There is no point in changing the structure and capital ratios, making the banks smaller and deleveraging unless we change the culture, hubris and arrogance.  That is the challenge for the Minister for Finance and his colleagues in government.  We must make sure the banks understand our language and lend in a prudent, sustainable way.  They must see risk in a proportionate way and be at the heart of their communities.  I am 43 years of age and I remember when I was 18 or 20, bank managers knew people in the community.  That did not happen in the past ten years when an unsustainable banking model was pursued.  We must get back to the local banks knowing the communities they serve.  We must replicate what the credit union movement has been doing.  We hope our policies, implemented within a month of being in government, make a difference in terms of getting the banks to a better place culturally.<\/p><p>When we came into government, the banks were bankrupt and in an appalling condition in terms of any sense of the future.  The banks are still in the accident and emergency ward but let us look at what has happened in the past two weeks.  Independently of the guarantee, Bank of Ireland raised substantial sums of money on the open market for the first time since 2009.  AIB, which is 98% or 99% owned by the State, raised significant sums of money yesterday for the first time in three years.  The demand was three or four times what one would expect.  That is an example of slow but sure incremental progress in the Irish banking sector.  We make this point in today's proposal.  We are rolling over the eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, scheme, but we are doing so for a reason.  The reason is to bring to an end the ELG scheme as soon as practicable and possible.  It will be a good day for this country, the banking sector, public utility companies, and the sovereign debt exposure we face when we can set the guarantee to one side.  It will be a good day for Ireland and will show a sign of positive development and that the banks are beginning to get to a new plateau and move away from the umbilical chord inherent in the ELG scheme.  When this Government came into office, the cost of borrowing ten-year Irish debt paper on the international money markets was 15%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900027#AA00500","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1354198200,"counter":312,"content":"<p>It was not 15%.

We are slowly beginning to present this country as less of a sovereign risk and more as a sovereign opportunity.  This year, the NTMA has raised in excess of \u20ac5.5 billion at a time when alleged commentators in Europe said we would need a second bailout, which is looking increasingly unlikely, and that no money would be raised this year.  Some \u20ac5.5 billion has been raised this year, admittedly in short-term paper.  It is another example of the incremental progress we are trying to make as a Government, given the appalling legacy and mess left by the previous Administration.  The motion we are asking the House to accept, in terms of advancing the position and getting to a point next year when this will no longer be needed for the banking liabilities, will be seen as a positive step in that direction.  It will be another milestone towards recovery and away from the bankruptcy the Government found when it first came to office.<\/p><p>Senator Kathryn Reilly asked about the conditions we are awaiting before exiting the scheme.  We are in the midst of ongoing discussions with the EU about managing the sovereign crisis across the European Union, particularly in Greece and Spain, as we have seen over the past week.  The outcome of the eurozone Ministers meeting and the deal reached to put money into Spanish banks, while at the same time agreeing in principle on a debt reduction programme for Greece, is the type of improvement we need in the general financial environment.  Once we see economic stability return to the Union and the eurozone, this country, more than any other country, because of our exposure to exports and because we are a small, open, trading economy, will benefit more than any other because of our exporting potential.  We have a solid economy in this country.  There is a strong private sector economy waiting to emerge when it sees stability re-emerge across the EU.  The conditions at the eurozone level, in terms of Spain and Greece, help us greatly in our task to reposition the country.<\/p><p>On the question of fees, the State obtains \u20ac1 billion per year for the provision of the ELG.  By the end of January or February, if the guarantee no longer existed, we would still obtain fees from the existence of the guarantee because it is on a five-year maturity basis and only comes to an end at the end of five years, even if the guarantee is no longer in place.  It is not the case that the income the State receives from the guarantee will completely disappear overnight.  The State will be weaned off and we are factoring that into the macroeconomic framework in terms of next year and the resources available to it.<\/p><p>I ask the House to accept that Ireland is a small country that has come to an appalling time in its economic history.  Dreadful mistakes were made in terms of the decisions taken, as Senator Barrett and others said.  We will come back from this and the only way to come back is to have a viable banking sector.  That is why the decisions the Government has taken in terms of restructuring the banking sector in Ireland are essential to recovery.  What do we want more than anything else?  We want our money back.  We want the money invested in these banks over a period of years to be returned so that, for taxpayers in the future, the funds can be used for investment, jobs and development purposes.  That is the ambition of the Government and the passage of the motion will help us to reposition the Irish banking sector towards more normal, profitable and positive territory.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900027#AA00700","speaker":"958"},{"type":"vote","time":1354198200,"counter":314,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 37; N\u00edl, 4.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden; N\u00edl, Senators David Cullinane and Kathryn Reilly.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900027#AA00800","aye":["1157","1121","1138","1116","1114","1165","1151","1158","1130","1166","1160","1159","1117","1172","1119","1152","1173","1135","1161","1162","1140","1149","1132","1128","1174","1134","1146","1118","1127","1125","1142","1145","1163","1171","1126","1143","1164"],"nay":["1133","1136","1122","1155"]},{"type":"speech","time":1354198800,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Senator Thomas Byrne voted in Senator Darragh O'Brien's seat, but that does not affect the result of the vote, which is T\u00e1, 37; N\u00edl, 4.

While Europol has existed since 1995, it did so on the basis of an EU convention, which has been subject to a number of amendments introduced through subsequent protocols.  However, such legal instruments are subject to lengthy ratification procedures by member states and therefore it was agreed to replace those instruments with a Council decision which will ease any future amendments.<\/p><p>  In 2008, the Houses of the Oireachtas approved the adoption by the State of the Council decision which ultimately entered into force in 2010.  The convention and protocols to which I have referred were given force of law in the State by way of the Europol Act 1997, as amended.  Section 2(1) of that Act states that the convention and the protocols &quot;shall have the force of law in the State and judicial notice shall be taken of them.&quot;  Such wording, which is usual for the implementation of international agreements such as conventions, effectively precludes the need to legislate for each and every article of the instrument.  In effect, the 1997 Act as amended is relatively minimalist.  However, a Council decision must be implemented in a manner whereby each and every aspect of the instrument which has domestic effect must be provided for in legislation.  For that reason, this Bill is significantly more detailed than the existing Europol Act.  Nonetheless, the Bill will, in effect, maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>.  Although the Council decision does introduce a small number of changes to Europol, to which I will shortly refer, it replicates to a large extent the provisions of the convention and the protocols thereto.<\/p><p>  Turning to Europol itself, I would like to mention briefly one change introduced by the Council decision.  Under the convention, Europol had the status of an intergovernmental organisation funded by contributions from member states.  However, establishing Europol under a Council decision gives it the status of an agency of the European Union.  As an agency in the area of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters, Europol joins the European Police College, CEPOL, and the EU's judicial co-operation unit, Eurojust.  Establishing Europol as an entity of the EU ensures that it is funded from the general budget of the European Union and also enhances the role of the European Parliament in the control of Europol.<\/p><p>  The objective of Europol, under the Council decision, is to improve the effectiveness and co-operation of the law enforcement authorities of member states in preventing and combating organised crime, terrorism and other forms of serious crime affecting two or more member states.  This is another difference between the Council decision and the convention and probably the most significant change from an operational point of view.  The Council decision extends the mandate of Europol from that under the convention.  Organised crime was originally the sole focus of Europol's activities.  The Council decision removes the requirement that an organised criminal structure must be involved before Europol can act.  It will be sufficient for the crime concerned to involve organised crime, terrorism or another serious offence affecting two or more member states.  The annex to the Council decision lists those other serious offences for which Europol is competent, which include the main transnational crimes such as drug trafficking, terrorism, money laundering, human trafficking, counterfeiting and arms smuggling.  Also included are other more serious crimes such as murder, organised robbery and kidnapping.  Europol's role in supporting and strengthening action by the member states in combating such crime is clearly set out in Article 3 of the Council decision.<\/p><p>  It is the reality that no member state - including Ireland, despite our island status - can avoid the impact of international crime.  The very nature of this crime requires the co-operation of several states to ensure an effective response.  Europol describes its role as that of making Europe safer, and it does so by providing the necessary co-ordination of and support for national law enforcement authorities.<\/p><p>  The support and assistance that Europol can offer to any investigation can be broadly categorised as information management and, to a lesser degree, semi-operational tasks.  The latter tasks include the option for Europol to participate in joint investigation teams.  Primarily, however, Europol co-ordinates and supports Europe-wide operations investigating serious criminal activity.  All arrests and policing functions are carried out by the competent law enforcement authority in the member state in question.  Europol assists member states in combating crime on a daily basis.  In the case of Ireland, this assistance is achieved through secure intelligence exchange between the Irish Europol national unit based in Garda headquarters and the Irish liaison bureau located in Europol HQ in The Hague.<\/p><p>  Europol has established a number of crime priority areas which are assigned a team of analysts and to which Ireland contributes on a daily basis.<\/p> <p>The information gathered has assisted has assisted in identifying links between international organised crime groups operating in Ireland and in other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>In terms of operations, in 2011 Ireland assisted Europol in the provision of intelligence and information about a mobile organised crime gang which was involved in the organised thefts of rhinoceros horn throughout continental Europe.  That work continues with ongoing intelligence exchange between Ireland and other member states about this gang, which is also involved in the commission of crimes including burglaries, aggravated robberies, fraud, money laundering and drug trafficking.  Europol has also assisted Ireland in the area of illegal immigration.  Ireland has taken part in operational meetings involving the exchange of information and intelligence concerning an organised crime gang operating in France that assists illegal immigration into Ireland.  This operation, which is continuing, has already resulted in a number of arrests in France.  More recently, An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na took part in a joint operation with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, targeting prostitution on the island of Ireland.  Europol again assisted this operation through the deployment of analysts who worked alongside Garda and PSNI personnel.  Europol continues to be of major assistance in combating and preventing crime.  It is an essential means of exchanging and analysing information and intelligence and ensuring that European law enforcement agencies are alerted to new threats.<\/p><p>Turning to the Bill, I will highlight some of its main provisions.  Section 2 confirms that the competent authorities for the purpose of the Act and the Council decision are the Commissioner of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na or, in the case of a revenue offence, the Revenue Commissioners.  &quot;Competent authorities&quot; are defined in article 3 of the Council decision as &quot;all public bodies existing in the Member States which are responsible under national law for preventing and combating criminal offences&quot;.<\/p><p>Sections 4 and 5 provide for the Europol national unit including the functions of that unit.  Those functions are set out in Article 8 of the Council decision and include liaising with Europol and the competent authorities of other member states, responding to requests for information and intelligence and performing such other tasks as are required by the Council decision.  The provision allows the national unit to refuse a request for information where to provide such information would prejudice the security or other essential interests of the State, prejudice a criminal investigation or criminal proceedings in the State or would jeopardise the safety of a person or persons.  Section 5 also clarifies that the national unit may access the Europol information system as permitted under the Council decision.<\/p><p>Section 6 provides for the role and functions of liaison officers.  This provision replicates the existing section 4 of the Europol Act 1997.  Under this provision, a liaison officer may be sent from the national unit to Europol to serve in the Irish liaison bureau.  A liaison officer may not necessarily be a member of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and could, for instance, be an officer of the Revenue Commissioners.  Currently, Ireland has two liaison officers based in Europol - one from An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and one who is an officer of the Revenue Commissioners.  These officers provide co-ordination between Europol and the national unit in the transmission of information and otherwise co-operate with Europol in accordance with the Council decision.<\/p><p>Section 7 gives effect to Article 7 of the Council decision which permits Europol to request member states to initiate criminal investigations.  A request shall be made to the national unit which will transmit the request to the competent authority of the State, that is, An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and-or the Revenue Commissioners.  The competent authority will consider and decide whether to comply with the request.  The national unit will notify Europol of the decision as to whether to conduct the investigation.  Where it is decided to refuse the request, the national unit will inform Europol of the reasons for refusing, unless to do so would harm essential national security interests, prejudice an ongoing criminal investigation or proceedings or would jeopardise the<\/p><p>safety of any person or persons.  This provision which was initially introduced into the convention in 2002 responds to previous difficulties with regard to member states acting upon information provided by Europol.  However, it must be emphasised that An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, the Revenue Commissioners and the law enforcement authorities in other member states have absolute discretion in the prioritisation and deployment of resources.<\/p><p>Section 8 provides for the transmission of data to the Europol information system.  This system is used to store personal information about people who are suspected or convicted of having committed a crime for which Europol has competence or where there are reasonable grounds to believe that they will commit such an offence.  Subsections (2) and (3) set out the types of data which may be input and which are also set out in the Council decision.  As can be expected, this data includes information concerning a person's identity including names, date and place of birth, address and driving licence or passport information.  Also included is the possibility of providing DNA data which, owing to the lack of the appropriate technology, was not in the previous Europol instruments.  Now, because of modern technology, the use and sharing of DNA information is a key element of criminal justice systems across Europe.  However, it should be pointed out that neither the Council decision nor the Bill requires the obtaining of such DNA data and it will only be provided where it is available.<\/p><p>Section 9 concerns the transmission of data to Europol for purposes other than under section 8, that is, for input in the Europol information system; for example, Europol may include information in a system known as analysis work files.  This system offers broader information than the Europol information system although with much more limited access.  These files allow Europol to provide operational analysis with the aim of assisting criminal investigations.  Information may also be used by Europol and transmitted to third states or other entities.  However, the prior consent of the national unit is required before any onward transmission of the data by another party may take place.<\/p><p>Sections 10 to 14 concern the use of, access to and protection of personal data to which the Bill applies.  On a general point, it must be noted that data under the Act is subject to the provisions and protections of the Data Protection Acts.  There is a very strong data protection regime in place in Europol.  It is generally highly regarded, most recently in a 2012 report following an evaluation of the implementation of the Council decision and of Europol's activities.  While not making any changes to Europol's systems of data protection, the Council decision does establish a data protection officer at Europol.  Although such an officer has always been a part of Europol, the Council decision makes it a formal and independent role.  The functions of the data protection officer are set out in Article 28 of the Council decision and include ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Council decision concerning the processing of personal data.  Where there are concerns regarding compliance, the data protection officer may raise these directly with the director of Europol.<\/p><p>In addition to these safeguards, section 10 addresses the modification, correction and deletion of data, giving effect in the main to Articles 12 and 13 of the Council decision.  These functions are the responsibility of the inputting party.  Data must be deleted, without delay, where it relates to a case where proceedings are definitively dropped or a person is acquitted.  This section also creates an obligation on the national unit or liaison officer, as the case may be, to notify an inputting party of their belief that data input by that party is incorrect or should be supplemented.<\/p><p>Section 11 confirms that the national unit or liaison officers may input, access and retrieve data from the Europol information system for the purpose of preventing and combating those crimes which fall within the competence of Europol.  There is also provision for limited access to the system by the competent authorities who may directly query it, although any data that is located can only be obtained via the national unit.<\/p><p>Section 12 concerns the use of data in the State and confirms that data obtained from any of Europol's processing files shall only be used to prevent and combat criminal offences and other forms of serious crime.  The State is also obliged to abide by any restrictions placed on the use of data although there are some limited circumstances in which restrictions may be waived.  Subsection (3) of section 12 permits the waiving of restrictions in circumstances where a court, legislative body or other body is acting in a supervisory role over the competent authorities.  However, such waiving of restrictions requires the prior consultation of the communicating state or body.  It should also be noted that by virtue of the definition of &quot;criminal offence&quot; in section 1 of the Bill, the use of data is limited to offences for which Europol is competent.<\/p><p>Section 13 provides for access by individuals to personal data.  This provision allows persons to request information as to whether data relating to him or her has been processed by Europol and to have such information communicated to him or her.  Grounds for objecting to a disclosure of data are set out under subsection (5) which permits the State to object where it considers that providing the information would likely prejudice the sovereignty, security or other essential interests of the State, prejudice a criminal investigation or criminal proceeding in the State or would prejudice the rights and freedoms of any person.  This section replicates, in part, section 6 of the Europol Act 1997.<\/p> <p> Section 14 designates the Data Protection Commissioner as the national supervisory body for the purpose of the Act and the Council Decision.  This provision gives effect to Article 33 of the Council Decision and replicates section 7 of the Europol Act 1997.  The national supervisory body is responsible for monitoring the management and processing of personal data by the State in the context of its relationship with Europol.<\/p><p>The section also confirms the authority of the Data Protection Commissioner to access data provided to the Europol Information System and the requirement on the Data Protection Commissioner to inform the Joint Supervisory Body of any action taken with respect to the Europol Information System.  The Joint Supervisory Body is an independent body with the task of ensuring compliance by Europol with data protection principles.  The body is made up of representatives of national data protection authorities, including the Irish Data Protection Commissioner.<\/p><p>It should be further noted that, by virtue of section 15, the Official Secrets Act 1963 applies to facts or information which come to the knowledge of any director, member, employee or other person connected with Europol.  This provision replicates section 9 of the Europol Act 1997.<\/p><p>Section 17 confirms the validity of acts done in accordance with the Europol Act 1997 or the Council decision, prior to the passing of this Bill.  The Council decision establishing Europol applies from 1 January 2010.  As has been mentioned, it repealed and replaced the Europol Convention and its protocols.  However, existing Irish law gave force of law to the convention and its protocols and it is arguable that, as these instruments have now been repealed, the status of the Europol national unit and its powers as set out in the existing legislation is unclear.  Following legal advice, this transitional provision seeks to put beyond doubt the status of the national unit by providing that the acts done by the national unit and liaison officers during the intervening period are valid.  The Attorney General has indicated that: &quot;there is no difficulty in providing retrospective validation of anything done by the existing national unit&quot;.  The remaining provisions are of a standard or technical nature.<\/p><p>Before concluding, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the future of Europol.  Europol has been given responsibility for the establishment of the European Cybercrime Centre which will place it at the forefront in the continuing fight against high-tech organised crime.  Ireland, through the An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na computer crime investigation unit and the staff at the liaison bureau in The Hague, will continue to offer advice and expertise to assist the cybercrime centre when it becomes operational.<\/p><p>In 2013, Europol will publish the serious organised crime threat assessment, or SOCTA.  On the basis of this document, the Council of the European Union will determine its priorities and recommendations for the fight against organised crime in Europe.<\/p><p>Also, in 2013, Ireland will take up the chairmanship of the Europol management board which is Europol's governing board.  This board gives strategic guidance and oversees the implementation of Europol's tasks.  Each year the management board adopts Europol's final budget, the work programme of future activities and a general report on activities carried out during the previous year.  These will be submitted to the Council for endorsement and to the European Parliament for information.<\/p><p>I wish to comment on the future regulation of Europol.  Article 88 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides for a new legal regime for Europol stipulating that Europol shall be governed by a regulation or regulations.  While the main policy objective of the new regulation will be to align Europol's legal base with that treaty, it will, undoubtedly, also seek to address any recommendations arising from the recent evaluation of Europol's activities.<\/p><p>The implementation of the Council decision is an important step in ensuring Europol can adapt in a flexible manner without the need for complicated ratification processes by member states.  The extension of its mandate reflects the very significant contribution which Europol has made to combating serious and organised crime across borders.  Since its establishment in 1995, Europol has evolved to become an essential tool for national law enforcement agencies in their efforts to combat this form of crime.  Such crime is increasingly cross-border and without the overall strategic analysis of an agency such as Europol, combating that crime would be a more difficult task.<\/p><p>I thank members for their attention and look forward to the discussions on the Bill.  I commend this Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900028#CC00700","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354200000,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and the Bill's proposals as set out in the legislation.  Given what the Garda Commissioner said at the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in respect of criminal gangs in Ireland, of which there are 25, there is a huge issue at international level as they are obviously transgressing borders.  He mentioned communications and contacts with the Russian mafia and African crime gangs, and communications in the Middle East with established gangs.  Therefore, it is imperative for Ireland, as a small island on the periphery of Europe, to be involved in Europol and Interpol and in getting as much international support as possible.<\/p><p>I had a question for the Minister who has left the House.  He mentioned a liaison officer who need not necessarily be a member of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na but could be a person from the Revenue Commissioners.  Would it be possible for an officer of the PSNI to be a liaison officer and, if not, why?<\/p><p>There were a series of major drug confiscations off the coastline of west Cork, the region where I am lucky to live.  One of these confiscations involved a huge consignment of drugs found in Dunlough Bay off the Mizen Peninsula.  A number of members of that gang are serving long-term prison sentences.  The second was a yacht with a consignment of cocaine from South America which was brought, almost at sinking point, into Castletownbere.<\/p><p>In the Dunlough Bay incident, although many people claimed credit for it, the fact is the criminals involved were out at dawn of day and left my home village of Kilcrohane having put diesel into a petrol engine.  Had that not happened, as sure as night follows day, they would have headed off to London with their huge consignment of drugs.  I made the point at meetings of Cork County Council many years ago that west Cork was, and still is, a gateway for huge consignments of drugs coming through this country, not necessarily for the Irish market.  That is where the Bill, Interpol and international co-operation can be successful.<\/p><p>In the second incident, where the consignment of drugs came in by yacht to Castletownbere, having been monitored from 50 miles out to sea by the Irish Naval Service, an eye in the sky, so to speak, in some part of Spain or Portugal, was able to track the yacht and, through communication, transmit its precise location from when it left South America all the way to Irish waters.  That proves how international co-operation prevented a major consignment of drugs getting to our shores.  Irrespective of whether it was the intention to land them in Ireland or the UK, we must be ever vigilant and alert in that regard.  Cigarette smuggling is another area where co-operation can help as well as in the areas of human trafficking, prostitution and so on.<\/p><p>To return to the Dunlough Bay consignment of drugs, it is ironic that three of the culprits who are serving long-term prison sentences in Portlaoise Prison were detected, caught and arrested by local garda\u00ed.  Unfortunately, the Garda station at Goleen has since closed and Ballydehob Garda station is basically unmanned.  I think the Garda Commissioner told the joint committee last week there was no economic consideration on savings - or, if so, it was trivial - in the closure of rural Garda stations.  One of the garda\u00ed who was in plain clothes got a tip-off from a farmer.  Were it not for vigilance, an hour later they would have slipped through the net and would have been gone.  The closure of rural Garda stations has a negative impact on rural communities.<\/p><p>There is concern in regard to the whole area of policing.  It may not be fair to lob these grenades at the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, as it was the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, I was planning to ambush, but he has taken leave.  There is concern about the issue of Garda numbers.<\/p> <p>Even though the Garda Commissioner would not admit it, reading between the lines, he is concerned about lack of resources.  He is also concerned that the Garda training unit in Templemore has been shut down for the time being and there will be a terrible deficit in two or three years' time.  With garda\u00ed retiring, the numbers will decline below the famous 13,000 figure which is of grave concern to us.<\/p><p>I recently heard that a new consignment of Garda vehicles was being purchased.  Rather than sending a Garda vehicle from Bandon, Bantry or Clonakilty out to the Mizen when an incident such as the one I mentioned occurs, it is preferable to have the local knowledge of the local garda, working and living in the community.  When someone rings him he knows exactly where to go to make the arrest.  The three lads concerned were mingling among a herd of dairy cows west of Schull.  The farmer became concerned and rang the local garda, who knew exactly where to find them.  They had travelled several miles and were wet.  They had resisted arrest for some days and were it not for that sort of local knowledge and local effort, these three men, all of whom are serving sentences in excess of 20 years, could have easily escaped from the jurisdiction.  They could have got onto a ferry and slipped away unknown.  Local garda\u00ed in their own communities, knowing the local terrain, have a very valuable contribution to make to policing.<\/p><p>As part of a delegation from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, I recently went to Finland and Sweden.  Based on my experience of travelling and meeting ministers for justice and senior police officers, the world seems to be becoming a smaller place.  It is essential to have international co-operation not just within Europe, but also beyond.  While I support the entire thrust of the Bill, my remarks are in criticism of the Minister on other issues.  We need to have complete co-operation with other international police agencies in Europe and beyond.  It is well known that bulk of the smuggled cigarettes are coming from eastern Europe and Russia.  It has been said that less than 10% of the illegal cigarettes available for sale in this country have been captured.  While the Garda Commissioner could not confirm or deny this to us when we questioned him, it is well known that a substantial proportion of the illicit drugs coming into the country go undetected.  While I do not know how accurate these figures are, I understand that 80% of the drugs that come into Ireland are not detected, which is frightening when we consider some of the big hauls that have been captured.  It is a tough battle to stay on top of the 25 criminal gangs operating in places like Cork, Sligo, Limerick, Dublin and other centres.  It is frightening to think that they have the capacity to do business thousands of miles away.  In order to keep on top of these criminals, it is important that we have co-operation with Interpol and this new Europol.<\/p><p>This legislation will copper fasten something that is in place already.  It is important legislation.  I apologise to the Minister of State for lobbing a few grenades in her direction.  They were targeted at the senior Minister, who, I am sure, would love to return and address the fears I have about rural Garda stations, garda numbers falling and a lack of resources.  I might have a chance to do that another day.  The Minister of State should not take it personally - it was intended for the senior Minister, who, I presume, knew I was going to launch an attack and slipped away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900030#EE00200","speaker":"1127","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354200600,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and I welcome the Bill.  I trust she will be sufficiently robust to deal with the situation as outlined by Senator O'Donovan.  As I listened to the Senator giving us a lovely meandering geographical tour from eyes in the sky to the dairy farms of west County Cork to the Garda station in Bandon and on to the bays of west County Cork, I was reminded of our former colleague, Mr. P.J. Sheehan, who always gave us such evocative and interesting tours of the countryside during his parliamentary career.  Of course the son of the said former Deputy, who is a councillor in Goleen, was one of the people who came across that famous drugs haul a number of years ago - at least he claimed credit for having done so.  Perhaps that is how the Sheehan family operated so well on the political front for a number of years.<\/p><p>Obviously I welcome the Bill, which further strengthens what needs to be done throughout Europe in tackling crime.  Just as society has changed and Europe has changed, so has crime.  Some 20 years ago if we had been discussing crime on this island and co-operation between the Garda and the then RUC, which is now the PSNI, we would have been talking almost exclusively about paramilitary crime.  Sadly, some of that still exists and needs to be tackled on an ongoing basis.  We now have different and, in some sense, more terrible crime, involving illicit drugs, arms dealing and prostitution, all of which need to be tackled.  In the Europe of 25 years ago when we had the Berlin Wall, and the Continent was geographically and politically divided between East and West, there was a different type of threat to the security of Europe.  Thankfully, that has passed, but every threat is replaced by a new threat and now organised crime, terror gangs, drugs gangs, and practitioners of all sorts of illegalities are continually threatening the individual citizens of Europe in ways that may be small or big.<\/p><p>In the first place the resources required by national police forces must - in so far as possible - be provided and we also need the highest possible levels of co-operation between police forces.  This legislation is about ensuring that those structures are in place and I welcome it.  The more co-operation we have between the police forces of Europe, the better and obviously results will be achieved.  We will never get to read about many of the results because in many cases they do not bring about convictions but rather prevent crimes from being committed by warding off criminals from pursuing certain activities, which is welcome.<\/p><p>At the commencement of his speech, the Minister said that Europol is about making Europe safer and obviously we all support that purpose.  He outlined some detail of the contents of the legislation.  The previous speaker mentioned fuel laundering.  I am sure Senator Whelan will speak about the matter, as it is something about which he has previously spoken in this House.  Fuel laundering along the Border gives rise to huge losses to the Exchequer.  It has been the cause of difficulty for many motorists, who ended up buying an inferior quality fuel necessitating costly repairs to their cars.  The Revenue Commissioners are losing countless millions of euro per annum and the progress in tackling this problem has been relatively disappointing.  It is great to talk about European security and co-operation at a continent-wide level, but here in our own island of 32 counties and two jurisdictions further progress is needed on fuel laundering.  I would like to see the Europol resources and thinking applied in that area.<\/p><p>At the conclusion of this contribution, the Minister highlighted some aspects of the future of Europol.<\/p> <p>It shows how we need to change with the changing times.  He spoke of the establishment of the European Cybercrime Centre.  Ten or 15 years ago, none of us could pronounce the word.  Cybercrime was certainly something that one might have associated with \"Star Wars\" or next generation matters, but we are the next generation and we must deal with-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900031#FF00200","speaker":"1121","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354201200,"counter":328,"content":"<p>Dr. Spook.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900032#GG00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1354201200,"counter":329,"content":"<p>There are still a few Klingons hanging around.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900032#GG00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1354201200,"counter":330,"content":"<p>Indeed, there are certainly a few political Klingons, but the Senator is coming our way and need not worry.  Obviously, cybercrime must be tackled with modern resources and I welcome the progress that will be made in that regard.<\/p><p>The data protection side of the issue will cause a certain amount of concern to a number of persons.  Data protection is a sensitive area.  All of us would like to think that any information retained about ourselves would be kept safely and securely and would be deleted and disposed of as soon as it serves no useful purpose to any agency.  It is a question of balance.  In a perfectly libertarian society where everybody is entitled to do what he or she wishes within the law, and to be as removed as one possibly can be from regulation and monitoring, and Big Brother, the question of data protection and data retention would not arise, but we need such data retention from the point of view of knowing who are the major threats, be they groups, organisations or individuals.  The Europol arrangement probably strikes a fair balance between the rights of the citizen to have his or her details protected insofar as possible and the obligations of states and security forces to have access to the sort of information which they require to tackle crime.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill.  It will put in place strengthened regulation.  We must welcome any regulation which will result in one less illegal cigarette being sold, one less illegal litre of diesel being sold, one gram less of illegal drugs on the streets of Dublin and one less unfortunate person being trafficked across the State or the states of Europe, and gift the resources to ensure it will be done.  The Bill was passed by the other House with ease and I am sure it be similar here.

The Bill is certainly welcome.  I cannot see how anyone would have any objection to it.<\/p><p>I had a friend in the supermarket business in Holland some years ago who was kidnapped and I was impressed at the speed at which the local police were able to move across borders to see if they could identify the criminal.  Unfortunately, they were not able to move quickly enough because he was murdered that same day.  The reason I mention this is that it is the speed at which they were able to cross borders, and, therefore, the need for Europol and all of the technology that it can provide, that is essential to us.  If nothing else, it seems the aim is to be a deterrent so that those criminals who are thinking of acting in a manner not in the public interest are deterred from doing so because of the speed at which the police forces of the various countries can move and also they way that they can co-operate.  There needs to be as much technology as possible if we are to succeed with that.  I think of young Ms Madeleine McCann who was kidnapped and disappeared.  While she was close enough to other borders - it was in Portugal but close to Spain - the kidnappers could cross borders quickly.  If we are to compete with the criminals we must have the same ability to compete as they have.<\/p><p>There was mention of cigarette smuggling.  We were visited last week by the retailers who are concerned about it, the scale of which is significant.  Senator Bradford mentioned that only a fraction of the amount of cigarettes that come into the country are detected.  The issue is not only cigarette smuggling, but counterfeit cigarettes.  We can use technology but I do not think the authorities are doing so.  I understand that when a container comes into an Irish port, there are only two scanners capable of identifying illegal goods and I am told only one of those is able to work at a time.  If this is to work, we must use international co-operation, the best technology, aim at ensuring we have the capability to act speedily and, most importantly, act as a deterrent.<\/p><p>This is a worthy step forward.  I understand that it will make us more alert and more capable of being able to compete, and we need to do this if we are to protect ourselves in the future.  I support the Bill.

It is, perhaps, housekeeping, a sensible piece of legal scaffolding or necessary infrastructure.  I am surprised it has taken this long to put it in place but I commend the Minister and the Government for bringing it to this stage.<\/p><p>We enjoy all of the benefits, privileges and flexibility that have been brought to us by a European Union without frontiers and borders, and we have enjoyed the free movement of labour, goods and services.  As anyone who has travelled abroad in recent years will be aware, a person can get into his or her car in Ireland and go to a football match in Poznan without meeting any roadblock, checkpoint or border control.  Likewise, crime knows no boundaries and criminals certainly do not respect borders.<\/p><p>To some extent, we are coming late in the day to put in place this kind of infrastructure insofar as there has been a borderless Europe for decades.  We are playing catch-up in such areas as sex offenders and human trafficking.  The drugs gangs are exploiting this opportunity to drive across Europe and into Britain and Ireland unimpeded and unchecked.<\/p><p>As other Members pointed out, it is reeking havoc in communities.  It is not merely an urban problem.  While the Garda Commissioner pointed out that the criminal gangs operate out of the major urban centres, I was horrified in recent weeks that a man was shot down in his own home in front of his children in Portarlington, which is not by any means a big town.  The impact of such organised crime of drugs smuggling has reached its tentacles into every corner and part of Ireland; it is not only a Dublin, Cork or Limerick phenomenon.  We read in the newspapers in recent days of where criminal gangs are turning their hands to skimming credit cards and bank cards, and this is an international pursuit.  We must get with it, get smart and get wise, and match up in terms of combating and preventing this crime.  It is possible to do so.<\/p><p>Hardly a month goes by without the detection of serious fuel laundering operations along the Border with the North.  It is damaging, in terms of the loss of revenue to the State but it is also crippling legitimate businesses and making it difficult for legitimate petrol stations and hauliers to operate and match up to such sculduggery.  It is high time that we put the resources into this and this begs the following question of the Minister.<\/p> <p>To what is extent is the Europol dedicated unit in Garda headquarters in the Phoenix Park resourced?  There is very little point in paying lip-service to this type of co-operation without resourcing it.<\/p><p>People who came before the District Court in the midlands for offences such as stalking or sex offences were deported to their native country in the EU rather than being incarcerated here.  Is there an exchange of information with the authorities in the countries to which these people are being returned?  In the case I have in mind, the person convicted had a string of previous convictions in his native country, but such people are able to arrive in Ireland unimpeded.  Are the Garda authorities notified that such a person is roaming the towns and streets of our country?  It is a serious matter and not one that would be lost on the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch.  I would like to have an opportunity to raise it directly with the Minister, Deputy Shatter.<\/p><p>I support the point made by Senator O'Donovan.  We speak about modern policing and how it has evolved and that it is not necessary to have bricks and mortar and a Garda station at every corner in every village.  I would go along with this, but it does not mean we do not need the personnel.  We cannot have the shrinkage that has taken place in Garda numbers and resources and state garda\u00ed are gathering information and intelligence on the ground.  One cannot beat local knowledge, and the advantages of the relationship a local garda has in his or her community and organisations were well illustrated by Senator O'Donovan.<\/p><p>It is ironic that we speak about co-operation to prevent transnational crime throughout Europe when, I am ashamed to state, in towns such as Mountmellick people are accosted while bringing their children to school or driving up the streets.  Some local shops and businesses have had to put locks and buzzers on their doors so they can allow people enter.  We cannot continue to turn a blind eye to this and state we can continue to reduce front-line services.  We must make savings, and we are under the cosh from the troika to reduce spending, but we must ask at what stage we enter diminishing returns.  One could go through towns throughout the country the size of Portarlington and Mountmellick for a week or a fortnight and not encounter a garda on the beat or a Garda patrol car.  This allows criminal elements, including organised criminal elements, to get on with their dastardly deeds virtually unimpeded because there is no one to keep an eye on them.<\/p><p>The cost to the State of criminality, trying to solve crimes and fighting a rear-guard action afterwards is greater than ensuring we have a Garda presence in towns.  Having garda\u00ed on the beat makes people feel safe and secure in their businesses and on the main thoroughfares.  We cannot continue to reduce Garda numbers and suggest it has no impact on deterring and preventing crime, or on the feeling of security of people as they go about their daily routine seeing garda\u00ed, as was traditionally the case, walking the beat in twos and meeting people or going through the town on a rotation in a patrol car keeping an eye out for ne'er-do-wells and criminal elements which would exploit an opportunity.<\/p><p>We have reached diminishing returns in the scaleback of numbers.  The Garda Commissioner confirmed to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality that a further 1,200 garda\u00ed are due to retire but the Garda training centre in Templemore remains closed.  Even if it was re-opened next year it would take two full years before we had a new squad of young trained garda\u00ed on the streets.  We cannot be dismissive or offhand about this.  Serious consideration must be given to this by the Minister and the Government.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to relay these concerns of people in towns throughout the country.<\/p><p>I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill.  I hope it will lead to continued success in deterring criminal gangs operating in and out of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900032#GG00600","speaker":"1143","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354201800,"counter":334,"content":"<p>Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire St\u00e1it.

This is necessary in line with bringing Irish legislation in line with the European Council decision which brought Europol within the EU\u2019s institutional framework, and it does to some limited degree improve the accountability of Europol to the European structures and potentially to the European Parliament.  It is on this basis we will not oppose the Bill.<\/p><p>The Minister of State will be familiar with the concerns that Sinn F\u00e9in has about the growing European justice infrastructure.  Similar to many other areas of policy, European institutions are taking on competences beyond their original remit and expanding their powers.  We believe there is an agenda at the highest levels of the European institutions, and in particular those parts of it not directly elected, to ease us gradually and quietly into a European superstate, something for which there is neither a popular mandate nor popular demand.<\/p><p>The evidence of such a trend, the trend of ever closer union as many of the EU's top brass would call it, is especially evident in the area of justice.  A number of EU justice system features are being developed in addition to the current ones, namely, the European Court of Justice and Europol, which are more characteristic of a state than of a union of nation states.  Most obviously, justice as a policy area was removed from the intergovernmental sphere and became an area of community law under the Lisbon treaty.  We have seen, or will soon see, the development of a border control agency, a common immigration policy, a European public prosecutor and an incrementally harmonised and integrated justice system, including joint investigation teams and EU-wide arrest warrants.<\/p><p>Sinn F\u00e9in does not support the development of EU superstate architecture in respect of justice matters, and for this reason it opposed the EU five-year justice and home affairs harmonisation plan known as the Hague programme, which ran from 2005 to 2010.  We do not support the creation of a so-called European legal area with a European criminal code and a European public prosecutor.  We believe it is important that nation states retain sovereignty over the area of justice policy.  This is not to preclude genuine co-operation and intergovernmental action, but what it does mean is that the primary responsibility has to lie with them.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding this, we have adopted an approach of critical engagement with these institutions, and with these changes in agreements.  We will, on a case-by-case basis, decide whether such a change would be in the interests of the Irish people or not, on the basis of whether it respects or fundamentally compromises national sovereignty over justice, whether it is proportionate and necessary, and its consequences for human rights protections, social and economic equality, and minorities.<\/p><p>With regard to the particularities of Europol, Sinn F\u00e9in is not opposed in principle to inter-jurisdictional police co-operation in the investigation of serious crimes with a cross-border dimension where it is necessary, where appropriate safeguards and accountability mechanisms are in place, and where it is jointly authorised on a case-by-case basis.  We support effective action against cross-border organised crime, including trafficking in human beings and drugs.<\/p><p>Europol's primary focus is on intelligence-sharing between the law enforcement agencies of the EU member states.  Previously it has operated as a body which was a separate international institution funded by individual member states.  We are now bringing it into the EU institutional framework, which is welcome.  The European Court of Justice has had limited jurisdiction over its operations, and it will be now be accountable to the European Union Council of Ministers.  I hope the Bill has the capacity to make it more accountable to the European Parliament, the only directly elected EU institution, as recommended in the Council decision.<\/p> <p> We have some concerns about the operation of Europol, particularly as it pertains to information about citizens.  Information lawfully obtained in the Irish jurisdictions should only be made available to and used by the authorities in another state for a legitimate purpose, that is, for the detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences that are - this is the key point - analogous to offences in the Irish jurisdiction or for the prevention of an immediate and serious threat to public safety in another State, provided that a criminal investigation subsequently is conducted.  Garda or police intelligence should not change hands for its own sake when there is no criminal investigation, for this potentially violates the right to privacy.<\/p><p>The Schengen information system is Europe's largest security database.  It started out principally as an electronic system for migration control and deportations.  Such data can also include a list of &quot;persons to be submitted for discreet surveillance ... for the prevention of threats to public security&quot;.  It therefore has obvious implications for the right to data protection, privacy and other civil liberties.<\/p><p>The new second generation information system, SIS-11 database has been extended to contain biometric data and information on extradition, EU arrest warrants and third country nationals refused entry to the EU.  The Government has introduced biometric passports and these biometrics will be stored on the SIS-11.  We will all soon be on it.  There is no need to request this information from the national authority from which it originates and there is no need to explain to the national authority why it is being requested.<\/p><p>Moreover, Europol will be able to share this sensitive information with third countries, perhaps with the United States, and we are all aware of the abuses that may be carried out in this context.  There is a need for safeguards in this regard and full respect for and enforcement of data protection rights.  We ask the Minister and the Government to fight this battle at European level.<\/p><p>We can support inter-jurisdictional police co-operation on investigation of serious crimes with a cross-border dimension where there are appropriate safeguards and accountability mechanisms in place.  However, we do not support the operation of foreign police forces in the Irish jurisdiction, especially where such forces are not subject to domestic policing oversight and accountability mechanisms and therefore does not support the use of joint investigation teams.  The joint investigation team's powers introduced by domestic legislation in 2004 go beyond the existing Interpol and Europol mechanisms for police co-operation and information-sharing.<\/p><p>However, on balance we are happy to support this legislation, given its technical nature, the fact that it is necessary in terms of bringing us into line with the EU and that there is a small improvement in accountability.

I too am happy to support this important technical Bill.  During his contribution, the Minister, Deputy Shatter outlined in great detail the benefits in terms of the security of the State and of Europe.  Over the years we have developed an<i> ad hoc <\/i>system of co-operation with other police forces, however, under the provisions of the Bill we will create a police architecture that will ensure co-operation and that we are best equipped to fight organised crime.  Organised crime will always be one step ahead of the detection and prosecution of crime.  Let us hope we are only one step behind because if organised crime gains ground, it will take us twice as long to catch up.  We co-operate effectively with the PSNI in Northern Ireland.  We are joined at the hip in terms of dealing with crime on both sides of the Border.  I respectfully suggest we have an excellent working relationship with the police force of Great Britain.<\/p><p>  One often hears of a person absconding to Spain or France after committing a crime in Ireland.  Let us hope that absconding to France or Spain becomes redundant as a result of the provisions of this Bill.  The only way is to co-operate.  We are an European unit.  We have been very successful in terms of the free movement of persons, goods and services.<\/p><p>  Following the Second World War, when Europe was nearly ripped apart, the European project was initiated.  Who would have thought back in the late 1940s that by the turn of the next century, we would be where we are now?  There is a determination that European states will work together as a friendly neighbourly unit and will be able to compete effectively with the United States, China and other major conglomerates.  We probably need to improve the structure to co-operate in terms of crime prevention and detection.  That is why this Bill is very important.  I am very heartened that it is being supported unanimously.<\/p><p>  We are all working against crime.  We are determined to break organised crime.  This city has suffered at the hands of organised crime and drug dealers.  At a recent sitting of the justice joint committee the Garda Commissioner outlined in great detail the 21 criminal gangs operating out of the cities with spurs in every town and village.  He also advised us that these gangs have close links with organised gangs throughout Europe and as far away as Russia.  The level of sophistication of these criminal gangs is remarkable.  Since the murder of Ms Veronica Guerin in 1996 we have seen how some of these criminals have enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle in places such as Spain.  We have also seen the Spanish authorities apprehend some of the most high profile gang leaders who had absconded from Ireland and bring them to justice.  The co-operation is evident, but we need to bed it down and develop it and bring it to a higher professional level in order to ensure that neither Spain nor Ireland are attractive destination for criminals, as we are all working as a single entity to take on terrorists, drug dealers who destroy the lives of thousands of citizens throughout Europe.<\/p><p>  I am very happy to support this important Bill.

While the unit is considered to be adequately staffed, I understand the reason for the question.  If legislation such as this Bill is to be passed, as the Senator quite rightly pointed out it is important that it be adequately resourced<\/p><p>I again thank Members for their contributions today.  The issues raised will be brought to the attention of the Minister and no doubt will be discussed further on Committee Stage.  I accept this is a technical Bill that may have little operational impact on existing arrangements between Europol and the State.  However, this Bill provides an opportunity to remind oneself of the threat of international crime and the importance of co-operation between the law enforcement authorities of this State and international partners such as Europol.  In the case of this State and its particular circumstances, my reference to &quot;international&quot; reminds one there is a Border very close to this location, which also must be protected in terms of co-operation and information.  It should be remembered the Council decision was motivated primarily by the need to introduce a more flexible legal basis for Europol and it achieves this aim.  While there have been some changes to the provisions relating to the governance of Europol, the most significant change from an operational perspective has been the extension of Europol's competence to include all forms of serious crime when two or more European Union member states are affected.  Importantly, the need to show evidence of organised criminal activity has been removed.  This is an important development in so far as it removes an unnecessary obstacle to Europol's involvement in the investigation of international criminal activity.  However, it also reflects the increasing emphasis at European Union level on closer co-operation between member states.  Europol is an investigative resource for member states, the effectiveness of which is determined by the action and response of member states to information from that organisation.  Ireland has an effective relationship with Europol, which was evidenced through some of the examples the Minister already has outlined in his earlier contribution.  The importance of cross-border co-operation in the fight against crime cannot be underestimated and the European Union is continually seeking to improve information exchange between member states.  While one sometimes imagines or envisages that this pertains to major international gangs, which are all covered in this respect, as Members including Senators O'Donovan, Whelan, Bradford and Conway have outlined, it also is about matters such as fuel laundering, cigarette smuggling and other activities one sometimes thinks of as being almost benign but which in fact have a huge impact on revenue, of which the State is desperately in need.<\/p><p>In 2008, a Council decision was made which is known as the permanent decision.  It is a further step in European co-operation in the fight against crime and terrorism.  The decision allows for shared access by member states to national databases of DNA profiles, fingerprint data and vehicle registration for the purposes of criminal investigation.  In so far as it relates to DNA profiles and fingerprint data, the forthcoming criminal justice, forensic evidence and DNA database system, Bill will make the necessary legislative provision.  This Bill is being drafted at present and is due to be published shortly.  I also wish to mention briefly the steps taken at European Union level to improve the exchange of information in respect of criminal records and this is an issue in which Senator Whelan was interested.  Under a 2009 framework decision in which an EU national is convicted in one member state, that state shall automatically notify the member state of which the convicted person is a national.  Legislation to give effect to this framework decision also is currently being drafted.  Notwithstanding these and other developments over the years, Europol has, since 1995, proven its effectiveness in supporting national law enforcement agencies in their efforts to combat crime.  Recognising that support, the Council decision to which this legislation will give effect provides Europol with an up-to-date legal basis, placing it on a par with other European Union agencies in the area of police and judicial co-operation.  I welcome the support Members have given to this Bill, which recognises the important role that Europol plays in supporting law enforcement authorities across the European Union in fighting crime and I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900034#JJ00700","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354203000,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1354203000,"counter":344,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900035#KK00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1354203000,"counter":345,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900035#KK00400","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354203000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 4 December 2012.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1354203000,"counter":347,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900035#KK00500","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1354203000,"counter":348,"content":"<p>Ag 10 maidin am\u00e1rach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900035#KK00600","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Adjournment Matters","time":1354203000,"count":349,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900035#KK00700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","time":1354203000,"count":350,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900035#KK00750"},{"type":"speech","time":1354203000,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I am sure the Minister of State seeks no great introduction to this motion but while I do not often use tough language, inside or outside this Chamber, what has happened in respect of home help is nothing short of being scurrilous and is attacking people at the very coalface.  On the one hand, Government policy suggests and advocates that in so far as possible, one should keep people at home rather than putting them into hospitals, homes or institutions, while on the other hand, the cutbacks that now have occurred are affecting in a very tough way the old, the vulnerable, the sick and the lonely.  This is true in particular in HSE south, as according to the information I have, the impact appears to vary in different parts of Ireland.  In many such instances, people's home help, sometimes available for two or three hours per week, has sustained them in their own homes.  The home help calls in and might get such people up and out, get them washed, get them breakfast or whatever.<\/p><p>More than 30 people contacted me to express their deep concern that the cuts to their home help provision would compel them to eventually end up in nursing homes.  The Minister of State is aware that the cost of keeping people in a nursing home or public hospital is very significant in comparison with keeping them in their own homes in their own environment.  In this context, the few euro spent every week on home helps is a very small amount in comparison with what would be the cost to the State otherwise.  As for the cutbacks, I attended a meeting at which one home help, who obviously would not go public, stated she had five half-hours with five different people in the west Cork area.  Incidentally, it is another disgrace that home helps are not allowed to open their mouths for fear that they could lose their jobs, such is the contract into which they have entered with the HSE.  The aforementioned person observed that the logistics of this allocation mean that as soon has she given someone a ring and perhaps boiled the kettle to make a cup of tea for the unfortunate elderly person, the half hour is up and she then is rushing from A to B to C.  It is a ridiculous situation and some of the people I have met, who provide the home help, have never complained in the past.  Their hours have been cut and obviously they are trying to make a living out of it, as it is a career for some of them.  One must have a certain amount of compassion and training to become a home help and in this regard, the cutbacks are having an impact in the first instance on those for whom they are caring.  These cuts make no sense when one considers the logistics and it is a case of being penny wise and pound foolish.  In many instances, I am of the view that eventually, the elderly people who are dependent on the three, four or five hours per week - or whatever they are given - of home help, will be obliged, because of the lack of those few hours, to end up in homes.  In some cases, this will cost the State a lot more than what currently is being paid to the home helps.  I believe the situation is grave and these cutbacks should be rolled back.  Given all the issues that can happen in the forthcoming budget, I note some Departments such as those responsible for social welfare and education and so on are being protected.<\/p> <p>We are protecting some Departments, such as the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills.  I am sure every decent person in government or elsewhere believes that protecting our old and vulnerable should be at the core but I do not believe that is happening.  I am also very concerned that the cuts in some areas are far deeper and more severe.  Last week in the other House, Deputy Denis Naughten said he got an answer under a freedom of information request stating that cuts in HSE south were the worst of all.  In other words, the people in Cork county and city and in Kerry, who are complaining, have reason to do so because they have been targeted.  The knife has entered more deeply into their system and the cuts have been far more severe than elsewhere.  The Minister of State may have some good news for me.  This is a very serious situation which needs to be addressed urgently. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900035#KK00800","speaker":"1127","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354203600,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Senator O'Donovan knows me long enough to know I would share his sentiments in regard to people who receive home help.  They are not all elderly, although the majority are, but most definitely they are in need of assistance to support them in the community.  I am afraid we will not know if there is good or bad news until after the budget which is still under negotiation.<\/p><p>The Government's policy firmly remains to support older people to live at home and in their communities for as long as possible.  This is realised by the Health Service Executive through a range of community-based services, such as mainstream home help, enhanced home care packages or by other supports such as meals-on-wheels, respite care or day care.  These services, often delivered in partnership with non-statutory agencies, are designed to be as flexible as possible to best meet the needs of individual recipients and their families.  Overall, approximately 100,000 people - 20% of those over 65 years of age - receive some form of HSE community-based supports each year, whether home care, day care, respite, etc.  <\/p><p>On the immediate front, this has been a challenging year for the health services overall, including maintaining home care services in line with evolving resource pressures.  The overall provision of these services is, therefore, regularly reviewed at national and local levels in the context of assessed client need against resource availability. <\/p><p>The HSE has a statutory responsibility to live within its budget voted by the Oireachtas.  In this context, the HSE developed a range of proposals to reduce spending between now and the end of the year.  In my opinion, that was way too short a framework and that is why the difficulty arose.  It is a priority for the HSE to minimise the impact on clients of any spending reductions in the home help area.  The HSE service plan target for this year was to deliver 10.7 million home help hours.  The measures now being implemented envisage that almost 10.3 million home help hours will be provided this year to more than 50,000 people.  Again, I think it was the timeline that caused the most difficulty. <\/p><p>The HSE is making every effort to ensure that services are provided in the first instance for direct patient care.  Decisions in regard to the provision of home help hours will continue to be based on an assessment of individual needs and no current recipient of home help, who has an assessed need for this, will be without a service.  That message has gone out very loud and clear from the Minister for Health in the past few weeks.<\/p><p>The particular focus now is to identify those who are most dependent and require personal care services and maintain these clients by, if necessary, reducing the lesser dependent household duties such as shopping, cleaning, etc., even though I know it is these things which sometimes maintain people at home.  The current review will also identify those whose health or circumstances have improved and whose hours can be reduced in order to facilitate new applicants or those requiring increased care.  Home help hours are, therefore, recycled back into the system on a regular basis.  The action originally planned by the HSE was to save approximately \u20ac8 million by reducing home help hours between now and the end of December - approximately 400,000 hours - and to save approximately \u20ac1.2 million by reducing home care packages.  <\/p><p>The latest information available indicates that in trying to balance overall projected financial savings for the home help budget nationally, against maintaining adequate service in individual cases, the HSE will probably not meet the savings target envisaged.  The position is being kept under review by the HSE and the Department of Health to ensure that the objective of reducing overall expenditure does not compromise maintaining assessed service to existing recipients.  The HSE and the Department of Health are monitoring activity and financial trends in regard to home help on a weekly basis.  Whatever action is deemed necessary between now and year end will be undertaken to balance the objectives I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900036#LL00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1354203600,"counter":354,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's response does not tally with the reports I am getting, some of which are first hand.  It is very mean of any Government - in the past, I criticised my own party in government on many issues - to try to save money from the home help service because it provides value for money.  As the Minister of State knows, in many instances, the only contact some people have with the outside world is the home help who comes in for one or two hours.  Our citizens deserve that service and instead of cutting back in this area, money should be found somewhere else.<\/p><p>Today or yesterday a Government Senator made a very valid point that there have been cutbacks in front-line services, including an embargo on the recruitment of nurses, but apparently the number of administrative staff in the HSE has hardly been touched.  The HSE is top heavy with administrative staff but there have been cuts to the number of nurses at the coalface, where we need them most, and home helps.  <\/p><p>Will the Minister of State bring back the message to the Minister, Deputy Reilly, that what is happening on the ground is appalling, that there should be no cut backs in home help hours and that in the context of the few million euro he is saving, he is being penny wise but pound foolish because many people will end up in respite care but will not return home as there will be nobody to care for them.  It will cost the State twenty times what it is currently costing to keep people at home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900036#LL00300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1354203600,"counter":355,"content":"<p>There is no disagreement between us.

Yesterday a report by Professor Ivan Perry of UCC was reported in the media.  A study found the fact that people are obese or overweight is costing the country \u20ac1.1 billion every year.  That cost is based on scientific evidence, so we should take it very seriously, and that is not to mention the effect on the health of these individuals and their demeanour.  I am sure their mental health suffers in many cases as well.<\/p> <p>It is estimated in the report that two thirds of the cost is as a result of absenteeism and lost productivity due to back pain and the remainder is as a result cost of health care, be it GP, drug costs, physiotherapy and everything else that goes with being overweight and having certain conditions such as heart disease, colorectal and other types of cancer, type 2 diabetes and stroke.  We must be clear about how we will tackle this issue.  We must target children and young people to ensure these problems are not carried by them into adulthood.  The Growing Up in Ireland report on Ireland's 13 year olds was published today and it found a quarter of those surveyed are overweight or obese.  It also found almost 40% of girls were trying to lose weight. <\/p><p>Obesity has a huge impact on children so we must tackle it now in order that it does not become an even greater problem later in life.  We must encourage good habits in terms of eating and exercise.  Young people who are overweight are also at risk of developing asthma and diabetes.<\/p><p>We are doing a lot in schools about exercise and while it is unfair to target schools all the time, the children are in a learning environment there and it is where they form the habit of exercising with their peers.  The environment in schools, however, with tuck shops and vending machines filled with crisps, sweets and sugary drinks, was mentioned in the report.  We should consider banning the sale of junk food in schools.  Children are in school to learn and making such foods available is not conducive to developing healthy eating or the habit of exercise.<\/p><p>We must also talk about labelling in supermarkets.  Tesco and Lidl are considering this but in Britain, all supermarkets are introducing the traffic light system of labelling, whereby a red traffic light means a food should be avoided, amber means it should be eaten in moderation and green means it can be freely consumed.  That would assist people to make healthy choices for their eating and shopping habits.<\/p><p>There are many other areas where action can be taken.  The Restaurants Association of Ireland is putting calorific values on menus, although some restaurants are resistant to the idea, which I understand because anyone who has attended a cookery course with Darina Allen knows that she considers full fat butter and full fat cream as essential for flavour.  We must be aware, however, of the effect of such ingredients on health and the development of habits that young people will continue in adulthood.<\/p><p>In the United States, the First Lady, Michelle Obama, is playing a strong role in tackling obesity.  As a Government, we should be developing policies that keep this issue to the fore to ensure the message gets through and we develop a healthier population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900036#LL00500","speaker":"1114","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354204200,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I was at a conference on older people recently where I heard that a study in Sweden has outlined that poor nutrition will kill more and cost more than obesity.  Eating the wrong types of food will have a more detrimental effect.  We sometimes forget that.  Equally, the Growing Up in Ireland study told us about far more than just the issue of obesity.  It also told us our 13 year olds are happy and we must look at that.  There is always a contradiction between our children being healthy and active and being careful that they do not obsess about body image, which brings with it even more complications and difficulties.  It is not as straightforward as we sometimes think.  We must be balanced and careful.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Health received the report The Cost of Overweight and Obesity on the Island of Ireland, funded by <i>safe<\/i>food Ireland and conducted by UCC.  This study provides reliable figures for the annual economic cost of weight related ill health in Ireland.  Initial findings estimate the annual cost to be &#8364;1.13 billion.  The direct health care costs are &#8364;398 million, or 35% of total costs.  In addition to this, two thirds of the economic costs were indirect costs in reduced or lost productivity and absenteeism, and these amounted to &#8364;728 million.<\/p><p>  These figures show a compelling case for obesity prevention based on changes in our food environment and physical activity levels.  Obesity is the major health problem in Ireland, with studies showing that two out of every three adults, one in four primary school children and one in five teenagers are overweight or obese.  Of particular concern is that in children as young as three years of age, one in four are overweight or obese.<\/p><p>  Since entering office, the Minister for Health has made overweight and obesity a public health priority and has established a special action group on obesity.  The group comprises key stakeholders and is chaired by the Department of Health.  The Department recognises that no single initiative will reverse this growing trend but a combination of measures should make a difference.<i><\/i> Currently, the special action group is concentrating on measures such as calorie posting in restaurants.  The Minister has met food outlets and held a national consultation, and a tool to support food outlets in working out the calorie content of meals is being developed and a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks<b><\/b>has been introduced.  The group<b><\/b>has carried out a health impact assessment and presented to the Minister a proposal based on the evidence for consideration.  Action has been taken on the marketing of food and drinks to children<b><\/b>and the group<b><\/b>is working with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland on new codes to restrict marketing of high fat, high salt and high sugar foods and drinks until 7 p.m.  There has been action on the supply of healthy food products in vending machines.  On the detection and treatment of obesity, three specialist obesity treatment centres have been established.  The group is promoting the healthy eating and physical activity guidelines that were published this year and considering a physical activity plan.<\/p><p>  The group is taking a cross-sectoral approach to help halt the rise in overweight and obesity.  Of major importance is the new health and well-being framework for Ireland which will be launched as part of Ireland's Presidency of the EU.  This is an overarching strategic framework for sustained action to improve the health and well-being of the nation and will have as its key goals an increase in the number of Irish people who are healthy at all stages of life, the reduction of health inequalities, the protection of the public from threats to health and<br>well-being, and the creation of an environment where every sector of society can play its part.  This new framework will further prioritise the importance of preventing overweight and obesity in the Irish population, particularly in children.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112900037#MM00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1354204200,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that comprehensive reply.
