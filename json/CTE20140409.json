The preparation of our submission has been informed by international research, consultations with principals' associations around the world and feedback from the 3,500 principals of primary schools who have approximately 500,000 children in their care every day.<\/p><p>  We face a major challenge because we are failing to harness the power of leadership in schools.<\/p> <p>I want for a moment to plant the thought among the members that the effect of a principal in a school is similar to the effect in yeast in dough.  Our education system may not be the best in the world but it is not far off  that when we peel back some of the layers, and that gap can be bridged if our school principals are empowered to be leaders of learning, a theme to which I will return.  By empowering principals to be true leaders of learning in schools, we can significantly improve the educational outcomes for children and prepare them for the world of tomorrow, which is a very different world.<\/p><p> It is unrealistic and unsustainable to entangle principals with the myriad of tasks that have nothing to do with their role.  Imagine the reaction of an airline company if it found that its CEO was doing work such as cleaning the airplanes between journeys?  We do not have a focus in this country yet about the idea of the principal being the leader of learning as opposed to the leader of other work in a school.  There are many challenges but the committee will be glad to know that we have solutions to these challenges.  <\/p><p> There are eight themes in our submission but I will address only two because there is not the time to address them all.  I will deal first with the early stages of a principal's career, namely, the recruitment and appointment phase.  We must attract the best teachers into leadership roles in our schools.  There is a saying among principals that good teachers do not always make good principals but poor teachers never make good principals.  A principal teacher, first and foremost, must be a good teacher because to refer to it as Gaeilge, it is pr&iacute;omh oide -  the main teacher, but that is something that we not value enough.<\/p><p> Many people think that teachers apply for principalship as a promotion but in reality the research shows that the main motivation people have to become a principal is largely that they have a belief that they are a good teacher and they want their philosophy and  methodology of teaching to be over a full school, and not only their classroom, through the influence that they can have on teachers.  Getting the right teacher for a school is critical.  If that is not done, the implications are profound, particularly for the children.  <\/p><p> We would recommend that, first, there needs to be a clearly defined job description for principals because currently the job description for principals is based on a 1973 circular, which is a long time ago.  There has been much research done on the role of principals by many different groups, including ourselves, but there needs to be a system-wide definition for principals based on what best practice suggests.  <\/p><p> The people who select principals have an onerous task and the people who select the selectors have an even more responsible task but often these people have no training in any form of recruitment, education or school leadership.  There are horror stories about how some appointments are made.   Appropriate training must be made available for people in selecting principals of schools. <\/p><p> There is a need for a flexible career structure-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040900003#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Cottrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1397045100,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Some interference is being caused.

Despite it being in the best interest of the pupils, the staff and the principal when a principal wishes to step down, first, there must be a vacancy in the school and, second, he or she is put down as the most junior member of staff in the ranking of seniority.  It means that a person who may have served in a school for several years quite successfully and had the courage to know that it was no longer the best place for them and decided to step aside will get punished.  It is a very undignified way to wind up one's career as a teacher in that the person will be  first to go on the panel and be redistributed if the numbers in the school fall.<\/p><p>   The second theme I would like to address is continuous professional development, CPD.  It is part of the course in virtually every other profession and it is obligatory in many cases but we do not have any such obligation.  There is no requirement for an aspiring principal to have undertaken any course in education management or leadership.  It is not necessary.  Even after appointment, there is still no requirement to undertake CPD because there is an assumption that if one was a good teacher and has been appointed principal that one is fine.  However, the reality, is that teaching in a classroom and leading a school are two totally different jobs.  <\/p><p>  Professor Michael Fullan from Toronto, who is a world recognised expert on leadership in schools and such matters, says that if the goal is to improve student learning, investing in school leadership offers the best value for money compared with other forms of intervention.  He said that it is the-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040900004#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Cottrell"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1397045100,"counter":12,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397045100,"counter":13,"content":"<p>-----and influencing effect of the principal teacher that brings that value.<\/p><p>  We recommend that CPD become compulsory  but it should not be necessarily compulsory for a person who applies for the role of a principal currently because there is not enough provision for such services.  Rather than make it compulsory, there should be an extra weighting for points in a marking scheme for the appointment of a principal position, a person who has completed a relevant course should be awarded extra points for it.  In other words, it should be highly incentivised rather than made compulsory.    We are considering this proactively.  Given the need to do something around CPD, we are establishing a national centre for leadership and innovation, which will be a virtual centre initially.  We are excited about it because we have got a tremendous reaction from the different stakeholders to the establishment of  the centre, including some international interest in it.  It will offer programmes and leadership not only for  principal teachers and teachers but for parents, children, boards of management and other interested groups.  It is part of our five-year strategy.  We hope to be a contributor to this rather than simply a commentator.  <\/p><p>   The committee has had our formal submission and hopefully the members have had a chance to read it.  I decided not to repeat what is in it but to comment on a few topics covered in it.  We have examined the issues of recruitment and CPD but I stress that the six other topics covered in the submission are equally important.  We can no longer stand by and do nothing.  If in ten years time we were to appear before a similar committee, there would be no excuse.  We cannot say that we did not know about the leadership issue.  I had the opportunity to visit a school in New Zealand many years ago.  When we went to the school we could not find the principal.  We found there was secretary, a receptionist and an administrator and we found the principal in a classroom.  The principals there spend most of their time in the classrooms coaching new teachers, helping teachers with different challenges, dealing with children with special needs, children who are disadvantaged or whatever the issue may be.  They consider that to be normal but we were surprised at the idea that the principal would be in the classroom.  That principal did not know about the school electricity bill, plans or the types of responsibilities principals in Ireland have, which is a reflection on our governance structure.  It is because we have ineffective and non-complete functionality from our boards of management that principals end up having to take up that parental slack.  <\/p><p>  To compare the effect of a principal in a school with the yeast in dough, without the best yeast we will not get great bread but with wonderful yeast we can make wonderful bread.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040900004#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Cottrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1397045100,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Before calling the next speaker, I ask everyone to check to ensure their mobile phones are switched off because interference from them affects the recording and broadcast for people whole who are following the proceedings.

One of the stated objectives of the NAPD is to support the professional development of school leaders.  School leadership and the appropriate management structures are critical to the delivery of a world-class education system to children.  Schools are large and diverse organisations with a wide range of different challenges and problems.  Like all such organisations, Ireland's schools will not achieve their goals and objectives unless the correct management structures are in place.  The NAPD believes there is a crisis of school leadership because of cutbacks and the failure to invest in management structures in the schools.  While there are excellent people involved in school management, regrettably the management structures that currently apply in schools are not to the highest standards.  Essentially, the middle management system in schools is not fit for purpose and the reason for this is there are insufficient middle management structures within schools to facilitate the changing nature of school activity and the increased demands on school leaders.  Equally, there is no industry standard for professional development and promotion upon which to build such structures.  These issues are outlined in greater detail in the NAPD's submission, which has been supplied to the joint committee.<br \/>In short, the problems stem from a lack of resources to develop effective management structures, the current system, which has developed in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>and unstructured way, as well as the lack of a grand plan to develop effective leadership within schools.  The lack of investment and resources to develop effective management structures is not unique to education.  However, there is no reason the current system cannot be reformed in particular to ensure a more effective system of allocating posts of responsibility, of providing a set pathway for promotion of teachers to such posts and finally, for developing a long-term strategy to achieve the leadership objectives.  The current economic situation limits the capacity to implement a whole new school management structure at present.  However, it does not limit the ability to develop a new management architecture and nor does it prevent a real start being made on reforming the way in which schools are managed by ensuring that all future post appointments are in accordance with the new paradigm, once the latter is put in place.<br \/>The NAPD has five chief recommendations to tackle the challenges of school management in 21st-century Ireland.  In the first instance, we propose that a centre for leadership planning, with ongoing professional supports, should be established.  There must be ongoing professional development support for principals in order to attract, develop and sustain school leaders.  At a time when more than two thirds of school leaders at second level have less than five years' experience, this is crucial.  The NAPD proposes that a centre for leadership and planning be established, which would involve the principals' professional associations, expertise built up over many years by the leadership and planning arm of Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, and its forerunners, namely, the leadership development for schools programme and the school development programme, as well as other education partners, third level educational institutions and the Department of Education and Skills, chiefly through its teacher education section.<br \/>Second, the NAPD also believes the implementation of the recommendations of the Blackstock report, which dealt with second-level school funding, the McGuinness report, which dealt with second-level school staffing, the McIver report, which dealt with further education and the Martin report, which dealt with discipline, would help schools to put in place an administrative structure to meet the needs of the 21st century.  While these reports made specific recommendations for funding, staffing, infrastructure and support structures, they have yet to be implemented.  The NAPD's third point is that the Department of Education and Skills must implement the current circular at assistant principal level, that is, one per 100 or part thereof at a rate of 0.2 whole-time equivalents per 100 students and that this time be returned to the school to provide additional time for pastoral roles for the assistant principals.<br \/>Fourth, we call for the establishment of a steering committee that would drive reform.  It should have a particular link to the Professional Development Service for Teachers and the Department of Education and Skills should form this committee comprising representatives from its teacher education section and inspectorate, the education centres, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, the management bodies, the leadership and planning arm of PDST, as well as representation from the Teaching Council.  Our fifth point is that because things happen as they do in Ireland's education system, we must learn from other performing education systems.  For example, the school management system in New South Wales is one of the world's best examples of how post-primary schools could be managed.  In the majority of schools, each principal has at least two assistant or deputy principals working under him or her.  One is responsible for student welfare and the other for school curriculum.  All appointments to middle management posts are made on the basis of capacity to undertake duties associated with this specific post to a high standard.<br \/>In conclusion, it is clear that the current post-primary school management system is in clear need of the 3 Rs, namely, reform, resources and restructuring.  School leaders today cannot cope with every evolving demand of the 21st-century post-primary school environment.  We owe it to our students to have properly qualified principals in schools who are not overburdened due to an onerous workload.  What started as a problem more than a decade ago has developed into a full-blown crisis today.  School leaders can have a direct impact on student outcomes as they progress through second-level education.  School leaders can provide the leadership of learning to students and can act as the school system's primary agents of change.  School leaders can ensure a supportive and orderly environment for students to learn and to thrive.  Failure to act on this does a disservice to my colleague principals and deputy principals, to teachers and parents and ultimately, to the students.  Ireland's schools must be managed to the highest professional standards to facilitate the quality education to which our children are entitled and I urge the joint committee to give serious consideration to the NAPD's proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040900004#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Clive Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1397045700,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I  thank Mr. Byrne.

I am accompanied today by Mr. Alfie Barrett, who works in the teacher salaries section of the Department, as well as Ms Deirdre Matthews of the Department's inspectorate.  At the outset, it is appropriate that I acknowledge the standard of leadership provided in schools since the foundation of the State.  It is indeed true to state that the need for leadership is a priority for organisations, whether large or small and public or private and schools are no exception in this regard.  It has been stated and is true that schools are complex organisations, comprising a community of participants with high expectations that may not always be well aligned with one another and where there often can be conflicting issues and demands.  Our understanding of school leadership has evolved over recent years and that understanding has been enhanced considerably by the work of international organisations like the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, that have scoped out the parameters.  This has informed our thinking and certainly will continue to so do into the future.  The quality of leadership is central to the setting of direction in a school and the achievement of good education outcomes for students.  The primary purpose of school leadership, therefore, is to create and sustain an environment that is conducive to good learning and teaching.  Effective school leadership is inclusive and distributed across a range of partners and personnel who have a shared understanding, ownership and commitment to transform and make change happen in a context that itself is changing.<\/p><p>  In Ireland, school leadership has evolved from a model in which leadership was tightly held by a few, namely, the school owner, the principal and the Department, to the position today, where we have a more open, democratic model.  As a society, Ireland has changed significantly over recent decades.  The profile of student intake has changed, as have our expectations as a people.  However, nowhere has this change in expectations manifested itself more than in people's expectations of public institutions and local schools.  In response, new legislation, not all of which came from the education area, has been enacted that clarifies roles, responsibilities and the entitlements of citizens, much of which has an impact on the daily operation of a school.  There has been a drive for curricular reform and change, as well as new programmes designed to improve education outcomes in a more holistic and inclusive way than heretofore.  We are developing further the role of assessment in a learning context and from research, it is known that the management and mediation of change at school level is critical.<\/p> <p> We know from research that the management and mediation of change at school level is critical.  Leadership is key in this regard.  The Education Act 1998 provides an enabling legal framework for the development of a distributed model of leadership in the schools.  The Act envisages roles for the patron, trustees, board of management, the principal, teachers, parents, students and the Department.<\/p><p> The boards of management have a clear role in setting the direction of a school.  The distributed model of leadership in place in the schools is comprised of a tier of management and middle management posts.<\/p><p> The Department has made significant investment in leadership development programmes, both directly through its support services but also through the work of the education partners, such as the IPPN and NAPD.  The inspectorate, through its work, supports the development of high quality school leadership.  The school self-evaluation framework, which every school has to implement, is a key strategy for school improvement at every level.  The Teaching Council's work also will add to the capacity of teachers to teach and act as leaders within their school community.<\/p><p> In terms of evidence of how we are doing, we know from the chief inspector's 2013 report that the school leaders are performing well across a number of headings: teaching and learning; leadership; management; and school improvement.  However, there is a significant number of schools, at both primary and post primary, where leadership and management require improvement.  That is something that is of concern to the Department and will be guiding our policy development and planning in the future.<\/p><p> We are also aware of other concerns that are emerging in the system, some of which have already been identified in the international context.  There is evidence of a lack of interest among teachers to apply for principal posts.  There is also evidence that some of the school leaders are leaving their posts early.  There is a negative perception of the role  of principal which may have to do with the perceived lack of clarity of the role, the workload and the absence of support.<\/p><p> There is no doubt but that the expectations and demands being made of school leaders have increased.  These matters are being considered by the Department and will be addressed as the availability of resources permit.  We have already commenced discussions with the IPPN and NAPD, particularly in the area of ensuring that there is a continuum of professional support available to teachers, including preparation for the role of principal, induction and career-long support.<\/p><p> System reform has and will address some of the administrative workload issues with which school principals are dealing on a daily basis.  We know that the best performing education systems place high value in quality school leadership.  A number of factors distinguish these systems and we must take account of these as we plan for the future.   These systems are clear that leadership is a shared responsibility for all teachers in a school, not merely the concern of a few.  These systems pay particular attention to the selection and development of the correct staff for leadership roles and development must commence early in the teacher's career.  These systems also have a clearly distributed model of leadership in place within schools where there is clarity of roles and responsibilities clearly set out for boards of management, principals and the middle management posts together with the provision of appropriate supports.  These systems also place an emphasis on making school leadership attractive, which relates to role clarity, remuneration, training, supports, and career progression.<\/p><p> School leaders are leaders of teaching and learning first and foremost and managers second.  Therefore, any policy framework must address those barriers that keep teachers away from making teaching and learning in their school their absolute priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040900005#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1397046300,"counter":20,"content":"<p>We will take questions now.

Traditionally, notwithstanding that the IPPN and the NAPD and others have been pushing this issue for quite a long time, this is an area in which the Irish education system has been weak.  The programmes that these bodies have developed for the training of teachers are fantastic, for instance, the mentoring programme from the IPPN, but it is an area where the Department needs to do much more.<\/p><p>  There are good examples given in the submissions, and, indeed, the one sent in from the Joint Managerial Body, JMB, about more developed structures elsewhere and how in other systems there are principals, who are, to use the term of the IPPN, leaders of learning and for whom that is their job.  Their job is not all the administrative work and red tape.  They are freed up and have the support systems to be leaders of learning.  I visited Canada a good few years ago to look at the way they do it there, and it is totally different, where principals are really leaders in an educational sense and they have the freedom to do that.

I wanted to touch on that issue of performance management.  Although we are a long way from the Canadian system, one of the issues with the Teaching Council that was highlighted when we were having the debate about the extra power that it is being given in the performance of teachers was that in the OECD research on performance management and whether teachers had received feedback from their principal, the Irish figure was very low internationally.  Out of all the countries surveyed, Ireland was one of those at the bottom.

I would like to see us as a committee put together a report on this issue - we will discuss this is private session.  It is something that we should champion on a cross-party basis.  We should be pushing on school leadership.  Should we be looking at the reports that Mr. Byrne mentioned - McIver, Martin, McGuinness and Blackstock?  Given that some of those written 15 years ago, are those reports still relevant or should we be looking to put together a new strategy, which is, perhaps, stepped out so that one is looking at the vision for school leadership over the next ten years, accepting that resources are limited at this time but at least having a clear strategy of where we are going, what an ideal system would look at and what supports we need to put in place to get there because this is a crucial issue?<\/p><p>  If they were to prioritise one or two matters for the committee to champion on their behalf, what would they be?

If anyone looks at the change in the role of the principal over the past ten or 15 years, and the amount of additional legislation which has been passed and the amount of additional workload which has been put on principals, nobody could argue but that the job is more stressful and difficult.<\/p> <p>It will impact on individuals on a personal level as well as on their ability to carry out the role.  If we overburden those who provide leadership in schools, that will trickle down to the rest of the school and impact on the quality of education provided.  We cannot blame the principal if he or she is completely overburdened.<\/p><p> Where does the Department stand in regard to what we heard today from the NAPD and the IPPN?  I presume departmental officials have had an opportunity to study their detailed submissions, which include several constructive recommendations.  If we do not address some of the concerns raised, our children will ultimately pay the cost.  The issue of continuous professional development was raised in both presentations.  What is the Department's view on this issue?  Mr. Byrne suggested that a budget be allocated for professional development.  Has he raised this previously with the Department?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040900006#H00600","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1397046900,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I declare an interest in this matter because I was formerly a primary school principal, and may become one again very soon.  I am speaking with a certain level of knowledge, therefore.  In regard to the issue of school leadership, when people go into the profession of teaching the idea of becoming a principal probably does not enter their minds.  Is this something that should be dealt with at the teacher training stage, perhaps by way of a module, induction or conversation about school leadership?  School teaching is a very isolating job and sometimes it is tempting not to look outside one's classroom and students.  Should a sense of school leadership that could possibly be transformed into a consideration of the wider school community and the role of principals be encouraged at an early stage?<\/p><p>  Many teachers become principals by accident.  They may never have thought the day would come when the staffroom would ask them to take over.  People step up to the role partly out of a sense of duty and often reluctantly because there is no boundary to a principal's responsibility.  The biggest difference between my current job and my previous one is that I am no longer expected to fix the photocopier.  As a principal, I had to fix the photocopier and everything else.  There was no point at which I could say \"that is somebody else's responsibility.\"  That is a stressful position and it prevents principals from focusing on their primary role as a leader for learning.  They are dealing with everything else, from paperwork to departmental requirements, and sometimes things get dropped.  Do the witnesses agree there is a big difference, in terms of resources, between the principal of a school with 100 pupils and a school with 600 pupils?  How best can we manage that difference?  The stresses are similar but they have to be balanced with a reasonable expectation of resources.<\/p><p>  In regard to Senator Power's point about the various reports that have not been implemented, perhaps Mr. Byrne and the departmental officials could comment on the issues arising.  It is wonderfully empowering to be a leader in any sphere but we must acknowledge at an early stage that the job of principal is very different to that of a teacher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040900007#J00200","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1397046900,"counter":27,"content":"<p>It is timely that we focus on the issue of leadership in schools given their importance to society.  Like the previous speaker, I have interest in this subject as a former school principal.  When I was first appointed 13 years ago, a teacher advised me that the children would be fine but that I should watch the teachers.  That advice stuck with me because it came home to roost.  It can be an extraordinarily challenging time, as anyone working in the field would know.  The children, by and large, are not the issue but managing staff is a challenge in any career area.  Principals find it particularly difficult to manage a troublesome member of staff or an underperforming teacher and supports in that regard is non-existent.<\/p><p>  On becoming principal, I took the IPPN's Misneach course and I have said repeatedly since then that it was one of the most impressive course I ever took.  I took the course in Ennis and it was extremely informative and valuable.  I continue to use what I learned from it.  I agree with the point raised by Mr. Cottrell regarding the inability to stand down as principal.  If there was one progressive issue this committee could address, that would be it.  When people become tired or burned out they should be able to stand down without going to the bottom or, in all likelihood, ending up on the panel for deployment to different schools.  <\/p><p>  I cannot believe that Circular No. 16-73 remains the blueprint for the duties of principals and that it has not been updated.  Given that the circular only uses the masculine pronouns, there clearly were no female principals in 1973.  I note with interest that principals are given 29 tasks, the 28th of which is \"he should bring to the notice of his pupils the advantages both national and personal of the habit of saving\".  I was not aware of that responsibility when I was principal but it might have done no harm had I put more emphasis on it.  I give credit to the authors of the circular because it was fairly forward looking for 1973 when, I hasten to add, I was one year old.<\/p><p>  The role of boards of management is an issue of particular interest for me.  Boards of management can be very good but they can also be very weak.  principals heavily rely on them but I am not sure sufficient effort is made to ensure there is genuine support for managers in dealing with staff.  In other words, business people and others with experience in this area should be represented on boards.  That expertise exists in communities but I am not sure the selection criteria for boards is sufficient to recruit it.  There is often over reliance on boards that are not up to scratch in terms of the job they are given.  In an era when we are examining the role of boards and the separate issue of transparency, which I intend to raise in a different context, one of the last bastions left untouched are the boards of management in schools.  Everyone kowtows to the fact that they are voluntary but I do not accept that they are beyond scrutiny.  What do the witnesses think about the roles and qualities of boards of management?<\/p><p>  I think the INTO is running the management of most schools because if principals have difficulties they go to the INTO.  I am not sure that is always in the best interest of the schools concerned, however, because the advice given is not always up to scratch.  In my view there is over reliance on the INTO for management tasks the board of management should be supplying but there is a gap and the INTO is filling it.<\/p><p>  As I am well known locally as a former principal, I find myself holding the hands of a considerable number of principals because, thankfully, there has been significant investment in building projects in my constituency.<\/p> <p>The devolved building projects are a major headache for school principals.  They are not architects or surveyors, they do not understand planning and do not know how to meet and greet a builder.  The boards are not doing it and in many cases it falls back on the principal.  The Department is conveniently using the devolved grant system, sending the cheque and leaving the schools to it.  Heretofore there was more support from the Department.  It is an added pressure on principals and should be highlighted because they are not qualified in that area.<\/p><p> Have the witnesses any views on shared leadership for small schools?  It is a contentious and thorny issue.  I have publicly advocated having a full-time principal for, say, four small schools.  Although it has not always gone down well, I would be interested to hear the witnesses' views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040900007#J00300","speaker":"994","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1397047500,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Mr. Ward, on behalf of the Department, said the standard of leadership and a good learning environment are key.

Many members and witnesses have outlined the importance of leadership in learning and that investment in school leadership will bear fruit.  On the basis of that, is there a case for moving gradually toward a situation where principals are professional?<br \/>I would be interested to hear the witnesses' comments on Deputy Jim Daly's idea of shared principalship.  Internationally there is evidence that principals have more power regarding management of staffs, such as increments, which are performance-related in many countries.  Do the witnesses have a view on it?  Mr. Byrne said middle management at second level is very much in need of reform having developed over the years.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on how it developed and its weaknesses?  How did it happen to develop as it did?  There was significant development over the past ten or 15 years in terms of different posts and it seemed to be <i>ad hoc<\/i>.<br \/>We all see the difficulty for younger primary teachers.  More experienced teachers who are higher up on the payscale, and whom one would have expected to have moved into principal roles, see the difficulties and stress of all that is involved in those roles and balk at taking them on because the pay incentive for them is not as strong.  Therefore younger principals are appointed and have to manage more experienced teachers, which creates difficulties.

We meet IPPN, NAPD, parents and a variety of stakeholders from time to time.  There are major concerns about what is happening in our schools.  We are tied by resource limitations.  In my presentation I outlined the evolution from when we held very tightly the ownership of the management of schools to a more open model.  Much of what happens in schools is negotiated and worked out between national partners.  The composition of boards of management is very much agreed through local decision making.<\/p><p>  We are looking at the picture anew.  The concept that we need a new strategy around promoting school leadership is at the forefront of the Department's thinking.  A theme, echoed in the presentations of IPPN and NAPD as well as by the Deputies and Senators, is that a principal must be given the time and space to be first and foremost a leader of teaching and instruction in school and the management role must very much take second place.  The research and the findings of the Department's inspectorate tell us we urgently need to address this and remove the barriers that prevent a school leader from being a leader of teaching and learning.<\/p><p>  The middle-management tier in school was negotiated very much around tasks.  We need to look to a time when all teachers accept that they have a leadership responsibility.  I take the point that it must begin from the initial teacher education.  We are probably at the cusp of a new framework when the Teaching Council legislation is commenced.  The legislation sets out the criteria for the initial teacher education courses and the criteria and a register for teacher registration.  We are moving to a time when teachers will have to engage in compulsory CPD, which must and will involve leadership because our teachers begin by being leaders in their classrooms.  We are moving into that space when we discuss the CPD framework that will take us into the future.<\/p><p>  We are involved in conversations with IPPN and NAPD around that continuum of support for principals.  We want to ensure we have people coming into principal roles who have some qualification.  Whether one can make that compulsory is negotiable.  There is a high participation rate in these courses.  We have the initial training that aspiring principals do, an induction course and the development that takes place afterwards.  More than 1,100 people participate in those courses each year.  In conversation with IPPN and NAPD we want to identify deficits in the system.  From our conversations and some mapping work we have done regarding what we do here and the best systems internationally, one of the clear deficits we have identified is around coaching and mentoring.<\/p> <p>We are giving very active consideration to how we can support that.  There is already a very successful induction and mentoring piece being developed in the context of teachers when they leave college and go into schools.  That is giving very positive feedback as to the system's effectiveness.  That is something we are looking at.<\/p><p> Other members of the delegation may want to take up one or two other matters.  We are very anxious.  It is a priority for the Department.  We will be looking at it in all its facets in terms of role, clarity and setting boundaries.  Clearly any leaders need to know who is doing what and there should be ownership by people who have responsibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040900008#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397048100,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Regarding making the qualification for leadership compulsory, we should bear in mind that our counterparts across the water did that a number of years ago and have now rescinded on it because it becomes more of a paper exercise rather than a qualification for leadership.  I agree with the IPPN suggestion that it should be incentivised rather than being compulsory.  It could be partly incentivised by how the recruitment is done because the school boards of management have a certain amount of leeway in the elements they take into consideration when recruiting leaders.  That is one way to incentivise it.

It included quantitative and qualitative research.  The findings were quite amazing.  Most of the boards of management were considered to be supportive of the school and generally speaking working quite well.  When one drilled down, they were benign and supportive and helped out with particular things but they did not perform like a board.  I believe Sr. Eileen Reynolds said in 1975 when the boards of management were introduced that it was a lost opportunity and that they should have been called boards of governors because their function is really a governance role and not a management role.  Management is hands on and governance is hands off.<\/p><p>  A board of management is made up of volunteers and volunteerism is very laudable.  However, it is estimated that a chairperson has to put in four to six hours a week on average.  A good chairperson needs to be competent and available.  Such people are generally not available because they are living their own lives.

The role of the single manager, typically the parish priest or vicar, was expanded into an eight-person role with representative functions.  However, five of those eight people have no named function on the board.  We believe that a member of a school board of management should have at least one meaningful responsibility of some sort, which does not arise unless they volunteer.  It is not about their abilities - they are capable.  However, school life and school business have moved on so much that it is very hard for people to contribute unless they are in the business.<\/p><p>  On project management, buildings and the devolved grant, that is a major issue.  It seems like a wonderful benefit to be given the money and told to build a building with it.  I know of a principal whose school got a devolved grant and instead of putting in two prefabs, he built two permanent classrooms.  When the Department officials came they were able to tick the box that said \"no prefabs\".  The principal was able to use the money because he was entrepreneurial and that was his nature.  However, most principals do not want to know the first thing about building - that is not why they became principals.  There should be a fee for project management.  It is ridiculous that principals spend July and August most summers ringing tradesmen and chasing up builders.  It is no way to do business.<\/p><p>  I am not sure if I picked up the point correctly about people becoming principals at a younger age.  As outlined in the report, many principals are finding it very difficult in their first year.  Sometimes there is resistance to their appointment - there may be disgruntled candidates.  Principals need considerable care and support.  A huge amount of our energy goes into supporting newly appointed principals with online programmes and face-to-face programmes.  As Mr. Ward pointed out, it is an area we must get right because it is a very delicate time for a person.  If a principal makes fundamental mistakes in his or her first year it is very hard to recover.  Dealing with boards of management, parents' associations and staff is really important.<\/p><p>  Someone suggested that it is not the children, but the staff.  Any organisation, private, public or voluntary will identify the management of people as the single biggest issue.  Schools do not make or sell anything, so it is all about interaction and eventually somebody will annoy somebody else.  We are focusing much of our time in terms of CPD on the area of personal development and conflict management.  Interpersonal skills are what make it for a principal.  Professional development on its own is not enough and needs to be nurtured further.<\/p><p>  I could not agree more with the point about teaching leadership to undergraduates in the colleges of education.  In our centre for leadership that we are working on, we are talking about devising programmes for teacher leadership in second level schools and in primary schools because leadership as a concept and a function applies to even children at play through the whole business of teamwork and so forth.  Leadership is not a fuddy-duddy concept that people discuss in rooms such as this one, but is a very real thing.  Children are very responsive and can really do great things when they understand more about leadership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040900009#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Cottrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397048100,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I wish to make one further point on the board of management issue.

In post primary schools we regard it as positive that the boards in the 700 schools are there as resources but they operate in a different way within the different sectors.  Regarding the representative quality of the board, whether it is staff, parents or the experts the trustees would put on, in many instances, as Mr. Cottrell said, the boards are benignly supportive but often they do not have the level of expertise that would make it easy for a principal or deputy principal to operate.<\/p><p>  I am not sure if members are aware that the rights-based legislation, the Education Act 1998, made the second level school principal one of the most legislated for individuals in society, but without the resources to enable him or her to implement that.  The second level school principal is named in the Education Act, the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, the Education Welfare Act, the Teaching Council Act, the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act, the Ombudsman for Children Act, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act, the Employment Equality Act, the Equal Status Act, the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act, the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act and the Equality Act 2004.<\/p> <p>One would have to be an expert to understand it all.  There have been many changes in the level of responsibility of the principal.  While I made the point in my submission that many of our colleagues have less than five years experience, in the past to become a principal one did not require a professional qualification and were as likely as not a teacher on 31 August and principal on 1 September.  In those circumstances, a whole plethora of events presented.<br \/>In regard to the role of the principal and deputy principal within second level education, previously we had, in theory, a generous middle leadership structure in the form of assistant principal and special duties posts.  It would not have been unusual in a school of 700 to have up to 16 special duties posts and ten assistant principal posts.  Given the economic downturn, this has changed in recent times.  What we are saying is that as a first step an assistant principal post, at level agreed within the Department, should be provided.  It must be remembered that in schools, while the timetable allowance for an assistant principal is 18 to 22 hours, the difficulty is that this is not recouped to the school in terms of teaching allocations.  The schools have to find those hours from within their own resources.  The assistant principal post, which had an allowance of &euro;8,000 plus and special duties allowance of almost &euro;4,000, worked in theory.  It is often forgotten that the postal responsibility function was introduced in the late 1960s as a resolution to an industrial relations situation in respect of which it was proposed to give a special functions allowance on the basis of seniority, which would not be paid to everybody.  This post has developed on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis. <br \/>In the past the most viable criteria for appointment to the post of principal and deputy principal was seniority.  In this regard, we believe an element of suitability, flexibility and accountability should be factored in.  What is often not realised by those outside the education sector is that in a school the only person who can have a professional conversation with a teacher is the principal.  Nobody else has the authority or autonomy to speak to a teacher in regard to the manner in which he or she is doing their job.  It is only within the past number of years that this was  rectified by section 24(3) of the education Act.<br \/>A number of other points were raised by Deputies and Senators, which my colleague Ms Nihill will respond to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040900009#L00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Clive Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397048700,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Many of the issues have been already covered by Mr. Byrne, Mr. McCabe and Mr. Cottrell.  We welcome this opportunity.  I know that some Members have been in the role we are now in.  I have been a principal since 1993.  Since then, the post has changed dramatically.  Some of the issues with which we are now dealing have evolved over the years.  We all recognise that society and schools have changed dramatically since 1993.<\/p><p>  I work in the voluntary secondary sector.  Many of us who work in this area are the first lay principals following the religious orders.  The support structure which they had is now absent for anyone who takes over as a lay person.  There was an expertise in the convent parlour or monastery that now has to be replaced by one's husband or partner.  In that context, everything has changed.  I am hopeful that things will change.  There is a need for a fundamental change in culture around leadership and management in schools.  All correspondence from the Department - this is not a criticism of the Department, which I accept is also at sea on this issue - is addressed to the principal of the school, be that correspondence in relation to the roof of the school, a maintenance grant, special needs issues or the names of students due to sit a home economics examination.  That this is the case is symptomatic of the culture that needs to change.  I am confident it can change.  <\/p><p>  In 1993, the role of the deputy principal at post primary level was significantly less than what it is now because the perception at the time was that this was a promotion as a recognition of long service.  This is no longer the case.  The combination of principal and deputy principal, which the association represents, is very much seen as a leadership duo at post primary level.  I am conscious that it may not be as significant a duo at primary level.  If that change can happen then the concept of teachers recognising themselves as school leaders can also evolve.  <\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in mentioned the concept of initial teacher training and recognition of leadership in this area.  One of the difficulties in our system is that formal remunerated leadership roles involve teachers leaving the classroom.  This is at the core of many of the difficulties we are experiencing.  In other words, teachers are promoted out of the classroom.  We need to look at ways of recognising teacher and curriculum leadership.  This would fundamentally change things.  Senator Power asked about teacher appraisal.  We need a model in this regard.  In response to a question about the role of the principal, Mr. Byrne mentioned we are the people who can engage in that conversation.  If genuine teacher leadership and quality teaching were recognised, it would be legitimate for that teacher to engage with a teacher experiencing some difficulty.  This would symbolise what our colleagues in the Department want, namely, a more distributed form of leadership. <\/p><p>  These are reforms that would not cost a huge amount of money.  I am confident they would enable change to happen.  Recognised throughout all of the research is the role of coaching and mentoring.  If we were to invest in quality teaching and teacher leadership and to engage in CPD around coaching and mentoring not only for the principal, but for the teachers, it would enable teacher appraisal, which is a term not much like in the education system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040900010#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Nihill"},{"type":"speech","time":1397048700,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and apologise for coming and going during the meeting but I had to attend other meetings also.

However, this is not the case in the vocational sector, as it was.  I was teaching in a school for a year before being given a special duties post.  If it is not happening in the vocational sector, it should not be happening in the voluntary sector.<\/p> <p>I stand to be corrected but I believed this is something that had been changed by the Department in recent years.  Could that be clarified?  It is very important that merit should be taken into account rather than just length of service.<\/p><p> There is the issue of inspection findings on boards of management at post-primary level, particularly the overall quality.  It was indicated that there was 89% satisfaction but what steps were taken to improve the remaining 11%?  What supports were put in place to try to improve the position?  We sometimes fall down when we provide reports and argue that 90% satisfaction is great but we must consider the remaining issues.<\/p><p> I agree that the role of the principal in a school must be that of leader with interpersonal skills.  We may see cracks when principals do not have such skills.  There was mention of a problem when a role is not just that of principal or teacher, but when it involves fixing computers, etc.  Every schoolteacher goes through this on a daily basis, as teachers have to cater for sick children, etc.  I agree with Ms Nihill in that the role of the teacher has evolved over a number of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040900010#M00300","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1397049300,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I have a comment and some questions.  I acknowledge the interesting comment by Mr. Clive Byrne regarding the special duty post versus the principal and assistant principal post.  As somebody who chaired numerous boards giving those special duty posts over years, I can inform Senator Moran that in the VEC sector there was a farcical position where every second allocation had to go on seniority, with 50 points allocated for time and the rest for merit.  With the next interview we could use a new model being negotiated.  To give the Department its credit, there were partnership agreements with unions, which insisted on them.  That ties up much of what is being discussed today.  The partnership agreements did not always have the best interests of the education system.  The point was well made about the evolution of responsibility and not just duties.  A person with a special duties post could not correct another teacher, etc., so the responsibility stayed at the top while duties were devolved.  Some of that process is a bit pathetic.<\/p><p>  Is it correct that Circular 16\/73 is the last outlining the duties of the principal?  Will the Department officials provide a comment on the point about devolved grants for building projects?  Is the assessment I provided fair and has the Department increasingly devolved work?

Mr. Byrne mentioned different sectors at second level with regard to the structure of boards of management, with primary schools different again.  With the VECs and now the education and training boards, there has always been a system of democratic representation.  Councillors would have been on the VEC and members of the VEC, including those councillors, would be appointed to be members of boards of management.  It is my experience that many councillors on VECs have a particular interest in the area and get very experienced with interviews, etc.  I am not saying everybody is perfect in this regard.  The democratic representation on boards of management recognises that schools are for the community and there should be some form of democratic accountability.

In the voluntary secondary sector and community and comprehensive schools, the board is the employer.  In the education and training board, ETB, sector, the board is a sub-committee of the ETB, which is the employer, so there are slight differences in how it works.  The role, structures and supports made by the board are absolutely based in the community and should be seen to represent the parents, staff and interests of trustees.  The skills built up by many councillors on the boards in the ETB sector schools are certainly put to extremely good use.  Those interview skills count for nothing if there is only one applicant for a position, which was the default in many schools at one time.  When a post arose, a meeting took place and often there would only be one applicant for the post.  There would be no need for the finely honed skills of colleagues.  Deputy Daly referred to clusters of schools and Mr. Cottrell has a more nuanced view on this.  In discussions I have had with senior officials in the Department, I queried why up to eight or nine years ago there were 13 primary schools on Achill Island, given the level of structure in a school required to make it operate.<br \/>Another Deputy asked about the role of bodies in dealing with the Department of Education and Skills with our proposals.  The teacher education section in the Department has the closest of links with the professional associations at the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, and we routinely meet those officials to discuss issues of concern.  At the height of the good times, there were over 500 teachers seconded from schools to the professional development services but that went to fewer than 100 at one stage.  We had close involvement in leadership development for schools and when times were good, there would have been up to 16 full-time people involved in that programme, delivering at primary and post-primary level, but the initiative is much diminished.<br \/>Recently there have been very fruitful meetings between the senior officials in the Department and us with a view to meeting the needs with a stream of newly appointed principals.  There is also consideration of how to create a cohort of individuals applying for principalship, as in our sector the desirable job is the position of deputy principal rather than principal, with a far higher rate of applications for positions of deputy principal, depending on the context, size and location of school.  There have been fruitful discussions in this regard and I am hopeful, particularly regarding the point made by Mr. Ward regarding coaching, mentoring and supports for existing principals and principals <i>in situ<\/i>, that there will shortly be proposals emerging to allow that happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040900011#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Clive Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397049300,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I will return to Deputy Daly's question regarding the notion of shared leadership across schools, which is a contentious issue that is difficult to resolve.

We have considered all possible types of configurations in this regard.  In Scotland, for example, at a local level in many places they wanted to amalgamate or close some small schools but the national government has a policy against that.  It is the opposite of what is occurring in Ireland.  The Netherlands has many federations of schools, and it is probably a more interesting example, with potential for the Department to examine these more closely.<\/p><p>  Where there is a desire for it, we favour the notion that schools would form different clusters.  For example, one parish could have four small schools which between them might never have an administrative principal but they would if the four were put together.  There is no reason all four schools could not stay open on their respective sites but be part of one school.  This is a possibility but there are others.

There are meetings between various officials from the Department and the patron, board of management and the principal, depending on what the issues are.  They are monitored until they get to a stage where the Department is happy that they are in a position and have built up the capacity to manage themselves properly.

They are the only means by which a principal can find the time to handle much of the stuff that is coming at them outside the learning and curricular issues within the school.  Ideally, we would like all teaching principals to have one release day per week.  That is what pertains in Northern Ireland and we would like to have the same here.

As we know from our research on boards, sometimes a patron appoints two people - one being a chairperson - and there is a tendency for some boards to elect a chairperson within the membership, which is, strictly speaking, not in compliance with the rules.  Some schools do so because the chairperson designate decides that he or she does not want to be chairperson.  That is an area that is worth looking at because it would go a long way towards at least having people in the role who want it.  There is nothing worse than having a chairperson who does not want to be in that role.<\/p><p>  I shall mention continuing professional development.  I do not think the matter has been mentioned so far today.  Instructional leadership is one of the most difficult professional skills that a principal will encounter.   It means working with one's peers, some of whom are more qualified and experienced, yet one has a responsibility to improve the quality of his or her instruction and get the best from all teachers.  That takes a lot of skilful coaching and mentoring and is not something one learns by reading a manual.  <\/p><p>  Senator Power mentioned performance management.  Michael Fullan wrote about the drivers of success in schools, listing the most popular methods Governments around the world choose to improve education.  Most government wish to improve education and I must say that we have one of the best education systems in the world.  However, four of the drivers listed work and four do not.  The analysis was quite interesting.  One of the drivers that does not work is the hammer-to-crack-a-nut approach because it builds up resistance and, if anything, standards of teaching go down.  Obviously I will not go into all eight drivers now.  The most successful one, believe it or not, is for principals to take teachers in groups and develop professional learning communities within schools.  In that instance, the principal and teachers work together and share preparation, evaluation and ideas.  It is the group dynamic, the famous peer pressure, that lifts performance in schools, not the hammer-and-nut approach.  <\/p><p>  Earlier somebody asked what can be done to make the situation better reasonably quickly.  I can mention three things for primary schools.  First, as Mr. McCabe said earlier, principals should have one day per week to deal with essential administration and have no contact with children.  Second, an administrator should be provided, depending on a school's size, which measure would allow principals into the classroom to be instructional leaders.  That will not happen unless help is provided to release principals.  It does not matter how many circulars and policy documents are written; principals must be given time.  We know that time is not malleable, but the way it is used must be changed.  My suggestion would allow principals to be leaders of learning.  That would be the biggest plus in attracting good new teachers to the role.  Third, we must define middle management - the role of a deputy principal, the role of post holders - and make it meaningful.  Unfortunately, a lot of tasks that have been taken on are trivial and menial.  I shall be brief, as we have discussed this matter at length.  One does not need to be a teacher to carry out some of the tasks that teachers have been asked to perform.  <\/p><p>  I will reiterate my three suggestions.  A day per week provided to teaching principals to carry out administration; administrative support for principals of all schools; and a definition of the middle management structure.  A lot of the improvements can be made without incurring much cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040900013#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Cottrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397050500,"counter":68,"content":"<p>There is another issue that would not cost a huge amount of money but, again, it is a culture thing.  There is some difficulty when we talk about the role and difficulties of school leaders.  There is no uniform opinion on the role of a school leader, which breaks down very much at selection level.  Selection committees are often confused about the primary role of a school leader, which perhaps crosses primary and post-primary sectors.  In an interview with a selection committee comprised of five people, there may be a complete difference of opinion from one end of the selection committee table to the other on the essential requirements being sought.  Perhaps some members of the selection committee will prioritise the leading of learning while others will prioritise other things such as compliance or care of the building.  That concept needs to be looked at.<\/p><p>  Senator Power asked for improvements that would not cost much, so I will outline another one.  Perhaps we could look at the whole public service and redeploy people between Departments.  As Mr. Cottrell pointed out, some of the stuff that principals spend a lot of time doing does not necessarily need a teacher to do it.  Perhaps some creative redeployment from other sectors, such as the HSE or whatever, could create space for the teachers, principal and deputy principal to lead learning in schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040900013#P00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Nihill"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397050500,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I will address some points that were not dealt with.  Regarding boards of management, the Education Act sets out their broad legal framework and allocates specific roles to a variety of people.  A negotiated model of the rules and procedures is now in place, and these are reviewed from time to time.  There is also a budget for the training of boards that is agreed, and priorities are agreed annually through a consultation model.  Perhaps that is something that we can look at in terms of emphasising governance roles and responsibilities more.  I agree that boundaries are blurred and there needs to be clarity for everybody concerned.<\/p><p>  Mention was made of ETBs and the administrative workload, in a variety of ways, of principals.  There is a push for public sector reform and it is happening within the Department.  In that context, we are conscious of the expectations and demands placed on schools.  One of the significant reforms that have been put in place is the system of reporting on teacher absences at school level.  A paper mountain no longer moves through the system because it is now done on a computerised basis.  There is a lot of potential for ICT to improve the system.<\/p><p>  In terms of the potential of ETBs, yesterday I attended a presentation by an ETB on its model of ICT support in a school.  Not only has it taken over a lot of the school administration tasks; it is also heralded as a means to promote and facilitate teaching and learning in a school.  ICT is never an end in itself but there are improvements to be gained in how teachers use ICT effectively for teaching and learning.  I refer to an all-inclusive model.  The Department is preparing an ICT digital strategy for teaching and learning and it is something that we will look at because of its potential.<\/p><p>  Mention was made of the way the Department oversees leadership.  We have in place a consultative format whereby we invite the partners to talk about CPD priorities and what we are doing about particular matters.  We are engaged currently in bilateral negotiations with the NAPD and the IPPN, which have been very fruitful as they have generated very good ideas.  We are looking closely at the coaching-mentoring gap that has been identified in the kind of mapping work that is going on.<\/p><p>  With regard to the culture and expectation of leadership and the setting of boundaries - the following is probably true of the whole public service, but particularly of schools - we need to accept that everybody in the system and in a school has a responsibility.  Leadership is not just the concern of a few, which is a point that is reinforced more and more in research.  Although there is more international research available on the matter, the research emphasises the point very strongly.  However, there needs to be clarity around the subject.<\/p> <p>Certain practices have developed under the model that is currently in place and we need to show openness towards new ideas.  One of the positive aspects of the circumstances in which we find ourselves is that they make people think about how we are doing things, what our vision should be and what point we want to reach.  The Department is open to examining these issues, and the spirit of partnership shown by the bodies representing principals is very good news in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014040900013#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1397051100,"counter":71,"content":"<p>We will bring the discussion to a close at this point.

On behalf of my colleagues and myself, I thank the committee for the invitation to meet and update it on our progress on relevant matters.  As the Chairman detailed, I am joined by Mr. Stephen Groarke, head of financial reporting and planning, Mr. Shane O'Sullivan, managing director of the asset management unit, and Mr. Ger Mitchell, director of mortgage and consumer finance.<\/p><p>  I would like to keep these opening remarks very brief as I am sure it would be a better use of the members' time to focus on questions and answers, but I would like to make a small number of points.  The past 12 months have been transformative for the Permanent TSB Group.  A year ago the bank was marking the end of the first phase of our recovery programme.  We had completed the stabilisation of the bank after the crisis.  We had put in place the new architecture of the group that was suited for our journey to recovery.  The asset management unit, our specialist unit to support and assist our customers with troubled loans, had commenced its work.  We were making the first tentative step to re-engage with the market and our customers and begin competing with other banks in what I might call the normal thrust of business.<\/p><p>  During the past 12 months we have made further significant progress on all fronts.  Much of the attention at this meeting will be on the critically important issue of mortgage arrears, and today we report that we have comfortably exceeded the targets set down for us by the Central Bank of Ireland in respect of putting in place long-term solutions for our customers in arrears.  In respect of the targets required us by the end of December last, to have offered long-term treatment arrangements to 50% of our customers who were in arrears, we had in fact offered such solutions for 61% of those customers.<\/p><p>  The bank has made very significant progress on re-entering the retail market.  We have just ended quarter one of 2014, and during that quarter the bank lent &euro;105 million in mortgages.  Twelve months ago, the comparable figure for the first quarter of 2013 was just &euro;14 million.  That is almost an eight-fold increase in 12 months.  At the end of 2012 and start of 2013, we accounted for just 4% of the mortgage approvals that were given in the market.  At the end of January last, we accounted for 20% of those approvals.  That is real progress.  We have made huge progress also on current accounts.  A year ago we effectively challenged the approach taken by every other bank for current accounts by launching an account which has no fees or transaction charges for the vast majority of users.  The response has been excellent and we have recruited some 60,000 new customers during the past year.  I can confirm that even with no fees or charges for most customers, this is a valuable product for us as well as an important product for our customers.<\/p><p>  We have made very important progress in other areas too.  We have reduced our loan to deposit ratio from 191% in 2012 to 150% in 2013.  We increased our net interest margin from 72 basis points in 2012 to 82 basis points in 2013.  We have reduced our cost-income ratio from 144% in 2012  to 119% in 2013.  Importantly, we have reduced our ECB borrowings from almost &euro;11 billion in 2012 to less than &euro;7 billion in 2013, and this was down to &euro;6.5 billion at the end of last week.<\/p><p>  I am not naive and I do not for a moment underestimate the challenges still ahead of us, or for all the other banks in this market, but I believe the progress we have made is very important and gives us great confidence in our ability to meet whatever challenges lie ahead.  We will return to our traditional role of being a relevant and innovative force in retail banking in Ireland.  In that context, I note the recent very strong statement of support for the bank from the Minister for Finance who described Permanent TSB as a \"genuine and important competitor in the retail banking market\" and who stated he would continue to support the board and management of the bank in the delivery of our strategy to rebuild it.  That concludes my opening remarks and my colleagues and I will be happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Masding"},{"type":"speech","time":1397034000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Masding.  I propose to take the first group of questions in 15 minute slots and then move on ten minute slots, and I would hope to conclude by 1 p.m. or even earlier than that.<\/p><p>  I thank Mr. Masding for coming before the committee and for the information he provided to us.  I will begin by delving into some of that.  It appears that Permanent TSB has probably the highest percentages of split mortgages as a resolution that is offered in comparison with the other banks.  Can Mr. Masding explain how the bank is probably the greatest provider of split mortgages?  Is the bank providing split mortgages to people in positive equity as well as to people in negative equity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900003#B00500","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397034000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I will take that question.  When we started the journey of debt resolution and our strategy, we saw the split mortgage as a fundamentally very good proposition for both the lender and the borrower.  That was our intent from the beginning.  It is a resolution that is quite costly from a bank's perspective but it is fundamentally one that we think can help customers who have struggled in recent years.  With that in mind, the Chairman can note from the template we provided that we have offered approximately 4,000 split mortgages to date.  The template by its nature - the MART methodology - focuses on late arrears.  I am pleased to confirm that, outside of that cluster of customers, we have offered a further 3,000 split mortgages.  In total, Permanent TSB has offered 7,000 split mortgages to our customers.<\/p><p>  On the Chairman's second question, we do not look at our resolution strategy from a positive or a negative equity perspective.  The reality is that we are focused on affordability and sustainability.  When we look at a case to see what we can do, certainty is uppermost in our mind.  We are looking for a solution or a pathway that can give us comfort that the principal outstanding is repaid at the end of the term, or the extended term, and that there is affordability month by month from here to there.  It is really as simple as that in terms of our assessment and the negative-positive equity is not a direct factor in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900003#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1397034000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>On the mortgage to rent solution, which was another one of the resolution processes set out in the Keane report, I note there has not been completion of any of those to date.

We have not to date completed a mortgage to rent solution, and there are many that we would like to complete.  Our perspective is that the system needs an overhaul to enable mortgage to rent to become a solution at scale.  The problems are many and I could cluster them into a number of categories.  The process is fraught.  There are a great number of parties involved, from the borrower to the lender to the housing association to the housing bodies to the local authorities.  It is a cumbersome process that clearly needs streamlining.  The criteria at this stage is a little out of date.  It made sense at a point in time but, for instance, properties that are over the value of &euro;220,000 in Dublin at present are excluded.<\/p> <p> There are issues regarding income thresholds.  There is a fundamental problem with valuations which needs to be rectified.  I am happy to state the banks are working in a collegiate way with the Banking Federation and have proposed meetings in recent times with the housing authority to see what we can do together.  The funding and resourcing of the scheme needs to be examined also.  From our perspective we consider we have 100 or 150 customers who would well fit this proposition and we hope in time we can provide this solution for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900003#B00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1397034600,"counter":88,"content":"<p>While I accept there may be valuation difficulties arising in Dublin at present the bank's loan book is not exclusive to the Dublin area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900004#C00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397034600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1397034600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Why has the bank been unable to complete it in other districts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900004#C00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397034600,"counter":91,"content":"<p>It is for very similar reasons.

From there we ask whether the mortgage, were we obliged to restructure it, would be sustainable.  To us, sustainable means there is a clear path to the repayment of the outstanding capital by the end of the term or an extended term.  Thereafter, once one can pass that test, the question is whether the customer is able to afford the monthly repayments between here and there, month in, month out.  When one can identify that solution, it will lead one into treatments like the split mortgage or parked capital and interest or whatever it might be.  Unfortunately, there are times when no matter what way one considers it, up or down, left or right, that affordability and sustainability is not there.  Consequently, the certainty is not there and this leads one to the route of the best outcome for the customer being to work collaboratively to sell the property.  This is seen by the Central Bank as a sustainable solution.  It might not be the one the customer would prefer but it is a credible solution, given that affordability and sustainability are not there.<\/p><p>  In terms of the mechanics of how we arrive at these decisions, the Deputy will understand that all customers will complete a standard financial statement, SFS, form.  It is a ten-page or 12-page form that they will complete with a member of our staff in a branch.  We have two staff members in each branch who will take customers through the SFS.  The SFS form is then validated by a team of Dublin, who will compare it for accuracy and will then pass it to an underwriter.  The underwriter will make his or her decision based on the SFS, as well as with the assistance of cash flow projections that enable the underwriter to consider what options are available for the customer in each case.

There has been movement by some of the other banks in engaging with the Central Bank and considering what may be sustainable solutions, for example, with cases of people in positive equity who may be in their late 50s or early 60s.  These people may not clear the debt by the time they get to retirement but they may be able to sustain an interest-only payment through retirement.

AIB is considering this.  Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan has a reasonable concern that because household income halves, approximately, on retirement that raises a concern about affordability.

There was a lot of push-back from people following the much publicised AIB debt write-down, who asked &ldquo;What about me?&rdquo;  The main issue is not people asking &ldquo;What about me?&rdquo; but that nobody profits from a debt write-down, which is a legitimate concern.

The bank will look to the open market valuation, which is the norm in banking, to establish the value of the property and the price the bank expects to receive for it.  On the other side, the housing associations or bodies look to the valuation based on rental income.  Those two differ.  That delta or gap causes a problem because it usually means that the bank will receive less than it might have anticipated for the property and as a consequence the subsequent shortfall for the borrower if one arises, is larger.

I am not saying it is easy to deal with a mortgage in distress but it is certainly more difficult if the customer also has a credit union loan, a term loan or a visa card in distress.  Efforts have been made in recent times to appoint an intermediary.  A charity, StepChange, fulfils that remit in the UK and the Central Bank has facilitated a certain amount of work to introduce the concept to Ireland.  While it has fallen away in recent times, after a pilot with the banks and unsecured lenders that lasted 11 months, that is not to say the banks cannot act in a collegiate fashion to put the trusted intermediary model at the centre of the aforementioned type of difficulties.

Then there are those who will come to the branch and make a commitment that they will provide the substance of the information that they have provided, such as a P60 or P45, utility bills or whatever it might be, and yet will never submit that information so that the SFS cannot progress.

Clearly, I disagree.  I have worked in the law and that is a Chinese wall that would not pass muster with anyone, particularly when prohibiting people from accessing a statutory service.  We will raise that again with the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  Of 3,813 buy-to-let mortgages in arrears of more than 90 days, 1,518 are subject to legal proceedings of one sort or another.  This is a much higher proportion than the private dwelling house, PDH, loan book.  There is enormous concern about the treatment of tenants by lending institutions who live in these buy-to-let properties as their homes.  This is particularly the case where receivers have been appointed.  Permanent TSB has not provided information on the appointment of receivers.  What is the view of the witnesses on the duties of receivers?  I do not know if the witnesses are aware of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, which sets out the obligations of landlords.  Are the witnesses in favour of supporting an amendment to the legislation to ensure that, where receivers step into the shoes of landlords, they must abide by the obligations on landlords when they accept the rent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900015#O00500","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397041200,"counter":373,"content":"<p>Let us clarify the figure of 1,518.  Of those, some 1,000 are categorised as being in legal proceedings and the number above that are not in legal proceedings but refer to voluntary sales.<\/p><p>  With regard to the point about rent receivers, we must distinguish between rent receivers and fixed charge receivers.  The rent receiver is engaged on behalf of the borrower and is engaged in scenarios where there are tenants in place and rent is being paid, but it is paid to the borrower, not the lender.  The rent receiver is appointed on behalf of the borrower and the tenants continue to pay rent but the money goes to the lender rather than the borrower.  More often than not, the property can be left in disrepair over a period so the rent receiver has an obligation to tidy up the property.  It is a win-win situation in that the tenant gets to remain in the property and, if it is in disrepair, it is tidied up; the lender receives the rent that it had not received in the period up to the appointment; and the borrower, as a consequence, is now in a position to work with us to see what we can do to keep the property in his or her portfolio.<\/p><p>  The fixed charge receiver is a different case and we do not appoint them.  We have never done so and do not intend to do it.  The fixed charge receiver has the authority to liquidate the asset and to sell the property without going through the traditional legal process that one goes through with a rent receiver in a buy-to-let property.  In that scenario, the tenants tend to fare less well and it can lead to tenants having to vacate the premises sooner than they would want.  From the perspective of Permanent TSB, we do not appoint fixed charge receivers and do not intend to do so.  We have rent receivers in a small number of properties, some 360 accounts, which amount to about 700 properties.  Where we have them in place, it works because there is a contribution to the mortgage, the tenant remains in place and the property is not vacated as part of a court process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900015#O00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1397041200,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I will be brief in my response.

There is no maintenance on the property and there is a significant need for clarity in the legislation with regard to treatment of tenants.  There is no code of conduct on mortgage arrears for buy-to-let properties and, quite often, tenants are left in a poor situation and treated badly by lending institutions.

This is my third time meeting the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform since becoming chief executive, and I have found it a most valuable forum for explaining the bank&rsquo;s position to members - and, by implication, to our customers and the wider public.  It also serves the purpose of informing us about the committee's thinking and how best we can work together.<\/p><p>  Our primary concern is to brief the committee, in as much detail as possible, on our strategy to deal with mortgage arrears and lending, but I would first like to give a short overview of the current position of AIB.  We have completed two years of a three-year strategic plan to restore stability, achieve sustainable growth and return to profitability.  AIB recently reported a return to pre-provision operating profit for 2013.  In essence, after major restructuring, deleveraging, and securing a much reduced cost base, the bank has progressed to a point where it has stabilised its balance sheet, successfully returned to the funding markets, met Government lending targets, and is now positioned for lending growth.  We are reducing the level of impaired loans in the bank and targeting a full return to underlying profit during 2014.  Ultimately, the goal is to see the bank make a return to the Irish State over time.  That is the primary objective.<\/p><p>  While we are encouraged by this, we remain steadfastly focussed on mortgage and SME arrears management and implementing solutions for customers in financial difficulty.  We will discuss that in detail during questioning.  Resolving these cases is difficult, labour-intensive and a constant operation in the bank.  It demands our time, empathy and resources, but, as I hope to demonstrate, it is not intractable.  Our enduring priority is to keep people in their homes where possible and to safeguard jobs and businesses while ensuring taxpayers&rsquo; capital is appropriately utilised. <\/p><p>  We have developed a range of tailored permanent solutions and are achieving results in implementing these with customers who engage and work with us.  I have full confidence that these models are allowing us to make real inroads into the problem.  The issue of SME distress and arrears receives a disproportionately small level of coverage in the national debate despite the fact that its resolution is critical for the long-term sustainable growth of the country.  In monetary terms, it is by far the larger proportion of AIB&rsquo;s troubled loan book.<\/p> <p>I am pleased to say that we have made very strong progress in resolving our SME arrears book and are seeing much higher rates of customer engagement with regard to our mortgage book.  We are confident that we will have completed the substantial majority of the SME restructures over the next 12 months.<\/p><p> I will not labour the point, but our key theme is that engagement is the key that unlocks the conundrum for most distressed borrowers.  Having established positive engagement, we can then proceed to agree an outcome that provides certainty to all parties and allows both the customer and the bank to move on to a sustainable financial arrangement.  In a bid to maximise the bank's reach to customers in financial trouble, and after reflecting on feedback from Oireachtas Members at our last meeting, AIB has explored new avenues, including the involvement of customer and consumer advocacy groups &ndash; a development that has already led to breakthroughs in a significant number of areas.<\/p><p> All resolutions offered to customers in difficulty are assessed on the basis of affordability in respect of the borrower&rsquo;s mortgage.  It is important to clarify the definition of the term &ldquo;affordability&rdquo;: this is calculated on the totality of a customer&rsquo;s net income from which reasonable living expenses are subtracted - in AIB, we calculate these expense as being approximately 20% in excess of the Insolvency Service of Ireland guidelines.  What remains is net disposable income, NDI, for the purposes of our calculation.  Cognisant of its responsibility to the Irish taxpayer, AIB must, as a core fiduciary principle, seek full repayment of mortgage debt where the customer has the ability to meet that payment from his NDI.  Any other outcome is unacceptable from a commercial perspective and would be grossly unfair to the significant majority of mortgage customers across the country who continue to meet their full mortgage obligations despite changed circumstances.<\/p><p> The committee is aware of recent media reports of mortgage debt write-down and we are aware that some commentators have questioned the consistency with which we are dealing with our customers.  It is therefore necessary for AIB to be unambiguous in this regard.  AIB will compromise on debt with co-operating customers only if there is no prospect of that debt being paid, where there is no affordability to pay it, or when considered against the economics of alternative options open to the bank and, of course, against our requirement to optimise our recovery.  All AIB's decisions regarding the nature of the forbearance solution offered to any given customer is grounded in the principle that customers must pay the maximum they can afford from their net disposable income.  This principle equally applies in situations where debt compromise forms part of the solution.  Decisions are based strictly on customer affordability.  I will talk about that in more detail when responding to questions.<\/p><p> Meanwhile, it is not possible or practical to set out absolutely strict guidelines in relation to applicable levels of compromise.  The principle is consistent but each case is indeed different and circumstances vary from customer to customer.  However, once it has been determined that a customer&rsquo;s level of net disposable income does not allow for a standard forbearance solution, it is sometimes necessary and commercially sensible to involve debt compromise as part of the resolution.  This debt flexibility can arise in the application of a split mortgage or a voluntary sale for loss arrangement, although it is not the case that it always arises in every situation of a split mortgage or voluntary sale for loss arrangement.  Where a customer has affordability in such situations, the issue of debt compromise does not arise and is not offered.  At our last meeting with this committee in September 2013, we considered at some length the issue of the bank&rsquo;s legal processes.  I again reiterate that AIB only pursues the legal option where customers do not co-operate or engage with the bank and do not maximise their payments of their mortgage based on their affordability after the calculation of reasonable living expenses.  These actions are predicated purely on the need to protect capital and to ensure that the bank operates commercially and in compliance with the regulatory guidance.  Customers always receive ample opportunity to engage in an effort to reach a financial arrangement, and the possibility of having to resort to legal proceedings is repeatedly flagged by the bank.  In fact, the Central Bank has set down clear guidelines on the responsibility of both bank and customers in respect of that engagement.<\/p><p> We engage with people who are in the legal process to seek a sustainable solution for their mortgage difficulties.  We cannot leave the legal process until agreement is reached on a sustainable solution based on the affordability principles, as discussed, and the customer demonstrates a commitment to sustain the payments as part of that sustainable solution.  However, even in a legal process AIB is amenable to pausing that process when a customer chooses to engage meaningfully to reach a non-legal sustainable solution.<\/p><p> I believe AIB has demonstrated a clear and differentiated willingness to pragmatically engage with co-operating customers in reaching sustainable solutions and also to leave the door open to those in the legal process who are non-co-operating to re-engage despite being in the legal process with the bank.  However, the flip side of this is that we must, as a commercial entity, enforce our rights over the property in the event that the customer continues not to engage with us.  To do otherwise would be a misuse of the capital that has been provided by the State and would ultimately lead to an unfair transfer of taxpayer's funds from one citizen to another.<\/p><p> Overall, we are seeing a reduction in the bank&rsquo;s total impaired loans.  In addition, the number of early and pre-arrears in our mortgage portfolios reduced materially in the second half of last year.  All of this meant that our provision charges in 2013 were &euro;625 million lower than in 2012, including consideration of substantially all of the findings from the Central Bank of Ireland balance sheet assessment.  I am optimistic that, over the next 12 months AIB will have completed the majority of SME and mortgage restructures, allowing the recovery and growth of viable businesses, the protection of jobs - very importantly - and an improvement in retail confidence.<\/p><p> The bank exceeded the Government&rsquo;s lending target in 2013, approving credit to 32,000 customers, and issued almost two in every five mortgages drawn down - that is, utilised mortgages.  The bank is focused on a &euro;7 billion to &euro;10 billion target of lending approvals over the next five years and is positioned appropriately in capital terms for that.  These cover mortgages, personal and business loans.  While there is much public conjecture as to whether banks are lending or not, I can categorically state that, having undertaken a significant level of balance sheet restructuring in recent years, AIB is squarely focused on positioning our bank for lending, as the primary balance sheet and as part of our overall strategy to return to profit.<\/p><p> In summary, on behalf of AIB, I want to use this opportunity to again express thanks to the Irish taxpayers for their support, without which we would not be here.  Our objective is to re-establish AIB as a profitable investment bank and this is the optimum way to deliver a return on the shareholders' investment over time.  Let me reassure members that our team, AIB&rsquo;s workforce and myself will continue to pursue relentlessly the goal of restoring this bank to good financial health in the shortest possible timeframe. <\/p><p> While we are focused on addressing legacy issues of the past, we must continue to invest in developing a customer-centric banking model that is fit to meet the challenges of our recovering economy and the needs of our customers.  We are dedicated to that project until it reaches a successful conclusion.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and members, and we are happy to answer questions on our submissions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900016#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1397042100,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Duffy.

Let us look at the process of engagement, where it might lend itself to a legal outcome.  In the first instance, we advise people that they may enter into a legal position and try to outline all the alternatives.  In that circumstance I can confirm that 50% of the people contacted on a potential legal path re-engaged with the bank.  That is a very positive outcome.  It is largely related to the various solutions that we offer, as the Deputy identified, rather than pursuing the legal position.  When we are in the position of saying that we will now enter a legal process, we have seen on average a 10% re-engagement pretty quickly.  When those 10% of customers engage with the bank they are paying the full capital and interest, subsequent to the advice around the potential legal process.  It is worth mentioning also that when one looks at the legal letters in totality, the average duration of arrears or non-engagement for people who have received legal letters is greater than two years.  In terms of civil proceedings, the average is greater than three years of arrears.  We are satisfied that we have engaged as substantially as we can.<\/p> <p>The whole legal and regulatory process is well defined.  Significant and frequent engagement takes place by telephone, letter and other means.  When that fails and we warn of the potential process, 50% engage.

When one is two years down the road of non-co-operation, 50% re-engage when one issues advice of a potential legal process and a further 10% come back and pay the full capital and interest on their outstanding mortgage, without variation, when one issues legal proceedings - that is, when one takes the first step in a convoluted process.

We look at the models that create solutions, namely, those that are defined and agreed by the Central Bank.  We take these solutions and, to return again to the issue of affordability, we sit down with the person and look at our criteria on net disposable income, which are 20% better than those used by the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  We look at the person's complete and total income in a full and detailed standard financial statement.  Based on the outcome of that process, we look at the total debt and determine what is realistically repayable.  One cannot publish a criterion other than the absolute principle of affordability because every circumstance is different.<\/p> <p>There are joint, separate and connected debts.  The debt structure is what defines the discussion around the principle of affordability.  We would love to be able to publish in the press \"Go and check your criteria,\" but it is an actual negotiation.  At the same time, because there would be concerns about who one knows, we will never let that happen as a principle of integrity of the bank.  I stand firmly in that space.  We have an internal appeals and review process to double check and make absolutely sure that we are implementing those types of solution for consistency reasons.  As the committee can imagine, in years to come, there will be look-backs for consistency and equitable treatment of the customer.

We will lend a maximum of 92% loan to value, LTV.  For one-bedroomed apartments, which are a more risky proposition, we will lend a maximum of 75% LTV and for properties greater than &euro;400,000, where a mortgage greater than &euro;400,000 is required, the maximum LTV we will provide is 85%.<\/p><p>  We are looking at the market internationally and looking at those economies where the banking system, particularly the mortgage markets, performed better through the crisis over the past five or six years.

We stress each mortgage application at a 2% stress rate over the rate at which the mortgage is being drawn down.

Let us say, for example, a property is for sale for &euro;200,000 and somebody needs to borrow the full amount to buy that property, but cannot do so because of the LTV requirements and the Central Bank guidelines issued in 2009.

As far as the bank is concerned, the mortgage is doing well.  However, when an application is made for one of the parties to come off the mortgage, that party is refused on affordabilty grounds.  Those people's lives are on pause.  They may have already entered a new partnership and have a second family but they cannot move on with their lives because they are tied to that deed.

Until recently, we have been involved in a pilot programme that was sponsored by the Central Bank but it now appears this will not get off the ground.  There are talks under way among a number of banks in the industry precisely along the lines mentioned by the Senator.  I believe AIB would have to be part of the solution because I cannot see how it could be economic for someone to take on the set-up costs and so on.  Ultimately, however, it would benefit both AIB and the consumer and I believe it is the key to unlocking the personal debt issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900025#Y00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1397046900,"counter":627,"content":"<p>For the record, it is important to state that when the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, appeared before the joint committee last week, its representatives made it clear that they found the current situation to be entirely unacceptable.  They mentioned how every time borrowers who were engaging rang, they were obliged to deal with a completely different person.  Under the current system, borrowers definitely are not operating on a level playing field and from their perspective, that places them at severe risk of making arrangements with banks that are not sustainable.  On that point, I was pleased to see that AIB is abiding by the living rates recommended by the Insolvency Service of Ireland and indeed is going above them and for the record, I consider that to be positive.<\/p><p>  However, I wish to make two points.  The first pertains to mortgages that are in positive equity.  As the witnesses are aware, considerable concern has been expressed in this regard.  I certainly have been dealing with people who are in mortgage arrears but are in positive equity.  In the engagements I personally have had with some lending institutions, I have become deeply suspicious about the manner in which such mortgages are being approached.  I am uncertain whether the witnesses have provided members with information - I do not appear to have it - but under each of the categories that are set out-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900025#Y00800","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1397046900,"counter":628,"content":"<p>This issue was dealt with by Deputy O'Donnell earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900025#Y00900","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1397046900,"counter":629,"content":"<p>Very well.  It is very important to have information on all the proposed solutions as to how they break down between mortgages that are in negative equity and those that are in positive equity.  It also is important to state that unfortunately, the figures do not look as rosy as they might appear.  I am aware that Deputy Pearse Doherty has alluded to this point but for the sake of argument, I did a tot on the buy-to-let market.  I noticed that when one takes into account the assisted voluntary sales, again I am deeply suspicious in that regard, there actually are 3,000 cases in which legal proceedings are being initiated and 1,400 in which there are sustainable solutions.  As 20% of the people of Ireland live in rented accommodation, that is not a particularly good outcome for many of those who rent their homes.<\/p><p>  I must echo the comments made by Deputy Kevin Humphreys on the current position regarding separated couples.  There is a very serious problem in respect of such couples.  I have encountered two cases in which court orders have been made ordering the transfer of the family home from one spouse to the other and ordering the mortgage to be placed in the sole name of one of the couple.  The lending institutions concerned, one of which is AIB, have given effect to neither of those orders.  Given the proportion of people in Ireland who are separated, divorced or in partnerships but not married, it certainly appears to me that a real solution to this problem will not be found unless some change can be made to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA.  Incidentally, under chapter 1 of the aforementioned code of conduct as it applies to joint borrowers who notify their lender in writing that they have separated or divorced, the code provides that the lenders should treat each borrower as a single borrower.  However, that is not happening and something must change to permit it to happen.  Again, while I do not wish to be prescriptive in this regard, I have encountered cases in which borrowers have come after one of the signatories on the mortgage deed because that person was a good mark.  I cannot understand how, when the situation is reversed and one party is willing to pay the mortgage and to go forward, that for whatever reason, a legal outcome cannot be found to permit them to so do.<\/p><p>  I also wish to ascertain how AIB is treating a certain category of people.  I refer to those who have bought properties they now are forced to rent because the properties in question no longer are suited to their needs.  They are in a category that I would call rent to rent, whereby they are renting out their own property in one location and are renting another property somewhere else because they clearly are stuck.  First, has AIB encountered this situation, which certainly exists in reality?  Second, how is AIB treating these people?  Does the bank regard them as being in breach of their mortgage deed if, for the sake of argument, they bought a principal private residence on a tracker?  Does AIB consider that mortgage as having been breached?  Would the bank revoke a tracker mortgage in that situation?  How is AIB dealing with this category of borrower?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900025#Y01000","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397046900,"counter":630,"content":"<p>We do not revoke the tracker in such a situation.  If the Senator examines our submission, she will see that under buy-to-lets, there are 14 split mortgages.  While we do not provide split mortgages in respect of buy-to-lets, they are people who have moved out of the home and have rented it out.  We treat them in the same way as we treat any other customer.  Under the CCMA, it is now their sole property in the State and, consequently, we treat them the same as we would under the mortgage arrears resolution targets, MART, process or the CCMA.  Moving them off a tracker is not a solution for people who are in difficulty, because it will only make the arrears worse.  Consequently, we do not treat them any differently.<\/p><p>  As for the other questions the Senator asked, I wish to talk to her about one case she mentioned in particular, because as I understand it, I believe the Senator stated we are defying a court order and I would like to know about that.  I am not aware of that and have never been made aware of it but I do not believe we would defy a court order to transfer a mortgage.  While I am not sure whether the Senator was present when we had this discussion earlier, when someone wishes to come off a mortgage and if there is to be just a single name on that mortgage, we are required, under Central Bank rules, to stress-test the affordability of the person to keep that mortgage.  While the person may wish to go onto the mortgage, he or she may not be able to afford it under stressed circumstances and in that case, we cannot give a mortgage because the person concerned does not pass their stress test for it.  We have many cases in which people voluntarily, that is, not from a court perspective, transfer their value in the home and also would like to come off the mortgage but that is not possible.  We also have many cases in which, given the nature of the situation, we cannot get both sides to agree or cannot get signatures for release or for release of security.  It is extremely difficult issue but in particular, if there is a case extant in which there is a court order that we are defying, I would like to know about it and am happy to talk to the Senator afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900025#Y01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1397046900,"counter":631,"content":"<p>In this particular case, the mortgage is sustainable with the remaining borrower.

These rules are arcane and it is difficult to look forward and say whether someone qualifies.  Often, we can say customers look like they are suitable for a mortgage to rent solution, but two to three months down the road we find there is additional family income, apart from that of the mortgage holder, that will preclude them.  Therefore, to eliminate the complications, we need to simplify the rules and make the product easier for people to understand.<\/p><p>  There are also issues around the housing agencies.  The issue is not with the agencies, but they must buy houses that fulfil all of the regulations in terms of council or social housing.  Therefore, they will not buy the house as is but only with all of the modifications that need to be made, etc.  From a bank perspective, the house could be sold on the open market and these costs would not have to be paid.  There are valuation issues; many people are involved and various steps must be taken.  It is not just one issue but a combination of them.  We met Cl&uacute;id a couple of weeks ago in this regard.  As banks, we can get better in this area.  It is a complex process, but there is nothing that could not be solved by getting eight or ten people who care around a table to figure out how to make the process smoother.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900027#AA00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1397048100,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Duffy and his team from AIB.  My mood has swung wildly while I have been sitting here.  On the one hand, I was very impressed by the presentation, but then, on the other, I keep going back to my constituency experience, with which the presentation jars significantly.  There are two main issues, the first of which is the bank's definition of affordability.  I appreciate it has taken on board the insolvency guidelines in that regard, but in my mind's eye I can picture individuals I know in my constituency whose cases jar with the bank's presentation.  I would like to focus on the issue of affordability and flesh it out further.  The second issue concerns the financial solutions group within the bank.  I believe it operates on a regional basis and that various teams have been set up.  Through the experience of constituents, I am familiar with the teams in Cork and Tralee.  <\/p><p>  It seems that the process is like a game of poker.  The debtor rarely knows what it will take to achieve a solution and keeps having his or her proposals thrown back at him or her.  There seems to be no real engagement.  I could cite chapter and verse, but for reasons of confidentiality I will not do so, where it seems no real effort is made to come up with a workable solution.  Solutions must work for both sides - the bank and the debtor.  I am aware of cases in which there are write-downs on the table, but at the same time horrendous levels of debt are being imposed on people with modest incomes who have families to rear and whose reasonable living expenses can only be expected to rise because of the ages of those involved.  They will be in hock for the rest of their lives, way beyond retirement age in the context of the proposals on the table.  In general, they are middle aged and have significant debts.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the efforts being made and the progress made.  However, behind all of the statistics are individuals and families.  The presentation made was slick and impressive, but it jars with the real life experiences I come across in my constituency office, the experiences of people who desperately want to move on and deal in an honourable way with their problems.  They need the banks to engage and write down some of their debt.  I acknowledge that there is a write-down on the table in one case of which I am aware, but people are still being left with a horrendous level of debt.  It comes back to affordability.  The proposals on the table are, in one case I know of, a consequence of the extended family dipping their hands into their pockets to try to bail out a family member in difficulty.<\/p><p>  Will the delegates flesh out the process and the issue of affordability a little more?  I thank them for their impressive presentation, but this is a nasty business.  This is a legacy issue with which the banks must deal and there is no point in pointing fingers or apportioning blame.  Everybody shares a little of the culpability in this matter, borrowers and lenders alike, and we must find workable solutions that will let people get on with their lives.  Those with honourable intentions cannot be saddled with unworkable solutions, but the impression I am getting is that they are.  Regrettably, I have engaged with a lot of people on this issue.  Some of them have come out the other side; some are stuck in the process, while others are afraid to go into it.  These are probably the ones to whom the banks are sending legal letters.<\/p><p>  This is, as I said, a nasty business, but the proposed solutions are not working for everybody.  A greater effort is needed, as well as greater openness, to engage with people, particularly in cases like the one I mentioned in which the extended family is ready to pony up money to try to help.  They could easily walk away.  The nuclear option in one case of which I am aware is to take the insolvency or bankruptcy route, but because of the consequences for the family involved, this is not something they want to do.  They want to try to deal with the issue.<\/p> <p>However, it is an option that is coming closer to their horizon because of what they believe is the bank's intransigence and unwillingness to state they are nearly there and another &euro;50,000 might solve the problem.  They just do not know what it will take to solve it.  There is a little mystique to this like in a poker game, but the debtor holds few of the aces.  The bank needs to engage more.  Without going into individual cases, will Mr. O'Connor outline how the process operates in the financial solutions group at a regional level and refer to the issue of affordability?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900027#AA00800","speaker":"986","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397048700,"counter":678,"content":"<p>Most typically, it is around SME customers and non-mortgage debt.  We have well over 1,200 staff spread throughout the country in various areas.  The fundamental principle is the concept of affordability and consistency.  We have a structure with which the Deputy is familiar under which we say, subject to this being paid, we will compromise on X amount.  I do not know I would necessarily agree - although I am sure there are cases - that people do not know what is being asked of them.  We issue heads of terms, an agreement that states this is what the deal looks like in outline before we progress it further.  There will be a natural tension in such discussions.  We will rarely give somebody everything he or she wants and he or she will rarely give us everything we want.  That is the nature of compromise and we have very well trained staff, of whom I am very proud.  They do a very good job in trying to put in place good solutions.  Ours is the only bank, as far as I know, that has a crystal clear process in order that one knows up-front when one signs up exactly what will happen in the next few years.  There is no concept of stuff hanging there forever.  I can see where a customer or a business may state it is too much for them, but we figure it out on the basis of sustainability.  We cannot afford to leave equity behind to the extent that this is taxpayer's money and if we are going to compromise on it, we have to make sure we have optimal recovery.  It is a matter of trying to balance this.  I take the Deputy's point about the imbalance but as much as possible we try to get this out because a deal cast in such an environment probably does not have much chance of sustaining beyond the first couple of years.  It does not make sense for us to overload a deal because it is just going to fall down in a couple of years and we will have to start all over again.

We are very happy to do this with the individuals concerned, the committee, Mr. O'Connor and me, as required, because the reason we put so many people in the regions was to try to bring the matter to closure and communicate what would happen and the process to be gone through because we were not adequately staffed or effective enough in that regard.

The process was very simple.  We said that if the IMHO is a consumer advocate and people find it more trustworthy than their perception of a bank, and want to engage with it, we will provide resources at whatever level.  With those resources the IMHO could go away and successfully negotiate solutions with those customers.

Has Allied Irish Banks considered the idea of a general write-down of owner-occupied mortgages in negative value to today's value, with a clawback procedure in the event that the craziness starts again, and a recalibration downwards of the monthly payment with a view to a universal solution that would take this horrific millstone off our people and assist the economy to function better and reboot itself?

I preface my remarks by saying I take my hat off to these four gentlemen because they were not part of the bank boards, across the whole banking sector, that were not decent.  I can say this safely because the figures and balance sheets show it.  In the case of AIB, which was not part of its watch, its loan-to-deposit ratios for a series of years ended up at 155%, which is 72% above the norm of 90%, which means that the creation of the asset bubble, which could only occur with a credit bubble, is 72% to the account of the bank.  No matter where the capital comes from, it is for the account of the bank.  In the case of Bank of Ireland, which will be here tomorrow, it is 75%.  The customers who, in good faith, have to live and provide accommodation for their families in owner-occupied houses borrowed into that asset bubble, and when it bursts we have a financial Nagasaki.  That is where we are in Ireland today.  It is not the fault of the witnesses.  This is the truth and every time I try to say it, including this morning in the Chamber, I am muzzled and derided by the Minister for Finance.  I am not asking for any praise but I am asking for acknowledgment of the truth.  Around 180,000 families are in distress, despair and in some cases death.  Last week, David Courtney died due to stress.  As the committee is aware, he was a shareholder in a large NAMA customer.  He was a very worthy developer.  The developers are not at the core of this; it is the bank boards - not the witnesses - and I am not afraid to say that.

They are going around with their heads in the clouds and do not understand the situation.  This is why they do not argue the case for debt write-down in Europe through the euro system.  This write-down should be in two parts.  First, there should be a &euro;25 billion cancellation of the promissory notes, of the money borrowed on the creation of those notes to pay off senior bondholders, people who should be contributing to clearing up this mess.  Second, the banks need more capital.

Therefore, the bank has a vested interest in increasing the pressure on that person so that he will die within the next 15 years, within the life of the policy, and the bank will get all its money.

I wish to raise three issues which I hope are in order.  I, Deputy Mathews and a number of other Oireachtas Members have made a submission to the Minister for Finance calling on him to ensure a fair valuation of properties when adjudication is being made on the issuing of a mortgage.  A mortgage should be based on the historical ratio of income to average house price.  I understand the bank spoke earlier about a 72% loan to value as an average, that it rises to 85% if the value is in excess of &euro;400,000, and that there is a certain limit in regard to one-bedroomed apartments.  The concept we propose is not based on the market value, which can increase where there are people with funding who can compete with one another and drive prices up.<\/p><p>  What we suggest is that we have what we might be termed a \"fair value\" on a property, based on a historical data multiplier - a link between average income relative to average house price.  I understand that historically average house prices were five or six times the average income.  Loans should only be issued for houses on this basis and this should not be let get out of kilter  For example, if a house in Portlaoise is valued at &euro;400,000 and the multiplier is four times the average income, the fair value would be &euro;320,000.  The grant for the mortgage should be based on that.  I sent this proposal to the Irish Banking Federation and it said there was merit in the proposal but they felt it was not a necessary tool.<\/p><p>  I suggest that if this policy had been in place prior to the crash, we would not be in the current difficulty, because it would ensure we had sustainable and responsible lending.  What is the view of AIB on this?  The proposal might seem draconian, but it would stop banks lending money on an basis that is unsustainable for the future.  Notwithstanding the fact that on the day the money is lent, the individual is in a position to make repayments, this can change if employment takes a hit.<\/p> <p>Who would ever have thought that public sector wages would decrease to the extent that they did?<\/p><p> The second issue is in respect of the demand for housing.  Perhaps it does not come under the witnesses' remit, but what do they think of the demand for housing?  The Taoiseach stated that if 30,000 houses were built in Dublin tomorrow morning they would sell.  Other conservative estimates put the need at 5,000 houses, while other projections outlined the number and type of houses needed nationally between now and 2015.  I realise that there is a geographic variation in the demand.  One could say that there are two and a half Irelands, consisting of Cork, Galway, Dublin and the rest of the country.<\/p><p> Morgan Kelly made a point about the SME mortgage time bomb.  I do not know whether the witnesses referred to it earlier, but do they have views on it?  He gave a stark lecture.  Many people put him down as the guru who forecast the difficulties that arose.  Apparently his forecast about the banks was not correct, because he said they were in good order in 2006 and 2007, but it is my understanding-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900032#FF02300","speaker":"1184","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1397051700,"counter":789,"content":"<p>The IMF-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900033#GG00200","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1397051700,"counter":790,"content":"<p>Have the witnesses any view on the warning given by Professor Kelly?

I have no issue with the observation that there would be an impact if we were to do what he said and that we would end up damaging SMEs.  As I sit in the committee with the ECB, the reality is that its primary objective in carrying out stress tests is to guarantee the transition mechanism to support SMEs, as this is central to the growth of Europe.  It may look different from the outside, but the comments made by Mario Draghi and his committee colleagues consistently relate to what they need to do get lending going into SMEs, both domestically and across borders.  As an academic exercise it may be construed one way, but on the practical level on the ground, I am more comfortable that the SME universe will not be negatively affected as articulated.<\/p><p>  We have been working with Government members and other institutions and bodies to map housing demand across the country for the right type of house in the right place, and to look at issues such as NAMA land supply, the appropriate volume of planning permissions or whether they are relevant to their location.  We have worked with the Construction Industry Federation to look at the labour supply and the relevant skills.  We also have given our own commitment to support construction and the mortgages associated with it.  That is coming to a conclusion now, and all the parties will be able to make sure that we build into the demand cycle at an appropriate level and cost for the next few years.  Things will level out and demand will not create too many bubbles, as supply will be coming on stream over the next few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014040900033#GG00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1397051700,"counter":792,"content":"<p>How does the term \"map housing demand\" for the future make its way down to the developer who will purchase land and develop it?

At a minimum, one has to take a best guess at evolving demographics and do that around the country.  It is an imperfect science.  All of the houses will not be built over six months.  They are built over five years, so we keep mapping to that.  The efforts required to work in concert with the different constituents to make that happen has begun, and I think we will be successful.

I gather it was decided not to go ahead with that.  I must accept that, of course, but I believe that was because of the financial arrangements between the People's Republic of China and this country, and the sensitivities arising from that.  In my discussions with the Dalai Lama's representative in London, Mr. Thubten Samdup, he made it absolutely clear to me that the Dalai Lama would not wish in any sense to cause difficulties and if there was controversy, he would not wish to come.  That shows an admirable sensitivity, but personally I find it appalling that a man of peace should not be welcome, and this is happening all over the world.  The UN had a meeting of world religious leaders, and the atheist Chinese Government managed to prevent the Dalai Lama being there.  I think that is this country's loss.<\/p><p>  Some years ago the Green Party proposed to Dublin City Council to grant honorary citizenship of Dublin to the Dalai Lama, and some of the other parties got into a snit about it, because they thought it should have been them who did it, so the motion was defeated on a technicality.  They have no idea of the visionary power of this man and the importance of his message.  I want to put it clearly on the record that it was indicated strongly to me that if there was any difficulty, he would not want to complicate the situation, either for Ireland or for China.

I am here in my capacity as a private citizen, but with a direct experience and familiarity with Ukraine based primarily on my service there as the United Nations Resident Coordinator, responsibly for co-ordinating all UN agencies&rsquo; activities for development, during the period 2004, that is, the Orange Revolution, to 2009.   My views are therefore my own, and I take full responsibility for them.  I compliment the motion on Ukraine carried in the D&aacute;il last week, in every respect.<br \/>I would also like to recognise H.E. Mr. Sergii Reva, Ukraine&rsquo;s ambassador to Ireland and his colleagues from the Baltics.  I have come to know during this crisis.  His previous presentation to the committee on 5 March was not only erudite but accurate.  He has adequately refuted Russian myths about language issues and many other issues as well.  I share fully the Ambassador&rsquo;s alarm that Russia&rsquo;s legislators have empowered President Putin to invade Ukraine.  Worse, Russia&rsquo;s resort to unilateralism to allegedly redress purported grievances, whether on grounds of Ukrainian instability, or language, ethnicity, or political concerns, has to be utterly repudiated.  If there was the slightest truth in Russia&rsquo;s concerns, why did it not recourse to established international instruments, such as the UN Security Council, the Human Rights Council, the OSCE, or the Council of Europe?  Russia must be urged to return to multilateralism and diplomacy.  <br \/>Since my tenure in Ukraine, I have kept in touch with many on the ground and in leadership positions, and during the past several months of this crisis, I have privately networked to build support and understanding for Ukraine&rsquo;s true realities, often in the face of contrary propaganda by its large neighbour.  As a result, and subject to further developments, the Global Partnerships Forum based in New York stands ready to engage in support of Ukraine&rsquo;s partnership-building, and more specifically, following my entreaties to the Elders, that is, the group of distinguished former heads of state and government, headed by Kofi Annan, founded by Nelson Manela.  I believe they are now planning to bring forward a collective <i>demarche<\/i>to Moscow, which they had previously been planning to visit later this year.<br \/>Why is this important?  It is crucial in my view that the strongest possible delegation of distinguished former Heads of State and Government from around the world should engage in force and in unison with the Russian authorities, both President Putin, and the legislative branches of the Russian Federation.  We are on the brink of a major conflagration in Europe.  I have had great concern about this for several months, expressed in my various communications to the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and to the UN Department of Political Affairs.  I wish I were wrong, but my regretful predictions as the weeks have gone by have been sadly accurate, and I express further dismay that the latest report I have read last night from the British Royal United Services Institute, on Ukraine military dispositions, both Ukrainian and Russian, is very worrying.  Therefore, the international community should demand, in light of the annexation of Crimea, that Crimea which is currently occupied in flagrant violation of international law should have an international civilian monitoring presence to ensure that all segments of Crimean society are able to exercise the full range of their civic and political rights.  It is also required as international witness to events, and as a disincentive to abuses of human rights, and to prevent impunity for violations. <br \/>Democracy can be manipulated.  We know this.  For the past ten years Ukrainians have struggled against such manipulation and have resisted such obstructions in favour of joining the European mainstream.  This is no arbitrary political choice, nor optional geo-strategic alignment to fall into one camp or another.  Their aspiration is so deep that it is an insult to them to be told that their orientation is merely the product of western influence, of alleged billions poured in, let alone of US funding of NGOs or EU fiscal bribery, as if they could be &quot;bought off&quot; - to use the term - by such largesse.  Nothing could be further from the truth, and those who cling to such myths are either agents or victims of Kremlin propaganda.  For that matter, US and EU funds provided largely to Ukraine have mainly been used to strengthen civil society, and build institutions&rsquo; capacities in the best traditions of modern governance, and in programmes that reflect the sovereign choice of Ukraine.  The UN and other agencies, as well as other multi and bi-lateral development partners have regularly collaborated with these programmes, within overall frameworks of donor co-ordination and accountability, such as the OECD&rsquo;s Paris Declaration and the Busan Partnership.<br \/>What should now be the priority of the international community?  First, the international community has to ensure that the costs to the Russian Federation are such that President Putin has no alternative other than to realise he grossly miscalculated his Crimean gambit.  Second, diplomacy must remain not only open but creative, exploring solutions &ldquo;outside the box&rdquo;; Russia must not be pushed into such a corner that it feels more isolated and can only fight back.  Third, therefore, there must be other options open to Russia that are attractive domestically and internationally in a fast-changing environment where positions can and must shift, ultimately towards resolution based on political compromise that entails a &ldquo;win-win&rdquo; perception.  Fourth, in this context, the &ldquo;win-win&rdquo; must be quadrilateral, as follows: for Ukraine, for Russia, for the European Union, and for the US and NATO.  That is a tall order, therefore the EU preparation for four-party talks is absolutely the way to go, and last night&rsquo;s announcement that these will start next week is hardly a minute too soon.  Fifth, it should also be a win-win for the international rule of law, for global and regional security, for human rights and broad-based socio-economic progress.  Sixth, it must lead quickly to an omnibus reform of the UN Security Council &ndash; so very long overdue &ndash; as it is thoroughly unacceptable that any Big-5 nuclear-wielding power should not only hold a veto over vital actions to preserve international peace and security, but also be able to flagrantly violate the same.  Seventh, in this crisis, we should see an opportunity on many levels and dimensions, to strengthen the international system, the rules that underpin it, and the instruments designed to uphold human dignity and preserve peace and security.<br \/>Ukraine is at a crossroads and does not need foreign interference, invasion, occupation, fragmentation, and annexation, or for that matter, cultural condescension.  What role can Ireland play?  In my opinion Ireland should return to the great prominence of its moral leadership evinced during the de-colonisation era a half-century ago, and now play a vanguard role in building EU, wider European, and broad global consensus for reform of the UN Security Council.  Ireland should pay attention to the dramatically-altered threat environment posed by recent Russian aggression, conduct a new risk assessment, and reverse the pathetic trend of Irish defence expenditure which at 0.5% of GDP, is far below the EU norm.  We are almost unique as a non-NATO country that has dramatically depleted its Defence Forces in recent years.  In fact we have no practical capacity to defend this country.  Worse, the attempts to reduce the service age will accelerate the loss of trained personnel, at exactly the time when we may need them.  The parliamentary co-operation between the Oireachtas, and the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada could be enhanced within the framework of PACE.<br \/>For Ukraine, Ireland could explore, promote and support the engagement of the Global Partnerships Forum in building stronger partnerships for Ukraine.  It could promote also low-cost confidence-building measures that should serve to assuage both Ukrainian and Russian anxieties about risks of human rights violations, for example, through the deployment of teams by the international NGO coalition known as Non-violent Peaceforce which carries out low-cost and effective unarmed civilian protection with multilateral and bilateral donor funding in such places as the Caucasus, South Sudan, and the Philippines, where it is part of the Mindanao peace process.  FLD from this country could also be involved.  The Government and Oireachtas could support the Institute for International and European Affairs to substantially ratchet-up its monitoring of the situation in Ukraine and its neighbourhood, by having a watching brief regularly shared with government and Oireachtas officials, and also by inviting and hosting presentations by Ukrainian leaders and Russian alternative political voices, such as Boris Nemstov,<b><\/b>former deputy prime minister.<br \/>Not least, the Irish in Ukraine have long lamented Ireland&rsquo;s failure to deploy a full-time resident ambassador to Ukraine.  It is beyond comprehension that this, the largest country entirely in Europe, located at its geographic heart, in such a geo-strategically sensitive location, with a population about the size of Spain&rsquo;s, should have no Irish resident embassy.<\/p> <p>Ukraine's progress in this respect, with out support, would not be at the expense of Russia.  To the contrary, Russia stands to gain enormously from a European Ukraine but obstructing it is a lose-lose failure.<\/p><p> More than this, let me conclude by saying that this is an historic opportunity to, as it were, \"build back better\" a genuine and deeper partnership between Russia, Europe and America.  It would be one which is inclusive rather than built on exclusions, one that appreciates the multi-vector realities that Ukraine has so earnestly tried to balance.  Last but not least, one that not only recognises Ukraine&rsquo;s strategic centrality to the continent of Europe.  It also enables Ukraine to enjoy its location to the fullest by being the great link that underpins Russo-Euro-Atlantic co-operation.

Yesterday I attended a meeting on this same issue in Brussels that was organised by the socialists and democrats group.  A number of people from a journalistic background were in attendance.  Everyone was given some insight into what has happened to journalists and the importance of a free press.  Mention was made of two journalises who were held for 11 days, stripped of their clothes, had their hair cut, were held incommunicado for the entire 11 days and did not know if they were going to survive.  That was only a couple of weeks before the meeting.  It was said that the day before that another three people had been kidnapped and they were held for a couple of days in the same way.  The day before yesterday four attacks had been made on media offices supposedly by so-called Russian separatists.  By now people have formed their views on the matter.  The people at the meeting said that the media had been manipulated across the board regarding this matter and it is important to establish a free media.<\/p><p>  The EU and others are concerned about the situation.  Does Mr. O'Donnell see them having an important role to play?  At the meeting the point was made that it was more than just people from a Ukrainian background who were  investigating the situation and that journalists from the west were being attacked as well.  They said that there were voices coming out of Russia as propaganda on the situation.  <\/p><p>  I agree with what Mr. O'Donnell said about a win:win situation.  My view of the zero sum is that people were given an either-or option.  It is important for us to move away from zero sums.  That game continues because the Russians still propose it even though the country is practically bankrupt.  The EU is also talking about the matter.  We do need dialogue but people need to step back.  Some of the options proposed by Mr. O'Donnell may work and they are worth looking at. <\/p><p>  Some people have portrayed this situation as Moscow's grand plan to destabilise Ukraine.  Does Mr. O'Donnell believe that claim?  That is one viewpoint that has come out.  Yesterday's discussion in Brussels was useful because there were new voices to listen to and some of them had been at the protests that took place on the square.  They talked about what happened and the amount of people who had been killed.  Information came out about the interior Minister ordering uniforms to be destroyed, that the weaponry used had been put offside and that the rounds of ammunition that had been ordered were used for deer hunting.  There was a trail of information but that has all gone now at the hands of the previous minister.<\/p><p>  We are playing catch up in terms of Ukraine.  If we, as a society, are concerned about finding out what happened to many of the people who were killed then we need to conduct a separate body of work.  Does Mr. O'Donnell agree that the EU should hold off any negotiating agreement with Ukrainian leaders until after the elections?  There will be elections shortly.  Will they help the situation?  I note what he said in his report, that he is critical of people saying that it was an interim government and so on.  <\/p><p>  A question arose at yesterday's meeting about the inclusion of the far right in the Government such as the deputy prime minister and others.  The person who chaired the conference, and was in the same group as Deputy Eric Byrne, said that such involvement is one of the concerns that people have in Europe.  Also, there was reference to the fact that prior to the election those individuals had very little electoral support, yet nine members have been appointed to government, which sends out the wrong signal.  No satisfactory answers were given on the day.<\/p><p>  Another matter is the involvement in and building of civic society in Ukraine, which is hugely important as we move into the next phase.  I am interested to hear Mr. O'Donnell's viewpoint on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014040900004#C00400","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1397050800,"counter":824,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I deeply respect his accumulated knowledge and his experience as ambassador and placements throughout the world.  I am fascinated by his contribution.  It is my belief that I have not, as a politician, engaged in any previous issue that has been so divisive on the propaganda field.  A horrendous propaganda campaign has emanated from the east by the Russians.  We cannot move forward and be satisfied unless we come to terms with what provoked the Russians to move into Crimea.  I am not happy that the west has projected itself honestly from a propaganda point of view.<\/p><p>  In order to move forward it is important to understand what happened.  Therefore, I shall defer to Mr. O'Donnell and ask him a couple of questions.  What is his belief or understanding of the eastern partnership as a European concept?  To this day I fail to understand how so many people from the west engaged without success in the eastern partnership relationship with Ukraine.  Mr. Pat Cox was sent out as the Baroness Ashton's agent.  Everybody in the west was told, including the Cheann Comhairle who visited Kiev and spoke to people there, that the ink had almost dried on the paper yet the partnership did not happen.  Can Mr. O'Donnell explain the diplomatic ineptitude within the European Union that existed at the time?<\/p> <p>Notwithstanding what had happened in Georgia when that President, stupidly, in my view, attempted to take on the so-called Russian bear, who he thought was asleep on some bank holiday weekend in May, he is now advising the current Government, which worries me.  That was the history.  Then, the Eastern Partnership was engaging in these agreements with Armenia, and clearly Armenia pulled out because of the pressure from the Russians.  Therefore, we already have a timescale and then we have the lads trying to secure the agreement of Yanukovych.<\/p><p> What worries me is that I am not satisfied that all the Western propaganda has been explained.  Why did we not know about the existence of the extreme right wing fascists in Ukraine until after the events?  Is Mr. O'Donnell happy that the intercession of France, Poland and Germany in the creation of the alternative Government, which gave such prominence to these fascists in the new Government, was appropriate diplomacy?  What does he think of the first decision of that Government to outlaw Russian in those peripheral regions where Russian was recognised as the second language?  Its first parliamentary project was to renege on that agreement.  There is a lot of propaganda.  It worries me that we have not as yet had an explanation as to why the Estonian Foreign Minister, in a live taped broadcast with the baroness, suggested that guns were being used by the opposition.  It is my confirmed belief that members of the opposition killed at least 12 riot police.  Where is this being debated in order that we can understand the totality of what went on at the Maidan?<\/p><p> In the past three years it has always been my belief that the West has not treated Ukraine as a unitary state.  It spoke to the Western element of Ukraine and totally neglected to engage and understand the Russian speakers and the Russian half of the nation.  Diplomacy in the West and in the European Union must be examined very closely in regard to why the poor Ukrainian state is in the state it is in today, given what is happening in Donetsk and the eastern regions.  I am probably an unpopular politician in suggesting that we need to study the role the EU played in pushing the Eastern Partnership cause, given what trends had occurred in Georgia, where the troops could have gone as far as Tbilisi, as we know.  How did it get it so wrong?  Pat Cox was out there and everyone was going to sign, but it all failed.<\/p><p> I extend and put on the public record my support for the Ukrainian state, the state of both Russian and Ukrainian speakers.  We must do all in our power.  Mr. O'Donnell is aware the OSCE originally sent in some monitors, who could not get into Crimea in any case.  A presidential election is taking place.  One of the first acts of Tymoshenko when she got out of jail, notwithstanding what was going on with the four leaders of the West and with the Parliaments, was to tell the rioters to stay at their posts.  Now, she is going to be a candidate in this election.  Would Mr. O'Donnell agree with me that what we need in Ukraine are nationalists who believe in Ukraine as a totality, combining the support of the Ukrainian people and Russian speaking Ukrainians?  How does he view the OSCE election monitoring that is going to take place?  He knows they are sending out 900 short-term observers and there is already a core team and other teams out there.  How does he consider it will pan out in terms of their ability to monitor?<\/p><p> Does Mr. O'Donnell think a presidential election at this point in time is the appropriate structure that is required for Ukraine?  In other words, would it not be far more democratic and healthy to have parliamentary elections rather than presidential elections?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014040900004#C00600","speaker":"1030","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1397051400,"counter":827,"content":"<p>Dia dhuit a iar-ambasad&oacute;ir, agus t&aacute; f&aacute;ilte romhat.  First, I compliment Mr. O'Donnell on an admirably passionate advocacy of the rights of the people of Ukraine, which is very refreshing and, if it was not always diplomatic, I welcome that.  We all feel that the people really squeezed in this situation are the small people who want to get on with their lives, raise their families, educate their children and live happily.  There are very worrying historical echoes, for me, of the Sudetenland and the Anschluss, and the way in which German speaking people were deliberately motivated by Berlin to create trouble in order that this would provide an alibi and an excuse.  This is particularly worrying in a place like Donetsk, for example.<\/p><p>  I have two questions and I would then like to make some comments.  First, what, in Mr. O'Donnell's opinion, would constitute a win-win situation?  My second question is more fundamental but very important.  I am delighted Mr. O'Donnell raised the issue, which concerns the outrageous situation of the UN Security Council.  There is absolute need for reform of the UN at the very highest level.  It is not tolerable that the post-Second World War situation remains, whereby there are five countries with vetoes permanently on the council.  It is totally out of date and it leads to an abrogation of democracy.  I was quite amused, by the way, by the attitude of the Chinese on this, in that they abstained and they waffled, and they this and they that.  I would love to see them take a similar position with regard to their own situation in Tibet, where they have done huge damage.<\/p><p>  I note the reference to confidence building measures we could engage in that would assuage both Ukrainian and Russian anxieties about risks of human rights violations.  Mr. Putin is quite a professional human rights violator himself.  I have to say, as somebody who likes looking at the psychology of leadership, there seems to me to be something a bit odd about a leader who finds it necessary to gallop around half naked on a stallion in order to demonstrate his masculinity, while he is persecuting gay people who do not behave in half as outrageous a fashion.<\/p><p>  The other point I want to make is one I do not think will recommend itself to Mr. O'Donnell, for which I apologise, but I like to look at the truth.  I believe Crimea is part of Russia historically.  If we look at Crimea, with its enormous Russian naval base and the kind of population balance there, while it may be uncomfortable, I think it is part of Russia.  The problem is Putin and the putrid regime that he heads.<\/p><p>  It was the same in Iraq.  There is not the slightest question or doubt that Kuwait was part of Iraq.  In any situation - and I am half-English - where we have the British Administration in 1919 drawing a line from the coast, turning at right angles, taking another right-angled turn, hitting the coast neatly and enclosing all the then known oil reserves for their own advantage, it is obvious that Saddam Hussein was right.  He was egged on to a certain extent by the Americans, although they then intervened.  The problem was that Saddam was a monster and his regime was appalling.  I would say to people on this committee to look at the net result of international intervention led by the United States and Britain.  I have been in Iraq.  It is a hell of a lot worse.  The lives of ordinary people are now infinitely worse than they were before.  That is a fact.  Where there was a secular state, there is now sectarianism.<\/p><p>  I would be worried about this situation, which is immensely complex.  I have great sympathy for and empathy with the ordinary, decent people of Ukraine, whether they are Russian speaking or Ukrainian speaking.  Our sticking our nose in, in any very militaristic way, would be a disaster.  I pose this question.<\/p> <p>For example, if Russia had decided to mount a massive propaganda campaign in Hawaii and convinced the indigenous people of the island that they had been walked on and their rights trampled by dreadful flip-flop wearing tourists and they were incited to say, \"Russia, please come in and rescue in\" and they went in, the Yanks would not like it given all the naval bases and so on in Hawaii.  There would be a whiff of cordite around the joint.  It is a complex situation.  Our interest and that of Mr. O'Donnell is the welfare of the people on the ground.  The arrangements of empires are for the people at the top who are usually blackguards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014040900005#D00200","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1397052000,"counter":829,"content":"<p>According to Mr. O'Donnell's curriculum vitae, one of the schools he attended is St. Vincent's in Glasnevin, which is in the constituency I represent.<\/p><p>  Last night's Irish television news carried pictures of our President and the Queen of England speaking together at the banquet in Windsor Castle and this reminded us of our troubled, difficult and fractured history and relationship with Britain and where we are at this point in time.  This was followed by a report on violence at a meeting in the Ukrainian Parliament.  It was appalling to see members of parliament beating each other up in the parliament.  Where will the leadership come from if that is the solution to a disagreement between people with varying views?<\/p><p>  When the Ukrainian ambassador appeared before the committee, he described vividly the Russian language issue for people in the Crimea and gave an example of that and when the Russian ambassador appeared before us, I asked him why these human rights issues had not been brought to the various authorities and he had no answer.  I was left to draw my own conclusions from that.<\/p><p>  I have a question about the implications of what has happened not only for Ukraine and Crimea but for the other former members of the USSR.  One cannot help feeling their fear and the dangerous scenario they are in if this is the beginning of the age of imperialism, round two.  The other issue is gas and energy dependence and what is going on in this regard.  What is Mr. O'Donnell's view on that?  Senator Norris mentioned the ports issue.

Is this a reference to increased sanctions?  Will Mr. O'Donnell flesh this out?  He said: \"Diplomacy must remain not only open but creative.\"  What creative solutions has he in mind?

He referred to the helplessness of the international community, an issue we have all raised in the House from time to time when an aggressor appears on the scene.  The strongest suit an aggressor always has is the belief that no one can intervene and no action can be taken.  Then aggressor in whatever part of the globe he or she may be will proceed.  We do not have to go too far back in our history for examples of aggressors assuming supreme control on the basis that nobody had the courage to ask them to stop or to intervene with them.  That is the lesson to be learned.<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Donnell is correct about the need to reform the UN Security Council in a way that would make it more meaningful and more respected.  I was surprised by the appraisal by some Members of the Ukrainian conflict during a debate in the House last week who made a comparison with the war in Kosovo.  It was indicated that the EU and NATO were aggressors.  Even recent history fades into memory quickly because that was not the case.  The aggressor recognised that nobody had the power to intervene.  The UN did not have the military power to be able to stand down an aggressor and diplomacy did not work.  It was as simple as that.  During the famous intervention in Srebrenica, it was clear that the UN was recognised as being helpless and unable to do anything and, as a result, 8,000 people were massacred in one fell swoop.  It is to the discredit of the international community that it was unable to deal with that.<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Donnell raised the question of the appointment of an ambassador to Ukraine and we should consider this.  We will convey that to the Minister.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Sullivan raised an important issue.  Diplomacy works in more ways than one.  Hidden diplomacy with an iron fist is an alternative.  Energy supplies to that region are in Russian hands.  The rest of the international community must be able to say to them that they cannot do what they wish all the time.  There has to be recognition of the rights of others and of minorities and that applies across the board.<\/p><p>  Nelson Mandela left prison after a long number of years.  He was unique in the sense that he was a forgiving man.  He was able to walk away and then talk about peace.  Everybody is not as easily disposed towards peace, particularly when they have been imprisoned following a short, sharp intervention in this fashion and it takes them longer to recover.  We need to recognise that Yulia Tymoshenko was not treated in a democratic fashion when she was in prison.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014040900006#E00400","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397052000,"counter":832,"content":"<p>I thank the members.  I am excited by their questions and I would love to answer them in the detail and the richness of a good debate.  I will try to do justice to them and I will go through my notes from the beginning.  I will, therefore, begin with Deputy Byrne.  There is a huge challenge to us in the international community - and this is an irony, if not a paradox, of today's information revolution that we so often speak about - first to understand where is the truth in all that we are hearing about Ukraine and to what extent there is any veracity in the many Russian claims made about the situation there.  I believe there is some.  Can we believe everything that is said from the other side of fence - the western or EU sides?  It is difficult.<\/p> <p>In a way, it comes down to questions of honesty, transparency, accountability and the extent to which we can corroborate and verify the evidence and determine what it suggests.  If we want to examine Russia's activities, particularly those of President Putin, we must ask what exactly is occurring and his motivation.  Have we been asleep at the switch for years without recognising the significance of the Georgian experience and other events?<\/p><p> I note that Transnistria did not figure particularly prominently, or at all, in the remarks but I am very concerned that Russia will not stop with Crimea and push into eastern Ukraine imminently.  I have been saying to those on whom I feel I have an influence and who can influence events that the presidential elections on 25 May are what I consider to be the outside limit of what Mr. Putin believes to be his window of opportunity to seize what he wants in Ukraine.  It is unlikely that he will wait until the day before the elections prior to acting.  Irrespective of whether one relies on General Breedlove of NATO or the British Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies, whose very interesting report I read last night, all the indicators suggest the build-up is ready to move.  The Russian forces are, to all intents and purposes, ready to move, regardless of how poorly reformed they may be and how poorly co-ordinated they might turn out to be in practice.  If this is the case, the world at large has no time to lose.  I hesitate to say the west because the matter should not be cast in these polar terms.  We in the world at large have no time to lose in bringing pressure to bear on Mr. Putin personally and on his regime to have him back off from the horrendous move he has made into Ukraine and the devastating gesture he has made towards the international rule of law.  The move has come from a Big Five superpower with a nuclear arsenal.  The question of truth is fundamental.  It is perhaps very difficult to discuss this when views can be so polarised, as members rightly pointed out.<\/p><p> Why did we in the west not project ourselves better?  Much of the substantive background analysis and information on Mr. Putin's motives and what was occurring has been available.  What has been missing, and what is usually missing, as with the risk of Rwandan genocide, on which I spoke to a multi-faith forum in New York six months prior to that genocide's occurrence, and as with problems in the Balkans over 20 years ago, is a political leadership that ought to be informed about and conscious of the risks.  The political leadership does not take these matters into account when it ought to.  I sit here today to try to do my bit to alert the committee, in our humble nation on the fringe of Europe, to the grave risks that we all face.<\/p><p> Let me address the question of what I think of the concept of the Eastern Partnership.  It was, on the whole, an effort in very good faith to try to afford the possibility of integration into the European Union to those countries on its periphery.  Such countries are getting closer and closer to the Russian frontier.  I was asked what I mean by \"creative\".  There is a Eurasian union on the cards, if not coming into being, and there is the European Union and the gap between the two.  There is still a black hole in the Balkans, whose states have still not been integrated into the European Union although they are completely surrounded by it.  It would not take too much to imagine an arrangement between the European Union and the Russian Federation with some involvement across the Atlantic in support of this on the basis of some further political configuration that is not as intensive as the European Union but which does not compromise the existing unity between its member states.<\/p><p> I hope the Union can be improved and reformed further and that we can get rid of the democratic deficit that is so often spoken about.  I am talking about bringing Russia closer to a looser type of arrangement like the European Union, making it part of such an arrangement and giving it some kind of prominence, while also giving the other central Asian countries a role in addition to the Caucasus and so forth.  In a way, this ought to be possible.<\/p><p> Curiously, I believe former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, when in office, and others spoke about a Euro-Mediterranean union.  When we look to the south, we look beyond the European Union towards some sort of more open and inclusive arrangement that involves the relevant countries in a wider set of challenges and opportunities.  The same should be done in the east.  The same needs to be done with Russia.  Russia cannot be made to feel excluded from what is happening.  We need to think outside the box and determine how this can be achieved.  However, we are too slow in the west.  In Europe, we are far too slow to move forward with these types of ideas, flesh them out and debate them.  Instead, what has been happening is that Mr. Putin and his elite have been pursuing a different, more imperialist vision of a resurgent Russia, very much influenced by Mr. Ivan Ilyin and other such people.  There is an ideology in Russia today based on a form of Marxism that regarded the tragedy of the 20th century as being the collapse of the Soviet Union, but also on what President Putin's philosophical mentor Ivan Ilyin has described as the tragedy of the Russian Revolution. <\/p><p> It is very important to understand the philosophical underpinnings of what Mr. Putin is doing, what makes him think, what drives the elite, and where the interests mesh with the oligarchic class.  Unfortunately, a book that was to be published by Cambridge University Press on the connections that may or are alleged to exist between criminal networks, organised oligarchs and the Putin regime has been pulled back by the publisher out of fear of litigation from the Russian side.<\/p><p> There is a need for us to understand, at a wider level and not just at the level of policy experts, much more deeply what is happening in the part of the world in question and not be swayed too much by the ideological clich&eacute;s that arise from time to time.  We should not regard this as a left&ndash;right issue in the classic sense of Irish politics, for example.  This is not an issue of the left and right wings, nor is it an issue of the west of Europe versus the east of Europe.  Even in Ukraine, it is not an issue of the west of Ukraine versus the east of Ukraine.  Outside the main urban centres where Russian is the predominant language, the language in the rural areas is primarily Ukrainian.  One should not think that when one sees a linguistic map of Ukraine, it is showing one the political configuration, even in Kharkiv, for example.<\/p><p> We are speaking English in this room today.  Can one imagine the outcome if, after President Higgins&rsquo;s visit to London over the past few days, soccer hooligans were to come over here fomenting unrest against Gaelg&oacute;ir&iacute; and people began stating we must speak up for the rights of English speakers, with the result that Her Majesty's Government became very concerned about the matter and British forces started coming here without their insignia to take over Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan so as to annexe them to Northern Ireland and declare the Republic of Ulster, which would be suddenly annexed by Great Britain?  This should not be done but it is exactly what Mr. Putin has done in Crimea.  It is exactly what he would not fail to do if he had the chance in the rest of Ukraine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014040900006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Francis M.

In other words, there was an element of blackmail in Russia's treatment of Ukraine at that point in time.<br \/>With the association process, in absorbing the <i>acquis communautaire,<\/i>a number of chapters will be very problematic, especially the agricultural area for the Ukraine, for example, and in some other areas.  Like all of the other countries that have joined the EU, Ireland has gone through this process more or less.  Ireland has had its fisheries issues and other countries have had reservations about one thing or another.  It is through the process of discussion and dialogue that one eventually sorts things out.<br \/>I shall explain what I think has happened.  President Putin saw a threat and sees a threat in western liberal traditions and in western liberal thinking.  If one understands what goes on in the Kremlin then one will understand the following.  Anything that speaks of a greater open society, more liberal values or sharing of them, and various freedoms that are only recent in this country for certain communities is seen as a threat by President Putin.  He is extremely conservative, he is politically fairly autocratic and even some of the political elite in Russia are very concerned about what is happening in Russia.  As I mentioned in my paper, only yesterday Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister of Russia, drew a comparison between the liberties and rights that Putin espouses for Russian speakers as if they are ethnic Russians - which is not the same thing - in Ukraine and the denial of the same rights to people in Russia.  There has been a gradual pulling back from these things.  <br \/>Clearly, at the intelligence level there had been an insufficient grasp of what was likely to happen with the partnership and an insufficient understanding of the risks.  I think we were all taken by surprise by the alacrity with which Russia manoeuvred itself into Ukraine or Crimea and into which it has an exit.  One can be fairly sure that because of the sophistication with which this has been done that - and they say that it was almost bloodless though not entirely - this has been in the planning for a very long time.  It is not the sort of thing that just comes about by chance.  In the west we did not realise what was going to happen.  Pat Cox's role was a very important one.  I would not say that there was diplomatic ineptitude.  I am not competent to judge the competence of the European Union's diplomats.  With regards comparisons with Georgia and the fact that Armenia pulled out, we should have seen something more in that situation but we did not.  <br \/>A question was asked about fascists.  Let me also mention the issue of anti-semitism.  About eight years ago when I was the resident co-ordinator in Ukraine we had a very serious problem on the streets of Ukraine.  I would say there was a rise of zenophia.  Even people who were Spanish did not look Slavic enough and were occasionally beaten up and tortured.  There was huge concern for Japanese, Indian, Oriental and African students who were being regularly beaten up.  This was all being done by a tiny fringe group of neo-nazi extremists.<br \/>In response I mobilised the international community.  We created what was called the diversity initiative which was implemented by UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration.  We got President Yushchenko at the time to acknowledge the problem and take action.  He instructed the SBU, which is the secret service headed today by Valentyn Nalyvaichenko who was also the head of it at the time though not in the interim.  Mr. Nalyvaichenko took immediate action against these people and the foreign ministry set up a unit to monitor the situation.  There was excellent dialogue and communication between the international community and the Government at that time in order to deal with this <i>cr&eacute;puscule<\/i>of extremism.  <br \/>Extremists exist as they exist in most countries in Europe.  One has far less risk and less incidents are experienced today in Ukraine, for example, by the Jewish community than one has in Paris, London, Munich or Berlin.  It is true that there was one rabbi who said that all of the Jews should leave Ukraine.  His call was immediately contradicted by the most widely recognised chief rabbi of Ukraine - there is more than one - Yaakov Dov Bleich who is head of one of the Hasidic movement.  Rabbi Bleich clearly said this was not the case and there was no major risk to the Jewish community in Ukraine and, in fact, a lot of the anti-Semitic activity was motivated clandestinely from Russia.  This statement was backed by Rabbi Alexander Duchovny who is the chief rabbi of the progressive Jewish movement in Ukraine.  It was also picked up by a rabbi who is himself a native of Simferopol in Crimea.  Both rabbis wrote to Mr. Putin telling him to please back off and to stop playing the Jewish card in Ukraine, that this is not an issue and he does not need to make it an issue.  If one read the articles of <i>The Times of Israel<\/i>one would also see that this situation is largely the case.  We should not exaggerate the importance of this matter.  It is always a risk in any western society as much as in any eastern European country.  Fanning the problem does not help and that is what has been done by Russian propaganda.<br \/>Fascism exists.  Most of us would not be happy to see some fascist members of Svoboda or the Right Sector  take part in some of the activities in Ukraine, let alone in the current cabinet of the Government.  Let me explain what happened.  Mr. Yanukovych accepted the memorandum, that he signed with three foreign Ministers who had arrived and also the Russian envoy, and reverted to the constitution of 2004.  He then refused to sign the Bill that would have done so and fled the country.  The Rada Parliament, acting under the terms of the agreement, reverted to the constitution of 2004 and in the absence of an effective head of State - because he had fled the country - appointed a speaker and a cabinet composed of democratically elected members of the Verkhovna Rada to assume office.  How anybody could question the legitimacy of such a parliament?  One can.  If I am not mistaken, Italy currently has a Prime Minister who is not an elected member of Parliament.  Has anybody created a fuss about Italy?  I do not think so.  Each country has its constitutional traditions.  Is there a need for constitutional reform in Ukraine?  Absolutely and that has been recognised by the major political parties.  They need to adopt, or consider at least, a lot of the recommendations of the Venice Commission which will bring them to a meaningful place.  This is a work in progress.  The Irish Constitution is not perfect, just look at how many times we have had to amend Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.<br \/>With regards the OSCE mission, Tymoshenko told protestors to stay put on the Maidan which was probably not a good move.  Some mistakes were also made on the Ukrainian side.  It was obviously a mistake by Rada to try to remove the status given to the Russian language.  The acting president did not endorse the bill so it was a red herring.  <br \/>It was also probably a mistake to dissolve the Berkut forces.  The regime simply disowned them and allowed them to be recruited <i>en masse<\/i>by the Russians in Crimea and elsewhere.  The proper thing to do would have been to rein in the Berkut security forces.  The regime should have ensured that the Berkut were properly under civilian control and would not engage in the sorts of things that have happened in Crimea and now in Kharkov and Lugansk.<br \/>The question of including the Global Elders was raised.  The Global Elders is a group of former statesmen and stateswomen, which includes our own Mary Robinson.  It was led by the late Nelson Mandela but its current Chair is Kofi Annan whose birthday was yesterday.  I have been agitating, so to speak, to get this group of distinguished world leaders to go to Moscow.<\/p> <p>I have been told they were going to go later in the year and that they wanted to keep their powder dry.  I went back to them again on this and they said they would bring the trip forward.  I do not know how soon it will be.  Does it have the support of the UN, EU or Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade?  I have no idea but I have written to the Department to urge it to support a measure like this.  <\/p><p> The non-functioning of the Security Council is tragic.  It needs to be reformed and the committee knows my views on that.  Is there any appetite for reform?  There was in recent years and when we had the Millennium Declaration around the turn of the Millennium, there was much promise and hope.  I remember how following the events of 11 September 2001, the thought of what a moment of truth crossed my mind.  US foreign policy does not always work, there are lessons to be learned here and there.  There might have been a real reaching out to the underprivileged in this world.  What happened then?  We had the riposte to the events of 11 September; the war on terror; the rolling back of civil liberties in many countries; increasing repression, even in western countries; and all of what we have today with cyber-security issues.  Our lives have changed forever as a result.  It is tragic.  The dividend we should have got with the peace situation in the world in 2000 was blown asunder when all the financing that would have been available to really achieve the Millennium Development Goals and more than that, many of the principled ideas that are in the Millennium Declaration itself had to go towards security, the war on terror, higher insurance premiums and all the rest so it is very difficult to try to recover that ground.  <\/p><p> The situation we are now facing where Russia as a responsible guarantor of the international post-Second World War order has flagrantly violated the fundamental norms of peace and security must be a wake-up call around the world that we need to reform the international instruments we have for our protection.  It is a nonsense that the five largest arms-exporting and producing countries in the world should be the ones who are guaranteeing our security.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014040900008#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Francis M.

I am sure there will be many people in other countries in the EU, Europe and beyond who will be willing to join it.<\/p><p>  The question of media freedom is fundamentally important.  We ought to have a free media.  However, we have a problem in the west.  What we increasingly see with globalisation are mergers and acquisitions, industry consolidation and large conglomerates taking over and pushing out small enterprise.  It happens in agriculture, the retail sector, the communications industry and the media.  Even in the US, about four or five media conglomerates largely dictate content - even on the small radio stations one tunes into as one drives along route 66.  We have lost the diversity of small enterprise that ought to underpin the democracy of the economy.  This is what I would call the down side of globalisation and something needs to be done about it either through anti-trust legislation or some measure to prevent the emergence of oligopoly in these different marketplaces.  It is fundamental for democracy that we have a free press but it is also fundamental that we have diversity of opinion and freedom of expression and that it is accessible and can be expressed.  When one has too few people controlling the vast empires that comprise the media world today, liberty is at risk.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014040900009#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Francis M.

We very much welcome the heads of the children and family relationships Bill and are delighted to have an opportunity to contribute our opinion.  Our attention has focused on heads 1 to 30, inclusive, as they involve parentage issues relating to assisted human reproduction and surrogacy. <\/p><p>  In response to publication of the heads of the Bill, an expert group of obstetrician gynaecologists was formed to compile a written opinion on behalf of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  However, fertility treatment is very much a multidisciplinary effort that includes not only doctors but also embryologists, nurses, counsellors and administration staff.  Therefore, in order to obtain as wide an opinion as possible from assisted reproductive technology, ART, practitioners in Ireland, an invitation for input was extended to the Irish Fertility Society, the Irish Clinical Embryologists group, the Irish Fertility Counsellors Association, IFCA, the Irish Fertility Nurses Group, IFNG, and representatives of all long established assisted reproduction units in Ireland.  This document can, therefore, be regarded as representing a consensus opinion among all of these groups.<\/p><p>  We were mindful of the report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction in 2005, the Irish Fertility Society consensus on infertility and ART practice in 2011 and the recent Supreme Court and High Court judgments.  While we welcome the heads of the Bill, we acknowledge the complexity of the issues involved and make the following 11 major observations.  Other recommendations are included in our written report.<\/p><p>  We identify the need for clarity in the medical terms used in the Bill.  Clarity and accessible language are paramount in a complex medical area such as this.  The term \"conception\" used in the Bill is vague, with no clear medical definition.  In assisted reproduction, key events, including consent, happen at the time of sperm insemination in insemination cases and in IVF at the time of formation of an embryo but also at the time of its subsequent transfer to the uterus.  We suggest, therefore, that throughout the document the term \"conception\" be replaced by clear time points relevant to the particular treatment being undertaken.  Similarly, the term \"human reproductive material\", as defined in the Bill, is confusing.  We suggest the terms \"sperm\", \"oocyte\" and \"embryo\" be used instead.  We also stress that the legislation refers to the embryo only prior to implantation.<\/p><p>  We believe the Bill should address the importance of counselling for persons undergoing assisted reproduction treatment.  Professional counselling should be mandatory in cases involving donor conceptions and surrogacy.<\/p><p>  We propose that the Bill address anonymity or non-anonymity of donors of sperm, oocytes or embryos.  Whether gametes or embryos are donated on an anonymous or known basis, it should not affect legal parentage, but the right of children to access information on their genetic origins needs to be urgently considered.<\/p><p>  We think the legislation should incorporate provisions for posthumous conception through assisted reproduction.  This issue is of great concern to couples undergoing assisted reproduction.  Several Irish ART clinics already provide this service.  This is common practice in some European countries, including the United Kingdom.  It is of particular relevance to those who have been diagnosed with cancer and wish to freeze sperm, oocytes or embryos.<\/p><p>  We support a non-commercial approach to treatment, but propose that the Bill allow the payment of reasonable expenses to donors of sperm, oocytes and embryos.  <\/p><p>  We propose that in the Bill it be acknowledged that in cases of sperm, oocyte or embryo donation, there may be only one parent.<\/p><p>  With regard to surrogacy, we propose that the Bill include a mechanism whereby potential surrogates and potential patients may access information on surrogacy services.<\/p><p>  We propose that the Bill include cases where a child is conceived using a donated embryo or an embryo where the sperm and oocyte have both been donated by third parties.<\/p><p>  We propose that the Bill include cases where a surrogate conceives using her own oocytes.  There are several medical reasons for this on which we can elaborate.<\/p><p>  The Bill should clarify the legal rights and obligations of all parties entering into a surrogacy arrangement regarding: (a) the right of the surrogate to dictate medical care for her and her foetus during the pregnancy; (b) legal responsibility for care of the child, including decision making and consent, during the interval from birth to the time of assignment of parentage; (c) responsibility for the care of a child born with a significant disability or foetal anomaly. <\/p><p>We believe the proposed penalties for offences in respect of payment for surrogacy may be unworkable.<\/p><p>  My colleague, Dr. Mocanu, and I will be very happy to elaborate on these proposals.  We thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to present these carefully considered views on behalf of our members and, more importantly, our patients and their current and future children.  A major strength of our submission lies in the fact that it represents the considerable experience of a multidisciplinary group working at the coalface of assisted reproductive technology treatments in Ireland.  We would be delighted to offer our services in the future to aid in the development of this much needed and much welcomed Bill.

I am a law lecturer at NUI Galway.<br \/>I suggest head 10 of the Bill, when read in conjunction with head 2, may, in fact, be constitutionally infirm.  The Bill is unclear as to whether it applies to assisted reproduction that takes place only in a clinical context or if it also applies to assisted reproduction that also takes place in a non-clinical setting such as self-insemination or &quot;home-insemination&quot;.  The reason this poses a problem is that where there is home-insemination, there is no formal procedure by which a known sperm donor father, for example, may waive parental rights prior to a lesbian couple proceeding with self-insemination.  Therefore, the known donor can be ousted from playing any parental role in respect of the child without ever having formally waived parental rights.  It appears that the Bill is attempting, although I may be incorrect, to abrogate the decision of the Supreme Court in McD <i>v<\/i>. L, whereby it recognises that a known donor is akin to any other natural father.  If that is not the intention of the Bill, I propose that the Oireachtas change some of the language used in the Bill to ensure, similar to the points made, certain things are given a proper definition at the outset.  I strongly encourage that the procedure be defined in the Bill because, to my mind, it is arguable that self-insemination is a procedure that results in, to use the language used in the Bill, or leads to implantation of the embryo.<\/p> <p>Self-insemination initially results in fertilisation and eventually implantation but legally interpreting the Bill it does result in or lead to implantation.  That is why I feel the Bill covers the self-insemination scenario whether that is the intention or not.  The reason I believe this makes the Bill constitutionally infirm is that even in the absence of Article 42A and the child nonetheless has constitutional rights, the child has, to quote Mr. Justice Walsh in G <i>v <\/i>An Bord Ucht&aacute;la, natural rights to be supported and reared by its parent or parents who are the ones responsible for its birth.  Arguably a known sperm donor father is responsible for the child's birth.  Also Article 7.1 of he United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that the child shall have as far as possible the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents.  If we are to oust the known donor prior to the birth of the child and prevent that person from applying for rights of guardianship or access we are, perhaps, denying the child its fundamental constitutional rights.  Arguably, if Article 42A is inserted, what may be a natural and imprescriptible right of the child to at least know and possibly have the society of its father is a concern in respect of the Bill as it currently stands.  However, if the Oireachtas wishes to exclude the known-donor scenario I would strongly encourage that the language in Head 10 be changed and that a definition is given for what is meant by &quot;procedure&quot; in the Bill, that it is referring to a clinical procedure.<br \/>If the Bill is regulating and abrogating the decision in McD <i>v <\/i>L  then it will favour the intention-based parental status model or the intentions in the example of the lesbian couple a family unit that is devoid of constitutional protection over the constitutionally protected and, perhaps, soon expressly constitutionally protected rights of the child.  While the use of the language &quot;natural and imprescriptible&quot; rights, may be unfortunate in Article 42A, nonetheless the use of the word &quot;natural&quot; does imply that a child has rights in relation to those from whom he or she naturally results, that is, his or her biological parents.  Geoffrey Shannon has pointed out that the use of the terms &quot;natural and imprescriptible&quot; seem to allow for the natural law of philosophy to be used in the interpretation of rights under Article 42A.  I would encourage the Oireachtas to reconsider head 2, which deals with interpretation, and head 10, which deals with parentage in assisted reproduction cases, other than surrogacy.  If the Bill sees to oust the known donor it may be constitutionally infirm.  <br \/>Head 2 defines conception.  Conception is deemed to have occurred when the procedure was performed that resulted in the implantation of the embryo.  Self insemination is arguably a procedure that does result in implantation.  Under head 10, the child's birth mother and a person married to, in a civil partnership with or cohabiting with her, and who consented at the time of conception, at the time of this procedure, to becoming a parent of the child will be the child's other parent.  One might say having consented at the time of conception, surely that envisages a formal consent, perhaps, given in a clinical setting.  Not so, because head 10(6) provides that unless the contrary is proven, a person is presumed to have consented to be a parent of the child, simply by virtue of the fact of being in a marital, civil partnered or cohabiting relationship with the child's mother.  Again, that clearly encompasses the self-insemination or home insemination scenario if consent is going to be presumed.  There is much evidence leaning towards the self-insemination scenario being covered by the Bill and possible future constitutional infirmity of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Tobin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1397032800,"counter":857,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Tobin.

It represents the practising profession and reflects some issues arising in that context.  The children and family relationships Bill represents the most significant change in family law in a generation and attempts to reflect the social reality of contemporary family life in Ireland.  Until recent decades, family life in Ireland has been synonymous with marriage.  However, increasing recognition of marriage breakdown, changes in relationship formation patterns, economic change and the influences of<\/p><p>international law have all contributed to the increasing fluidity and diversification of family forms.  It is no longer tenable to assert that Irish law should continue to recognise only one type of family.  The constitutional preference for families based on marriage remains intact, but it is essential to provide legal certainty for all families, whatever their official status.  The new framework that will be implemented following the passage of the Bill will not only radically overhaul many existing rules, it will create new rights for parents, both biological and social, and, most critically, for children.  As a result, it represents an important milestone on the road to recognition of children as rights holders.<\/p><p>  The Law Society&rsquo;s substantive submission on the Bill was submitted last week to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, drawing from the experience and expertise of its family law practitioners.  It is hoped that it will assist the committee, as policy makers, and the Department in its consideration of the Bill.<\/p><p>  The Law Society has made one of its most significant submissions to date to the Department on the issue of the broader structural reform of our family courts.  We feel that any reform must be viewed in the context of broader structural reform.  We understand the Minister is actively engaged in bringing forward proposals in this areas.  An explicit requirement for the courts to have regard to the best interests of the child when making decisions affecting them.  That this is included in the Bill is welcome.<\/p><p>  Head 32(1) requires that the best interests of the child be taken as the paramount consideration in proceedings concerning guardianship, custody, access or the administration of property or on the application of income thereto.  It is submitted that consideration should be given as to whether the best interests should be required to be paramount in all proceedings concerning children and not merely those referred to in the Bill.<\/p><p>  The provisions contained in the Bill relating to the right of the child to be heard and the right of the child to express himself or herself are to be welcomed in their desire to give a voice to the children the subject of judicial proceedings.  If the Bill is enacted in its present form a person with no biological connection to a child, albeit in an intimate and committed relationship with the child&rsquo;s mother, as referred to at head 10(3) and (5) and head 12(1) and (3) will be the parent of the child if they consent whereas the biological but unmarried father of the child will only be presumed to be the child&rsquo;s father under head 6 if he has cohabited with the child&rsquo;s mother for at least 12 consecutive months prior to the child&rsquo;s birth and, where applicable, the cohabitation ended less than ten months before the child&rsquo;s birth or the circumstances at head 6(3)(b) or (c) apply.<\/p><p>  Therefore, it is arguably easier for a person with no biological connection to achieve the status of a parent than it is for the unmarried biological father to do so.  Consideration should be given as to whether heads 10 and 12 of the Bill should be expanded upon to include a temporal requirement of cohabitation similar to that set out at head 6 for the unmarried biological father of a child.  Conversely, consideration may be given as to whether head 6 should be brought into line with heads 10 and 12 and the cohabitation requirement for unmarried biological fathers be reduced.  Either way it is submitted that the 12 month cohabitation period for unmarried fathers should be reduced so as to facilitate the recognition of family ties.  The Law Society is of the view that the provision in its current form may be vulnerable to challenge under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, given the approach of the court to the nature of the family.  <\/p><p>  It is submitted that further consideration should be given as to whether children should have the right to information pertaining to their donor.<\/p> <p>In the United Kingdom, a system has been introduced by which a child conceived after 2005, is entitled on reaching the age of 16, to apply to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and receive the non-identifying information about the donor.  Then at age 18, he or she can apply to receive identifying information.  Access to donor material can be important for the person&rsquo;s development and health.  Clearly it could be beneficial for a person born as a result of human reproduction to have access to their genetic information.<\/p><p>The use of the terms &ldquo;guardianship&rdquo;, &ldquo;custody&rdquo; and &ldquo;access&rdquo; should be reviewed.  The report of the Law Reform Commission on the legal aspects of family relationships recommends that the terms &ldquo;parental responsibility&rdquo;, &ldquo;day-to-day care&rdquo; and &ldquo;contact&rdquo; should replace the older terms.  The concepts of parental responsibility and day-to-day care more adequately reflect the reality of children and families in Ireland today, in that they encompass more broadly the various compositions of families, such as blended families, where, for example, one parent, who may not be living with the other parent and the child, has parental responsibility, but the partner of the parent living with the child may be exercising day-to-day care of the child.<\/p><p> A significant reform is provided in head 39(4)(b), which requires that before a new guardian is appointed in respect of a child, if that child is over 12, he or she too must consent.  This provision is worthy of further consideration.  The intention behind the provision is to be welcomed, in that it provides for a significant level of participation by children in a vitally important application affecting them.  However, the specific age criterion is unusual, as our international obligations are to ensure participation in line with the child&rsquo;s age and maturity rather than relying on a chronological age.  This could be dealt with by amending the provision so that it reflects the language of Article 12 of the convention on the rights of the child, and including a rebuttable presumption that children over 12 are capable of full participation.  This would also cover situations where the child who is over 12 is not capable of exercising participation rights through disability, even with significant support structures.  Additionally, the requirement of consent rather than participation may be problematic.<\/p><p> Empirical research in several jurisdictions has consistently highlighted that children require a voice, but not a choice.  This research indicates that better outcomes for children are likely to result where children are relieved of the burden of having to choose the outcome, but at the same time are integrated into the decision making process by appropriate means, including by judicial interview.  Consideration should be given to revisiting this provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1397033400,"counter":860,"content":"<p>We are way over time, so I ask Dr. Shannon to sum up if he can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900005#D00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397033400,"counter":861,"content":"<p>In conclusion, the reforms proposed by the Children and Family Relationships Bill will significantly benefit families in Ireland, while at the same time will increase the recognition and implementation of children&rsquo;s rights.

Our policy work is rooted in the extensive family support work we have provided over the past 40 years.  We welcome the heads of this Bill as it is long overdue and badly needed to support the thousands of families in need of family law services every year.  The Bill attempts to reflect the realities that many children and their parents experience in Ireland today and to provide safety and security for them.  We refer the committee to our written submission for an overview of all our recommendations, but today I will focus our comments on issues relating to Part 7 &ndash; guardianship, custody and access, Part 8 &ndash; safeguarding interests of children and Part 9 &ndash; making parenting orders work.<\/p><p>  We are very familiar in One Family with the practical, financial and legal challenges faced by mothers and fathers going through the family law courts in regard to separation, custody, access, maintenance, domestic violence and related issues.  We have been particularly concerned with the lack of information and services available to family law courts when they attempt to make orders in regard to these issues.  In 2009, we undertook research into the need for child contact centres in Ireland.  These are safe, neutral and child-centred services where children can spend time with their non-resident parent.  They are widespread outside Ireland and are used by courts, social services and families as safe places for high-conflict families, to facilitate children having an ongoing relationship with the parent with whom they do not live, who is often, but not exclusively, their father.<\/p><p>  Following this research, we received funding for a two year pilot project which we delivered in partnership with Barnardos in the greater Dublin area.  These centres offered family and risk assessments, court reports, contact services, including handovers, supported contact and supervised contact, family support services including, counselling, play and art therapy for children, parent mentoring and mediated parenting plans.  These services cost approximately &euro;200,000 per year and have closed due to lack of funding.  The independent evaluation of this project was launched 10 days ago at an event attended by five members of the judiciary - from the District, Circuit and High Court - a large number of legal practitioners and members of the Law Society of Ireland and representatives of family support services.  There was overwhelming support for the work that had been done and the need for it to continue.  <\/p><p>  The key policy issues that have arisen through this work were also published last week and these are extremely relevant to the Children and Family Relationships Bill, because we believe this is the opportunity to get this right for children in the future.  Committee members should have received a copy of the publication by email, but we are happy to provide it to anyone who has not received it.<\/p><p>  Currently, family law courts are making critical decisions about children and families in a vacuum.  They are unable to make evidence-based decisions, unlike other branches of law.  Irish family law courts do not have independent, quality information on the families presenting to them, because unlike other jurisdictions we do not have a court welfare system.  This must change.  It is not possible, for example, for head 32, best interests of the child, or head 63, enforcement orders, to function as envisaged if courts are not resourced with relevant background information on the family.  Children are having unsafe and unsuitable contact with their non-resident parent or other family members on a daily basis in Ireland because courts are ordering it.  This may be because there is a strong pro-contact assumption inherent in family law, because courts do not have full information on the extent and impact of domestic violence, addiction and mental health issues, because parents may not recognise the negative impact of violence on their children or their ability to parent or because courts do not have anywhere else to refer parents to for support.<\/p><p>  What are the solutions and what can be done about this?  The provision of a court welfare system must be included in this legislation, as family assessments are the basis for making evidence-based decisions in regard to families.  It is also necessary that courts and social services collaborate much more closely to ensure the safety of children.  A range of appropriate family support services, including child contact centres, to which families can be referred by the courts, must be nominated in the legislation.  Children&rsquo;s voices and their best interest may be more appropriately determined through external independent services, as is facilitated through child contact centres.  The legislation should be clearer around domestic violence and abuse and the required support systems.  It must be clear on the range, the benefits and limitations of family supports.  There is a serious impediment to people with low incomes accessing ancillary family supports and resourcing needs to be looked at in the future.<\/p><p>  Inclusion of these provisions in this legislation is just one of the steps required to ensure safety for children in private family law proceedings and to avoid repeated court visits for high-conflict families.  We estimate that each of the 17 child and family agency areas could have a comprehensive, trained and accredited child contact centre service which could offer family assessments, contact services and family support services for a total cost of &euro;3.5 million per year.  We believe this is excellent value for money, particularly compared to legal or court based supports.  This would be a defined rather than open funding stream.<\/p><p>  I thank the committee for its time and we welcome questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900005#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Kiernan"},{"type":"speech","time":1397033400,"counter":864,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kiernan.

It is good to hear a general welcome expressed for the long overdue introduction of these heads.  I would like to acknowledge former Senator Mary Henry in the Visitors Gallery, who I know has done a lot of work on this issue over many years to try to bring forward legislation like this.<\/p><p>  I wish to focus on two issues.  Both submissions from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists referred to definitions as potentially problematic; in particular, the current definitions which exclude what we call gestational surrogacy, or the traditional surrogacy arrangement where a surrogate mother uses her own reproductive material to become pregnant.  I find slightly concerning a comment in the note on head 2, which states that there are compelling public policy reasons to exclude traditional surrogacy arrangements, as the effect would be to allow a woman to contract out of her parental responsibility for a child which is clearly hers, both by genetics and by birth.  It would seem to me that the more compelling public policy reason is to protect the child born as a result of such an arrangement who currently is without any protection or regulation in law and who, following enactment of a Bill in this format, would still be without protection.  Do the witnesses have a view on whether the Bill should therefore have a broader definition of surrogacy to include a surrogate mother who is using her own reproductive material to become pregnant?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900006#E00100","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397034000,"counter":866,"content":"<p>One of the difficulties with surrogacy is that there are so many different groups.  It is very important that the rights of all of those groups are protected.  I agree that the rights of the child are the paramount rights, because the child is the most vulnerable person in this situation.  One of our main proposals is that the Bill should include cases where the surrogate uses her own oocytes for the conception.  This links a little bit with cases of home insemination or artificial insemination, because if the surrogate can use her own oocytes, then she does not need to take part in an IVF procedure because it can be done by artificial insemination.  There is some medical evidence that there are increased risks in pregnancy if a woman conceives using donated eggs.  Her body will not reject the eggs but there are immunological changes that happen.  If the surrogate is using her own eggs, she will not have those increased risks.  There are certain cases where the woman in the commissioning couple may have no eggs herself for genetic reasons or for premature menopause, or for other reasons, or in cases where there is only parent.  There will be a need for donated eggs and one way of getting those eggs is for the surrogate to donate them.<\/p><p>  We have extra suggestions in other parts of our submission because it is also very important to protect the rights of the surrogate.  We have other suggestions in our document on the age of the surrogate and that she should be medically fit for pregnancy.  It is important to protect all of those risks.  Certainly we feel that the surrogate should be able to use her own oocytes.<\/p><p>  One of our strong recommendations is that counselling be made mandatory for these cases, because there are so many competing interests, and it is quite complex.  People choosing to commission surrogacy need counselling.  They need legal advice and what is known as implications counselling, which outlines all the implications of what they are doing.  The surrogate and her partner also need counselling that is independent from the counselling given to the commissioning couple.  Even if that is taking place within a family, such as a woman being a surrogate for her sister, it is important that they have counselling to make sure that the sister who is going to be the surrogate is not being coerced or is feeling that she should do it when she does not want to do it.  We have all of those in our submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900006#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Wingfield"},{"type":"speech","time":1397034000,"counter":867,"content":"<p>Would you include counselling for donors?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900006#E00300","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397034000,"counter":868,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900006#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Wingfield"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397034000,"counter":869,"content":"<p>I would like to complement what Dr. Wingfield has said.

It is important to put that on the record.  I can understand the difficulty in moving from custody, guardianship and access, which derives from the provision in the Constitution.  It is my understanding that perhaps the reluctance to move derives from the fact that under the new Article 42A, the terms used are \"concerning the adoption, guardianship or custody of, or access to, any child\".  As it could create confusion, I urge the Department to reconsider this.  We all understand what the terms mean, but in my view they are outdated.  Using the term \"custody\" to describe the day-to-day care of a child is 19th-century language.  There is a legal argument for retaining these provisions, but I urge the Department to err on the side of being progressive and perhaps to dispense with the concern around the constitutional dispensation.

The institute's submission is along the lines of Dr. Shannon's point that a child - as is the case in the UK - should, on reaching maturity, be able to make a request to identify whether he or she is the result of donated human material, either sperm or egg, and be in a position to contact the donor.

Otherwise, she will remain guardian until a guardian is appointed.  This is a sensible and practical approach which will avoid the situation in which a child is left without a guardian.  That is my understanding of the rationale behind this provision.  In all circumstances, the birth mother will remain as guardian unless her rights are extinguished by the child's adoption.

I am not entirely certain what is happening in the Supreme Court, but I will sum up briefly what occurred in the High Court.  The wife involved in the case was infertile and her sister kindly agreed to act as a surrogate.  It was a very amicable arrangement.  She was actually a gestational surrogate because it was possible to use the reproductive material - the terminology used in the Bill - from the husband and the wife.  The issue was that wife was unable to carry a baby to term.  Her sister bore twins for her and the issue which arose was that the married couple wanted to be registered as their legal parents.  The birth mother and the husband could be registered under existing, law but there was no provision for the wife - the genetic mother who had provided the ovum - to be registered as the twins' legal mother.  They wrote to An t-Ard Chl&aacute;raitheoir who responded that his hands were tied and that there was nothing he could do.  They proceeded to the High Court and Mr. Justice Abbott found that the parents of the twins were the genetic parents and that the old maxim of <i>mater semper certa est<\/i>- mother is always certain - in this instance no longer applied.  Whereas usually the child's mother would be the birth mother, in an instance like this, where others provide the genetic material, the mother was determined to be the genetic mother, namely, the wife from the married couple.  An order was handed down that the register of births be changed to reflect that fact in this instance.

In jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom where children can access information on their genetic origins and obtain the name and address of the person who donated, this causes a difficulty in the supply of eggs and sperm.  The majority of people in Ireland have no choice other than to go to countries such as Spain where anonymity is assured and there is a large supply of eggs.

That is long overdue and in keeping with the rights of the child to private and family life under the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  I wish to highlight a few key points from my detailed submission to the committee on parentage and assisted reproduction and surrogacy.<br \/>The aim of this part is to provide clarity and certainty in the legal relationship between children born through assisted reproduction and their parents.  However, in my opinion the wording used in the scheme is very convoluted and does not facilitate the necessary clarity to be easily obtained.  There are many examples from other jurisdictions of simpler wording which achieve the same objectives such as the Family Law Act 2011 from British Colombia in Canada.  I would urge careful drafting of these provisions to resolve any ambiguity and avoid protracted and costly litigation.<br \/>The Bill appears to deal with parentage from the perspective of the adults involved in the child&rsquo;s conception rather than the child himself or herself.  It does not grant any recognition to the child of a right to identify the donor whose reproductive material was used in his or her conception.  Given that the stated aim of the Bill is to ensure that the best interests of the child are paramount it is regrettable that the opportunity has not been taken to set out clearly in legislation that it is in the best interests of any child born through assisted reproduction to have the right to identify its genetic parent if the child so chooses.<br \/>Head 10(9) provides that the consent of an intended parent is not valid after the death of that intended parent.  In many other jurisdictions posthumous conception is recognised as a valid exercise of reproductive autonomy and there are couples in Ireland who would like to avail of this option in the event of the death of one of the partners.  I have outlined in my submission the mechanism whereby posthumous insemination might be permitted based on the written consent of the deceased partner and I would urge the committee to give further consideration to these proposals.<br \/>Surrogacy can be a very positive option for many couples who are trying to build a family.  I commend the proposed scheme for setting out to regulate rather than to prohibit surrogacy as experience in other jurisdictions has shown that prohibition only serves to drive surrogacy underground with consequently little protection for those involved.<br \/>The policy on surrogacy in the Bill is that the birth mother is always the mother but that an application for parentage may be made to the court by the genetic father and his partner, or the genetic mother and her partner.  This is subject to the consent of the surrogate.  It is important to point out that in the event that the Supreme Court upholds the High Court decision in MR <i>v<\/i>. An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir<i><\/i>the policy of the Bill will require substantial revision in this respect.<br \/>The policy of the Bill is clearly to facilitate gestational surrogacy only, that is, where the surrogate does not use her own eggs or have any genetic relationship with the child.  This means that where the intended mother is unable for medical reasons to provide the eggs, she and her partner must find an egg donor who is willing to donate.  The introduction of a third woman into the conception of the child is unnecessary and not consistent with the best interests of the child in circumstances where the surrogate mother might be willing to give valid consent to the use of her own eggs in the arrangement.<br \/>The stated policy rationale here appears to be based on a negative bias against traditional surrogacy which is neither appropriate nor justified.  The language used presumes that the surrogate mother who is genetically related to the child either (a) abandons the child or (b) is forced to relinquish or sell it.  There is no acknowledgement that many women volunteer to become surrogate mothers using their own eggs because they want to help others to have a child.  They generally do not consider the child they are carrying to be their own child.<br \/>It is also stated that the exclusion of traditional surrogacy is intended as a human rights measure &ldquo;to prevent a surrogate mother from being coerced into selling her own child&rdquo;.  For women who volunteer to become surrogates for altruistic reasons, such as family relatedness or friendship and are willing to use their own eggs - no money changes hands, there is no financial coercion or exploitation, and therefore this policy rationale does not apply.  It is difficult to see how prohibiting a surrogate mother from using her own eggs prevents potential exploitation.  While I accept that there may be concerns in relation to potential exploitation of women of lower socioeconomic class, the avoidance of such potential exploitation will not be achieved by this Bill.<br \/>The language used also leads us to conclude that women are unable to make a decision to become surrogates without being forced or coerced.  Language is important in the law &ndash; this is not facilitating a black market in babies, there is no sale of a child here - children are not capable of being owned and therefore cannot be bought and sold as a commodity.  In surrogacy there is a transfer of parental rights to one or more of the child&rsquo;s genetic parents<i><\/i>following an agreement entered into between consenting adults as part of which the surrogate&rsquo;s expenses over the period of the pregnancy may be reimbursed.<br \/>Under the current proposals a declaration of parentage may only be made with the consent of the surrogate, unless she is deceased or cannot be located.  Where she refuses to give consent, she will remain the legal mother, can receive the agreed payment, and presumably can seek a court order for maintenance against the genetic parents.  The genetic father may apply for guardianship, which is not automatic.  The genetic mother cannot apply for guardianship as the surrogate mother is regarded as the legal mother.  This position is patently discriminatory against women in circumstances where both of the intended parents' own genetic material is used.  I strongly recommend the adoption of a judicial pre-authorisation model similar to California or New Hampshire in the United States which ensures independent judicial scrutiny of the arrangement, oversight of the voluntariness of all parties, and the prioritisation of the best interests of the child which in almost all surrogacy cases will be to be regarded as the legal child of its intended genetic parents from the moment of birth.<br \/>Finally, although the Bill does make provision for reasonable expenses to be paid, the consequences of transgression are extremely harsh and result in potential criminal prosecution as well as loss of eligibility to apply for a declaration of parentage.  In such circumstances, what is the outcome for the child?  Who are the legal parents?  If a court were asked to decide on the parentage of a child in such circumstances, the court would surely be obliged to prioritise the best interests of the child irrespective of whether the provision relating to payment was violated, the result of which in most cases would be to grant parentage and custody to the intended parents.  Therefore the policy is likely to be ignored in practice as has occurred in other jurisdictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900014#S00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirdre Madden"},{"type":"speech","time":1397038500,"counter":1015,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Madden for being concise and staying within the allotted time.

I am sharing the five minutes allocated with my colleague.  Thank you for inviting Treoir to make a presentation today.  It is a specialist information service for unmarried parents.  We have a very long history of working with unmarried parents and we are aware of the issues of concern to them.  We welcome many of the provisions in the Bill and they are detailed in our submission which I am sure many members have read.<\/p><p>  For the purposes of this presentation I will focus on head 37 which also refers to head 31(3) relating to guardianship for unmarried, cohabiting fathers and also the presumption to paternity.  My main focus is guardianship.  It is very welcome that under the Bill an unmarried Dad who is living with the mother for a year or longer before the birth would be entitled to guardianship rights for his child.  It is really positive and progressive.  However, the Bill does not address the issue of how cohabitation will be established and that is an area of concern.  I wish to paint a scenario of a couple living together for three years at which point the relationship breaks down and the parties disagree on the length of cohabitation.<\/p> <p>He believes he is the father of the child because he was living with the mother a year before the birth and since then, but she is of the view that cohabitation evolved in that they lived together on and off initially and he moved in during the pregnancy; therefore, he is not a guardian.  The only option for that father, therefore, is to go to court to establish his guardianship rights.  That brings us back to the current situation because there is no improvement in that regard.  Treoir is proposing that there be a system of affirming or declaring cohabitation for a year at the point of birth registration to ensure the guardians of that child are clear to everybody.  That is the first point.<\/p><p>  Second, we are concerned that there is nothing in this Bill to improve the situation of unmarried non-cohabiting fathers.  They either get agreement from the mother to become guardians or they go to court.  A scenario we deal with in the office every day is where both parents are involved in the child's life.  They are co-parenting while living apart.  That might continue for five years.  The child is very involved with its father and the paternal family but the mother decides she wants to move to New Zealand, Australia or another part of the world.  She can leave with her child and the father usually only discovers at that point that he has no legal rights to the child.  He believes his name on the birth certificate gives him rights but it does not give him any rights.  After five years of the child being involved with the father, a mother may leave the country and she has no obligation to allow that child see the father again.  We are hearing those stories every day in the office, and it is very difficult.  We believe there should be some improvement for those fathers who are not cohabiting.<\/p><p> At a minimum, at the point of birth, registration information should be given on the fact that the mother is a sole guardian.  We recommend that the statutory declaration for guardianship be given to the couple at that point, and they should be told to think about it.  To go even further, if a couple is in agreement about joint guardianship they could do it at the point of birth registration.  That is our recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900014#S00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Margaret Dromey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397039100,"counter":1018,"content":"<p>I would like to talk about something that is not in the Bill.  As the members are aware, unmarried fathers do not get guardianship rights from having their name on the birth certificate - many people do not know that - but they can get guardianship rights by signing a statutory declaration with the mother in front of a peace commissioner.  That facility has been available since 1997 and, as members can imagine, there are thousands of these documents.  We know that because in 2013 alone, 2,570 statutory declarations were downloaded from the Treoir website.  In addition, a considerable number of parents telephoned asking for the guardianship form to be posted to them and the question that followed that request was \"Where will I send it when it is signed?\".  We replied, to their amazement, that they should mind it carefully because there is nowhere they can send it.  They are horrified by that.  We had a case recently in which a father had lost his declaration and the mother was dying in hospital.  He was very distressed.  He did not know what to do, and there was nothing he could do apart from going to court at a later stage.<\/p><p>  We have been calling for a central register for guardianship agreements for many years, and we call for it again now.  We envisage a register whereby people could send their documents to be registered in a central place, and if they are lost they can get a copy.  One can imagine what would happen if someone lost his or her marriage certificate and could not get a copy.  It is the same in this case because that is from where one gets one's guardianship rights.<\/p><p>  As Ms Dromey mentioned, cohabiting fathers of a year or more get their guardianship at the point of registration.  If some sort of register is set up at that point it could include a register for recording the statutory declarations already signed.  Ideally, we would see this register being located in the General Register Office.  That is where people register births, marriages and deaths, and guardianship is very much a key component of that.<\/p><p>  I would like to mention one or two other areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900015#T00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Margot Doherty"},{"type":"speech","time":1397039100,"counter":1019,"content":"<p>The time is a little tight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900015#T00300","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397039100,"counter":1020,"content":"<p>Indeed.

Those of us in the office know the difficulty in getting consensus when two guardians disagree.  I ask the members to be alert to that possibility, although I am not saying they should place a limit on it.<\/p><p>  We are very disappointed that the terminology in the Bill did not change to \"parental responsibility\" instead of \"guardianship\".  It refers to access and custody instead of day-to-day care and contact.  That would bring us in line with our European neighbours, and is what the Law Reform Commission recommended.<\/p><p>  There are a few definitions of guardianship in the Bill, but it would be better to have one concise definition of guardianship.

In comparison, surrogacy is a relatively new and burgeoning industry.  Legalising surrogacy will lead to the widespread suppression and erosion of norms surrounding women's rights, with particular consequences for vulnerable female populations.  Family &amp;amp; Life believes that altruistic surrogacy will eventually lead to commercial surrogacy.<\/p><p>  The first of the primary areas of concern we wish to highlight is a lack of attention to the rights and welfare of children produced, not created.  Children who are the products of surrogacy will have no legal rights to their birth mother.  The commodification of children as objects to be reared specifically to be bought, sold or traded is akin to child trafficking.  Further, there is legal chaos surrounding parentage, and we have seen that in many other countries where surrogacy has been legalised.<\/p><p>  There is a vast body of research, and a growing body of personal testimony, affirming the deep connection children have with their birth mother.  Children of surrogates are now speaking out about the psychological trauma of being separated from their mother of origin.  There are a number of examples of adults speaking out about the psychological consequences they experienced as a result of separation from their birth mother.  A particular example is Jessica Curran, who is leading this campaign.<\/p><p>  A second area of overall concern is the serious ethical and practical consequences of commodifying a woman's body.  Pregnancy is an extremely high-risk activity.  Legalising surrogacy puts women's health at risk.  The medical drugs required to prepare a surrogate for an embryo carry well-documented short-term and long-term risks.  Surrogacy will not just expose but normalise exposure to such drugs.  We have a list of drugs commonly used for IVF, and some of the consequences as a result of using these drugs.<\/p><p>  Our final and overarching concern is the moral and ethical consequences of transforming a normal biological function of a woman's body into a transaction.  Surrogacy threatens the dignity of women.  Women lose proprietorship of their bodies during this process, and women who have been through surrogacy have self-identified themselves as incubators or breeders.  The medical facilities promoting the practice of surrogacy are in the profit-making business and, in many cases, information on the risks involved are not effectively communicated in an attempt to garner clientele.<\/p> <p>Legalising altruistic surrogacy will lead to commercial surrogacy and have an impact on countries, such as India, Mexico, Thailand, in two of which cases there are unregulated markets - India has just started regulating surrogacy.  The trade-off for a woman in those countries who is exposed to commercial surrogacy is choosing to place a price tag on her womb in lieu of the right to dignified and safe employment, education and sustainable economic mobility for her and her family which are markers of true progress for women and, consequently, for children.  As in the insupportable case for a legalised prostitution, hidden behind an application of any rights-based language to the practice of surrogacy is really the exploitation of a marginalised woman and her necessity to have to make a choice.  Women of privilege will rarely offer themselves as surrogates to incubate children of strangers.  We believe that this particular assault on the dignity of women is really quite a twisted turn in the reproductive industry's attempt to incentivise profitable pregnancy in short-term motherhood.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900015#T00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Marion Boteju","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397039700,"counter":1026,"content":"<p>I will address a couple of the issues pertaining to the wider general scheme of the children and family relationships Bill.<\/p><p>  Legislators have a wide degree of discretion as to how to shape this piece of legislation.  There is no Supreme Court ruling and no finding against Ireland by the European Court of Human Rights mandating a particular and rigid approach to all Parts of the Bill.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that underpinning Parts 3 and 5 and aspects of part 12 of the general scheme is a strong policy preference in favour of a right to have a child by artificial or commercial means, that right being a dimension of adult reproductive autonomy.  As a matter of law, the Constitution does not contain, in either enumerated or unenumerated form, such a thing as a right to have a child via artificial or commercial means.  This is also true of the European Convention on Human Rights, the jurisprudence pursuant to the convention, and international human rights law generally.  Thus, none of those instruments requires Ireland to make positive legislative provision for commercial services or private arrangements which aim to satisfy adult demand for the creation or production of a child.  In the alternative, both domestic and international law support a child's right to have his or her best interests govern all state actions directly affecting them.  Those are merely legal points.<\/p><p>  Turning to substantive policy points at issue here, no doubt many parts of the proposed Bill take serious account of children's best interests.  I refer especially to Parts 7, 10 and 11.  However, it is submitted that certain parts of the general scheme clearly privilege equal adult reproductive autonomy over and above the best interests of the child.  The general scheme's policy preference in favour of an adult's right to have a child via a commercial or artificial means consistently trumps the child's best interest in Parts 3 and 5 and in certain heads of Part 12.  For example, no consideration is given to a child's right to have two parents.  This relates to a single adult's right to avail of AHR services and surrogacy arrangements.  No consideration is given to a child's right to the society and support of his or her genetic or natural parents.  This is in relation to the permissibility of anonymous gamete donation and heterologous gametes donation in Parts 3 and 5.  No consideration is given to a child's right to know the identity of his or her genetic parents re the permissibility of anonymous gamete donation in Parts 3 and 5.  No consideration is given to the child's interest in having parents who are likely to live for the duration of the child's upbringing re the lack of upper age limits in part 3 for adults seeking to avail of AHR services.  Finally, the Bill will knowingly and expressly deprive children of either a mother or a father.  This is in relation to the provision for the right of a single person to avail of AHR services in surrogacy arrangements in Parts 3 and 5 and the right of civil partners to jointly adopt a child in part 12.<\/p><p>  We can see that children's best interests are only permitted expression in the general scheme where there is little or no danger that such interests will clash with adults' interests in equal reproductive autonomy.  Where the right to reproductive autonomy is treated as near absolute as it is, the children's best interests are virtually ignored.  They merit mention in neither the relevant textual provisions of the general scheme nor in the relevant accompanying notes, and that is no accident.<\/p><p>  In effect, the new affirmation - it is a new affirmation - of such a thing as a right to a child indicates the commodification of procreation.  The child's origin and upbringing is made subject to freedom of reproductive contract.  This places Ireland, by the way, as an outlier in the European context.  This is permissive by European standards.  Both the child's best interests and the adult reproductive autonomy cannot be vindicate fully.  One has to be subservient to the other.  It is clear under the general scheme, as currently constituted, that adult reproductive autonomy trumps children's best interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900016#U00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Thomas Finegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1397039700,"counter":1027,"content":"<p>Has Dr. Finegan circulated that particular document to us because we seem to have something different here?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900016#U00300","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397039700,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>I am not sure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900016#U00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Thomas Finegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1397039700,"counter":1029,"content":"<p>It is usual that one circulates the presentation so that members would have it in front of them and could refer to it if they are asking questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900016#U00500","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397039700,"counter":1030,"content":"<p>My apologies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900016#U00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Thomas Finegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1397039700,"counter":1031,"content":"<p>We do not seem to have that document.

Dr. Fergus Ryan, who is a board member of GLEN and lecturer in law in NUI Maynooth, will contribute to the discussions later.<\/p><p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity afforded to the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, to contribute to the committee's deliberations on this vitally important Bill, which is, perhaps, the greatest and most needed family law reform in a generation.  I acknowledge and thank the Minister and his officials at the Department for the extensive work that has been done to date on the Bill.<\/p><p>  This Bill will directly benefit the significant numbers of children living in many differently shaped and sized families that are common in Ireland.  It will give practical and real expression to the principle of the best interests of the child and will provide much needed legal security to children in many different family forms, including children being raised by lesbian and gay headed families.<\/p><p>  The provisions of the Bill are utterly necessary and we stress the urgency with which this Bill needs to be passed.<\/p><p>  For GLEN, I suppose, any reform in this area needs to be guided by three clear principles: one, the best interests of the child principle; two, the right of a child to know his or her identity; and three, the right of a child to have his or her family recognised and supported.  I will expand a little on each of those.<\/p><p>  GLEN is a proud member of the Children's Rights Alliance and strongly supports the application of the best interest principle to all matters concerning the child.  The fact of the matter is that every child who is being parented in a lesbian or gay headed family lives without the protection of a secure legal framework.  This means that the child lives without a legal relationship with his or her non-biological parent and that has potentially far-reaching consequences whereby the child can be separated from his or her non-biological parent in the event of death or separation.  In the case of the family home, maintenance and inheritance, the child's financial welfare is not secure.  There are other day to day issues as well.  A number of the heads will resolve these inequalities.  In particular, head 32 ensures that the best interests of the child will be the paramount consideration in areas such as guardianship, custody, upbringing of or access to a child.  Part 2 provides much needed amendments to the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 regarding shared home, maintenance and provisions upon dissolution of a civil partnership, and GLEN strongly welcomes those provisions.<\/p><p>  GLEN fully supports a child's right to know his or her biological and genetic identity and to have his or her family recognised and supported.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child recognises these rights alongside a child's right to be cared for by his or her parents.  The convention recognises that a parent can be someone who is not biologically related to the child, a person who takes responsibility for and cares for the child.  Heads 10 and 11 reflect this interpretation by providing a framework for the recognition of parentage in cases of assisted reproduction.  There are further provisions for guardianship in heads 38 and 39.  GLEN is of the view that taken together these provisions will address many of the needs of children being parented by lesbian and gay headed families to a secure legal relationship with their parents.<\/p><p>  Alongside the provisions for all couples planning parenthood through assisted reproduction, the Bill also proposes to address retrospective assignment of parentage, and we welcome this.  Assignment of parentage involves the consent of both the intending, the biological and the genetic parents.  We would propose that the principle of fully informed consent should include independent, legal and counselling advice for both the biological, genetic and intending parents.  We would strongly suggest that where there is agreement between all parties, the assignment of parentage should be provided through the most effective and simplest of means in order to ensure that the provisions of heads 10 and 11 are as widely accessible as possible.<\/p><p>  Finally, on the area of adoption, there is no ban on adoption by lesbian and gay single persons in Ireland.<\/p> <p>Lesbian and gay people can and do apply to and adopt children.  However, lesbian and gay couples, even those in a civil partnership, cannot apply to adopt jointly.  Consequently, GLEN, while recognising that adoption is ultimately about a child&rsquo;s right to a family, welcomes the provisions in the general scheme to extend the categories of people who can apply to include civil-partnered couples.  We also welcome the recognition of adoptions from other countries.  This is a very important provision for many lesbian and gay couples who have adopted jointly abroad.  The Bill does not provide for second-parent adoption.  We suggest that this be provided for as the Bill is devolved further.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to contribute and I look forward to the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900016#U00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Sandra Irwin-Gowran","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397040300,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>As many members will know, the Children's Rights Alliance is a coalition of over 100 organisations working to secure the rights of children in Ireland by campaigning for the full implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC.

We thank them for their contributions to our fuller submission, which we have already circulated.  We welcome the publication of the heads of the Bill as they represent the most significant reform to family law for a generation.  We welcome the opportunity to be present to make our observations.<br \/>We acknowledge the work of the Minister for Justice and Equality and his departmental officials in producing this important draft legislation, which, in the main, is very child-focused.  The legislation puts children at the heart of family law reform and it will address the current discrimination faced by children in non-marital families.  We need only consider the results of the 2011 census to realise the wide range of different family types and parental relationships in the State today.  This legislation will bring about reforms for thousands of children and their families.<br \/>We welcome the inclusion of three key children's rights issues in the proposed legislation.  These are the best interests of the child, as mentioned already, the voice of the child in decision-making, and protecting the child's right to family life.  The legislation would provide much-needed clarity for children and families in these areas.  We have made some recommendations that we hope the committee will consider and that will improve and strengthen the legislation.  We feel, however, that there is one big gap in the legislation as it currently stands from a children's rights perspective.  I refer to the right to identity in cases of assisted human reproduction and surrogacy.  The inclusion of the general principle of the best interests of the child is a major milestone and it reflects the rights enshrined in the UNCRC.  This is the first time the principle has been defined in domestic legislation in such a comprehensive manner.  While it is included in the Child and Family Agency Act, it is set out very clearly in the proposed legislation.  The way it is set out in head 32 clearly complies with the standards laid out in the UNCRC, which states that the best interests of the child should be the paramount or only consideration in important decisions on adoption, guardianship, access and protection cases.  For this reason, the alliance strongly recommends that the standard included in head 32(1) be retained.<br \/>The alliance believes the principle of the best interests of the child must extend to all decisions made on children's care and well-being, not only to decisions of the court on guardianship, custody and access.  In line with the convention, the best interests of the child should be the primary consideration in all decisions affecting a child, regardless of whether they are made by the court, an administrative body or otherwise.<br \/>The committee heard from One Family, which advocated the use of child contact centres.  We support this call in respect of determining how the child's best interests could be protected and respected within the legislation.<br \/>The right of all children to be heard and taken seriously constitutes one of the fundamental values of the convention under Article 12.  In the proposed legislation, the voice of the child is presented as only one of the factors to be considered when assessing what course of action is in the best interest of the child in guardianship, access or custody proceedings.  We warmly welcome the fact that the voice of the child is referred to in the heads of the Bill but, in order to comply with Article 12 of the convention, this should be a stand-alone provision rather than one factor in a long list.  The views of the child should be sought by the decision-maker and should be properly considered.  This does not mean the child gets to decide what is best for him or her; instead, it means he or she gets to participate in and contribute to the decision-making process properly. <br \/>The proposed heads refer to the age and capacity of a child but it is not clear who will decide when a child is capable of forming views.  As outlined in the guidance provided by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, it is important to point out that being capable of forming views and being capable of expressing them are two entirely different phenomena.  The legislation should not contain an age limit since the weight to be given to the views of the child must be considered in accordance with both age and maturity.  Each case must be examined individually.<br \/>Part 7 of the general scheme of the Children and Family Relationships Bill 2014 seeks to address a number of the gaps in protection experienced by the increasing number of children who are being cared for by step-parents, civil partners and others <i>in loco parentis<\/i>.  This is a welcome development that will extend the right to apply to become a guardian to step-parents and grandparents, for example, and create a legal link between the child and the person caring for him or her on a day-to-day basis.<br \/>We welcome the extension of automatic guardianship to unmarried fathers who are cohabiting with the mothers of their children.  However, as Treoir has pointed out, automatic guardianship will not extend to unmarried fathers who do not live with or have never lived with the mothers of their children.  We urge caution in respect of how automatic guardianship can be extended to non-cohabiting fathers.  Obviously, we support the committee's examination of this, but it should bear in mind cases in which the mother has been a victim of domestic violence or a woman has become pregnant through rape.  When balancing the rights of unmarried fathers who are not living with the mother, and considering circumstances in which children have been born from rape, proposals by the committee should not endanger the children and mothers in any way or interfere with their right to privacy.  The rights of the unmarried father should be balanced with what would be in the best interest of the child.<br \/>The big gap we see in the legislation concerns the fact that the right to identity is not provided for anywhere within it.  The proposals in the Bill aim to provide much-needed legal clarity on parentage for children born through assisted human reproduction.  However, as I mentioned, the current heads do not provide any clarity on the right to identity enshrined in Article 7 of the UN convention, which concerns the right to knowledge.  This might be an issue where an anonymous donor has provided genetic material.  The 2005 report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, set up by the Department of Health, recommended that upon reaching the age of maturity, a child born through the use of donated genetic material should be entitled to identify the donors.  The Bill must make provision for the identity rights of children in these cases, and their right to identity should be vindicated as a matter of priority.  We regard the gap in this regard as the key gap in the proposed legislation that must be addressed.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to make a presentation today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900017#V00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Saoirse Brady"},{"type":"speech","time":1397040300,"counter":1035,"content":"<p>What Ms Brady read out is slightly different from what is contained in her submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900017#V00300","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397040300,"counter":1036,"content":"<p>It is a summarised version.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900017#V00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Saoirse Brady"},{"type":"speech","time":1397040300,"counter":1037,"content":"<p>Perhaps she could forward to us what she read out.

We, too, welcome the publication of the general scheme of the Bill.  We acknowledge the considerable work done on producing this important and necessary draft legislation.  We are conscious that it is very extensive and covers a wide range of very complex areas.<\/p><p>  The National Women's Council of Ireland represents more than 170 member groups from a diverse range of backgrounds, sectors and locations.  This Bill has been the subject of discussion among our members, particularly those working on children's rights in terms of recognition of care, gender equality, LGBTQ rights and reproductive rights.<\/p><p>  In my five minutes, I will focus on just a few points, the first of which concerns the diversity of families.  We really welcome the Bill's recognition of the realities of diverse parenting circumstances and the intention to provide legal clarity on parental rights and duties in diverse family forums.  We really do welcome the recognition of and provision for parental and guardianship rights of same-sex couples and the fact that legislation is finally addressing the anomaly whereby same-sex couples have been excluded from applying jointly for adoption despite their being free to do so as individuals.<\/p><p>  We welcome the fact that the Bill is offering practical recognition of the realities of divorce and remarriage.  The heads recognise that, in many cases, women and men play a significant role in caring for the children of their new partners.<\/p> <p>The Bill has the potential to address the day-to-day discrimination currently experienced by parents and children in non-marital families, particularly with regard to cohabitation.  Treoir has already touched on this, but we think clearer guidance needs to be provided on how cohabitation is to be determined.  In examining this issue it is also important to consider how it might accommodate situations where consecutive cohabitation has not been possible.<br \/>We wish to highlight that the Bill is significant in its recognition not only of the role and caring responsibilities of both parents, but also of the wider range of relationships that a child may have with others - such as step-parents, grandparents, aunts or uncles - and the caring responsibilities and rights associated with those relationships.  It should be noted that while recognising different rights and relationships, including the rights of separated parents or grandparents, the safety of children and the safety of their mothers must always remain paramount.  For example, caution is needed in cases in which the mother has been a victim of violence by her partner.  The Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance and Women's Aid have highlighted concerns around the extension of automatic guardianship where a woman has become pregnant through rape.  <br \/>As regards the best interests of the child, the National Women's Council of Ireland welcomes the placing of the child at the centre of this legislation.  This strong emphasis on the best interests of the child is significant and reflects a practical engagement with our Constitution and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.<br \/>The heads of the Bill are clear that the best interests of the child should be a guiding principle within the courts system.  This also needs to look beyond the courts system to other non-judicial decision making such as mediation, which is a valuable and often a recommended alternative for parents.  It is crucial that non-judicial or mediated alternatives should be held to the same standards, including the best interests of the child, as a guiding principle in all decision-making on children.<br \/>Head 32 refers to the factors in determining the best interests of the child.  Section 3(<i>j<\/i>), for example, cites &ldquo;The willingness and ability of each of the child&rsquo;s parents to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the child and other parent and to maintain and foster relationships between the child and relatives of the child.&quot;  In drawing this out, it is important to consider issues around violence against women.  The Bill does so in that there is a head concerning family violence.  That is critical as regards moving on in developing the heads of the Bill.  We welcome the recognition of the impact that violence can have on mothers and children.<br \/>The most recent research on violence against women by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights presents the first such comparative set of data.  It includes shocking statistics on where Ireland is in this regard.  With a view to further developing the Bill, it is therefore important to listen to the organisations that are working with women and children who have experienced and are experiencing violence.<br \/>We welcome the legislative engagement in the area of assisted reproduction and surrogacy, which has lacked clarity for far too long.  A regulatory approach is needed in order to guard against exploitation and ensure that the rights of the child, of intending parents, and of surrogates or donors of genetic material are all adequately protected.  This area is scheduled for further discussion by the National Women's Council of Ireland's members, as there is no definitive policy on surrogacy and assisted reproduction.  This will be discussed at our annual general meeting in June.  We are engaging with our members this year to develop a concrete policy in this area.  It will enable us to contribute more to the development of the Bill as well as examining the mechanisms by which to bring it forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900017#V00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397040900,"counter":1040,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman.  Overall, Barnardos supports many aspects of this progressive Bill as it finally gives legal recognition and clarity to children being raised in different family types.  This is long overdue, because the current legal framework is outdated and fails to recognise the diverse ways of conceiving and raising children.  The child-centred focus is evident throughout much of the Bill and we certainly welcome that.  In the interests of brevity, my presentation will concentrate only on some aspects of the Bill.<br \/>We are certainly pleased to see that parentage is viewed more widely than the genetic make-up of the child.  It removes the legal uncertainty experienced by many parents who do not have a genetic link to their child yet provide the security, love and encouragement that a biological parent would provide.<br \/>However, we do have concerns about the Bill's consequences for birth registration procedures, which are not explored in the legislation.  Will the birth certificate record biological details, including the use of donor material?  Will another parentage declaration certificate be issued stating who has been assigned parentage?  This has implications for establishing the child&rsquo;s surname, for example, in cases in which he or she is being raised by a same-sex family.<br \/>It is great to see that in Part 3 legal clarity is being given to those families who become parents through assisted reproduction and surrogacy, and the use of donor material in these methods.  For too long these families have been living in legal limbo.  However, Barnardos is concerned that the Bill does not provide guidance regarding the recording of donor material.  It is denying the child&rsquo;s right to know who his or her biological parents are.  Denial of access to such information repeats the mistakes of the past whereby some adopted people were denied access to their records.  <br \/>Access to donor information can be fundamental to a child's overall development and health, especially when medical issues arise.  Ireland must regulate this sector and establish an official register of donors whose information can then be passed onto donor-conceived people at a later date.<br \/>Another worrying proposal, under head 13, is that the surrogate will be the legal mother until the court assigns parentage based on the application received, and such an application can be made up to six months after the birth of the child.  This timeframe is not in the best interests of the child, as the surrogate will not be caring for the child, yet any important decisions to be made regarding the child&rsquo;s health or welfare rest with the surrogate.  At the very least, one of the intending parents should also be granted parentage upon the birth of the child to ensure consistency in the care and decision-making relating to the child&rsquo;s welfare.<br \/>With regard to guardianship, Barnardos is pleased that the Bill strengthens the rights of some unmarried fathers who satisfy the cohabitation clause.  It correctly recognises and values the commitment of fathers to their children.  However, we do support some of the concerns raised by Treoir regarding non-cohabiting fathers.  Head 32 mandates the court to ensure that decisions regarding guardianship, access or custody are made in the best interests of the child and to ensure their voices are heard.  This is something Barnardos has long campaigned for and echoes the commitment in the Constitutional amendment.  Unfortunately, the Bill does not indicate how the court should examine these aspects.  Barnardos believes this is where the role of family assessments, including the use of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>, should be undertaken.  They should be given due consideration to allow the court to assess the whole picture of what the child&rsquo;s life is like and what effect their decision may have on the child.<br \/>The Bill allows for the child to have multiple guardians, each of whom has the right to make day-to-day decisions, such as where the child should live, consent to medical treatments and decisions about their education.  The current wording of the Bill means that fractious guardians will have to regularly revert to the court over details of the child&rsquo;s life.  This is not in best interests of the child and could delay significant decisions being made, as well as having cost implications for everyone involved.  The Bill should not create a situation in which children could end up as pawns between multiple fighting guardians.  There has to be some recognition of the ability of a parent who looks after a child for a majority of the time to make reasonable decisions on the day-to-day care of the child.<br \/>With regard to Parts 8 and 13, Barnardos believes that some aspects of the Bill could be strengthened.  These include assessing all couples for their suitability for mediation prior to the lodging of an application for guardianship, custody or access.  Engagement in mediation can lead to faster resolutions of cases and is more cost-effective.  However, if any domestic violence or child protection concerns are present, these cases should be dealt with within the court process.<br \/>Capturing the voices and wishes of the child will be diluted if head 58(1)(<i>b<\/i>) is unaltered, as it allows any person to compile a social report regarding the welfare of a child.  It also permits these people to become guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>.  Guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>should be professionals with the required expertise and training to talk to children about highly sensitive and difficult situations.  Barnardos has long called for greater regulation and transparency with regard to guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>services.<\/p> <p>The legislation and forthcoming regulations must be compiled in close collaboration with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and build on the guidance of the Children's Act advisory board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900018#W00300","nonspeaker":"Ms June Tinsley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1397041500,"counter":1042,"content":"<p>Is Ms Tinsley almost finished?

I thank the committee for the invitation to appear.  As a result of the very short lead-in time, the Equality Authority submission can only set out certain provisional observations.  We are conducting a further in-depth review and will provide more detailed comments as the legislation evolves.  Given the considerable detail in the scheme, it is not possible to deal with all of the provisions today.  However, we appreciate greatly the opportunity briefly to highlight some key points.<br \/>The ambitious general scheme proposes a ground-breaking overhaul of the law as it applies to children and family relationships in Ireland.  It addresses the increasing complexity and diversity of family arrangements in which children are being raised in modern Ireland.  It acknowledges and seeks to address the fact that a diversity of people other than biological parents may play a leading role in respect of a child's upbringing.  The best interests of these children require that these arrangements be recognised and supported.  Broadly speaking, the authority welcomes the scheme as a significant reform.<br \/>Our submission highlights a number of issues that require careful consideration.  In particular, we are concerned that the scheme makes no provision for children who are born as a result of assisted reproduction to access information on their identity and origins.  Notably, the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction in its 2005 report observed that &quot;having access to genetic origins is potentially of profound importance for people's understanding of their identity in a psychological, genetic and historical context&quot;.  Given the acute problems experienced by adopted people in this regard, it is recommended that the scheme should expressly ensure that all children at an appropriate age have access to information allowing them to identify their genetic origins.<br \/>The authority is also concerned at the exclusion of traditional surrogacy from the scheme.  This involves circumstances in which the surrogate mother uses her own genetic material in the pregnancy.  An arrangement involving the use of the surrogate's own eggs is arguably simpler, safer and more likely to result in pregnancy.  It is also less likely to give rise to ethical complications in that the number of potential biologically connected persons will be fewer than in the case of a surrogacy arrangement other than a traditional surrogacy.  This exclusion could be reconsidered.<br \/>Given the risk of the commercial exploitation of women, the focus in the scheme on altruistic, non-commercial surrogacy is to be welcomed.  The authority, however, queries the imposition of certain other restrictions in respect of the surrogate.  The scheme requires that a surrogate mother must be at least 24 years of age at the time of the surrogacy arrangement.  Given that the age of majority is 18, it is unclear why an elevated and potentially discriminatory minimum age has been chosen in this specific context for a woman to become pregnant.  Notably, there is no such minimum age imposed on a male donor of genetic material.  Why should a woman be deemed insufficiently mature in making a decision of this nature prior to the age of 24 when she can make all other important, life-changing decisions from the age of 18?<br \/>The requirement that a surrogate must already have given birth to at least one child that is in her care will also preclude many women who may for altruistic reasons wish to assist another woman in having a child.  This involves a surrogate making decisions to restrict the kinship of her first child.  This condition may need to be re-evaluated.  The authority also recommends that some consideration should be given to making pre-birth judicial arrangements in respect of surrogacy to ensure that there is clarity and certainty around the legal responsibilities and rights of all parties as early as possible and prior to the birth of the child.<br \/>The authority has previously noted that the language around children's well being could be less custodial.  We welcome the provisions expanding the range of people who may seek guardianship or custody of a child and proposed improvements to availability of access.  We recommend, however, the adoption of a broader definition of the phrase &quot;relative of the child&quot; in head 31 of the scheme to include the relatives of a spouse or civil partner of a parent in the category of those who may apply for custody and access.  We also recommended that, subject to certain limited exceptions, all fathers of children born inside or outside marriage should have automatic guardianship responsibilities in respect of their children.  The Law Reform Commission has endorsed this view.  The scheme proposes to extend automatic guardianship to a category of unmarried fathers who have been cohabiting with the child's mother for at least 12 months before the child's birth, ending no earlier than 10 months before the birth.  It is arguable that this timescale does not go far enough and arbitrarily excludes from automatic guardianship many unmarried fathers who play a vital role in the raising of their children, including those who commence cohabitation with the mother after the pregnancy or the birth.  While unmarried fathers will still be able to acquire guardianship by court order and by agreement, we submit that further consideration is required of the circumstances in which fathers are given automatic guardianship so as to ensure that fathers are not arbitrarily excluded from automatic guardianship.<br \/>We welcome the introduction of mechanisms to ensure that parenting orders work effectively and expand the range of persons who may be required to maintain a child.  We also welcome the significant amendments to civil partnership law that will, if implemented, ensure that the interests of children of civil partners are properly considered and vindicated in civil partnership proceedings.  These measures will eliminate the most glaring remaining gaps between civil partnership and marriage and greatly enhance the position of a child being raised by civil partners.  We are pleased also to see proposals to extend joint adoption to civil partners.  Given that gay and lesbian people may already adopt as individuals, allowing for joint adoption by civil partners is a logical step forward which will provide greater stability for a range of children living with same-sex couples.  While welcoming this step, the authority notes that the proposals exclude unmarried couples from adopting as a couple.  While marriage and civil partnership in many cases will provide greater stability for children, we question whether a blanket ban on unmarried couples adopting jointly is appropriate.  The UK House of Lords has invalidated a similar blanket ban in Northern Ireland on joint adoption by unmarried couples as being contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights.  Similarly, we question the wisdom of excluding all unmarried couples from joint adoption regardless of their circumstances.<br \/>We recommend that the option of second-parent adoption be considered in respect of children being adopted by a parent's spouse or civil partner.  At the moment, both the parent and spouse must adopt the child together.  Provision should be made to allow the spouse or civil partner of a parent to adopt the child without requiring the spouse or civil partner who is a parent either to extinguish her responsibilities or to have to adopt the child alongside the new parent&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner.<br \/>Finally, the authority has recommended that provisions and protections under the Adoptive Leave Acts should be extended to at least one commissioning parent in a surrogate arrangement.  The scheme should set out expressly the qualifications required by a person serving as guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>in respect of a child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900019#X00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Merriman"},{"type":"speech","time":1397041500,"counter":1045,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Merriman for his precise presentation and for keeping to the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900019#X00500","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397041500,"counter":1046,"content":"<p>Marriage Equality welcomes the general scheme as a major reform of family law which will reflect the complexity of family life in Ireland today.  As complex as the legal details may be, however, the spirit of the legislation is clear.  It is intended to legislate for the reality of children's lives in Ireland with their best interests paramount.  The vast majority of children whose lives will be improved on foot of the legislation are born to heterosexual parents.  However, we welcome the opportunity to address the committee as the legislation also has the potential to solve many of the practical day-to-day legal difficulties faced by children in same-sex families.  I offer a snapshot of the reality for children in Ireland growing up in same-sex families, which will hopefully demonstrate why the Bill is such an urgent matter.<\/p><p>  Currently, loving and committed same-sex couples cannot marry in Ireland.  Since 2011 and the introduction of civil partnership, same-sex relationships are now recognised in Ireland and granted many of the rights and obligations available to married heterosexual couples.  However, research published by Marriage Equality in 2011 entitled \"Missing Pieces\" highlighted many legislative differences between civil marriage and civil partnership.  The most distressing of these gaps - especially for those of us who are parenting - relate to children and parents in same-sex families.  The gaps range across lack of rights on access, maintenance, custody, inheritance, guardianship and the complete lack of any mechanism for a child to have a legally recognised relationship with his or her non-biological parent or parents.  All over Ireland, mums and dads who are lesbian or gay are raising kids in loving homes and doing the best they can for their children, just like other parents.  However, they live their lives in a precarious and insecure legal lacuna.<\/p> <p>As the ombudsman for children said in relation to the civil partnership bill in her report in July 2010: <blockquote><br \/>It should be borne in mind that this is not a hypothetical problem.  The omission of robust protections for the children of civil partners will have real consequences for the young people concerned and it is in their interests that the law reflect and provide for the reality of their lives.  <\/blockquote>In 2010, Marriage Equality asked a group of young adult children who had grown up in same-sex families what it was like for them growing up in Ireland.  We published what they had to say in a report called Voices of Children.  They told us about their vision of an Ireland where human rights for all children was a lived reality.  They also told us about their experiences of growing up in Ireland and the impact the lack of marriage equality and other legal gaps had on their lives.  They described experiences of homophobia in public spaces such as in schools, in contact with the health services and in private spaces such as friends' homes ranging from parents not being allowed collect them from schools because they were not recognised as a legal parent or guardian to one boy's friend not being allowed to play in his home because he had two mums.  <br \/>In September 2010, Marriage Equality held a Voices of Children conference where national and international experts and advocates from areas such as child law and psychology came together with young adults who had grown up in same-sex families, LGBT parents and people working with children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900019#X00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Moninne Griffith","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1397042100,"counter":1048,"content":"<p>There is a phone on.

Out of this conference, a group called Believe in Equality was set up by the young people themselves.  Since then, they have been working with us in Marriage Equality to advocate for equality for children like them.  One of them is a board member of Marriage Equality and the committee will probably have seen some of them share their stories in the media.<\/p><p>  One young woman who shares her story was conceived with donor sperm and born to her two doting mothers.  She grew up in Ireland with two loving parents but the law as it stands only recognises her biological mother as her parent even though her other mother planned her, went through the process of her partner getting pregnant, the pregnancy and the birth, raising her as her own very much-loved child.  There was, and still is, no way for her mother to become her legal parent.  She cannot even adopt her as same-sex couples are barred from adoption because of the marriage requirement nor could her other mother become her guardian so she could not even give permission for medical procedures or school trips.  Now that this young woman is grown up, although she is no longer at risk in respect of these gaps, she worries about her parents and their future.  Will she be able to make decisions about both of her mothers' health care if one of them gets sick or becomes dependent on her in the future?  This Bill offers families like her family clarity around these issues.  It means they will have the legal protections they need because it will for the first time recognise them as parents and children and reflect the reality of their lives.  <\/p><p>  The main points of our submission therefore are that we welcome the Bill as a positive step to protect children all over Ireland including those growing up in same-sex families by recognising their actual parent-child relationships.  While it should be remembered that the vast majority of potential parents accessing adoption and assisted reproductive services are heterosexual, we welcome the Bill&rsquo;s proposal to extend the definition of parent to include parents of children conceived through assisted reproduction.

It does not give any credence to the idea that the child might have a right to know the identity of his or her biological parents or that the child has any sort of right to the care, society and support of their natural parents.  When one reads that in the context of a Constitution that for decades has placed such a strong emphasis on the genetic link between children and their biological parents, one can imagine that there could be some constitutional questions there.  One has only to look at recent cases such as M.R. &amp;amp; Anor <i>v<\/i>. An t&Aacute;rd Chl&aacute;raitheoir &amp;amp; Ors and McD <i>v<\/i>. L where the genetic link was seen to be very important.  In McD <i>v<\/i>. L, it was held that the best interests of a child conceived through assisted human reproduction commissioned by a lesbian couple meant that the sperm donor father ought to be granted access rights to the child.  That would have some sort of relevance to the issues we are discussing here and the question of whether the general scheme as it is currently constituted gives or does not give enough protection to the rights of the child.  The best interests of the child only seem to kick in when adult reproductive autonomy has been served.  Only then when we are talking about guardianship, access and all those other aspects of family law does the best interests principle kick in.  Prior to that, it seems to be completely absent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900020#Y00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Thomas Finegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1397042100,"counter":1053,"content":"<p>I wish to tease that out.

In respect of the privileged status of marriage within the Constitution as well as the best interests of the child, one could not with any degree of reasonableness dismiss that possibility.  It is a genuine possibility.  There is no sense that marriage is taken seriously as a privileged institution.  One need only compare the general scheme here with our adoption law.  Adoption law provides that only a married couple can jointly adopt whereas pretty much any combination or adults considered singly can avail of a right to a child under this general scheme.  A right to a child itself is a very radical proposal.  It is a new right that is not recognised in many jurisdictions and is quite radical.<\/p><p>  It has been mentioned that there is such a thing as a right of single people to adopt under Irish adoption law.  There is a bit of divergence between what Irish adoption law provides in its textual provisions and what may be happening as a matter of practice.  In Ireland, there is a lesser right for a single person to adopt a child.  That is framed in the context of particular circumstances when it is in the best interests of the child whereas there is a far clearer and stronger right for a married couple to jointly adopt.  If one looks back on the original drafting of the Adoption Act 1991, one can see that the reason that a right was granted to single people to adopt in particular circumstances was to cater for very exceptional circumstances, as the Minister at that time put it.  He expressly put on the record a situation where an Irish nurse working in Ukraine might wish to adopt an orphan.  Perhaps practice has expanded upon that but if it has done so, it has diverged from the text of Irish adoption law.  I submit that the reason Irish adoption law is constituted as it is because it has had recourse to trying to value and respect the privileged status of marriage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900020#Y00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Thomas Finegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1397042100,"counter":1055,"content":"<p>Dr. Finegan mentioned in passing that this legislation is permissive by the standards of other countries.

It is difficult to make one statement that would cover everything in the general scheme of the Bill.  Heads 7, 10 and 11 are generally considered as priorities.  My comments on the rights of the child being ignored were made in the context of heads 3 and 5, which make a strong presumption that the right of an adult to reproductive autonomy and to have a child by commercial or artificial means should be paramount.  This right is not balanced, either in the text or the accompanying notes, by the best interest of the child.  The child's best interests only kick in after he or she has been brought into the world and issues such as guardianship, access and custody arise.  Children are deliberately deprived of both parents, their genetic identity and access to and support of their natural parents.  They are deprived of a mother and father.<\/p><p>  Other speakers raised the possibility that a child's right to identity might be downgraded.  That is a constitutional right which can be drawn from a Supreme Court case in 1998 but it is merely a function of the fact that adult reproductive autonomy is privileged over and above everything else.  That is to be expected when one makes the decision that there is such a thing.  It is a novel right to have a child.  This is where I see that children, and their origin and upbringing, are being commodified.  It is not a surprise that much of sections 3 and 5 deal with commercial arrangements of industry and transactions between supply and demand.  That is to be expected because we are creating a right to have a child, which has not existed in the Constitution or elsewhere in Irish law, European conventions or international human rights law.

If they transgress the provisions of the Bill they will face potential criminal prosecution and will not be eligible to be declared the parents of the child.  In circumstances where the surrogate mother wishes to relinquish custody of the child to those parents and does not want to raise the child herself, who will be regarded as the parents?

Where there are two conflicting policies the best interests of the child must be regarded as paramount and custody be awarded to the genetic parents even though they may have transgressed the provisions of the Bill.  In those jurisdictions the courts have said that only in the clearest case of abuse of the policy will they be able to withhold a parentage order, and most cases will not involve such abuse.

I am also a little concerned that it brings back the old definition that a woman who was pregnant or a mother in some way did not have full capacity during that time to make decisions up to or after it.  We have always fought the notion that maternity is an illness.  There is an implication in saying suddenly one can decide anything from 18 but not this one.

Other terms are used in the convention when they want to talk about other types of care arrangements.  Again in the UNCRC, there is this sense that there is a right to parents, plural, primarily meaning a Mum and a Dad.  General schemes such as this give no consideration whatsoever to those rights and in fact place above them a right that has far less of a pedigree in constitutional law and international human rights law - the right to have a child - and I would say there is a denigrating of children's rights and a prioritisation of adult rights, specifically the right to reproductive autonomy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900023#BB01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Thomas Finegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1397043900,"counter":1101,"content":"<p>I would like to clarify lest I be misunderstood that I was not referring to single parents through natural circumstances.

In lieu of the IVF industry, there would be a really strong push towards commercial surrogacy.  What we have seen in many other countries is commercial surrogacy being exported to countries where there are no regulations or lax regulations that protect women and their children.  In the case of India, a major market for surrogacy was Australia, and there were quite a few Australian heterosexual couples and LGBTQ individuals who were using the market in India as a source of supply of surrogate mothers.  What we have seen is a complete breakdown of efforts to move forward on the rights of women in these countries and in developing countries where for generations human rights groups on the left and the right, regardless of their political constitution, have tried to move forward the rights of women to dignified employment and to just participation in the economy.  We have seen the deleterious effects on them.  There have been several publications in this regard.  A clinic in India was highlighted in the media with regard to IVF.  There have been instances of clinics in which medical service providers have taken advantage of a market that is readily available.  What is happening now is that the market has moved from India to countries such as Mexico and Thailand, where there are no regulations protecting women who would serve as surrogates.<\/p> <p>It is not an easy matter to discuss.  It is ugly, but it is fact.  This is what is happening.

When it comes to Parts 3 and 5, the latter wins.  There is deemed to be a right to a child.  On that basis, the rights and interests of a child are ignored, including the right to two parents, the right to know his or her own genetic identity and that of the biological parents, the right to the care and support of natural parents and also a right to a mother and a father, where practicable.  The way this general scheme balances it is to tip the scales most definitely in favour of all adults.  There is no point in limiting it to one group or sub-group - all adults are included.

We have taken three serious cases in relation to surrogate parents in Ireland.  All of them involved young couples, the female of which following marriage had cancer and either lost her womb or ovaries.  In these cases, it was either a relative or a sister who decided, not only to enable the sister's recovery from the dreadful disease at a young age but to give her the gift of a family, to be a surrogate mother of a child who would be raised by the couple, the father being the biological father.  We are not talking about transactions or commodities.  We are talking about real situations.  The Equality Authority has stood beside these children in having access to full family lives.<\/p><p>  It is important to refocus the discussion.  Surrogacy is not some type of trendy lifestyle choice.  There is no such thing as gay or straight parents.  There are only good or bad parents.  If, in the case of adoption, a biological mother can stipulate that she would like her child-children to be raised by straight parents, why then could she not also stipulate that they be raised by wealthy parents?  It is important to understand that there are people with many needs.  There are children who require the vindication of their rights because their mother, father and so on has a disability, cancer and somebody in their family is wonderful enough to do something for them.  The global description of surrogacy as a process in which children are a commodity is false.  I say this on behalf of the people we have supported.  We have been able to ensure children born as a result of surrogacy, which children could not have been born as a result of a dreadful disability and illness, are now with happy families.  These children deserve respect and rights.  I admire the relatives who have enabled their families to have these children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900026#EE01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Merriman"},{"type":"speech","time":1397045700,"counter":1204,"content":"<p>The point was made that on the other side of the coin are people using surrogacy to make a great deal of money and to exploit others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900026#EE02000","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397045700,"counter":1205,"content":"<p>There has been a good deal of discussion of adoption, including by gay and lesbian couples.  I reiterate a point made in my opening comments, namely, that adoption is ultimately about the right of a child to a family; it is not about the right of adults to adopt.  When speaking about adoption by lesbian and gay couples, we are, for the most part, speaking about adoption of a child they are already parenting.  To my mind and that of any fair minded individual, in that case it is in the child's best interests.  Adoption does not always meet the needs of children who are being parented by lesbian or gay couples.  This legislation is so welcome and needed because it provides for broader recognition of parentage, guardianship and so on.<\/p><p>  For decades, researchers have been comparing the development of children parented by lesbian and gay couples with that of children parented by heterosexual parents.  All of the leading international child experts, including from the United States and the United Kingdom, on child development conclusively agree that what affects whether one has a healthy and well adjusted child is the quality of the relationship between the child and his or her parents, the quality of the relationship of the parents and the economic and social support afforded to that family.  To my mind, that is what the Bill is seeking to do.  We are not talking about it providing the opportunity to create families, rather we are taking about it taking cognisance of the complexity of family life in modern Irish society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900026#EE02100","nonspeaker":"Ms Sandra Irwin-Gowran"},{"type":"speech","time":1397045700,"counter":1206,"content":"<p>My final question is directed at Dr. Ryan and Ms Irwin-Gowran and relates to second parent adoption.

In a number of other jurisdictions there are facilities for step-parent adoption.  Under the Bill, civil partners, as well as spouses, are enabled to adopt a child without the biological parent who is a spouse or civil partner having to go through that process.  This raises difficult questions.  In particular, one would have to have regard to the position of other parents in this context.  It is not a straightforward issue, but nonetheless it might benefit from consideration of some scheme for second parent adoption.  I understand this is possible in the United Kingdom.

Would any witness disagree that the best interests of the child should be absolutely paramount?  If so, will they say why not?  I expect that everyone agrees and that there will not be an answer to the question.  However, if someone disagrees with that statement, I ask them to outline their reasons for disagreeing.<br \/>My second question is along similar lines, and I only have two questions.  It relates to the issue of the absence of fathers.  I will give a short quotation from President Barack Obama and ask witnesses if they would disagree with the points he made and, if so, explain why.  It is a speech he gave on fatherhood and missing fathers, in which he said the foundations of families were weaker as a consequence of that.  He went on to say later in the speech, and obviously he was speaking to some extent from his own experience:<blockquote>You and I know how true this is in the African-American community.  We know that more than half of all black children live in single-parent households, a number that has doubled - doubled - since we were children.  We know the statistics - that children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and twenty times more likely to end up in prison.  They are more likely to have behavioural problems, or run away from home, or become teenage parents themselves.  And the foundations of our community are weaker because of it.<\/blockquote>I believe most witnesses acknowledged in their submissions that the right of the child to know his or her biological and genetic parents was absolute.  Would they not agree that just knowing is simply not good enough and that it should involve the participation of that father in the rearing and development of the child?  That would obviously exclude the case made by Ms Brady.  We are not talking about a child who is a product of rape.  That would be untenable to anyone.  In the ordinary course of events, however, where the father is not violent and there is no legal or criminal reason he should not be involved, should the State not have the framework to encourage that to happen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900028#GG02000","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1397046900,"counter":1247,"content":"<p>There are many fathers who do not wish to be involved and walk away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900028#GG02100","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1397046900,"counter":1248,"content":"<p>I accept that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014040900028#GG02200","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1397046900,"counter":1249,"content":"<p>There is a vote in the D&aacute;il.

We prepared a short paper for the committee and rather than read it all, I will highlight a few of the main points.<\/p><p>  SEAI is the national authority for sustainable energy.  We concentrate our efforts on energy efficiency on the one hand and on renewable energy and de-carbonising our energy sources on the other.  By sustainable, we mean the core imperative for Ireland to wean itself off an energy system which at the moment is heavily exposed to imported fossil fuels which we are using inefficiently and the price of which is outside our control.  I would also make the point that the recent report by the inter-governmental panel on climate change reminds us very strongly that the ultimate goal of energy policy must be de-carbonisation and that our progress towards that goal must be accelerated.  <\/p><p>  I will make a few remarks about energy efficiency, renewable energy and then jobs.  First, as members will be aware, energy efficiency in the home has become a thriving sector in Ireland in recent years.  Thousands of people are employed in that sector and are going into homes and buildings and improving their insulation and heating systems.  On behalf of the Government, we give out grants and support that work in various ways.  We have supported more than 250,000 home energy upgrades in the past five years, including a strong focus on vulnerable homes.  We have also given direct advice, training and support to thousands of businesses and public bodies to help them make significant savings in their spend on energy.<\/p><p>  One area that the Chairman mentioned which I want to highlight today is our growing work with communities through a programme called Better Energy Communities, which my colleague, Mr. Declan Meally, runs on our behalf.  In 2013, our funds in this area supported over 80 projects around the country which led to more than &euro;30 million being spent directly in local communities on energy efficiency and sustainable energy measures.  In our submission, we highlighted a couple of projects and provided a full list at the back.  I visited a number of these projects around the country myself and the community spirit is striking, with community groups, businesses and local residents associations coming together and doing fantastic work on the ground in terms of making homes and public buildings more comfortable, reducing their energy costs and creating local employment.  We believe there is a lot more potential in this area and it is one on which we continue to concentrate.  The 2014 call for funding is now open and all of the details are on our website.  As with all of our work, we would very much welcome a partnership with the Deputies and Senators in terms of helping us to identify suitable projects or putting people in touch with us.  We remain open to conversations about anything we can do in local areas to assist in the delivery of projects.<\/p><p>  In terms of energy efficiency as a whole, I remain convinced that there is massive additional potential for work in this area in Ireland.  The particular point for Ireland, given that we import most of our energy, is that investment in energy efficiency takes money that we were previously sending abroad to buy energy from others and keeps it in local communities, spending it on local jobs, technologies and interventions.  That continues to be an area we would like to exploit.  <\/p><p>  On renewable energy and starting from the policy perspective, European policy is clear that by 2050 at the latest, Europe's energy systems need to be substantially de-carbonised and renewable energy is at the centre of that.  For Ireland, again because we import so much of our energy, this is a particular opportunity to stop sending money abroad to buy fuel and to exploit our own natural resources.  We have particularly rich renewable energy resources and are in a position to keep money in the economy, give ourselves greater control over energy costs and reduce our carbon emissions.  <\/p><p>  As the committee is well aware, Ireland's use of renewable energy has grown steadily in the last few years.  The strongest growth has been in wind energy.  The simple reason for that is that Ireland is a windy country and has a rich resource.  Therefore, wind energy is the cheapest form of renewable energy in Ireland at the moment.  We know through our detailed analysis of the sector that our use of renewables in electricity has reduced our imports of fossil fuels by more than &euro;1 billion in the last five years and has reduced our emissions of carbon dioxide by more than 12 million tonnes.  It is important to note that wind does not add to consumer prices for electricity.  In fact, in recent years our analysis of the sector shows that when gas prices are high, wind energy is actually lowering consumer prices for electricity in Ireland.  That is because Ireland has one of the strongest wind energy resources in the world and wind energy is cheap and effective here.<\/p><p>  While the evidence is clear that wind is positive for Ireland as a whole, that in no way means that we can be insensitive to local issues and concerns and there is a lot of controversy surrounding wind energy generation at the moment.  It is our view that we must find ways to bring the benefits to Ireland that wind energy offers but in an appropriate and acceptable way at a local level.  Good planning, local consultation and local benefit are all essential elements of that process.<\/p><p>  Bio-energy is also a very important sector for Ireland, particularly in terms of meeting our heat needs.  It has a particular benefit in bringing local supply chains for fuel into the economy, especially into rural economies, and therefore is a further example of how sustainable energy can keep money in local communities.  The Government will publish a new bio-energy strategy shortly.  We are looking at other areas of renewable energy, including solar electricity.  We are concentrating a lot on marine energy at the moment because Ireland has a very rich energy resource off its coast.  The technology is in the early stages of development so it will be a number of years before wave, tidal and offshore wind energy are making a significant contribution to Ireland's energy mix.  We are working on it now and investing in Irish companies now so that when the technologies become mature, it can be a significant employment and wealth generating sector here.  The focus of policy and our work in the renewable energy sphere is on meeting the 2020 targets set down under the European Union framework.  This, in very broad terms, entails a doubling of our use of renewable energy of all forms - electricity, heat and transport - between now and the end of the decade.  <\/p><p>  In terms of jobs, obviously employment cuts across all aspects of sustainable energy.  The first and most obvious point is that the businesses we have worked with to reduce their energy costs employ more than 300,000 people in Ireland and we have helped those companies to become at least a little more competitive by reducing the amount of energy they use.  More than that, there are many exciting emerging opportunities for Irish companies in terms of providing solutions to sustainable energy issues which will find markets not just to help solve Ireland's problems, but also internationally, in the context of the technologies and services that are growing rapidly.  This was very visible recently at our recent annual energy show at the RDS when we had thousands of businesses coming together to discuss the latest technologies and products that are emerging.  We are working with the enterprise agencies at the moment to focus on the points in the supply chains and investment chains for sustainable energy which will offer particularly strong opportunities for Irish company involvement so that we can focus our efforts on helping companies in the most promising areas.<\/p><p>  Undoubtedly we face very significant energy challenges in terms of our dependence on imports, our costs and the environmental impact.  That means that all forms of actions on both efficiency and renewables are absolutely required, with urgency.  However, we do have certain advantages in the global movement towards sustainability in energy, including our rich renewable resources and our strengths in information and communications technology and knowledge services.  Progress on the ground in retrofits, better energy communities and our growth of renewable energy gives us grounds for optimism in terms of the opportunities that can emerge from the challenges that Ireland faces.  <\/p><p>  As I mentioned earlier, we have provided a full list of all of the community projects we funded last year.   We will also provide members with a small brochure which highlights our work in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040900004#K00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Motherway"},{"type":"speech","time":1397032500,"counter":1280,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Motherway.

What does he consider to be appropriate and acceptable?  It is a very divisive issue, with many people being strongly opposed to these types of developments.<\/p><p> I have noticed a trend whereby there seems to be a much greater take-up of the better energy warmer homes schemes in urban areas compared with rural counties.

In regard to home upgrades, those upgrades are delivered by two types of organisation, namely, private contractors that we procure through open tender or, particularly in the vulnerable sector, by a network of more than 20 community-based bodies which are usually not-for-profit community-owned organisations.  Those organisations can be found in some counties and cities but not in others.  We will use community-based organisations where they exist, with private contractors being used to fill in the rest.<\/p><p>  The key issue for us - again, it is something we need the committee's help with it - is getting the word out there.  This is particularly important in the case of our supports for vulnerable household, the main qualifying criterion for which is entitlement to the fuel allowance.  We tend to find that where a locality has a community-based organisation, it often leads to higher uptake simply because there is higher awareness.  In other instances we have to use other mechanisms to make people aware that they can come to us and ask for this service.  The committee can be of assistance to us in this regard and we also co-operate with the Department of Social Protection in terms of sending out letters to targeted people.  In addition, we use local media and advertising and any other means we can find to get the message out.  Sometimes a trend is essentially about our success or otherwise in getting the word out to qualifying people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040900005#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Motherway"},{"type":"speech","time":1397033100,"counter":1283,"content":"<p>Is Dr. Motherway saying that some people are not aware of their entitlements?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040900005#L00300","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397033100,"counter":1284,"content":"<p>That, in my view, is often the explanation behind discrepancies in take-up between different areas.  In other cases, it can be a question of patterns such as how old the homes are, what types of upgrade measures they need and so on.  However, there undoubtedly are people out there who would benefit from this free service but they are not aware of it and we do not know who they are.  It is an ongoing issue for us to find ways of communicating with those people.<\/p><p>  We are well aware of the level of concern in communities across the country regarding proposals for wind farm projects.  It is important to point out that there are parts of Ireland where wind energy has been developing successfully and people are living quite comfortably near wind farms.  These projects are bringing local benefits in terms of rates paid to local authority, jobs created in the area and so on.  However, there are plenty of other people who have concerns regarding what is proposed for their area, and those concerns are absolutely valid and must be taken on board.<\/p><p>  Our view is that the planning process is central to all of this.  Good planning is able to discern between good and bad projects.  On an ongoing basis we see planning authorities approving some projects and rejecting others.  We are working with those authorities on a local area renewable energy strategies model whereby we are encouraging all local authorities to have a strategy in place in advance of any given project coming to them.  The model involves the devising of certain principles for good planning, which are developed through consultation in the context of the county development plan.  Those principles will guide decisions as to the parts of the county or region where wind energy and bio-energy development is not acceptable for whatever reason, and where such development would be welcome.<\/p><p>  Transparency and openness are central to this process.  It is undoubtedly the case that there are places where wind farms should not be built.  It is unquestionably the case that rules and regulations should be in place to make sure communities' interests are protected.  I see plenty of examples around the country where these types of projects have been done well and without any controversy.  People are comfortable with these developments and there are clear local benefits.  If we can learn from those successes, we have much to gain from the development of wind energy in Ireland.  It is a strong resource and if we can find a way to balance the benefits with the disadvantages, it remains an opportunity for us.<\/p><p>  I ask my colleague, Mr. Meally, to respond to the Chairman's question on community initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040900005#L00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Motherway"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397033100,"counter":1285,"content":"<p>The better energy communities initiative has grown out of our efforts to look at how communities operate and work around energy.  One of the things we have learned in recent years is the importance of having a champion for such initiatives, a concept the Chairman will be very familiar with in the context of his GAA experience.  The better energy communities initiative involved finding champions in local communities and community groups and seeing how we could skill them up.  Last year, we found champions in many guides, including, for example, a residents' association, a co-operative society and a local authority.<\/p><p>  A particularly innovative example of such engagement was the decision by the Musgrave Group to champion a project.  The company upgraded a number of its stores and a percentage of the grant that was due to the company was donated to local GAA clubs to allow them to upgrade.  The 45% contribution from the Musgrave Group was matched with a 45% grant from SEAI, with the clubs having to put up only 10%.  The Musgrave Group was able to organise the project management of that across several counties with an energy supplier.  Members will see from the county-by-county list that 23 shops and 22 GAA clubs benefited from this work.  It was championed by the Musgrave Group and involved only one application to SEAI.  A project management team co-ordinated and funded the initiative through the Musgrave Group, providing the necessary technical and project management expertise.<\/p><p>  We have been in discussions with GAA headquarters at Croke Park to see how that model could be expanded.  Some 2,000 clubs around the country could potentially benefit and we are looking at scaling up the project.  Moreover, the GAA itself could even take on the role of champion itself.  The initiative has been particularly successful and encompasses a broad definition in terms of what can define a community.  It can be a group of similarly-minded businesses, organisations or residents, or even, as happened in Tipperary, a group of households.  It is about putting together a team to champion the application to SEAI.  It is proving a very successful model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040900005#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Meally"},{"type":"speech","time":1397033100,"counter":1286,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for attending the meeting.  We have discussed this issue with them on several occasions.  In terms of energy efficiency initiatives, retrofitting and the better energy warmer homes scheme, there is a great deal of good work being done and many people are benefiting from these upgrades.  Such schemes have been operating through the local partnership and Leader groups.  Do the delegates envisage that continuing in the future?<\/p><p>  Everybody has bought into renewables, but there is huge concern in regard to the lack of consultation taking place.  I joined other committee members in visiting a number of wind farms and have been constantly interacting with people in regard to such projects.  We have very well respected people challenging the whole wind energy initiative, as I indicated privately to the delegates when we met.<\/p> <p>Both the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and society in general face a major challenge in the context of considering whether wind energy has a future or whether we should move to an offshore as opposed to an onshore option.<\/p><p> The warmer homes and retrofit schemes sponsored by the authority are excellent initiatives and they give rise to fantastic benefits.

On the EU targets relating to renewable energy, we will wait to see the mechanism that will be proposed.  The target for renewable energy is proposed to be stronger but, as the Deputy indicated, it is envisaged that it will apply at Union rather than individual member state level.  We wait to see how this is going to work in practice.  The underlying point for Ireland is that the proposal is for a 40% carbon reduction target.  For Ireland to achieve that, there will need to be an intensification of the process of decarbonising our energy system, particularly in the context of the issues we face with regard to agriculture.  Outside of EU targets and complying with them for their own sake, renewable energy is a more positive story in Ireland than is the case in many other countries.  This is because the resource here is rich.<\/p><p>  The Deputy referred to commentators questioning some aspects of renewable energy in this country, particularly, for whatever reason, that which relates to wind generation.  The question I would put to them is: \"What is the proposed alternative?\"  I presume no one is saying that we should continue to import gas, coal and oil in perpetuity and be obliged to deal with all the costs, disadvantages and emissions relating to doing so.  I am in favour of exploiting our own resources and I firmly believe that wind energy is a rich and strong resource for us.  However, we must ensure we exploit wind energy in an acceptable way.  It is a pity that people foster myths about renewable energy sources and state, for example, that wind generation does not work or that it does not assist in saving money or reducing emissions.  The evidence is clearly to the contrary.  The question which then arises is how we might reap the benefits in an acceptable and appropriate way.  The Deputy is absolutely correct.  Challenges remain and there is a need to engage in a debate in respect of them.  Even though the issue is more controversial than used to be the case, I would welcome a debate in which all of the relevant issues could be aired.  We need to challenge some of the myths that exist.  However, we must also accept that there are many valid local concerns which must be addressed.  We always emphasise that developers, in particular, and bodies such as ours must ensure all the facts are laid bare in order that we might engage in a full and frank debate.<\/p><p>  We are witnessing a shift in respect of our programmes.  In the context of the retrofit programme, a couple of years ago we were mainly dealing with individuals who were either availing of the grants we have to offer or obtaining free services from us.  It is increasingly the case that we are dealing with communities, particularly in the context of the work being done by Mr. Meally.  As well as economies of scale, there are also the additional benefits in terms of the uplift to communities from an increase in employment.  I certainly see this growing.  All partnerships are interesting to us and we are working with Leader, residents groups, local businesses, etc., at present.  We would very much welcome the committee's input on whoever else might be willing local partners for us as we try to expand our activities in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040900006#M00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Motherway"},{"type":"speech","time":1397033700,"counter":1289,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Motherway and Mr. Meally for their presentation.  I acknowledge the work done and progress achieved by the SEAI.  I was involved in one of the first community schemes in Waterford, which involved a national school coming together with a day centre for the elderly.  They would never have come together were it not for the relevant SEAI scheme.  They made a successful joint application and thereafter combined their resources to introduce a number of measures. including energy efficient insulation, boilers and lighting.  I commend the SEAI on the scheme.<\/p><p>  We have a long way to go in the context of informing the wider community of the further benefits of sustainable energy initiatives.  A joint approach is required in this regard.  At micro level, there are various grant schemes, energy awareness campaigns, etc., while at macro level there is the national energy policy.  The latter is something we must address and I have no doubt we will face a number of serious challenges in so doing.  At micro level, the SEAI grant aids energy efficient heating systems such as those which involve the use of geothermal and solar power, wood pellet boilers and so on.  That is extremely positive, but I would be critical of two aspects.  In the first instance, householders who have such systems in their homes require a degree of technical knowledge to operate them efficiently.  For example, a geothermal system uses heat taken straight from underground.  If such a system is not properly controlled, it can work in reverse and the householder can end up with massive electricity bills because he or she is not fully aware of what is involved in terms of controlling the system.  In addition, such systems are quite expensive to install.  There is a need for more work to be done in respect of this matter but I am not sure how the SEAI will proceed in that regard.  I would be interesting in hearing our guests' views on the matter.<\/p><p>  For the type of systems to which I refer to be installed, householders must have a certain amount of money to spend themselves.  In view of the fact that we are in the midst of a recession, there are limits to the amounts of money people have available and there are those who may not be in a position to invest in installing energy efficient heating systems.  A challenge also arises in respect of this matter.  A wood pellet or a geothermal system could cost anything up to &euro;10,000 to install.  Many households have open fires, which are extremely inefficient.  I understand the level of efficiency relating to them is 20%.  Would the SEAI not consider introducing a scheme whereby people could replace their open fires with simple stoves?  I accept they would still be burning fossil fuels but I understand the level of efficiency of such stoves is 80% in the context of heat output and the amount of fuel burned.  Technical knowledge is not required to use a stove and no major financial outlay is required.  If a scheme such as that were introduced, the level of energy efficiency throughout the country would increase dramatically.  I accept that stoves are not totally sustainable but they are a great deal more sustainable than open fires.  Would the SEAI be interested in introducing such a scheme?  Large numbers of people live in rural areas and many of them, particularly the elderly, would not have an idea how to use a geothermal system or a wood pellet boiler.  They would have no interest in such systems but they might be willing to install stoves if there were some incentive for doing so.  I am of the view that this would give rise to our achieving much higher levels of energy efficiency.<\/p><p>  On the macro level, there is much resistance to sources of renewable energy projects involving, for example, wind farms, and many people have lodged objections in respect of these.  I am very much in favour of wind farms.  There is a small wind farm in my locality which was installed approximately ten or 15 years ago.  No one objected to its construction at the time.  Schoolchildren in the area actually visit the facility.  They draw pictures and are proud of it.  Those in other communities have genuine concerns with regard to the impact of proposed wind farms, particularly those of a massive scale.  We have much work to do in the context of considering how we might bring members of the public along with us and impressing upon them the fact we need to convert to renewable sources of energy and reduce our dependence on imports of fossil fuels.  Will our guests indicate how we might proceed in this regard?<\/p><p>  There is a great deal of misinformation in respect of this matter and political parties can be opportunistic, particularly at election time.  We are not being responsible in the context of how we are dealing with the challenges we face.  On the one hand, it is stated that we need to access more sources of renewable energy.  There is a Private Members' Bill before the D&aacute;il in which it is stated that: \"Wind turbines that are of a height which is greater than 25 metres shall be located not less than a distance of ten times the height of the turbine away from any dwelling.\"  Is it physically possible to facilitate such a set-back distance in this country?  I very much doubt it.  I do not wish to oblige our guests to enter the political arena but I would like to hear their views on this matter.  As politicians, we need to be upfront and show leadership.  We cannot, as some politicians are trying to do, be all things to everyone.<\/p><p>  Will our guests outline their views on biomass?  I recently attended a public meeting, which was covered by the media, at which a presentation was made by BW Energy on the benefits of converting Moneypoint, Ireland's largest power station, from oil to biomass.<\/p> <p>They are telling us we would reach our 2020 targets at a single stroke if that happened.  What are SEAI's views on biomass?  Is it a sustainable technology on that scale?  Is the body aware of the report and will it be making a response to it?<\/p><p> Hydro has been mentioned only briefly.  I come from a place in Waterford where 300 kW of power was generated in the 19th century on the local river.  There is not one kilowatt generated there now.  Is there any promotion within SEAI to develop micro-hydro schemes nationally?  Is it an area we should explore more?  We have many rivers.  I acknowledge that there are issues with habitats and fish but is there a possibility of exploiting hydro power to a greater extent if only on a community scheme level to increase renewable energy production?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040900006#M00300","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397034300,"counter":1291,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions and commend him on his detailed knowledge.  He asked about geo-thermal energy.  Currently, we do not provide grant aid for geo-thermal, although we have in the past.  Our focus now is on insulation and heating systems in the more conventional sense.  However, I take the Deputy's point.  Technologies including geo-thermal and wood pellet will become more important in the future.  Our interest is in finding ways to develop markets so that on the supply side one has skilled installers, good technology and a competitive market.  On the demand side, people would have a choice available in terms of costs, benefits and use.  It is a challenge and a great deal of change is needed in the sector.  I replaced my boiler a few years ago and got a very conservative fitter who did not want any truck with new technology.  He wanted to sell me the old boiler he has always sold.  We support stoves via our energy efficiency obligation scheme whereby energy retail companies must meet efficiency targets.  Some of them are supporting stove installation to obtain credits in that regard.  I take the Deputy's point that stoves are an interesting solution in many cases and an important step towards efficiency and cost reduction.  People with stoves can use local wood supply, which is important.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is right about the misinformation on wind.  Our role is partly to publicise the facts and set out the national benefits.  The scale question is important.  I hear people say they are planning to build 25,000 MW and, as such, I must make it clear that the only certain plan in Ireland currently is to build another 2,500 MW of wind between now and the end of the decade to meet our 2020 target.  That will double what we have now.  There is clearly some uncertainty as to the nature of the intergovernmental agreement on export projects.  I also hear people quoting numbers of applications to the regulator for grid connections.  Most of that will never be built.  Right now, we are talking about going from what we have now to a further 2,500 MW.  What happens beyond 2020 depends on European policy, Irish policy, grid issues and export issues.  I would like to see more wind built but it will never be on the scale some people talk about.<\/p><p>  Biomass is a very important resource for us and will play an important part in meeting the 2020 targets.  In my view, it is best to focus on heat, especially when one considers how many people are using oil to heat their homes.  Biomass is a very interesting substitution for that.  I have read the BW report to which the Deputy referred and I have some serious concerns about some of the statistics it contains.  Some of the figures on the costs of the biomass resource are out by hundreds of millions of euro.  They underestimate by using British figures on the cost of biomass.  It is a very different story here.  There is a wider question of where the resource would come from.  The amount of resource they are talking about putting into Moneypoint is more than the entire national biomass resource we currently have.  That suggests importing it from all over the world at a heavy shipping cost.  Will the resource come from sustainable places?  There are significant unanswered questions.  There are no simple solutions like that where one thing will solve all of these complex problems.<\/p><p>  Our biomass resource is best used for heat in my view.  If one puts large amounts of biomass into a station like Moneypoint, one loses two thirds of it up the chimney as waste.  If one uses it to heat a home, one captures more than 90% of the energy value.  I mention a project I visited recently in Tralee where biomass was being used to heat hundreds of homes on a district basis at lower cost and very high levels of comfort.  All of the resource there comes from within 20 km or 30 km of the town as opposed to coming from abroad and making other countries rich.  Biomass has its place but I am not sure there is a magic, stroke-of-the-pen solution whereby we convert Moneypoint and all our problems disappear.<\/p><p>  In the past few years, we have funded a small number of trials for micro-generation, including hydro.  We found that in the right place, hydro works very well, which is what the Deputy suggested.  In fact, there are not that many of those right places.  The big stations like Ardnacrusha have served us very well and will continue to do so, but micro-hydro does not have huge potential in volume terms for Ireland.  There are a certain number of local sites where it works excellently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040900007#N00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Motherway"},{"type":"speech","time":1397034300,"counter":1292,"content":"<p>I will come back on biomass which is a very interesting point.

When the likes of this misinformation gets into the public domain, does SEAI proactively engage in the debate?

It can do great damage to public understanding and support levels for what would be a viable, renewable solution that would help us decarbonise our energy sector.

There are books and documents which are called strategy documents but they do not set out strategies for renewable energy in Ireland.  There is a list of targets, some with dates attached and some with benefits set out but no back up to support where those benefits will come from or how they are quantified.<\/p> <p>The Minister has said that he will produce a Green Paper on energy, which should be the precursor to this strategy.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, members and the public need to be involved in that discussion.  In the absence of a clear vision of the direction we want to take and community buy-in to the strategy, the impression is that energy companies are running rings around Government and that they are dictating the projects that will get the go ahead and where they will be located.<\/p><p> I do not want to politicise the issue in any way but even last night there was politicking with the discussion on legislation that we had put forward.  It was misrepresented by one of the speakers that the Sinn F&eacute;in Party is opposed to the export of energy.  We are not but we have asked Government to meet the needs of Irish people before exporting energy abroad.  If we have surplus energy from non-renewable sources, we should try to get the best possible deal and export it.  We are expected to believe, and I am not sure the SEAI has any impact on the issue - probably not - and the public is expected to believe that the midlands can effectively be an offshore wind farm for Britain, yet no one knows how much will be paid for it.  The public is not stupid.  Is it any wonder that a worthy project of promoting renewable energy is not enjoying public support when we expect the public to swallow that type of nonsense?  Does it help the sale of sustainable energy in Ireland when one or more of those providing advice is a beneficiary of one of the major energy companies in the midlands?  At what point does advice become lobbying in self-interest?  This is what the public knows.<\/p><p> I take on board that there may be some information on costs in the public domain, but some economists are questioning the financial assumptions underlying wind energy development.  If one removes EU and State subsidies for wind energy, exactly how much does it cost to generate energy from wind?  I think the facts need to be laid out and the comparative figures, which should be independently verified, need to be presented to the public.<\/p><p> Will the witnesses outline their views on offshore oil and gas, the threat of hydraulic fracturing and the contribution renewable energy can make to reducing our need for energy generated by fossil fuels?  I do not think we will eliminate their use but will reduce our dependence on them.<\/p><p> The issue of microgeneration was referred to briefly.  I have met a number of people who have invested a good deal of their own money in what appear to be exciting microgeneration projects, but the show stopper has been the cost of the connection to the grid.  One person wanted to convert chicken droppings to electricity to run chicken farms, which are high energy users, but he was quoted a figure in the order of &euro;250,000 to connect to the grid, which meant he had to abandon the project.  As a nation, we do not take microgeneration seriously at all.<\/p><p> The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland does a good job.  Everybody should be behind developments in renewable energy technologies but we are doing something wrong.  I am not saying the SEAI is doing something wrong but somebody is.  We are not getting it right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040900007#N00700","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397034900,"counter":1298,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Colreavy for those major points.

It is important we have a very detailed and wide debate around the issues.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is correct about the public concern about projects where there is uncertainty, such as the midlands export projects.  It seems there is a big question mark as to whether the projects will go ahead in the short term given the lack of an intergovernmental agreement.  We will know soon enough whether it is likely to happen.  If something does not move quickly, the projects will not be ready to deliver for 2020, which is the timeframe the directive envisages.  It is difficult to see where they are going.  People are right to question the benefits and financial gain from other projects.  That was the debate in the intergovernmental agreement.  I certainly heard the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, say he would not allow the projects to proceed without two conditions, first, that the financial benefit to Ireland is clear and significant and, second, that it is done right in terms of the engagement of the local community.  I think some people, through no fault of their own, ended up hearing or believing these projects in the midlands were steaming ahead, were ready to be built tomorrow and these giant turbines were about to be erected all around them, whereas in fact that was not the case and is still not the case.

I do not think it is a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.  The Minister has stated clearly what conditions are required.  If the companies have spent money on the ground, that decision is up to them, but whether they will get a return on it remains to be seen.  I take on board the thrust of the Deputy's point that there is an issue of trust.  Undoubtedly that has made wind energy more controversial.  As I have said a number of times, renewable energy is good for Ireland and it is a pity it has become such a questioned item.<br \/>The Deputy mentioned financial beneficiaries.  We, like all State bodies, have a board comprising people with different interests and expertise in this sector.  Like all State bodies, we manage that through very high levels of corporate governance, which is independently certified, measured and audited.  We manage any potential conflicts of interest.  I stand over all the advice, analysis and evidence we put forward.  It is robust and I am very happy to debate our numbers, conclusions and advice on its merits.  I very much treasure our independent status because that is our role in the landscape.  One hears economists saying they do not believe in wind energy but the point I make is that wind energy is good for Ireland.  We have measured it in tremendous detail and have looked at real data for Ireland.  When one hears people who argue otherwise, there are two common issues to be addressed.  People quote studies from other countries, but that is not valid because Ireland has a richer wind resource than other countries which makes wind energy cheaper and more effective.<\/p> <p>It is not relevant how much wind energy costs in Germany, in the United States or in any other country.  One must look at the real data from Ireland.<\/p><p> Electricity markets are complex.  Commentators quote subsidy levels and other such issues.  Wind energy is given a floor-price support to give it a certain amount of certainty.  When gas prices are high, as they are at present, that floor price is almost never hit which means the subsidy level to wind energy is very small.  We have modelled that in full detail, looking at full annual Irish energy data showing that wind energy is not adding to consumer prices in Ireland.  In fact, if anything, it is reducing them.  When one does the detailed real analysis for Ireland, that is what one finds.  Sometimes when one hears arguments being made, they are, maybe, using data from elsewhere or they are using simplified assumptions.  There is also a role for us to continue to fight the myths and to put out the facts as we find them in our research.<\/p><p> We do not really have any role in offshore oil and gas, and fracking, except to say the following on Deputy Colreavy's point about the role of fossil fuels.  I envisage an ultimate future where we get none of our energy from fossil fuels.  That has to be the ultimate goal, if nothing else, for reason of decarbonisation.  The question is: how long will it take to get there?  If we are to get there, we will have to exploit a range of renewable sources, including wind, bioenergy, solar, geothermal and offshore energy.  All of these will be important in the mix.  Some of them are not yet ready.  Some of them are starting to become ready and affordable.  I would certainly see a 100% renewable system as a long-term goal.  That has to be our ambition.<\/p><p> On Deputy Colreavy's final question about microgeneration, I have heard the same issues where some are having trouble getting connection.  Unfortunately, that is not really within our power, except to say we are working with Government.  We have done a lot of analysis on the costs and benefits of microgeneration.  I suppose sometimes the dilemma is, for example, in the case of wind, that a large wind farm will produce wind energy cheaper than a microgeneration scale one.  The question is: who bears that cost?  How does one quantify the additional local benefits, for instance, in terms of the benefit to the farmer or the local community?  That remains a challenge in all countries where there are economies of scale in this sector and sometimes bigger is cheaper, although not necessarily better.  That remains a policy issue.  I would like to see that debate taking place in the context of the new Green Paper because there are further opportunities for microgeneration in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040900008#O00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Motherway","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1397035500,"counter":1302,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Motherway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040900009#P00200","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1397035500,"counter":1303,"content":"<p>There are five members indicating and we will take them in two groups.

I would agree with most of my colleagues that the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland does a good job and has progressed considerably in the past few years.  I note Meath has benefited in four different areas from its projects last year.  Possibly, a lot that is good is not seen due to the negative talk at present, in particular, on wind turbines.<\/p><p>  Much ground has been covered by the other members.  On getting the message out, Dr. Motherway stated SEAI held a show last year and targeted businesses and it has different projects going on.  In the case of Joe and Mary living in their house on their own, he states some still do not know the kind of schemes SEAI has.  How is SEAI disseminating the message of what the individual home owner can avail of?  Is it through the local authorities?  He stated SEAI does a lot of work with them anyway.  How can SEAI build on that, as he stated?  The figures for Meath look quite low even compared to those for the rest of the counties.<\/p><p>  An issue that has been touched on here is the bills.  Consumers relate to their bill and whether it will go up or down.  We see that with the pylons where it is a significant issue, for example, in cost-benefit analysis.  How is SEAI communicating to consumers?  Earlier Dr. Motherway explained about the energy bills, that there are a lot of figures being thrown out about levies, these getting higher and the cost of renewable energy being subsidised by this.  This is also a matter of communication.  How is SEAI getting across to consumers that renewable energy is costing less?  I have sat in committee meetings or briefings where it was said it is costing more to use wind energy than any other type of energy.  It is a matter of communication.<\/p><p>  On offshore and tidal energy, Dr. Motherway stated SEAI is working on it.  Are we talking ten or 15 years, or how close exactly are we with that?<\/p><p>  I will touch again on wind energy because it is a significant issue, especially in Meath.  I note they are talking about an export project, but much of the work SEAI does with communities is being compromised by the lack of communication on the ground by some of these companies with which SEAI may not have any connection.  How is SEAI dealing with that because that is the biggest obstacle in moving forward?  I am in favour of renewable energy, I am in favour of wind energy but there are notices going round stating there will be 250 turbines in our area, and it scares residents and they run away from it.  How is SEAI tackling that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040900009#P00400","speaker":"1180"},{"type":"speech","time":1397035500,"counter":1305,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives from SEAI.  Returning to the two previous contributions, one aspect absent here is a bit of honesty about the opening of the interconnector between Ireland and Britain.  A person plugging in his or her kettle in Manorhamilton in County Leitrim could be just as easily using energy that is produced from a nuclear reactor in Sellafield or will be using energy from a nuclear reactor to be built in Somerset.  We need a bit of honesty in this.  If we do not want a wind turbine but we want an interconnector and we will rely on British nuclear energy to maintain our energy needs in the future, we need to be honest as policymakers.  If we are not going to have wind turbines or whatever, it is baloney to say that is fine, let us abandon all of our responsibilities, invest in a British nuclear reactor and import it from there now that we have the cable.  People need to speak up and be honest that it is an Irish solution to an Irish problem to export the problem and say let the British public worry about the fallout, if any, from a nuclear reactor in the south west of England but let us import our energy and pretend that we do not have a problem.  I do not accept that at all.  I do not think the public accepts it either and the public has wised up to politicians who come out with that kind of baloney.<\/p><p>  On sustainability of wind energy, one of the aspects I have often been interested in is the carbon footprint of the base of a wind turbine, that is, the amount of energy that goes into the production of cement that is used for the creation of a base.  There is a significant number of wind turbines in my area and I have seen the size of these bases, which are enormous.  I wonder has SEAI done an analysis on how long the wind turbine needs to turn at an optimum rate before it strips out the carbon footprint that created the foundation blocks in the first place.  If one has been out to a wind farm, as I am sure the SEAI representatives have, the bases of these turbines are massive and a significant amount of energy has to go into the cement factory that produces the cement in the first place.<\/p><p>  On what Deputy Coffey stated about stoves, there is a major anomaly in the implementation of SEAI's credit schemes.  I raised this with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, previously.  If Deputy Coffey and myself have two shops selling stoves side by side in Limerick but I also sell coal, briquettes, logs and turf legitimately, and Deputy McEntee comes in to me to buy a stove, I must ask her for her MPRN number.  Deputy Coffey, who is not selling coal, need not.  From whom does Dr. Motherway think the person will buy the stove?  This is a major problem and constituents have said it to me.  I relayed it to the Minister and I have probably related to SEAI as well.  That is placing an impediment in the way of consumers.  Dr. Motherway will state it relates to carbon credits but it does not matter where the stove is bought because once it is bought it will lead to an efficiency anyway.  We know how many stoves are sold in the country because the manufacturers can tell us exactly where they are sold, but it is unfair to place that impediment in the way of one group of retailers merely because they sell briquettes outside the door whereas it is not there for the other retailers.  It is something that should be looked at.<\/p><p>  On the insulation schemes, a great deal of the older housing stock, especially in rural areas, is built of mass concrete and one cannot pump the walls.  In some instances, one is limited because there are conservation officers and everybody else stating one cannot do this, that and the other.  I wonder would SEAI look at novel ways of addressing houses built of mass concrete and, in some cases, stone, which, occasionally, weeps.  Has it looked at that?<\/p><p>  I raised previously with SEAI the accreditation of the installation of the external wall insulation and ensuring that it does what it says on the tin.  It is not a small sum that the State is investing.  In fact, it is a significant labour activation measure as well.  I refer to those who are getting their walls insulated, be it with external wall or pumped insulation, or attic insulation.<\/p> <p>Given the amount of validation and security checking required, some of the legitimate operators are worried about groups in our society who look at insulation as a way of making quick buck.  The legitimate operators who have been upfront and meticulous in demonstrating to customers how their energy efficiency can be changed now find themselves competing with people who are only interested in drawing down the grant.  A mechanism is needed to weed out the latchicos from the genuine people.<\/p><p> In regard to Deputy Colreavy's comments on chicken litter, I am pleased to inform him that my constituency has the third largest number of chickens, after counties Waterford and Monaghan, is also at the forefront in developing the technology to convert chicken litter into energy.  I invite members and the SEAI to visit BHSL, which was born out of the closure of the old processing plant in Kantoher.  Perhaps Deputy Colreavy might like to visit the operation to observe how it converts farm litter into a renewable source of energy.  I welcome the witnesses contributions.  I acknowledge that SEAI is doing very good work but I can see opportunities for improvement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040900009#P00500","speaker":"1058","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1397036100,"counter":1307,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives and thank them for their presentation.  What role does the SEAI see itself playing in developing a microgeneration industry in this country?  In light of the benefits it can offer in the areas of sustainability, carbon emissions and community development, why are we still only discussing it as a possible proposal in the Green Paper?  I would expect the SEAI to take a lead role in developing a view on whether microgeneration has potential in Ireland.  Are we letting policy slip in this regard?  Perhaps the SEAI can play a proactive role in leading that debate.  Whether in wind, biomass, hydro or hybrid systems, there is huge potential  not so much for benefitting individual homes or businesses as for community gain.  Communities are kicking back against the large-scale projects currently under consideration.  They will not kick back against microgeneration solutions where they can see the direct benefits.<\/p><p>  I apologise for missing the earlier part of the witnesses' contributions.  What is SEAI's relationship with the Energy Regulator and how are its functions distinguished from the latter?  What is its relationship with the large energy companies?<\/p><p>  I congratulate SEAI on the warmer and better homes schemes and its champion based initiatives for communities and individual homes.  By and large, they have been very successful in offering better outcomes for individuals and businesses, generating employment and developing better energy products.  However, there have been problems with contractors.  Each of us has encountered customers who were less than satisfied with the standard of work carried out.  I regret to say that I have dealt with several cases which SEAI has been unable to resolve.  Perhaps they will ultimately be dealt with through a court process.  I am aware that SEAI has developed a resolution protocol but does it also provide a bonding or compensation mechanism?  If a contractor decides to liquidate a company and begin again under a different operating name, the consumer will be left exposed if the SEAI continues to recommend that contractor.  This is only happening in a tiny minority of cases but it needs to be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040900010#Q00200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397036100,"counter":1308,"content":"<p>Communication was a common theme in members' qusetions.  Deputy McEntee asked about our role in communicating on issues.  It is part of our mission to present facts and engage with communities and individuals.  That space is clearly crowded at present but we do our best to present facts and figures on how these measures can benefit Ireland.  We also go to considerable effort to communicate the benefits of our programmes and the opportunities they offer homes and businesses to reduce their energy costs.  Sometimes one meets with a business owner or manager who does not realise he or she can reduce the business's energy bills almost overnight.  Communication and awareness raising is a fundamental aspect of our work.  We are currently involved in advertising and local promotion of our schemes to encourage people to participate.  We welcome the role played by Members in terms of their local channels of communications because they are a trusted channel in local areas.  We are happy to provide them with leaflets or other material that can be distributed in newsletters because we value their support in this area.<\/p><p>  Deputy McEntee asked when tidal and offshore energy generation will be ready for production.  Tidal power generation is almost ready.  A company in County Louth, OpenHydro, has received a considerable investment from France and employs more than 100 people at its manufacturing site in Greenore to produce heavy engineering equipment.  However, there are relatively few sites in which tidal energy can be generated.  By contrast, wave energy is a much larger resource.  Deputy Feighan has been involved in work in this regard through the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  However, the technology is at least a decade away from being ready to make a contribution.  There will be opportunities for Ireland when the technology is ready, which is why we are building up skills among Irish companies, consultants and engineers.<\/p><p>  I take Deputy O'Donovan's point about our dependence on other countries' energy resources.  When people argue against constructing wind turbines, I like to ask them what they would propose as an alternative.  Are we going to spend our entire lives depending on fossil fuels?  Every year we send &euro;6.5 billion out of the economy to make other countries rich by buying their fossil fuels.  I do not think that is sustainable.<\/p><p>  On the carbon footprint of wind, I do not have the figures to hand other than to note that a considerable amount of concrete goes into gas, coal and nuclear generating plants, in addition to the carbon footprint of the gas and oil they consume.

There are many new wall insulation products coming out.  I take the Deputy's point that if one cannot pump the cavity, wall insulation becomes much more expensive and tricky in some ways.  I have this in my home.  We are examining different methods but some of it is down to luck regarding how one's home was built.  There are new technologies and the prices are coming down driven by volume.  Some four or five years ago external wall insulation was not happening in Ireland.  Now, because we grant aiding it, more of it is happening, more suppliers are coming in and costs are decreasing quickly.  That is part of the solution.<br \/>The Deputy raised accreditation and quality, which Deputy Harrington also raised.  We are trying to raise the quality of the small building retrofit market, which does not have a great reputation for quality.  Sometimes people are willing to do cash jobs and quick fixes.  Raising the standards of the market takes effort.  One must strike a balance where one sets quality and accreditation levels at a high enough level to raise the quality, but not so high that one is unfairly ruling people out.  Because our standards are uniform across the board, if one avails of an SEAI grant the contractor must meet standards regarding quality, qualifications, tax clearance and insurance, which relates to Deputy Harrington's point.<br \/>We insist on appropriate insurance for anybody working for our schemes.  There have been a small number of cases where a company has gone bust and, therefore, there is no redress for the homeowner.  We must continue to address that.  We have considered asking the market to develop a bond scheme similar to HomeBond.  Although we have not achieved it yet, it could have a role.

SEAI is in favour of microgeneration and has done analysis and published reports on both the technical opportunity for microgeneration and the economic case.

As I said earlier, microgeneration brings benefits that larger scale generation does not bring, but sometimes at a financial cost, and that is a policy question for policy makers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040900011#R01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Motherway"},{"type":"speech","time":1397036700,"counter":1324,"content":"<p>Has SEAI made recommendations on financial support to microgeneration schemes similar to the refit scheme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040900011#R01400","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1397036700,"counter":1325,"content":"<p>We have given a full and detailed analysis to the Department on what supports might be required and the levels at which they would have to be taken up.

It has been a lengthy meeting and their answers have been very detailed and excellent.<\/p> <p>That is much appreciated.  I am a Kerry Deputy and many of my constituents benefit from the better energy home scheme, which is operated out of Cahirciveen and is very important to the area.<\/p><p> I live in a coastal area and Ireland is an island nation surrounded by waves which can be ferocious at times.  Given that Scotland has companies such as Pelamis Wave Power, is there more potential for us in the future?  I know the technology is ever evolving and developing, but do the witnesses feel we could be doing more than we are doing on that front?<\/p><p> I agree with what has been said about the stoves.  I built a house five years ago with an open fireplace.  I installed a stove 18 months ago and the difference is phenomenal.  The savings for the amount of solid fuel used for a stove compared with an open fire are immense - I would say it is 80:20.  Could SEAI make some kind of effort in that regard?<\/p><p> Many people have benefited from home-insulation grants for attics and walls.  However, unless they qualify for the housing aid for older people schemes that the local authorities offer, they cannot get grants to upgrade their windows, as far as I am aware.  I have been in homes with single-glazed windows that are years old; the house is insulated to the maximum but the windows are single-glazed windows and people simply cannot afford to upgrade.  That might be the next step SEAI could consider.  It certainly would be a major boost to the window manufacturing and installation industry here and would support jobs.  It would definitely make sense from an insulation point of view.  Next to the roof, the windows and doors are the areas of highest energy loss - although the walls may be similar.  However, if they are insulated well, it is natural that the heat would escape through the windows.  Perhaps that could be looked at.<\/p><p> A person involved in the renewable energy sector asked me about biomass heating systems.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on potential grant aid for that in the future.<\/p><p> I understand the witnesses are aware of technology developed by the Kerry-based company, Ultimate Cell.  This is technology that reduces fuel consumption in mechanised vehicles.  Originally for regular cars, I now understand the company has developed the technology to apply it to HGVs and buses.  This is a very exciting development.  I have one of those devices in my diesel-powered car and I have noticed savings of approximately 10%.  If we could apply that to our national public transport fleet and make it readily available for people to apply to their own vehicles, we could make enormous savings in fuel importation which is a massive area of expenditure for the country.  Do the witnesses see potential in this and would they be willing to pursue it further?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040900011#R01800","speaker":"1051","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1397037300,"counter":1330,"content":"<p>Most of the issues I wished to raise have been covered.  What engagement does SEAI have with nursing homes?  We know the heating and electricity costs for nursing homes are huge and SEAI could engage with Nursing Homes Ireland and the voluntary sector.  I was happy to hear Deputy Coffey relate how he got the day centre over the line.  I was involved with a nursing home and when we tried to get SEAI to do something, we ran into bureaucratic obstacles.  There were questions about the structure of the nursing home and who owned it.  Given that it was a voluntary nursing home, it did not qualify in some way.  I ask the witnesses to consider how things could be made simpler.<br \/>On communications, I ask the witnesses to send something directly to us about the free service.  SEAI is to be commended on all the work it is doing.  From my experience, anybody who engages with SEAI has said it was positive.<br \/>Community resistance to renewable sources of energy is very unfortunate.  I have been dealing with wind generation for a long time and I believe we have probably hit a new low with the communities dead-set against it.  The positive message about what wind energy generation will do for our carbon credits and reducing our dependency on fossil fuels is lost on individual householders.  While their minds are not set against it, the message about climate change seems to have gone out of the whole debate.  It is all about aesthetics and everything else.  However, in the long run every one of us has a responsibility to do something in this area.  Each local authority has adopted a wind energy strategy, but there could be a different strategy across the border in the next county.  However, climate change does not know any borders, which seems to be the difficulty we have.  We certainly have a major challenge.<br \/>I would like to see SEAI's role developed in that national debate.  As the independent authority, it is in a position to get the facts out there because huge mistrust has crept into all this debate.  People think we are being developer-led again and they see no benefit for them, which is regrettable.<br \/>I return to the issue of the stoves.  I have been contacted by a number of local authority tenants who had an oil-fired central heating system installed.  Given that they are on very low incomes, they find it very hard to maintain the oil heating system.  The local authority seems to have adopted the policy that if a tenant has a particular heating system, that is a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.  We have had arguments with the local authority about installing wood-burning stoves, which is what the tenants want to do.  However, the tenants are not able to come up with the money to buy the stove and pay for its installation.  I am sure the local authorities would be able to carry out the installation, but that would come at a cost to them.  Can SEAI engage more with the local authorities about that?  It would be very beneficial to the tenants and lead to the kinds of energy savings we are trying to achieve.<br \/>Kilkenny County Council has advised the matter is being dealt with by the housing section of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.  However, it should probably also go to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The two Departments need to come up with a practical solution to the issue.  It seems quite simple.  SEAI could have a role to play in funding.  It would help many local authority tenants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014040900012#S00200","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1397037300,"counter":1331,"content":"<p>Engagement with local authorities was mentioned.

This sets out the approach and next actions in terms of moving forward.  There is an acknowledgement that Scotland has done some work in this area.  There is also an acknowledgement that this cannot happen without collaboration.  For example, for Ireland and Scotland to be able to work together would require a structured approach to the development of wave energy.  This would commence in test tanks, which we have in Cork,  and then move to the next scale in Galway.  Further testing would then be done in Scotland, ultimately coming back to Belmullet where we have the full force of the Atlantic.  Nobody is ready for that full force of the Atlantic yet.  Pelamis is currently considering stepping back to Galway, while others are considering going to Belmullet.  There is an opportunity for collaboration but as stated by Mr. Motherway, getting full commercial or large scale ocean farms may take a number of years.  The offshore renewable development plan brings the different Departments together on issues such as planning, grid, test sites, research, enterprise supports and infrastructure such off-coast ports and jetties.  This infrastructure is key in terms of supporting the industry.  In preparing for this over the next number of years, as per the approach set out in the plan, we are seen internationally as being in a very good space.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Ann Phelan's point in regard to communities, a number of nursing homes in Kilkenny have come together and submitted joint applications.  In terms of who is the champion, often it is a company that looks after heating upgrades and will bundle together the needs of the nursing homes in this regard.  That have been some examples of this.  We can engage with any of the nursing homes on how this can happen.  They can also partner with the energy suppliers and offer the credits for the work to be upgraded to the energy supply companies willing to manage and co-ordinate the projects.  There are different models available.  Nursing homes can come together, with one taking the lead on behalf of the others, in making an application to us.  It is not a case of one size fits all.  There are different models available, which is the benefit of the communities initiative.<\/p><p>  On Ultimate Cell in Kerry, this technology was on prominent display at our energy show this year.  We have been working on this with officials from Portugal.  We could look at this under the communities initiative and test and trial this technology with some of the transport companies.  For example, local authority transport companies could consider taking this technology on board.  Again, I encourage them to work with an energy supplier whereby these credits could be taken on board by an energy company.  We spotted the opportunity in this regard and have given the company some ideas in regard to collaboration.
