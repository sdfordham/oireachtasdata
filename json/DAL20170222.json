It seems that the previous Government sat on its hands over a two-year period.  Even though various plans went to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Transport Authority, nothing happened because nobody wanted to deal with these issues in the run-up to the 2016 general election.  In the aftermath of that election, the old management was cleared out.  The very aggressive approach that has now developed is putting the onus entirely on workers' terms, pay and conditions.  In my view, the objectives of this strategy, which is essentially driven by conflict, are to reduce the average bus driver's wages to &euro;32,000 or &euro;33,000 in one fell swoop and to achieve redundancies and other efficiencies.  In other words, the workers will have to bear the entire brunt of the savings of &euro;12 million that have been identified and are being sought by the company.<\/p>  <p>  The position and behaviour of management at the Labour Relations Commission on Monday was very provocative.  The ideological position of Fine Gael and the Minister, who hails from the same stable, is aligned to this strategy.  The Minister is engaging in classic Pontius Pilate behaviour by hiding behind the industrial relations fig leaf and refusing to engage.  He is privately comfortable with the undermining of this public transport company and the all-out assault on the terms and conditions of its workers.  I accept that efficiencies and reforms are needed.  I agree with that but I do not agree with a race to the bottom, which is what is actually going on.  I do not agree with the undermining of an important State bus company.  The last time we discussed this matter, I asked the Taoiseach to set out his position on it but he equivocated on the idea of supporting and maintaining a State transport company like Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It is interesting to note that the Luas and Dublin Bus disputes got sorted.  Was that because those companies are based in Dublin?<\/p><p>To hell with the regions and rural Ireland and let chaos prevail.  That is the message being sent in the contrasting way the various disputes have been dealt with.  The hands-off approach of the Minister, Deputy Ross, is ensuring that occurs.<\/p> <p> The basic question I have put to the Taoiseach is why it is not possible for the Minister, Deputy Ross, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to engage with the National Transport Authority, NTA, Bus &Eacute;ireann management and unions to work out the policy implications and issues that could contribute to a resolution of this particular dispute.  We should remember the public service subvention has been reduced from approximately &euro;45 million in 2010 to &euro;36 million in 2016 and the free travel contribution per passenger is approximately &euro;4.86 on the Expressway, with &euro;11.78 being the average fare on the service.  The policy matters and it is time for the Minister to engage on those issues with all the stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487765100,"counter":8,"content":"<p>It is very disappointing that talks have broken down and, potentially, there is a catastrophic position for hundreds of thousands of passengers if this spreads throughout the company.  The problem is on the Expressway service, which is a commercial service that is not subsidised.  The NTA representatives at the transport committee today are focusing on the financial position of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Of the passengers carried by the company, 81% are on routes that are subsidised under the public service obligation, PSO, contract that Bus &Eacute;ireann has with the NTA.  These services are fully remunerated by the NTA, and the subvention for PSO services by the NTA increased from &euro;24 million in 2014 to &euro;40 million in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  I have no equivocation about supporting a public transport system, as we have with Bus &Eacute;ireann carrying hundreds of thousands of passengers.  The difficulty lies with the commercial Expressway business and that must be addressed for the sake of the workforce in Bus &Eacute;ireann, including drivers and those who maintain the buses, and also the travelling public.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, is very anxious that the machinery of the State would be used, and all the other strikes mentioned by the Deputy have been settled around that table, as this one can and will be too.  The Minister has been in touch with the Minister for Social Protection in respect of the current funding levels for the scheme of subvention that is operated, with 81% of passengers carried on those routes.  As I stated yesterday, rumours of taking away the free travel system were completely and utterly false.<\/p>  <p>  There will be some further intense, difficult and complicated discussions before this is resolved and it will require direct engagement, one way or the other, between the management and unions.  The issues we have seen reported in recent days highlight the internal focus of the problems the company faces.  My understanding is the three routes mentioned were for discussion and no decision has been made.  There is one to Derry, one to Westport from Athlone and one to Clonmel.  They are important routes.  The NTA has pointed out that in the event that discussions continue and changes are made to the Expressway service, it will step in and provide connectivity for the public in those areas that would be affected by any change in the Expressway service by Bus &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this matter can be sorted out in the same way as all others.  It is complicated, difficult and tension-filled, but as the Deputy rightly points out, so many other awkward cases have been dealt with and settled through the machinery of the State.  I hope at this late stage that unions and management can get together again and work out issues.

There is a huge gap and a contribution that could be made.  There are avenues to be explored under the PSO obligations in terms of some of the routes.  The changes being demanded apply to far more than just the Expressway service.  They are more fundamental and broad-ranging.<\/p> <p> Given his ideological disposition, the Minister has deliberately stood back.

The management of Bus &Eacute;ireann announced measures that threaten the rights of bus workers and, most importantly, those of passengers, particularly people who live in rural Ireland.  By slashing overtime and Sunday rates and cutting pay, the management is forcing the issue to an industrial dispute.  The Taoiseach was well warned about it.  This race to the bottom in respect of workers' pay and conditions is unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Although the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport say rural Ireland is the Government's top priority, there is no evidence for that.  The Government has closed Garda stations, post offices, hospitals and other facilities.  It is attacking the public bus service in the same way Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats did when Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin was in government.  A huge number of people, particularly in rural Ireland, rely on Bus &Eacute;ireann.  They are the young, the old, the poor, rural dwellers and tourists.  The outworking of Government policy is that people who live in rural Ireland and who cannot afford a car or, for whatever reason, cannot drive, must stay where they are, even if it means they cannot access work, study, health care or a social life.<\/p>  <p>  The nub of the question is whether the Taoiseach believes public transport is a right and whether he believes rural dwellers have this right or not.  The Government believes in privatisation.  In that case, the profit motive will determine who gets a public bus service or a bus service at all.<\/p><p> Bus &Eacute;ireann is part of our vital infrastructure, especially in rural Ireland.  It is possible, with good management and by listening to transport users and workers, to create a service that will attract more people to use public transport.  That should be the Government&rsquo;s position.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, should ensure the future sustainability of Bus &Eacute;ireann as a public service.  He could take a number of decisions, including; a review of loss-making routes on which private carriers currently operate; a review of the number of private licenses issued on these routes; and an increase in funding for the free travel pass - the amount currently allocated covers just 41% of the cost of the average journey.  The Minister needs to provide clarity regarding routes and services including, as the Taoiseach said, the Dublin to Derry, Dublin to Clonmel and Athlone to Westport routes.  There is always, however, the get-out answer that the decision has not yet been made.  The Minister needs to engage immediately with all of the stakeholders to prevent serious travel disruption and a protracted industrial dispute.  His aim must be to ensure that together we find a way to protect, preserve and enhance our public transport network.  I again ask the Taoiseach to ensure that the Minister, Deputy Ross, engages with all of the stakeholders, including his own Department, the National Transport Authority, NTA, Bus &Eacute;ireann and the unions in order to find a resolution in respect of this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200005#C00700","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487766000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Deputy Adams raised a range of issues.  I again point out to him that the commercial end of Bus &Eacute;ireann is not subsidised by the taxpayer.  A total of 81% of passengers who travel by Bus &Eacute;ireann are availing of the public transport system that is subsidised, a subvention that was increased to &euro;40 million in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy says that nothing is being done about rural Ireland.  I fundamentally disagree with this point.  Not only have we drawn all the programmes together, there is, on a community basis, an opportunity for the vast majority of communities of small towns and villages to avail of benefits and opportunities under that programme.  The rural transport links scheme that applies not only services rural Ireland, it also brings people from their homes to towns and villages and back again.  There is always a consultation about the transport needs of every parish and community.  This is where the rural transport link is exceptionally strong.  Supports for rural Ireland include the programme relating to the development of IDA Ireland plants in different towns and villages throughout the State, the development of the hospitality sector, the retention of the 9% VAT rate, the abolition of the travel tax, the expansion of the lake land areas, the continuation of the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East initiatives and increased flights into the country.  All of these measures are important.<\/p>  <p>  On foreign direct investment, IDA Ireland has been directed that 135,000 of the 200,000 jobs to be created between now and 2020 should be located outside the greater Dublin region.  The NTA means what it says.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport this morning, the NTA pointed out - as it has done on many occasions - that if there are any changes arising from the discussions that must take place between management and unions regarding Bus &Eacute;ireann, it will, through its system, manage those changes in the context of connectivity for the public.  The essential point is that the Expressway system is a commercial system and is not subsidised by the taxpayer.  That is where the problem lies and it is the context in which it must be resolved.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, is anxious that this would happen; that union and management will sit down again - difficult though it may be - to work to resolve their differences.  Changes that arise from the Expressway system will be taken up by the NTA.  I do not accept Deputy Adams' assertion that nothing is being done.  In fact, more is being done for rural Ireland in so many ways.

That is the Taoiseach's legacy.  It is because he does not believe in the rights of citizens that he refuses to ask the Minister, Deputy Ross, to intervene in the Bus &Eacute;ireann dispute.

I said then that over recent months we had heard a lot of noise but little clarity about the future of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  What has now become clear is that the crisis is being used to slash the terms and conditions of front-line workers in Bus &Eacute;ireann.  A registered employment agreement - we restored those, if the Taoiseach recalls - is in place covering bus workers but that is now being ignored by management.  I believe management is trying to bypass the industrial machinery of the State.  It is open to the Government, in the interest of industrial relations and sectoral pay policy, to put in place a system of sectoral employment orders - the Taoiseach will recall we put that in place in legislation in our time.

Second, does he agree that no one - not the market, not the consumers and not the workers - benefits from a ruthless race to the bottom?<\/p><p> Third, will the Taoiseach accept that the members of this Government are not mere bystanders?

Does he agree, therefore, that he must at the very least ensure a common minimum acceptable floor with regard to the terms and conditions in this sector?  If he accepts that, will he agree, as a matter of belated but important action, that it would be a condition of public transport bus licences that the licensee would join representative employers in that sector who will negotiate common and fair terms and conditions?

I am especially proud to have retired Commandant Leo Quinlan, son of the late Pat Quinlan, as well as Jadotville veterans, Quartermaster Sergeant Michael Tighe and Corporal Tadhg Quinn, as my guests in the D&aacute;il today.<\/p>  <p>  Sadly, only 41 survivors from the siege of Jadotville are still alive today.  On behalf of the students from Galway community college, I appeal to the Taoiseach to award medals to the officers and NCOs, as recommended by Commandant Pat Quinlan in 1961 following 56 years of campaigning.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is no doubt aware of the fact that a 1965 military board considered the recommendation of Commandant Pat Quinlan that medals be awarded to eight or nine of his officers and NCOs who were under his command in Jadotville.  No medals were awarded and no one seems to know why.  Only recently, I learned that when that board met in 1965, it was not asked to consider the actions of the commander of the day, Commandant Quinlan.  Commandant Pat Quinlan should be considered for a medal of recognition of his outstanding military and tactical leadership in the field of battle.  The evidence is clear from his actions: Commandant Quinlan saved the lives of his men in his company.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the awarding of medals for members of the Defence Forces falls to a military board that reports to the Chief of Staff.  I believe that the time is right to ask the Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Mark Mellett, to appoint a medals board to review the awarding of medals of the solders of Jadotville.  In particular, such a board should review the awarding of a medal to Commandant Pat Quinlan.  Will the Taoiseach support the officers, NCOs and men from the siege of Jadotville, as well as their families, and ask Vice Admiral Mellett to convene the board as a matter of urgency?  Furthermore, will the Taoiseach commit to reporting progress to the House following his discussions with Vice Admiral Mellett?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200009#G00200","speaker":"1313"},{"type":"speech","time":1487767500,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Grealish for raising this, and I understand he has some of his colleagues with him in the House.

The board indicated that the issues raised had received consideration and that it was not prepared to alter its findings.<\/p>  <p>  On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the siege of Jadotville the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe, took the decision to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of A Company and issue a unit citation.  This was the first time that a unit citation was awarded within the Defence Forces to recognise formally the brave actions of these men.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, hosted an occasion in Custume Barracks in Athlone on 17 September last at which the unit citation was presented to the company in respect of its collective heroism and professional performance during the siege of Jadotville while cut off from support and reinforcements.  A specially commissioned insignia will also be provided to the members and the next of kin of deceased members of A Company in the coming weeks.  These are rewards that are used internationally by other military forces to recognise units that have served with particular distinction or heroism.  The Minister of State is satisfied that the award of a unit citation and the associated specially commissioned insignia properly honours the collective bravery of the men of A Company, 35th Infantry Battalion.<\/p>  <p>  On 19 December last, the Minister of State was in Renmore Barracks with Deputy Grealish and other Members of the Oireachtas and he met students of the fifth year history class of Galway community college.  He was impressed by the interest and knowledge of the students about the events at Jadotville in 1961.  Since then, the Minister of State has written to the students outlining his reason for awarding a unit citation and insignia as a means of formal recognition of the collective bravery and outstanding performance of the men of A Company.  I have a letter I received from Galway community college and I commend Alanna O'Reilly, Stefan Madalin, Wiktoria Gorczyca and Patrick Lenehan, on behalf of the fifth year students in Galway community college, on the way they wrote it.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Grealish made a particular point in respect of Commandant Pat Quinlan, his bravery and the fact his actions saved lives at the time.  I will have the matter examined.  I will talk to the Chief of Staff but I will not give the Deputy a guarantee.

For example, the number of cyclists in Dublin increased by 160% between 2004 and 2014.  Approximately 12,000 commuters cycle into Dublin city centre every day.  Cycling Ireland, which has seen a major increase in its membership from 6,000 members just five years ago to 28,000 members now, estimates that approximately 250,000 cyclists regularly use Irish roads.  All Irish road users are more than aware of the increased presence of cyclists, which is obviously a good thing from many perspectives.  Sadly, these cyclists are particularly vulnerable.  Twenty cyclists have been killed on our roads over the past 24 months.  This Bill seeks to create a minimum passing distance which motorists must observe when overtaking cyclists.  I propose to set this distance at 1 m in areas where the speed limit does not exceed 50 km\/h and at 1.5 m in all other areas.  We are setting out to create a safe space on our roads where cyclists can feel protected from passing traffic.  While most drivers give sufficient space to cyclists, a worrying number of them seem to have an attitude of &quot;no contact, no harm&quot;.  This kind of irresponsible driving behaviour is simply not acceptable.<\/p><p>Along with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Regina Doherty, I have been working closely with Mr. Philip Skelton, who is a committed road safety campaigner, to bring this Bill to fruition.  Mr. Skelton, who is in the Public Gallery, is the founder of the &quot;Stayin' Alive at 1.5&quot; campaign.  He has been working diligently for many years to raise awareness of the need for a minimum passing distance law in Ireland.  I am very grateful to him for his commitment to the campaign and for his extensive research into international best practice in this area.  Ireland needs to learn from the positive experiences of other countries.  To date, laws of this nature have been passed in France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, 28 states in the US, two provinces in Canada and five states and territories in Australia.  If we are serious about protecting cyclists on Irish roads, we should follow their good example.  This short Bill facilitates that by giving all cyclists, including children travelling to and from their local schools, members of families who go out for a Sunday spin and our future winners of international medals, designated space on our roads where they can feel somewhat safe and protected.  That is the very least they deserve.

The proposed amendments are in line with the recommendations made by the expert group on the review of the 2001 Act, which are yet to be fully implemented.  The Bill defines a voluntary patient as a person with decision-making capacity, aligns the principles of the 2001 Act with those of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and affirms that both voluntary and involuntary patients with decision-making capacity must give consent to treatment before that treatment is carried out.

The committee had received a large amount of evidence from NAMA and many other interested parties, including some from outside the jurisdiction.

Consider, for example, the volume of issues that go to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  It is extraordinary.  GSOC has almost become paralysed on foot of the volume of work it has on hand and its lack of resources and capacity.  One is obliged to wonder, in the context of the overall picture, what it is all about.  This volume of complaints must speak to something that is wrong with within our system.

People were saying the problem was \"Over there, and not over here\".  It is just bizarre that any State institution would have a view that it was fine because the potential wrongdoing was on the purchaser's side and not on that of the vendor, and that the issue would not need to be examined.

The Deputy previously suggested the establishment of a permanent inspectorate for public inquiries that would be professional, deal with issues in a timely fashion and have the experience to know which direction should be followed.  For his information, the proposal was considered by the Law Reform Commission in 2005 when it dealt with the report on public inquiries, including tribunals of inquiry.  I am open to the idea.  The Law Reform Commission made three points.  It said that, over time, an inspectorate's staff would become experienced in investigation and would be paid salaries rather than a daily rate, resulting in savings to the Exchequer.  Second, the office would have easy access to precedence and guidance on procedural issues.  Third, it would provide a one stop shop for those seeking information on inquiries.<\/p><p>The commission also listed some disadvantages.  Although there were a number on inquiries at the time, there was no guarantee that there would be a need for a similar body in the future.  The commission also said that public inquiries are, by their nature, <i>ad hoc<\/i>and their structure and personnel should reflect this.  Having weighed up the advantages and disadvantages, the commission did not recommend the establishment of a permanent standing inspectorate.  It did, however, recommend the establishment of a central inquiries office that would be charged with collecting and managing a database of records and information regarding public inquiries.  This would provide those charged with establishing and running public inquiries easy access to precedence, guidance on a wide variety of matters pertinent to their inquiry - including legislation - procedural issues, the drafting of terms of reference and administrative matters.<\/p><p>It should be borne in mind that the Law Reform Commission report was published in 2005, the year after the enactment of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.  Obviously, since then we have had a number of commissions of investigation.  Any decision to establish a permanent inquiries inspectorate or a central inquiries office would have to take into account the experience gained in the intervening period, as well as the Law Reform Commission's report and other relevant factors.<\/p><p>I would be open to having a rational discussion in the House about this matter.  Protected disclosures are flooding in and they are very complicated and complex.  Ministers have a duty and a responsibility for them, but cannot actually talk about them.  While other cases are to follow, many of the cases raised with me by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin a few years ago are still coming back in.  They were examined by senior counsel but people are still dissatisfied.  Perhaps the House should consider the idea recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  I may put this in train and see what will come of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200020#S00700","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"D&aacute;il Reform","time":1487773200,"counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200020#S00800"},{"type":"question","time":1487773200,"counter":175,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[7364\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200020#S00900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the status of the commitment in the programme for Government on political reform.","asker":"1283","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1487773200,"counter":176,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[8552\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200020#S01000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on commitments contained in the programme for Government in respect of political reform.

In December, the Government published a report on the programme setting out the progress made to date across all of Government on implementing the programme.  This is the first of many regular reports to be published in addition to the annual report which will be published in May following the Government&rsquo;s first year in office.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of D&aacute;il reform, this Government continues to build on the Oireachtas reform packages introduced by the previous Administration.  Implementation of A Programme for a Partnership Government requires a new relationship between the Government and Oireachtas.  This is reflected in significant D&aacute;il reforms that are being implemented, providing a significantly greater role for members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  These arrangements require greater collaboration and sharing of information by the Government with the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  Central to our approach for delivering on this ambitious programme is the concept of good faith and no surprises.  Following the general election in 2016 this Government, and the previous Government, played a crucial role in the process of D&aacute;il reform including the first election of a Ceann Comhairle by secret ballot, the selection of Oireachtas committee chairs under a d'Hondt system and the establishment of an all-party D&aacute;il reform committee, which has since made a number of recommendations.  Within my Department, there is an expanded role for the Chief Whip to support these arrangements including supporting good communication between Departments and the Oireachtas, particularly in terms of progressing Government legislation through the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  The new arrangements include more proactive communication between Ministers and their Departments and Opposition spokespeople and Oireachtas committee chairpersons and Members.  It requires greater sharing of information with the Oireachtas to inform its deliberations, for example through the new budgetary procedures, use of pre-legislative scrutiny by committees and more briefing on significant developments or issues.  There is a new D&aacute;il business management committee established to discuss and agree on the D&aacute;il schedule, more time for Private Members' business, new arrangements for Topical Issue motions and reformed structures for parliamentary questions.  These all require a new approach from Ministers and their Departments and the Government is committed to ensuring it works effectively.<\/p>  <p>  On Seanad reform, several steps were taken by the previous Government in relation to Seanad reform and we continue to progress this matter. The programme for a partnership Government commits to pursuing the implementation of the Manning report as a priority.  In response to a suggestion by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin last year, I have indicated that, provided there is all-party support for the Manning Report, the interim implementation body proposed in the report should be set up comprising members of all parties and groups in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  On foot of this, I wrote to party leaders, D&aacute;il groups and Seanad groups seeking agreement to the setting up of the implementation group and seeking nominees for same.  I understand the three groups have not yet responded yet.  I believe there is a bit of dispute over who should actually chair the group.

However, the biggest difficulty is getting answers from Ministers, either in the exchanges in the Chamber or as one goes about trying to make representations on behalf of constituents.  The Taoiseach cited the need for greater co-operation and greater information sharing with the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  I will give an example which I am sure matches the experience of all Teachta&iacute;.  I am fighting a case for a 42 year old adult with serious issues whose parents can no longer deal with this chap because he has such profound issues.  I made representations to the HSE, as other Deputies would.  The HSE sent back responses which are not adequate.  We then made representations to the Minister.  In this case, the Minister for Health referred it to the Minister of State with responsibility for people with disabilities, and we got an answer saying he has referred it back to the HSE.  That is the universal experience.  In another case, a five year old boy has only had two one-to-one speech therapy sessions despite the fact this child could be helped greatly if he got this therapy in a timely way.

Imagine the family who are beside themselves trying to get respite care and other care for a 42 year old adult or, on the other side of the scale, the parents of that five year old boy.  That is the reality.  It is not just an issue when I talk to the Taoiseach every so often.  It is an issue in their lives every single day.

Some Deputies will table a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health and get an answer from the HSE, and the paper trail goes around, but the Deputy still does not have the answer he or she might get through a phone call or a direct discussion with whoever might be in charge.

This represented an increase of over 9% on the year before and demand continues to be very strong so far this year.  Notwithstanding these pressures, renewal applications submitted through Passport Express continue to be processed within the 15 working day target.  Some categories, however, such as first-time applicants, take longer because of additional anti-fraud measures.  For example, first-time applicants are advised to allow 20 working days; the current turnaround time is 19 working days.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will readily appreciate, it is very important that citizens use the right channel when applying for a passport.  There have been a number of cases in recent times where applicants have used Passport Express despite their travel plans falling within the processing period for their passport, and I know that people in this category frequently contact my office and those of other Deputies.  Where applicants are travelling in less than 15 working days, the best course of action is to make an online appointment at the Passport Office in Dublin or Cork.  There are a limited number of appointments available daily in both offices.  I appreciate the assistance of Members of these Houses in promoting good practice as regards the Passport Office and I would like to thank the Deputy in this regard.  This week, I will again circulate a note on good practice to all Members of the Houses.<\/p>  <p>  Significant customer service improvements that are being rolled out as part of the passport reform programme will assist in managing growing demand.

The passport service through the Minister's Department employed additional clerical officers last year to deal with the spike around summer time, which is understandable.  All of those were let go before Christmas and now we are employing them again.  I put it to the Minister that we have to prepare in a post-Brexit Ireland because the level of applications being submitted will continue to increase.  Employing temporary clerical officers in the passport office, letting them go and continuing that cycle is not a long-term solution.  The passport service needs to revisit the turnaround time issue and republish those because as we approach the summer months and the holiday period, thousands of holiday makers and people who wish to go on business trips will be disappointed, as we have seen already.

However, I would remind the Deputy and the public that all applicants should carefully check the validity of their passports, and in particular those of their children, and then choose the correct mode of application because there have been a number of pressure points in recent times.

Minimising the impact on trade and the economy is a key priority for the Government in the forthcoming Brexit negotiations.  From our perspective this means, as the Taoiseach stated, that the best possible outcome in the negotiations is the closest possible economic and trading relationship between the European Union and the UK.<\/p><p>Every county in Ireland will be impacted by Brexit, including County Wexford which has significant trade and passenger traffic to the island of Great Britain and to continental Europe.  Consequently, the Government's preparation for the forthcoming negotiations has been extensive.  Responsibility for the strategic oversight of Brexit rests in the Department of the Taoiseach, and preparations for this next phase are co-ordinated through the dedicated Cabinet committee which the Taoiseach chairs and which has met six times since its formation.  Within my Department, a team of experienced senior officials both in Dublin and abroad is preparing intensively for the complex negotiations.<\/p><p>Brexit is an all-of-Government issue and each Minister and Department has an important role to play.  To date the Government's approach is to analyse on sector basis rather than county by county.  However, as this process advances and in particular as work progresses on a future EU-UK relationship, county level analyses may be required to complement this sectoral work.  In this regard, an analysis of County Wexford would be important.<\/p><p>That said, regional issues have fed in to the extensive analytical work undertaken to date, not least under the framework of the all-island civic dialogue process.  Fourteen sectoral dialogues have been hosted by Ministers in a range of locations throughout the country.  More than 1,100 industry and civic society representatives have participated in the events.<\/p><p>In addition, work by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has identified the maintenance of funding for INTERREG programmes as a priority issue.  The Ireland-Wales INTERREG programme, which covers County Wexford among other parts of the country, is one of three EU-funded cross-Border programmes involving Ireland and the UK.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>The programme has a total value of almost &euro;100 million over the period 2014 to 2020.<\/p><p>As part of its contingency planning for Brexit, the risks to the cross-Border programmes, which are 85% funded by the EU, were identified by the Department.  I am pleased, therefore, that following intensive discussions with the Welsh European Funding Office and the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland, agreement was reached at the end of October on a safeguard clause that has enabled funding agreements to be put in place and letters of offer to issue for these programmes.  <\/p><p>The Government's strategy of outreach with EU partners and institutions in advance of the Brexit negotiations has included engagement with the French Government.  Shortly after the referendum last year, the Taoiseach welcomed French President, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande to Government Buildings for a bilateral meeting, and I travelled to Paris for discussions with my counterpart Foreign Minister Ayrault in December.  Today, I welcomed Foreign Minister Ayrault to Iveagh House where we had a further exchange which focused largely on Brexit.  Since the referendum, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs has also twice met the French Europe Minister, Harlem D&eacute;sir.  Feedback to date from this comprehensive engagement has been very encouraging.<\/p><p>Maintenance of the common travel area, CTA, arrangements between Ireland and the UK is a priority for the Government.  At their meeting in Dublin on 30 January, in which I participated, the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, reaffirmed their joint commitment to maintaining the CTA and to continuing the two Governments' work in this regard.  I also discussed the impact of Brexit with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in my meeting with him last Tuesday, 14 February.  Contacts are ongoing with the UK Government through our Embassy in London.<\/p><p>As we move towards the negotiation phase, I remain confident that, given the extensive work which has been undertaken to date, Ireland will be prepared and ready to protect and defend the best interests of all of Ireland and Irish citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200026#Y00700","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1487776800,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I appreciate that Brexit will affect the entire nation and we need an all-nation approach to it.

It is important to recognise the fact that in 2016 alone, 181 irregular migrants were detected on the central Mediterranean route.  The vast majority of these people reached Italy, which has reported an 18% increase in arrivals.  This is a very challenging issue and it is important to note the vast majority of these migrants are unlikely to meet the criteria allowing them to qualify for refugee status.  In the first instance, we should look towards achieving political stability in Libya.

I did deal with the issue of Brexit, particulars of which we probably have already discussed.<\/p>  <p>  On the current political situation in Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State and I shared the view that it was of the utmost importance that the conditions would be in place for a power-sharing Executive to be established as soon as possible following the Assembly elections next month.  I emphasised to the Secretary of State that as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, both Governments had a role to play in supporting the effective operation of the devolved institutions and in upholding both the letter and the spirit of the agreement as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  I also discussed with the Secretary of State last week the imperative of dealing with the range of issues related to the legacy of the Troubles in a way that meets the needs and expectations of victims and survivors and of wider society through the comprehensive legacy framework provided for under the Stormont House Agreement.  I reiterated my determination that this be established at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding engagement with the political parties in Northern Ireland, I have in recent months been in regular contact with the leaders of each of the main parties as the crisis in the Executive has deepened.  I met last month with the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, a Sinn F&eacute;in delegation led by Martin McGuinness and spoke by phone to the leaders of the SDLP, UUP and Alliance Party.  I also had the chance to hear from and engage with members of Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP and the Alliance Party at last week's civic dialogue plenary meeting in Dublin Castle and at the successful sectoral dialogue on human rights in Maynooth university last week.  The Taoiseach has also been actively engaged and was in direct contact with the British Prime Minister, as well as with the leaders of both the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p>  <p>  I have agreed with the Secretary of State that both Governments should continue to work closely together in the weeks to come, looking ahead to the post-election period when a new power-sharing Executive will need to be formed.  We have also urged the parties to conduct their election campaigns in a calm and respectful way, conscious that polarising rhetoric and frayed relationships will damage the prospects of forming an Executive after the votes have been counted and the results announced.<\/p>  <p>  We must all be mindful that effective devolved Government, underpinned by a genuine spirit of partnership, is what the people of Northern Ireland voted for in 1998 and what they expect their politicians to deliver.  After the election, it will therefore fall to the parties to form a power-sharing Executive, and this will require the parties to find a way forward on issues which contributed to the calling of the election in the first instance.  The Government is always ready to support and assist the parties in any way we can.  Our commitment as a co-guarantor of the agreement is a constant one.<\/p>  <p>  I assure Deputy Darragh O'Brien that I specifically raised the issue of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  I acknowledge the fact I go to these talks, discussions and meetings fully armed and conscious of the D&aacute;il motions on this issue that have been passed, in particular the motion of 25 May last year following 42nd anniversary of the bombings on 17 May.  I assure the Deputy that I will continue to raise this issue.  I will continue to engage directly on the matter of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and pursue all possible avenues to achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the mandate given to me being in the form of a request by the D&aacute;il.  I hope we can bring some measure of closure to this.  I have not only raised and discussed this issue regularly with the Secretary of State since his appointment last summer but I can tell the House that there have been regular meetings at official level between my officials and the officials of the Secretary of State with a view towards coming back with an element of progress that I am sure everybody in the House wishes to see advanced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200028#AA00100","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1487778000,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I will take supplementaries from the Members present who tabled questions to which the Minister can give a composite response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200028#AA00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1487778000,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that update and also for raising the matter of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.

Accordingly, I share the concerns expressed by other EU partners regarding this development.<\/p>  <p>  I have noted the clarification issued by the Embassy of the United States in Dublin on 31 January 2017, to the effect that the executive order in question does not restrict the travel of dual nationals to the United States, so long as they hold the passport of an unrestricted country and possess a valid US visa, if required.  The US courts have since intervened and imposed a suspension on the implementation of the executive order.<\/p>  <p>  Both the executive order of 27 January and the question of immigration reform in the United States were high on the agenda for my visit to Washington, D.C. from 31 January to 2 February last.  I had a number of engagements with the Administration and congressional leaders, including the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, the House Majority Leader and the House Minority Leader among others.<\/p>  <p>  In my meetings with congressional leaders, as well as with the now former US National Security Adviser, General Flynn, I expressed Ireland's deep concerns with regard to the nature and impact of the executive order of 27 January.  In response, General Flynn outlined to me the rationale in terms of US immigration policy for these temporary measures while I pointed out their damaging consequences in humanitarian terms, as well as for the international reputation of the United States.  <\/p>  <p>  Achieving relief for the undocumented Irish citizens in the US and securing greater legal pathways for migration to the US remain key objectives for the Government.  These priorities featured in all of my meetings in Washington D.C., including with General Flynn, Speaker Ryan and other congressional leaders. <\/p>  <p>  Both the Administration and Members of Congress are fully aware of the importance of this issue for Ireland and appreciate our strong and continuing interest in securing immigration reform.  The Taoiseach's forthcoming visit to Washington, D.C. for St. Patrick's Day, which is now widely welcomed in the House, will provide a key opportunity to raise the issue of immigration reform, especially the plight of our undocumented, directly with the US Administration at the highest level.<\/p>  <p>  During my visit, I also met members of the Irish community in Washington, D.C. and reassured them as to the Government's commitment to immigration reform.  I emphasised that while the political context in Washington may have changed, the Government's objectives remain constant, namely, relief for the undocumented and finding greater pathways for legal migration to the United States of America.  I noted that we can only advance these objectives if we engage fully and articulate our views with the key decision makers in the Administration and in Congress.  In addition to these contacts at political level, the embassy in Washington and our consulates across the United States continue to work with Irish immigration centres on a daily basis in providing support to Irish citizens in the US.  <\/p>  <p>  Our ambassador to the US held a workshop with key immigration stakeholders in the Irish community, from across the United States at the embassy on 12 January last.  Ambassador Anderson and her team remain fully engaged.  The Government and my Department are committed to providing practical support to undocumented Irish citizens in the US while also continuing to advocate for immigration reform.  I acknowledge the work, commitment and engagement at every level of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, who is today on diaspora duties outside the jurisdiction. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200030#CC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1487779200,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that outline.

While I believe the Taoiseach should go to America, I suggest he should carry with him the strong voice of this D&aacute;il, which does not agree with what President Trump is saying.  A report produced by Amnesty International refers specifically to the politics of demonisation, which shamefully peddles a dangerous idea that some people are less human than others and thereby strips away the humanity of entire groups of people.  While the undocumented Irish are extremely important and near to my heart - I welcome the questions about them - the importance of this issue and this policy extends beyond Irish people in America and goes to the heart of what we want the Taoiseach to tell President Trump.  It is simply not acceptable to ban people based on race, religion or a decision made on a whim by an American President.  Since the suspension of the initial order, the US Administration has brought in a new executive order, which is equally worrying in respect of the undocumented Irish and all the other undocumented people in America.  The Minister should familiarise himself with it.

We fund several organisations that provide a range of services in the US.  I acknowledge the recent changes in respect of the J1 visa programme, which has been tremendously successful and has formed a strong basis of our relationship with US Administrations over the past 50 years.  Almost 150,000 Irish third-level students and young people have participated in the programme over the years.  Following an announcement that was made last week, an additional 2,600 J1 places will be made available this year.  I have discussed at the highest level the need to explore a number of pathways and options that may be available to secure relief for the up to 50,000 undocumented Irish people in the US.  It is important that every avenue and every opportunity is pursued.  My understanding is that there may well be an initiative in the US towards the end of this year.

I do not believe an adequate investigation was carried out by the Garda at the time of the murder.  I want the Garda to carry out a further examination.

This might have allowed people to meet to agree their statements before those statements were made to the Garda.  The DPP has confirmed that Kieran was killed by stabbing on the stairs in the dwelling but his body was found outside in an open area.  Clearly, many of the events on the night have not been adequately explained and further examination is needed.  That is why I am calling on the Minister to make a statement.

According to the post mortem on Kieran, he died as a result of a single stab wound.  He had been to the dwelling where he was stabbed earlier in the night.  He knew the people who were present in the dwelling, including the person who allegedly inflicted the fatal stab wound.  A number of men were present at this dwelling.

We remember that legislation going through the House.  Like the members of Kieran's family and their solicitor, as a local Deputy I am very concerned about this decision.  The 2011 Act provides that someone can use force against another person if \"he or she believes the other person has entered or is entering the dwelling as a trespasser for the purpose of committing a criminal act\" and \"the force used is only such as is reasonable in the circumstances\" to protect himself or herself or his or her property or to prevent the commission of a crime.

The T&aacute;naiste is aware of the reports surrounding this tragic case and sympathises greatly with the family and friends of Kieran Monahan.  I am sure everyone in this House is conscious of the very serious impact of violent crime on victims and their families.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste is advised by the Garda authorities that the incident in question was the subject of an investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2012.  A file was then submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, who directed that there be no prosecution in this case.  The Deputies will appreciate that criminal investigations are properly dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the first instance and that the T&aacute;naiste has no role in particular investigations.  It must be also stressed that the DPP is an independent body, which makes decisions as to whether a person should be prosecuted and for what offence.  Whereas the T&aacute;naiste appreciates the ongoing distress of family and friends in the aftermath of this tragedy, it is not open to her to intervene in regard to the DPP's decisions in individual cases.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that there is provision to allow for certain people, including a victim's family, to seek reasons for a decision made by the DPP.  I understand that details of the procedures in this regard are available from the office of the DPP.  This tragic case highlights the trauma and damage that can occur where knives are used in dispute situations.  There is a robust legal framework in place on the illegal use of knives.  Under the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the maximum penalty for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority was increased from one to five years.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has an extended power of search without warrant regarding knives and offensive weapons.  It should be noted, however, that many incidents involving knives occur in domestic settings and on the spur of the moment, which increases the challenges for preventative policing and enforcement.<\/p>  <p>  At an operational level, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na proactively targets public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including knife-related crime, through the strategic deployment of Garda resources.  In this regard, detective units and divisional crime task forces may be utilised to provide a high-visibility presence in areas such as late night bars to deter and detect possible altercations.  Finally, the accelerated programme of Garda recruitment underlines the Government's commitment to tackling all forms of criminality and providing communities with visible and effective policing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200032#EE00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1487780400,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the response from the Minister of State, which does not deal with the issue at all.

It was quite shocking as we learned for the first time that it was the intention of the Mental Health Commission to de-register the psychiatric unit in University Hospital Waterford and completely close it down.  It is the psychiatric acute unit for the counties of Wexford and Waterford.  The new determination of the Mental Health Commission was to reduce the number of acute beds from 14 to six.<\/p>  <p>  I will give some brief background.  In 2010, following the closure of St. Senan's Hospital in Enniscorthy in accordance with A Vision for Change, the acute psychiatric services for County Wexford, except for its very north, were added to the acute psychiatric service for Waterford and provided in Waterford.  The 14-bed unit had caused deep concerns over recent years as being inadequate.<\/p><p>The letter from the Mental Health Commission states that serious concerns remain as to the safety, health and well-being of residents in the approved centre and that it is quite clear that the current unit is not fit for purpose.  While this may well be the case, the notion that there would be only six acute beds available for the counties of Waterford and Wexford is wholly unacceptable.  In a letter received by me and, I presume, other Deputies yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, to whom I wish a speedy recovery, indicated that an appeal would be lodged.  However, the appeal must be determined by next Friday.  If not, the unit will be reduced to six beds as and from next Wednesday.  It is unacceptable.<\/p> <p> Will the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, indicate in very clear terms what provision will be made for acute patients beyond next Wednesday, assuming the ruling of the Mental Health Commission stands?  The letter I received yesterday aggregated acute and sub-acute beds and referred to 36 beds.  I am focusing exclusively on acute beds, which are to be reduced from 14 to six, which is wholly unacceptable and will cause consternation among all the population of Wexford and Waterford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200032#EE01000","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487781000,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I, too, have a copy of the Mental Health Commission's leaked report which considers a number of options, one of which is to deregister the entire unit at University Hospital Waterford, which would be inconceivable.

I was suffering from chest pains and was having a severe panic attack.  I was seen by a psychiatrist but I was informed that due to a shortage of beds I could not be admitted.

How is it allowed that people with suicidal ideation are turned away without adequate supports?  I would have gladly sat on a glass floor rather than being sent home.  I was left at home and suffered multiple panic attacks since.  Do those in authority understand what it is like to suffer from mental health issues?

The current system is already under pressure and patients are being turned away from the hospital.  I have received late night calls from people who have been asked to travel to Cork because the services were not available in Waterford.  I have received responses to parliamentary questions to the Minister for Health informing me that key psychiatric posts in the hospital have not been filled.  This is adding to the pressures.<\/p><p>Will the Minister of State confirm that the possibility of the unit being deregistered is not on the table?

Now we have learned that we could lose up to eight beds.  It is unacceptable and wrong.<\/p>  <p>  The 14 acute beds in the psychiatric department covering Waterford, Wexford and part of the south east has a catchment area of approximately 300,000 people.

The practice of admitting people suffering from mental health issues to emergency departments must end.  Mental health spending is allocated year to year.  It is obvious it is not working.  We need a multiannual plan in order that our mental health services can be developed with certainty and we do not see a recurrence of this.

Why are children being put into adult units?  Where are the out of hours services for children and adults?  Where are the crisis houses?  None of these exists, yet we are going to close the only outlet, which is access to hospital units.  We must increase, not decrease, services.  I expect a clear response from the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200033#FF00400","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1487781000,"counter":361,"content":"<p>It is unfortunate the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, cannot be here but she was taken ill suddenly last night.  She has been released from hospital and is at home.<\/p><p>The Government has been strongly committed to improving all aspects of mental health services since 2012.<\/p><p>Approximately &euro;140 million has been added to the HSE mental health budget, which now totals &euro;851 million.<\/p> <p> I will now turn to the provision of acute psychiatric care in counties Wexford and Waterford.  The acute mental health unit at St. Senan's Hospital, Enniscorthy, County Wexford, was amalgamated with the Waterford mental health services in 2010.  This now provides a 44-bed acute inpatient mental health unit at University Hospital Waterford.  The department of psychiatry in University Hospital Waterford provides inpatient assessment, treatment and care to service users living in the Wexford area.  Service users who live in north Wexford, who attend Tara House mental health services in Gorey and who require acute inpatient admission have access to Newcastle Hospital, Greystones, County Wicklow.<\/p> <p> To ensure that each mental health facility is fit for purpose, the Mental Health Commission is charged with visiting and inspecting every approved mental health centre at least once a year.  On 3 February 2017 the Mental Health Commission notified the HSE that following a number of inspections during 2016, it proposed that the department of psychiatry at University Hospital Waterford would be registered as an approved centre, with conditions.  Primary among these conditions was that the number of beds be reduced.  As Deputy Howlin stated, the HSE has until Friday, 24 February to make representations to the commission to either modify or remove those proposed conditions based on evidence that University Hospital Waterford is or will be compliant with the regulations to which the proposed conditions relate.  The HSE intends to request that the commission does not, as a condition of registration, require it to reduce the number of beds in Waterford.  Under section 64(6)(b)(iii) of the Mental Health Act 2001, the commission can specify the maximum number of residents in an approved centre or within an area of an approved centre.  In this instance, that is proposed because in the view of the inspectors there is insufficient space for the total number of residents, there is a lack of dining, recreational and quiet spaces for residents and the previously proposed programme of works would not have addressed these issues.  Taken together, these issues pose a risk to service user safety.  The HSE will make representations to the commission before 24 February detailing how the HSE intends to address these issues, including a revised programme of works and associated timelines.<\/p> <p> The HSE will outline how, on balance, a bed reduction is less safe for the service user population of the community health care organisation region CHO 5 than maintaining the current bed base, with the controls and improvement plans to be provided.  Bearing in mind all the circumstances, I am confident that the HSE and University Hospital Waterford will resolve the issues raised by the commission.  The Department will, however, continue to closely monitor the issues raised by the Mental Health Commission, in conjunction with the HSE, to ensure that the necessary corrective actions will be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200033#FF00500","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487781600,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I regret to say that the Minster of State has not given factual information to the House.

Bizarrely, the commission's recommendation is to close the unit or dramatically reduce the numbers there, with no consideration given to people who have mental health issues and who need the services of that unit right across the region.  Rather than looking at closing or reducing the services, the Minister and the Government should be focusing on increasing the capacity, which the Mental Health Commission has said is not there.  Where are the therapists?  When are the vacant psychiatric posts going to be filled?  How is the Minister going to increase the physical space for recreation areas and quiet rooms?

In February 2015 the previous Administration made available &euro;150 million for property solutions for the regions.  It was something I was very supportive of and I understand there simply cannot be a major advance factory or major IDA investment in every town and village.  However, every constituency should certainly be given the prospect of some expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  I found out the fund was being made available to Waterford and I can understand the logic of this as Waterford is the largest urban area in the south-east region.  I then received information that funding was going to Carlow-Kilkenny, which is a five-seat constituency.  Again, I can understand funding going to the northern perimeter of the region to try to get jobs out of the greater Dublin area, for example, back-office jobs.  However, to my very great disappointment, I was then told the funding would revert back to Waterford for the next expenditure from that fund for the south-east region.  This is just not acceptable.  It means that funding has gone to the four-seat constituency of Waterford, then to the five-seat constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, then back to Waterford, while leaving out Wexford exclusively.  Wexford is a large five-seat constituency and one of the largest counties in the country, with 150,000 people.  It is not fair.  I have said in this House, and in the other Chamber when I was there, that I am okay with getting a fair share but I am not at all okay with not getting a fair share.  On this occasion, it is not happening.<\/p>  <p>  The number of IDA foreign direct investment visits has been in low single digits in recent years.  In the first six months of one recent year, there were just three visits.  At the same time, I can understand there only being three visits because there is no premises available, although there is some land in the IDA industrial estate in Wexford town - I think it is three acres, in a county the size of Wexford.  Again, I am not looking for anything we are not entitled to.  I am looking for what we are entitled to, which is to get some shake of what is available.  That is not happening.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200035#HH00700","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1487782200,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy D'Arcy for raising this issue.  I know he has a particular interest in ensuring Wexford gets its share of jobs.  I apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, who was unable to attend due to a prior diary commitment.<\/p>  <p>  I think it would first be useful to set out some information on the aims and operation of the IDA regional property programme.  As Deputies may be aware, this initiative was launched in February 2015 by the Government and it is being delivered by the agency over a five-year period up to 2019.  The fundamental aim of the programme is to allow the IDA to invest in property solutions that will serve to attract further foreign direct investment opportunities and win additional projects for the regions outside Dublin and Cork.  In practical terms, this means equipping the IDA with the means to improve existing business parks and acquire and service suitable sites.  The programme also entails the construction of advance facilities, which can be marketed to prospective investors, in areas of the country where the private sector has been slow to build.  The availability of such advance facilities is an important part of the programme and 30% of the total funding available has, therefore, been allocated towards their construction.<\/p>  <p>  To answer Deputy D'Arcy's point as to why Wexford was not included, it is important to point out that IDA Ireland, in determining the most appropriate sites for these facilities, has applied a set of key criteria.  These include the following: the population density of the area in the question; the nature of other commercial activity and investment in those surroundings; the proximity of third level educational institutions, given their importance as effective feeders of employees for new companies; and the availability of local infrastructure than can support and foster further development in the area.  It was on this basis that nine locations were selected for facilities at this particular stage, including Sligo, Athlone, Tralee, Galway, Limerick, Castlebar, Dundalk and Waterford.  Facilities at six of these locations are due for completion this year and the remaining three, including Waterford, are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2018.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to point out the advance facilities, although important, form only part of the IDA's regional property offering and the agency has other tools at its disposal to help attract investment to the regions.  In respect of Wexford, for example, the IDA has two business parks, one in Wexford Town and one in Enniscorthy, both of which the agency&rsquo;s officials are intensively marketing in order to attract new investment.  Furthermore, the IDA holds a further 1.8 hectares of land at Drinagh which it hopes to be the home of future investment.  We should not forget that arguably a more efficient way to increase FDI in regional locations is deepening and strengthening engagement with client companies that are already there.  In other words, where there is foreign investment, it is vital to consolidate this in order to increase the footprint of such companies.  We note that IDA statistics are clear that approximately 70% of all new FDI comes from existing clients.<\/p>  <p>  Wexford is home to 17 existing IDA Ireland clients which, between them, employ almost 2,630 people in a range of manufacturing and service operations.  There is potential to increase the size of this existing FDI footprint and that is why IDA Ireland is constantly engaging with these client companies to explore the potential for further investment.  This approach has already borne fruit and in 2016 client companies already present in the county increased their employment numbers by almost 150 positions.<\/p>  <p>  I want to conclude by emphasising the Government is committed to regional development all across Ireland, including in Wexford.  The regional property programme is an important and useful tool but the IDA will continue to pursue all options and avenues to help win further FDI for Wexford, the south-east and Ireland as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200035#HH00800","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1487782200,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I think it is important to add some information to the Minister of State's script.  While he is correct there is an IDA business park in Enniscorthy, there is no land available because it is full.  I also want to correct myself as I said there was 3 acres of land whereas it is 4.5 acres.  However, if a major client wanted to come to Wexford, it could not do so because that land is not available.<\/p>  <p>  The issue is that if a new company is preparing to invest, either land or a premises must be available.  I am fine with the investment in the towns the Minister of State outlined, namely, Sligo, Athlone, Tralee, Galway, Limerick, Castlebar, Dundalk and Waterford, and also that the next funding is being prepared for Carlow.  However, subsequent to that, the funding will go back to Waterford, which is not fair.  The IDA has made it very clear it is going back to Waterford but it has an obligation to County Wexford as well as County Waterford.  Given the Government had made funding available, I do not believe the IDA can just exclude a county in the manner in which it is currently excluding Wexford.  I ask the Minister of State to address that specific point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200035#HH00900","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1487782200,"counter":380,"content":"<p>The information I have in regard to the business site at Drinagh is that it is 7.5 acres and it is available for marketing.  I want to highlight a point I referred to in my first contribution, namely, 70% of new jobs are created by existing clients.<\/p><p>That is an important statistic.<\/p> <p> Wexford is very strong in the medical-technology, medtech, sector.  Ireland's medtech sector is on a par with those in Minnesota or Germany.  We are very strong in that area.  It is not all about IDA Ireland jobs.  It is about Enterprise Ireland jobs also.  Enterprise Ireland is doing an excellent job in that regard.  There are 17 foreign direct investment, FDI, companies in Wexford, many of them in the medtech sector.  The number of indigenous small industries that can come out of those foreign direct companies speaks for itself.  Employment in the south east increased by 4.6% last year.  IDA Ireland had a very strong year last year, which saw all regions experiencing growth.  <\/p> <p> I am familiar with what Deputy D'Arcy is talking about in the Wexford-Waterford area.  Wexford has its strengths.  The Deputy spoke about site visits.  He is correct.  There were very few site visits in 2012; I believe there were only three.  Last year, there were seven site visits.  IDA Ireland's team in the south east is marketing Wexford equally as much as Waterford but he must consider the way IDA Ireland operates.  It operates in regions.  It has to try to bring jobs into regions.  It cannot simply bring jobs into towns because it is competing with other big cities such as Manchester, which has a population of 5 million or 6 million.  That is the way it has to operate to attract companies into these regions.  In any event, it is up to the companies to decide where they locate but it is important the Deputy takes note of the fact that 70% of new jobs come from existing companies.  I believe there are great opportunities for the existing IDA Ireland companies, particularly in the medtech sector but also in the indigenous area, and for Enterprise Ireland to grow jobs as well as the local employment offices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200035#HH01000","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1487782800,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.22 p.m. and resumed at 5.02 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Industrial Relations (Right to Access) (Amendment) Bill 2016: Second Stage [Private Members]","time":1487783100,"counter":383,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200037#NN00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1487783100,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p><p>I am sharing time with a number of other Deputies.<\/p><p>James Connolly once famously said that the cause of labour is the cause of Ireland and the cause of Ireland is the cause of labour.  He recognised that a republic is only a republic in name if it does not vindicate the rights of citizens.  Central to this tenet is the vindication of the rights of people in the workplace.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes in strong, robust, fair and effective employment rights.  We believe in the right of workers to organise, join a trade union and be represented by a trade union.  We support the right of workers to bargain collectively.  We see this as inextricably linked to trade union recognition.<\/p><p>The current voluntary system has worked for some but has failed many.  Some unscrupulous employers refuse to recognise trade unions and engage in campaigns of bullying, harassment and intimidation.  This cannot be said of all employers; the vast majority are decent.  However, for those who are not, we must ensure that appropriate laws are in place.  Those who are unscrupulous operate as they do because they can and because the current system allows them to.  Decent employers should have no truck with such tactics and neither should any Government interested in the rights of workers.  A voluntary system of trade union recognition allows unscrupulous employers a hiding place.  If an employer has nothing to hide, then it has nothing to fear.<\/p><p>During the infamous Ryanair dispute of 2007, Mr. Justice Geoghegan stated:<\/p><blockquote>As a matter of law Ryanair is perfectly entitled not to deal with trade unions nor can a law be passed compelling them to do so.  There is an obvious danger however in a non-unionised company that employees may be exploited and may have to submit to what most reasonable people would consider to be grossly unfair terms and conditions of employment.<\/blockquote><p>How right he was.<\/p><p>This Bill does not confer the right to trade union recognition.  It does confer the right for trade union members to associate with and meet trade union officials in the workplace.  The general secretary of Mandate, John Douglas, recently remarked that being a member of a trade union in Ireland was like being a member of a golf club but not being allowed to play golf.<\/p><p>Employers who value their employees have nothing to fear from strengthened labour laws.  Those who seek to bully and routinely to ignore industrial relations laws and trade unions do so to protect their interests over those of their employees.<\/p><p>A successful economy is one that values those who contribute to it.  A successful employment rights infrastructure is one that operates on the basis of equality and a level playing field between worker and employer.  There is no level playing field if workers cannot be fairly and properly represented by their trade union.  In far too many sectors, the odds are stacked in favour of the employer.  This has resulted in instances of abuse and exploitation.  The best way to avoid industrial disputes is to have genuine engagement and respect for all sides.  The most effective way to avoid workplace conflict is to resolve disputes at the earliest possible opportunity.  What better place than the shop floor or place of employment?  The right of trade union representatives to engage with trade union members in the workplace should not be feared by anyone, including Government; rather, it should be embraced.  It is a right afforded to workers in many countries that are competitive and that lead the way in workers' rights.<\/p><p>The Bill mirrors the Australian and New Zealand model.  The model works effectively and is supported by employer groups and trade unions in those countries.  It is seen, rightly, as an opportunity to avoid conflict in the workplace and as a way to promote harmonious relationships between employee and employer.<\/p><p>Far too often, we hear examples of employers granting the right to trade union access in the workplace only to withdraw it when it suits.  It is a right conferred when everything is going well but used as a punitive measure when conflict arises.  This <i>&agrave; la carte<\/i>approach to workers' rights cannot and must not be tolerated.  It is telling that instances of abuse and intolerance and breaches of employment law are highest in sectors where low pay, precarious work and if-and-when contracts are the norm.

It is also part of an attempt by the company to break the union as part of what has been termed project black.  In fact, in recent days Tesco has boasted and put out false figures of the number of people who have passed the picket line.  That is what these workers have to deal with.  The company has withdrawn the right to access for trade union representatives in several stores in a vindictive attempt to break the union and deny workers their proper entitlement, including their right to deal with trade union representatives.

We hear Fine Gael Ministers state repeatedly, when they deny workers rights, that it is about being competitive and flexible but for far too many workers flexibility is synonymous with abuse and exploitation.  Flexible work is good, but undermining workers' rights is about only one thing - greed.  We are the lawmakers.  It falls to us to protect workers and to put in place a strong, robust and effective legislative framework that protects the interests of working people.  Our current labour laws have positive aspects that should be recognised and celebrated.  While I do, there are far too many gaps and weaknesses which must be filled.  This Bill seeks to address one such weakness.  It is not a panacea for all the problems that affect workers or the plethora of rights they are denied.<\/p> <p> I have published legislation on piercing the corporate veil, on dealing with low-hour and if-and-when contracts, on trade union recognition and on tactical insolvencies.  All were rejected by the Government.  Every proposal my party puts forward to deal with workers' rights is thrown out the window because the Government is not supportive of such concepts.  However, this Bill is about the right of workers to engage with their trade union representative in the workplace.  Ministers repeatedly accuse Sinn F&eacute;in of opposing and not offering solutions.  Today, we offer a solution but the response of the Government is once again to hide behind its ideology and deny workers' basic rights.  Fine Gael is a party that represents a privileged, cosseted class.  In Fine Gael's world the working class is ignored while it represents the interests of big business and the elites.  Does the Minister or the Government care about exploitation and abuse in the workplace?  Have they any idea what life is like for many workers?  These workers are often pitted against highly trained human resources managers or an employer's legal team and yet are refused access to their trade union official.  The Minister stands over this.  Workers on low-hour contracts who complain about their terms and conditions of employment have their hours cut by unscrupulous employers, because the employers are allowed to do it.  The Minister sits on her hands and does nothing about it aside from vote down Bills brought forward by Members on this side of the House.<\/p> <p> This Bill seeks to amend the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 to allow trade unions access to their members in the workplace for purposes related to the employment of their members, for purposes related to the union's business or both.  There are sufficient checks and balances in the Bill.  It sets out conditionality relating to the permission which must be sought to allow trade unions to engage with their members in the workplace.<\/p> <p> I ask all Members, including those in Fianna F&aacute;il, to support the Bill.  No Bill is without flaws.  I have acknowledged that in recent times when my party has supported many Bills brought forward by Fianna F&aacute;il that were flawed.  When we agree with the principle, we support them.  Too often, however, Fianna F&aacute;il does not support our Bills.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Mandate and unions that represent workers in the financial services sector, the banking sector, the private sector and the public sector all support this Bill.  The only people who do not support it are Fine Gael Members.  We have yet to hear from Fianna F&aacute;il Members but the word is they will not support it.  That says it all about both parties.<\/p> <p> Members have a job to do, which is to legislate in the interest of workers who need to be properly represented.  We are doing our job.  It is now over to the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il to do their jobs.  I commend the Bill to the House.  I thank the Independent Members and Members from other parties who have indicated their support for the legislation and I look forward to their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200037#NN00400","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487783700,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I remind Deputies that they may refer not only to what is in the Bill but also to what could relevantly be put into the Bill.

Judging by the eagerness with which Fianna F&aacute;il representatives were scrambling to get into photographs beside striking Tesco workers this week, I was almost fooled into thinking that the party had experienced a road-to-Damascus moment and had been converted to the side of workers.  Unfortunately, Fianna F&aacute;il remains a party of photograph opportunities, not principles.  That this very reasonable Bill could be opposed by a party which claims to represent ordinary people, as Fianna F&aacute;il does, indicates how far we have fallen with regard to protecting workers' rights in this State.  Obviously, we had problems, having followed the Thatcherite path of the UK in the late 1980s and having legally hamstrung unions with industrial regulations that practically outlawed effective strikes in the 1990s.  It now appears radical merely to argue for the right of unions to access workers and attempt to organise.  The fact that this law is not already in place is sad and the fact it is necessary is an indictment of the State and lays bare whose side Governments have taken.<\/p>  <p>  The erosion of workers' rights over recent years is clear.  Zero-hour contracts, intimidation, blacklisting, punishment for union activities and bogus self-employment contracts are just a few examples of daily attacks on the rights of workers to organise.  With the increasing move towards automation, the role of unions has never been so important in ensuring that workers are not cast by the wayside in the name of ever-increasing profits for an increasingly small number of shareholders.  The effect of this erosion is insidious but pervasive on the public perception of fellow workers in other industries.  Many ordinary people who would have stood with their class a generation ago now decry the idea that anybody working in an ordinary job should earn wages that allow them to live.  It appears that people who work in unskilled or semi-skilled positions should be punished.  The consequences of not defending workers from the increasingly savage attacks of capitalism will be truly dire, most of all for those in power who will reap the whirlwind of the discontent they have sown.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200038#OO00300","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speech","time":1487783700,"counter":390,"content":"<p>It has been obvious for some years that the race to the bottom for Irish workers is in full swing but the Government continues to turn a blind eye to it.  Workers' hard earned rights and conditions are under attack.  We see it with Bus &Eacute;ireann and Tesco workers, newly qualified teachers, workers in the hospitality sector and part-time workers, as well as with minimum wage and minimum-hour contracts, zero-hour contracts, non-union shops and workers not knowing from one end of the week to the next what will be their hours or pay.  They cannot plan a week in advance, never mind plan their future.  All of this is happening on the Government's watch.  The Government states the economy is in a recovery but there is no recovery for workers.  There is a clear policy of busting unions, as can be seen in Tesco and other large retail outlets at present even though these companies make enormous profits in Ireland.  Again, the Government turns a blind eye.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is about unions having access to the workplace and their members.  In fact, it is about workers' rights.

It will be a cheap and hollow photo-opportunity if those Deputies vote against the Bill or abstain in the vote.  The vote on this Bill will show up the Members who are talking the talk but will not walk the walk.

It is evident that workers' rights are now worse in many areas than they were when we joined the European Union in the early 1970s.  The race to the bottom with regard to wages and rights started many years ago but it has accelerated greatly in recent years under both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments and, amazingly, under Governments in which the Labour Party was a partner.  The Bill brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in will allow trade unions to have access to the workplace to meet their members regarding official trade union business.  This is a fundamental right that many people in this country have strived for since the beginning of the last century and before that in some cases.  The Bill will allow trade unions to work out a reasonable time with an employer for access to trade union members in terms of discussing collective agreements as well as wider workplace issues.<\/p><p>This will prevent unscrupulous employers using the law to stymie trade unions in their work.  The purpose of this Bill is to bring some necessary balance to the situation.  It might not be popular for some Members of this House or for those in the media to admit the work that trade unions have done on equality and working conditions, their many other positive contributions to this country or the importance of their role in society.  Trade unions protect the rights of employees and, by doing so, serve a vital social and economic function.<\/p> <p> It is disgraceful in this day and age that we are standing in this Chamber discussing the need to pass this Bill while there is an ongoing battle against a race to the bottom in terms of workers' pay and conditions.  The State cannot continue to allow companies to slash wages to increase profits when those wage cuts end up as an expense for the State.  For example, 10% of Tesco staff are already on low pay.  The State has to top up their incomes with supplementary social welfare.  Now the company is trying to drive down wages and conditions of employment for their longest serving staff, leaving the State to step in to subsidise these low wages with welfare payments.  I ask the Government and its partner, Fianna F&aacute;il, to support our Bill, especially as the Government itself regularly deals with unions and has seen the benefits of negotiations with these unions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200038#OO00500","speaker":"1303","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487784300,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I, like others, commend the Bill and I look forward to the debate.

It is not something that is in any way radical.  It may have been seen as radical 100 years ago but I would have thought the idea of workers being organised in a modern Ireland was very much a positive thing.  If we look at other jurisdictions, this is clearly working.  It is about preventing, not encouraging, disputes.  If there are people on the ground who can come into a workplace and resolve issues, that is a big plus.<\/p>  <p>  We will probably hear tonight from some of the hard cases that it will not work.

Let me state from the outset that it is vital that trade unions are able to represent and take action in support of the interests of their members and that the laws of the State vindicate that right.<\/p>  <p>  It has been the consistent policy of successive Irish Governments to support the development of an institutional framework supportive of a voluntary system of industrial relations that is premised upon freedom of contract and freedom of association.  Our industrial relations legislation offers robust protections to trade unions to allow them to go about their business of protecting workers rights.  These include protection from tort regardless of any damage caused to an employer's business because of a trade dispute.  Furthermore the code of practice on victimisation drawn up under the industrial relations legislation offers protection against victimisation arising from an employee's membership or non-membership of a trade union.  This was further enhanced in 2015 to include an explicit prohibition on the use by employers of inducements, financial or otherwise, designed specifically to have staff forgo collective representation by a trade union.<\/p>  <p>  We should acknowledge that our industrial relations structures are very successful.  Hundreds of disputes are resolved each year by the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court and many more are resolved by the parties themselves through dialogue.  There is an extensive range of statutory provisions designed to back up this voluntary framework.  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 provides for a revised framework for wage setting under the Joint Labour Committee framework.<\/p>  <p>  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 significantly changed the existing industrial relations landscape in Ireland and it provides for a new statutory framework for establishing minimum rates of remuneration, pension and sick pay, to replace the former sectoral registered employment agreements.  It also ensures that where an employer does not engage in collective bargaining, an effective framework now exists that allows a trade union to have the remuneration and terms and conditions of its members assessed against relevant comparators and determined in a binding way by the Labour Court.<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 Act was the culmination of a process of in-depth consultation with stakeholders, including employer and worker representatives, and a review of the experience of the operation of the existing legislative framework as put in place under the Industrial Relations Acts of 2001 and 2004.<\/p>  <p>  From my perspective, the most important concept to consider in this debate is that of balance.  The 2015 legislation provides a clear and balanced mechanism by which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers in their totality can be assessed in employments where collective bargaining does not take place and brings clarity and certainty for employers in terms of managing their workplaces in this respect.  Of course the industrial relations structures of any jurisdiction must be fit for purpose.  We cannot simply cut and paste what exists in another country and apply it here.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill under discussion today has many flaws, particularly in relation to balance.  The practical issues which would arise if this Bill were to be enacted are numerous and capable of creating many difficulties across our economy and in these respects it is unworkable.<\/p>  <p>  The House may not be aware but there are currently 56 registered trade unions in Ireland.  This Bill sets no limits on the number of trade unions that can seek access to a place of work.  Granting statutory rights to enter premises is a very serious matter.  Thus, potentially, an employer could have multiple unions and multiple trade union representatives seeking access to a place of employment.  This applies even if the union does not have a single member in the employment.  This may present an onerous burden for employers, regardless of whether they have one or a thousand employees.<\/p>  <p>  The consent provisions outlined in this Bill effectively mean no consent is needed.  The timelines are unworkable.<\/p><p>The Bill proposes that the only grounds under which an employer can deny access to a union representative is if it is certified by the Attorney General that access would prejudice the security of the State or the investigation or detection of offences.  This is not a function the Office of the Attorney General can perform.<\/p> <p> The Bill as presented also proposes that a union representative may enter a workplace to deal with matters concerning the health and safety of union members.  Ireland has a competent and specialist Health and Safety Authority that includes an inspectorate warranted to enter premises.  The Bill would cut across the statutory mandate of the Health and Safety Authority.<\/p> <p> Furthermore, the Bill seeks to empower union representatives to monitor compliance with employment rights-related matters.  Inspectors of the Workplace Relations Commission have strong powers to monitor and enforce a robust suite of employment and equality legislation and I cannot see how a statutory role for union representatives in this area could work.<\/p> <p> I am open to considering any issues that arise in practice in terms of access and the potential for further developments regarding access that enhance our industrial relations landscape.  I believe that this is a subject the Joint Committee for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation might usefully consider for inclusion on its work programme should it so wish.  I am sure that employer and worker representative bodies would be eager to contribute their own analyses and suggestions and I am sure many of my colleagues in the Chamber would welcome the opportunity to explore any potential developments, particularly where there is some common ground.  I would welcome any conclusions or findings from such a process, if the committee were to decide to give the matter some consideration.<\/p> <p> However, the flaws in the Bill are such that I cannot support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200039#PP00400","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1487784900,"counter":397,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il has a long track record of supporting workers' rights and balanced industrial relations legislation.  The constitutional right of citizens to form associations and unions is enshrined in our progressive Constitution, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, which was introduced under Eamon de Valera back in 1937.  My party has a strong record on worker protection from introducing the National Minimum Wage Act to instituting the labour relations machinery of the State by establishing the Labour Relation Commission, which is now the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, it has been a consistent policy of ours to end exploitable low-hour-type arrangements and we supported a Private Members' Bill on freelance workers' rights in the Seanad last year.  I believe this Bill is being taken next week in the D&aacute;il under Private' Members time also and look forward to discussing its legislative proposals.<\/p>  <p>  However, having reviewed the Bill before us, Fianna F&aacute;il will not be supporting it for a number of reasons.  There are many weaknesses and much legal ambiguity in the Bill, which would place excessive and disproportionate regulatory requirements on existing enterprises, fundamentally risking the strong FDI footprint in Ireland, which employs some 200,000 people directly.  Significantly, it could undermine the current functioning of the Workplace Relations Commission and give rise to serious data protection concerns.  This Bill is not fit for purpose and sends out the message that Ireland is closed for business to international investors.<\/p>  <p>  There is a strong body of industrial relations law currently in operation in Ireland.  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015, enacted just over 18 months ago, struck a proportionate balance between increased collective bargaining rights and anti-victimisation provisions for workers, while maintaining the voluntarist approach to collective bargaining in Ireland.  Importantly both main social partners had a direct role in shaping this legislation to ensure it would work in the best interests of workers and employers.<\/p>  <p>  Were all the main social partners consulted on this Sinn F&eacute;in Bill?  Were labour officials in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation consulted?  Were representatives from the Workplace Relations Commission consulted?  If yes, I would be very curious to hear their feedback.  As the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson, I was not lobbied by ICTU or any other trade union, with the exception of Mandate.  I received three or four e-mails on it.  I received correspondence from Deputy Cullinane, who invited me to a briefing.  Other than that nobody asked to meet me about it and I have not received any big lobby on it.  I look forward to getting clarification on the consultation that was carried out in drafting the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The first cases under the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 are only working through the industrial relations system now.  It would be premature to change this legislation at this early stage.  The 2015 legislation is progressive and has the capacity significantly to improve the rights of workers seeking to negotiate collectively with employers through their unions.  It provides an avenue for workers through their trade unions to secure improvements in pay and conditions when an employer refuses to engage in collective bargaining.  This means, in cases where it can be demonstrated that collective bargaining does not exist in a company, a group of workers have a right to a hearing at the Labour Court where they can be represented by a trade union and have their case examined.  In these cases, legislation allows for the Labour Court to make a determination in a dispute, which can then be enforced by way of a Circuit Court order.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, the 2015 Act will be judged by its ability to resolve industrial disputes.  My party will carefully monitor this situation and the need for any potential future changes, provided there is clear evidence showing that the existing industrial relations architecture needs to be strengthened in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Significantly, the Bill fails to differentiate between unionised and non-unionised employers.  It provides that all employers, regardless of whether they are unionised or non-unionised, must allow a union representative access to its employees at the workplace at any time during working hours.  This is clearly not a proportionate piece of legislation.  The Bill fails to recognise the voluntarist industrial relations model operating in Ireland.  It is claimed that Ireland's voluntarist approach is key to our ability to attract foreign investment.  The Bill empowers a union representative to enter any workplace and \"monitor compliance\" with collective agreements and legislation regarding employment rights.  In effect, it could undermine the current functioning role of the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200040#QQ00200","speaker":"1221"},{"type":"speech","time":1487784900,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Did the Deputy get his briefing from the Minister?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022200040#QQ00300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1487784900,"counter":399,"content":"<p>The Workplace Relations Act 2015 gives Workplace Relations Commission inspectors the power of inspection and enforcement.

Workplace Relations Commission inspectors may also issue compliance notices as well as fixed-payment notices to employers for non-compliance, which may ultimately lead to a criminal offence.<\/p>  <p>  There are also serious data protections concerns emanating from the Bill.
