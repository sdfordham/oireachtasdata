The 2015 Act makes extensive provision in Part 10 for a new and enhanced legal costs regime which will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged, along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients.  As part of this structural reform, under section 139(1) of the Act, the existing Office of the Taxing Master, which is an office of the High Court, is to become the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators.<\/p> <p>The need to bring the Office of the Taxing Master to full working capacity is something of which the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, and the Department, are acutely aware.  Officials are actively working with their colleagues in the Courts Service to deal with this in preparation for the changeover to the new office.  The new office will come into effect with the commencement of the relevant provisions of Part 10 of the 2015 Act which they expect to happen later this year.  The changeover to the new office, therefore, not only enables the introduction of key structural reforms for dealing with disputed legal costs but also enables them to reconfigure that function in a way which will better meet work demand.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality assures the Senator this detailed preparation is already being undertaken by a specifically tasked joint working group chaired at assistant secretary level by the Department of Justice and Equality and is working in close co-operation with its colleagues in the Courts Service.  The working group, which has been meeting regularly, is mandated to map out and oversee the various practical steps to be taken to get the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators up and running.  This work is also intended to ensure the relevant new legal costs adjudication processes, documentation, rules of court and IT systems can be put in place in a legally robust manner.  By the same token, it is intended that the resourcing of the new office will reflect its enhanced statutory mandate.<\/p> <p>These preparations are being actively supported with the expertise and experienced inputs of the current Taxing Master whose term of office has recently been extended for transitional purposes under an enabling provision which the Minister introduced specifically for that purpose under the Courts Act 2016.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That Act also included a number of other measures to facilitate the timely winding down of the existing caseload of referrals before the Office of the Taxing Master.<\/p><p>Senators will appreciate that the transition to the new legal costs adjudicators regime is a very fundamental reform, one that requires planning and management, with careful management of potential risks, in particular.

As he knows, section 102 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for the electronic monitoring of the restrictions of an offender's movements imposed by a court under section 101 of the same Act.  To date, the section has not been commenced, but I understand electronic monitoring has been used by the Irish Prison Service to monitor offenders who have been granted temporary release from prison - for example, those who need to attend hospital as inpatients.  I understand that approximately 50 prisoners were electronically monitored, with good success, under the pilot scheme.  I am also aware that the electronic monitoring of offenders out of bail or post-conviction is a controversial issue that requires the balancing of society's need to reduce reoffending with the serious implications of removing or restricting a citizen's liberty.<\/p> <p>I agree with the view of the Irish Penal Reform Trust that any interference with the rights of someone facing trial must be proportionate and justified.  While I can appreciate these concerns, my research indicates that Ireland is very far behind the rest of Europe when it comes to electronic monitoring.  Our approach has been extremely conservative and, at worst, completely behind the curve.  Electronic monitoring has been used successfully for over 20 years in the United Kingdom and for over 30 years in Australia.<\/p> <p>Last year the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015 was introduced.  It targets repeat offenders with consecutive sentences and the option for bail to be denied.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, said she wholeheartedly agreed with this and that the burglary of a person's home was a heinous crime and traumatic for every victim.  Furthermore, the high rates of recidivism and limited resources are causing havoc in communities.  We know from statistics raised from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's analysis service that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars or offenders.  I am joined in the Visitors Gallery today by Councillor Lynsey McGovern from D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown who is extremely concerned about the number of burglaries in Dublin's eastern Garda division which covers most of the southside.  In 2016 the biggest increase was in the Dundrum area which saw a 25% rise.  It is mirrored in other areas where highly organised gangs have replaced the casual opportunist burglar.<\/p> <p>While the 2015 Act is bound to be effective and to be welcomed as a disincentive to committing multiple burglaries, it relies entirely on the punishment model.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2402\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While I agree with the importance of keeping burglars off the streets, the rehabilitative aspect of a custodial sentence must not be ignored.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Fitzgerald, is on record as stating: \"Monitoring of a convicted offender's movements, whether by electronic means or otherwise, does not provide a focus on rehabilitation in the same way that supervision does nor does it provide the security of a prison sentence in preventing further offences.\"<\/p><p>I believe it does not have to be an either-or scenario and that the combination of the electronic monitoring of burglars and habitual offenders while out on bail and post-conviction, with strong support services, offers a viable solution.  Research shows that where electronic monitoring is developed with high levels of support from probation and other services, the rate of re-offending can be greatly reduced.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that electronic monitoring is an expensive process but technology is developing at speed.  When I walked down Grafton Street at lunch time today, I received several notices on my mobile phone informing me of the various retail outlets and what they had on offer.  We are all being monitored at some level and surveillance systems now can greatly strengthen the system of bail and streamline the monitoring of those awaiting trial.<\/p><p>Electronic monitoring has been described as a force multiplier.  In times of greatly reduced Garda numbers and the closure of Garda stations, this is to be welcomed.  I ask the Minister of State to ask the Department, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Fitzgerald, and in terms of his own influence, to give serious consideration to widespread use of electronic monitoring as a disincentive and rehabilitative measure in the case of burglaries, sex offences and other serious crimes.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032100002#C00500","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490106600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I am here on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, who sends her apologies as she cannot be present.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue and for his thoughtful and well-researched presentation.<\/p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, the programme for Government gives a commitment to the preparation and fast-tracking of new bail legislation.  The new Bail (Amendment) Bill, which recently completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il, will expand the factors a court may take into account in refusing bail, will increase the range of conditions that may be attached to bail, will enable victim evidence to be heard in certain circumstances and will require the court to give reasons for its decisions.<\/p> <p>In addition, the Bill will make provision for electronic monitoring of persons on bail based on existing but uncommenced provisions in the Bail Act 1997.  Unlike the existing provisions, the new Bill provides that electronic monitoring may be imposed as a bail condition only if the prosecution applies to the court for such a condition.  This will ensure that the use of electronic monitoring can be targeted at those cases where it is most likely to be effective.<\/p> <p>In parallel with the progress of the Bill, the Department of Justice and Equality has established a working group to examine issues surrounding electronic monitoring.  The group is comprised of officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service, the Courts Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The working group has been tasked with examining the suitability of the category of offences that should be focused on, examining the suitability of the category of alleged offenders that should be focused on, examining similar best practice examples from neighbouring jurisdictions, examining how any new electronic monitoring system will interact with other existing supervisory schemes, examining the arrangements to be put in place for contracting out this type of monitoring service and examining the resource implications for the implementation of any new system.<\/p> <p>I can inform the Senator that the working group has already met three times since its inception in December 2016 and will continue to work in a focused way on this issue.

It is impossible to get GPs to locate in rural Ireland and the people in towns and villages throughout the country are left with very few services or none at all.  A recent report, commissioned by the HSE, highlighted the fact that the GP shortage would probably get worse before it got better.<\/p> <p>A combination of factors are involved.  First, a large number of GPs are due to retire in the next ten years and their posts may not be filled, with many young doctors planning to emigrate rather than stay in this country.  Last week, I took two calls from families in County Monaghan, one in Carrickmacross and one in Monaghan town.  Both had moved to the area recently and they went to every GP in both towns but no one would take them on.  Where are such people meant to go in such a situation?  The local GP is, for many people, the first port of call when they are sick and in need of medical care.  If there are not enough GPs, where are these families supposed to go?  They have no choice but to go to an overcrowded emergency department in Cavan or Drogheda, making the problems in these departments worse.  It is a vicious circle and patients are going to suffer.  Doctors are not to blame.  They are under increasing pressure with more patients and longer hours.  Some work on call at weekends and they cannot do any more.  They are not getting a fair deal from the HSE and I want to see a GP service with primary care centres that are properly resourced.  GP numbers must be increased and doctors incentivised to come to rural towns and villages.  Until that happens our health services will deteriorate further.<\/p> <p>Ireland is facing an estimated shortage of 1,380 GPs by 2025 unless urgent steps are taken to address this issue.  A recent HSE report recommends 138 training places per year just to keep up with current demand.  The report also recommends the introduction of a number of recruitment and retention strategies, including incentives to GPs to work up to the age of 70 if they wish, measures aimed at rural Ireland to encourage GPs to locate there and more trainees and graduates.  Further research into areas such as the expansion of nurse-led care should also be carried out and there needs to be a proper ring-fencing of primary care, especially in respect of GP practices.  A properly functioning GP practice leads to the best health outcomes and the best value for money.<\/p> <p>Urgent action is required on this issue before the crisis gets worse and I look forward to hearing what plans the Minister brings to this House today to address it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032100002#E00300","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1490106600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator and apologise on behalf of the Minister, who cannot be here.

It is imperative that existing GP services in these areas are retained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly-qualified GPs.<\/p><p>A Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment in respect of increasing the number of GP training places to 259 places annually.  In July 2016, the GP training intake increased from 157 to 172 places and the HSE's 2017 national service plan envisages a further increase to 187 places this year.  Of course, the Minister is anxious to achieve further increases in future years in order to ensure that the future manpower needs of general practice can be met.  The Senator rightly outlined the figures that we need to reach for that to happen.  There are currently 34 GMS GPs in Cavan covering 37 panels and 25 GMS GPs in Monaghan covering 28 panels.  Obviously, there are three vacancies in each county.  It should be noted, however, that all these panels with vacancies are covered by locum arrangements and that no panel is without a GP.  The HSE is working to fill these locum panels on a permanent basis as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>It is acknowledged that there have been some difficulties in finding GP cover, both locum and permanent, for some rural areas.  This includes Cavan-Monaghan.  The HSE is working on a continuous basis with GPs to find solutions to this problem.  In this regard, the Dublin north east training area increased the number of GP trainees by four last year, bringing the total number of trainees to 18.  The number will increase to 19 this year, making the area one of the largest training centres in the country.  This increase in trainee numbers should hopefully benefit the north east in the coming years.<\/p><p>Further efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible and shared GMS GP contracts and changes to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme.  This allows GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, if that is what they want to do.  An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices has also been introduced.  Some 252 practice units are in receipt of supports under the rural practice support framework, which equates to 313 individual GPs currently benefiting under the new scheme.  This is a significant increase in the number of GPs benefiting from rural supports, which stood at 167 before the introduction of this scheme.<\/p><p>These steps should help to address the future demand by enticing GPs who may have ceased practising for family or other reasons back into the workforce, facilitating GPs to work past the standard retirement age and encouraging more GPs to work in more rural areas.  In addition, the Minister and I are cognisant of the need for a new GP services contract which will help modernise our health service and develop a strengthened primary care sector.  Health service management have already progressed a number of significant measures through engagement with GP representatives.<\/p><p>Discussions on a new GP contract are under way.  The aim is to develop a new modern GP services contract, which we have not had in a number of years, that will incorporate a range of standard and enhanced services to be delivered.  The GP contract review process will also seek to introduce further measures aimed at making general practice a fulfilling and rewarding career option into the future.  I obviously hope that our young doctors will not leave the country to pursue careers elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032100002#E00400","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490106600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her extensive response to my question.

The problem is, like in many other sectors such as nursing, teaching or whatever, we seem to be training our nurses and doctors to emigrate and find better packages and deals elsewhere.

That is because of the difficulty in attracting GPs to rural areas.  GPs are private practices.  It is up to the individual to come to an area.  Where it has not been successful, the HSE is obviously looking to bring people into those areas, but it is difficult.  The changes to the retirement age, the opening up of access to the GMS panel, the changing of work hours for young mothers who may also want to raise families and the new rural contract linked in with the GP contract itself will hopefully start to see changes and encourage GPs to work in these areas in which they are not currently working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032100002#F00300","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greyhound Industry","time":1490106600,"counter":27,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032100002#G00050"},{"type":"speech","time":1490106600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Anthony Doyle, and also acknowledge the presence of Deputy Michael Darcy in the Visitors Gallery with his students who I assume are from County Wexford, not County Wicklow.

That issue must be dealt with over a period of time.  A number of part-time workers have been in contact with me to say they are losing significant earnings because of the reduced crowds as a result of the protests at Shelbourne Park.  We must resolve the issue of Harold's Cross greyhound stadium because if the protests continue, the jobs of permanent, part-time and temporary staff will be at risk because of the loss of income at Shelbourne Park.  I ask the Minister of State to exert some pressure to ensure the issue is resolved.  It can only be resolved through discussion and negotiations and anything that could be done in that regard would be much appreciated.  This is particularly relevant for part-time staff who are greatly out of pocket.  The permanent staff are still in employment and not seeing a loss of income.<\/p> <p>The other element of this issue is that the site in Harold's Cross, close to the centre of the city, is six and a half acres in size.  If the stadium is not to be reopened, it is very important that the local community be consulted.  This area of the city will see its population grow by approximately one third in the next decade.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this.  The area will experience huge population growth, yet it does not currently contain a field in which a child could kick a football or a second level college could be built for students.  There is a shortage of secondary schools in the area.  A proportion of the site, if the greyhound stadium is not to be reopened, could be used to serve that need.  It is currently designated as a Z9 zone, which means that the development of only 5% of the site is permissible, which means that it is not in the interests of the taxpayer or the Irish Greyhound Board to put it on the market at this stage.  What is required is a local area plan.  I ask the Minister of State to get involved in that process.  When the population of an area grows by one third and a six and a half acre site becomes available, we have to make sure there is sustainable planning.  I ask the Minister of State to look at entering into consultation with the local community before any long-term decision is made about the track.  <\/p> <p>I highlight again the possible loss of the stadium.  The Irish Greyhound Board has sought consultation on the sale of the site.  It could represent a significant loss to the taxpayer if the site is sold at below market value, as currently configured.  We need to take a step back and ask what is in the best interests of the city and the taxpayer.  My fear is that a developer will purchase the site and sit on it for five to ten years.  We would then have an unoccupied six and a half acre site in the city, not being used for the purposes of recreation, education or housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032100002#G00200","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1490106600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue which has occupied a lot of my time.  I have an official line but may be able to expand on that in the supplementary contribution.<\/p> <p>Bord na gCon is responsible for the control, promotion and operation of greyhound racing, including the operation of totalisator betting, the making of grants for prize money, the allocation of grants to improve amenities at tracks and the licensing of tracks.  In that context, it runs commercial operations in a number or greyhound stadia, including Harold's Cross.  There are 17 greyhound tracks licensed by Bord na gCon which owns Shelbourne Park, Harold's Cross, Cork, Tralee, Waterford, Youghal, Limerick and Galway, and also has a 51% share in the Mullingar track.<\/p> <p>In an economic report by Jim Power in 2010 it was estimated that the greyhound racing industry is responsible for sustaining in excess of 10,000 full and part-time jobs directly and indirectly, many in rural communities, and injects an estimated &euro;500 million into local economies.  While this work may be somewhat outdated at this point, the fact remains that the greyhound sector makes a significant contribution to the rural economy.  The greyhound breeding industry is also very export oriented with over 75% of greyhounds now running in the UK being Irish bred.<\/p> <p>Greyhound racing attracts thousands of tourists to Ireland from many countries, particularly France, Germany and the UK, and it works closely with Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the various tour operators.  Ireland is regarded as a world-class player in greyhound breeding and there is considerable potential for further development in this area.  The Irish Greyhound Derby, run in Shelbourne Park, is one of the richest greyhound races in the world.  However, Bord na gCon has been operating in a very difficult financial environment for several years and in particular since 2011 when it took on considerable debt as a result of the development of Limerick stadium.  In 2014, against the background of reducing income for the organisation through the recession, and the significant debt burden, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine commissioned an independent report into certain matters relating to Bord na gCon, including its financial performance and prospects.  That report, known as the Indecon report, provided a roadmap for the sustainable development of the greyhound sector, and recommended several asset disposals, including Harold's Cross, in order to reduce the debt burden.<\/p> <p>I understand that Bord na gCon, having considered the matter and having regard to the recommendations in the Indecon report, has decided to put Harold's Cross stadium on the market in order to reduce its debt levels and increase its capacity to provide support and assistance to the industry.  The directors of the Dublin Greyhound and Sports Association Limited approved the sale of the Harold's Cross property at a meeting held on 16 March 2017.<\/p> <p>While the sale of Harold's Cross is very regrettable, Bord na gCon's view is that there is no other option if the burden of debt on the organisation is to be reduced in any meaningful way.  I understand that its intention is to transfer the Harold's Cross racing schedule to Shelbourne Park and Bord na gCon continues to accommodate racing at Shelbourne Park on Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, albeit that is suspended at the moment because of ongoing pickets.  Bord na gCon has informed me that all permanent and temporary staff who had been employed at Harold's Cross have now been transferred to Shelbourne Park with no breaks in their employment records.  I understand that the closure of Harold's Cross has led to concern among supporters of the stadium and an effort at mediation between Dublin Greyhound Breeders and Owners Association, GOBA, and Bord na gCon is under way.  Bord na gCon has informed me that Kieran Mulvey has agreed to chair this mediation process.  There has been significant Government commitment to this sector in recent years, with the contribution of the taxpayer, through the horse and greyhound fund, having increased from &euro;10.8 million in 2014 to &euro;16 million in 2017.<\/p> <p>I remain committed to continuing to support this vitally important sector.  However, it is clear that if it is to have a sustainable future, the burden of debt on Bord na gCon must be reduced.  In this regard the board has its own responsibilities to discharge, and this may involve very difficult decisions.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Andrew Doyle:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I can appreciate that the local community will have a view on the further uses to which the site may be put, if sold.

Blacksod Lighthouse is situated at the very tip of the Erris Peninsula.  It remains the centre of the search operation under way around Blackrock for Irish Coast Guard helicopter Rescue 116.  Mr. Vincent Sweeney is the keeper of the lighthouse and it was he who was on duty awaiting the return of Captain Dara Ftizpatrick and her colleagues to refuel.  Sadly, they never returned.  As we all know, weather and sea conditions have played havoc with the search operation for Mark Duffy, Ciar&aacute;n Smith and Paul Ormsby.  <\/p><p>It is somewhat prophetic that a weather forecast from the same lighthouse, relayed by Mr. Ted Sweeney who was Vincent's father, just after 2 a.m. on 3 June 1944 contained a warning about a force 6 wind and a rapidly falling barometer at Blacksod.  On receipt of this information, General Dwight D. Eisenhower postponed by one day the planned invasion of Normandy by allied forces.  The actions of one man in Blacksod, County Mayo helped to avert a military catastrophe and changed the course of the Second World War and eventually led to the fall of Nazi Germany.  Despite immense technological advancements since that day in 1944, the perils of the north Atlantic Ocean and the unpredictability of the weather remain the same.  <\/p><p>There are around 300 people, mostly volunteers, involved in the massive operation to find the helicopter and the remaining members of the crew.  Unfortunately, weather conditions and the crashing waves of the Atlantic Ocean pose an immense challenge.  All of us who have been involved with the volunteers - I include my colleague, Rose, in this - want to see the families reunited with their loved ones.  There is a quiet resolve on the Erris Peninsula to complete the task in hand.  The response of the local community has been truly incredible.  They are responsible for three distinct aspects of the mission.  The first involves the provision of local knowledge from fishermen neighbours and friends who have been instrumental in the search.  The second is the land search by local volunteers that has yielded important parts of the wreckage.  The third is the welfare of the searchers and members of the emergency services.  Food has been provided for 250 people each day.<\/p><p>What is unique about the operation is the collaboration between the air accident investigation unit, the Garda, the Irish Naval Service, the Air Corps, Civil Defence, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, RNLI, Mayo County Council and the Irish Lights vessel <i>Granuaile<\/i>.  They have all worked together under the direction of the Irish Coast Guard.<\/p><p>As I have said previously in the House, on every single call-out members of the Irish Coast Guard are exposed to dangers, with which no other workers, apart from members of the emergency services, are faced.  There are many people alive today in Ireland who owe their lives to the bravery and skill of Captain Dara Fitzpatrick and her fine colleagues.  It has been touching to hear so many such stories as the nation has expressed its gratitude to these brave heroes.  It was striking to listen to the brave words spoken by the family of Captain Dara Fitzpatrick: &quot;We feel like the lucky ones now because we have her.  We can kiss her.  We can hold her.&quot;<\/p><p>Over the weekend I was in Blacksod Lighthouse with Mr. Vincent Sweeney and some of the immediate family members of the three missing crew members.  Another D-Day is being planned.  I know that I speak for every person involved in the search operation in County Mayo and the nation when I say we all hope the families of Mark Duffy, Paul Ormsby and Ciar&aacute;n Smith will have their own D-Day when their loved ones are discovered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032100002#O00200","speaker":"1373"},{"type":"speech","time":1490106600,"counter":42,"content":"<p>As the first speaker on behalf of the Independent group of Senators, I express our deep sympathy to the family of Captain Dara Fitzpatrick on their tragic loss and our warm support for the other families still awaiting news of loved ones also on the helicopter.

I want also to express my personal condolences to the family of Martin McGuinness who played a major role in the Good Friday Agreement which led Sinn F&eacute;in to embracing the democratic process, thus ensuring that peace has prevailed on our island ever since.  I express my sincere gratitude to Martin who died very tragically and suddenly.<\/p> <p>On a more uplifting note, I warmly welcome the Taoiseach's announcement of plans for a referendum to allow millions of Irish citizens living abroad to vote in Irish presidential elections, which is something that I have personally campaigned for over a number of years, along with most of the immigrant community groups in the United States and United Kingdom.  I recognise that there are many citizens residing in this State who are fearful of allowing such a large number of persons abroad to vote for a President of the country they love but do not live in.  I call on those people and any other party that is not intending to support this referendum to give the Irish diaspora a chance.  Second only to ensuring the undocumented Irish receive regularised status within the United States, this initiative means so much to the US diaspora with whom I spent the last number of days as part of the St. Patrick's week festivities, as in previous years.  When the Taoiseach asked me if I would accept his nomination as a Member of this esteemed Seanad he promised this referendum and he has delivered on that promise.  I can think of no better way to bring tangible meaning to Article 2 of the Constitution, which recognises that the Irish nation cherishes its special affinity with people of Irish ancestry living abroad who share its cultural identity and heritage.  The Irish love being Irish abroad.  We love the Irish when then return home.  Like any other Irish man or woman residing in this State, they are entitled to a vote in regard to who should be the next Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann.  My only regret in respect of the Taoiseach's proposal is that the referendum will not take place in advance of the next presidential election.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032100002#P00100","speaker":"1429"},{"type":"speech","time":1490106600,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032100002#P00200","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1490106600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>This is disappointing.

Republicans across Ireland will mourn Martin's passing because he is recognised across Ireland and internationally as a statesman and peacemaker.  Martin was a regular visitor to the west, particularly to Mayo, in both a personal and political capacity.  He joined me on many occasions on the election trail and had a genuine connection and affinity with all those he met.  He came to Mayo during his presidential campaign in 2011 and was received with great warmth.  He was also a regular visitor to the west in a personal capacity and believed strongly in the potential of the region and its need for investment.  He had a keen sense of the importance of rural Ireland to the republican project.  Although we have lost a great leader today, a wonderful legacy of peace has been left with us.  We must now continue and achieve what Martin started.  The aims of Irish freedom and unity were central to his life, and we owe it to him to make these his legacy.<\/p><p>I also extend my sympathy - I know Martin would want to do likewise - to the families of Ryan McBride and Maureen Haughey, who passed away during the week.

My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and party colleagues today.  I was privileged to meet Martin on many occasions due to the fact that my father comes from a small island off north Antrim.  Martin went there many's the time to meet the islanders, and I met him myself on many occasions.  I also met him through my music.  He was a great leader.  He was a very warm and charismatic man.  He was a gentleman.  His work on bringing peace to this wonderful country of ours will be a lasting legacy, and he was instrumental in delivering that peace.  His desire for equality and justice was a driving force in all he did, and I think it is generally recognised that without Martin McGuinness there would not be a peace process.  There is now an onus on all of us to complete the work about which he was so passionate and to strive ever harder for an Ireland in which everybody is treated equally, irrespective of background or tradition.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frances Black:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2474\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I would also like to say he was a great poet.

On behalf of the Labour Party group, I would like to join with others in offering condolences to the family of Martin McGuinness and to his Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues here in the Chamber and elsewhere on their sad loss.  As others have said, his legacy as a key negotiator and facilitator of the peace process will live on.  For any of us who had the pleasure of meeting him, he was a very warm, pleasant and, indeed, humorous individual.  It is fitting that the Leader has added time today for condolences to be offered.

We offer our sincere condolences to their families, noting that the search for the three missing crewmen still continues.  Others have spoken very eloquently of the immense bravery that has been shown over many years by the personnel of the Coast Guard and the rescue services, like Captain Fitzpatrick and her crew.

I was part of the Constitutional Convention that made that recommendation.  It is an important one and I hope we will see it take effect very quickly, even if the concern is that this is just an aspirational comment by the Taoiseach and not a real commitment.  I am glad to hear Senator Lawless say he was made a promise, so I hope we will see that promise kept and see that referendum delivered in early course.<\/p> <p>I commend our colleague, Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, on his initiative in organising an Irish Stand event in New York last Friday to make a stand against some of the narrow values espoused by President Trump.

Given only one hour is allocated on the schedule, I ask that either it be adjourned tomorrow if the Bill does not conclude, or that Committee Stage and Report Stage are separated, which I believe would be preferable, given the number of amendments from different colleagues, including Senator Nash.<\/p> <p>On another matter for tomorrow's business, I am glad to hear the Government will not be opposing the Pensions (Equal Treatment in Occupational Benefit Scheme)(Amendment) Bill 2016 that I and my Labour Party colleagues are proposing on Second Stage in Private Members' time.

The following quote came into my mind: \"Send not to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee\".  Death is always a sad event.  I have no difficulty whatsoever in sending my heartfelt condolences to Mr. McGuinness's family.  It is always sad for the family.  In recent weeks I thought to myself how terribly frail and pathetic he looked on television.  It was moving to hear him talk about the decision forced on him to have to leave politics.  However, he did have a dark past.  He was involved in the murder of Lord Louis Mountbatten.  For that reason, it is remarkably gracious of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, to send a personal note to his family.  He was involved in the Warrenpoint massacre.  He was also involved in persuading a former IRA informer to come back to the North by talking to his mother.  Within hours of his arrival, the informer was murdered.  In the presidential campaign I said to Mr. McGuinness: \"Martin, you did not get that luxurious fleet of buses on the average industrial wage.\"  He laughed.  The most important and significant part of his career, however, was the second half - his political and military career when he courageously turned towards the path of peace.  Without his intervention, the peace process might not have happened.  For that reason, I salute him.<\/p> <p>I am also glad to be reminded of the passing of Maureen Haughey who was a remarkably gracious and decent person.  She held her dignity throughout a series of assaults on her husband and her family.  She stood by him with remarkable fortitude.

It has been a bad weekend in general terms for the people of Derry.  I should also mention, although it has been well mentioned already, the tragedy that occurred off the Mayo coast.<\/p> <p>Today is World Down Syndrome Day.  Every week, two to three women give birth to lovely little babies with Down's syndrome.  Much has been done over the years to improve the supports for families but I do not believe that anyone can turn to those parents at that point - it is not always two parents - with hand on heart and say we are able to give all the supports that are needed.  As that is still a stretch for Ireland, I draw that to people's attention on a day like today.  Families are trying to find money for assessments.  Organisations such as Down Syndrome Ireland and others are trying to support them with practical measures such as speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and whatever.<\/p> <p>The other point that must be made is that many children with Down's syndrome can have other complications such as heart conditions and arthritis.  In their later years, many of them will face the onset of dementia of one kind or another.  Thankfully, the longevity of children with Down's syndrome in the past 30 or 40 years has increased from 30 to 35 years.  In the past, parents were told that if they got 30 or 35 years out of life with their child they were doing well.  They now live into their 50s and beyond.  That is a compliment to the improvement in services but we are not keeping pace in that regard.<\/p> <p>This is an occasion to applaud parents, families and communities that do their best and to remind ourselves, those in the other House and the Government that real issues arise for people.  For two or three families this week, that challenge will arise out of nowhere.  That is the reason ratification and implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is important.  Also, real issues arise now for parents who are becoming elderly in respect of how their son or daughter will be provided for when they pass way.  I pay tribute to those parents and express my condolences to all those who have been bereaved so sadly in the past week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032100002#W00200","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1490106600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I echo to the word what Senator Dolan has just said and the way he said it.<\/p> <p>When I learned of the death of Mrs. Maureen Haughey, and I would like to be associated with messages of condolences to her family, I was struck by something that was said when her husband, Charles Haughey, died.  At his funeral, RTE's John Bowman said that whatever one thought of his political views from all sides, there was no doubt about his greatness because greatness is about one's impact on events.  The same words are relevant when we think of Martin McGuinness today.  However, without in any way resiling from our disagreement with the path of violence towards a resolution of any human dispute, one can certainly say that there was greatness in the choice he made for peace when he came to make that choice, in the way that he led others, in the way he co-operated with past opponents and so on.

It normally hosts between 500 and 600 per day at its lunchtime meal.  On the same day, 160 families received baby food, nappies and clothing from the centre, which is run by Br. Kevin Crowley, one of society's living heroes.  Up to 1,600 food parcels are currently given out on Wednesday mornings and Br. Crowley said the people with whom he works live in constant fear of the unknown because they dread what might happen to them or their families in the future.  Despite economic growth and rising disposable income levels it is clear people in Dublin, and throughout the country, are left behind and are utterly reliant on charitable assistance.  Last month's survey by the CSO on income and living conditions indicated that the consistent poverty rate showed little recent change, going from 8.8% in 2014 to 8.7% in 2015 and a recent report by the Samaritans claimed social and economic inequality was putting people at increased risk of suicide.<\/p> <p>In recent weeks, in both Houses of the Oireachtas, there has been considerable and deserved spotlight on things that happened in the past but the focus must also remain on the considerable number of our citizens who are being let down by the State now, and who find themselves in various states of inequality.  Children are bearing the brunt of the inequity, especially those in lone-parent households and in homeless families whose sense of dignity and self-respect is being eroded on a daily basis but yet there are no significant street demonstrations calling for a change to this.<\/p> <p>Before Christmas, Br. Crowley said he met a mother of three who had been placed in emergency accommodation in Malahide, north Dublin.  She had no money and nothing to eat.  She had to leave her children alone in the accommodation because she had to go back to the Capuchin service in the city centre for food.  Today, we welcome our Government Ministers back from around the world and I am mindful we often call for Ministers to come to this House to discuss various issues.  They would do well to visit Br. Crowley's facility on Bow Street to see just how unequal Irish society remains in 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032100002#X00300","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1490106600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I join with colleagues in offering my sympathies to the families of Dara Fitzpatrick, Mark Duffy, Paul Ormsby and Ciar&aacute;n Smith on their tragic loss and the huge difficulties they have endured in the past week.

Martin was a colossus of contemporary politics and a committed activist throughout his life.  His political activism started in his youth.  At 21 he witnessed the shooting of 26 unarmed civilians on the streets of his city, Derry, and from that period onwards Martin McGuinness spent his lifetime opposing occupation and fighting for self-determination.  His pivotal role within Sinn F&eacute;in alongside Gerry Adams as a persuader for peace among republicans was truly remarkable.  He had conversations which would lead to that peace being realised, to the Good Friday Agreement and to a legal and political pathway opening for the achievement of Irish reunification.  That was Martin's vision.  That was his aisling.  In public life Martin was one of the most kind and gentle figures I have ever had the pleasure to meet.  Senator Black mentioned his poetry and his love for Seamus Heaney, and little did I know as I picked up a copy of <i>North <\/i>on Parnell Street yesterday that we would wake to such sad news today.  Martin's love of the arts extended to music, and he was always extremely supportive on that front, including to musicians like Senator Black.

I had the pleasure of meeting him in Boston Airport and also being next to him on a radio broadcast as I was about to be eliminated in the last general election and he wished me well.  He was genuine and generous on the two occasions I met him.  To his wife, Bernie, and family who have lost not just a father, a husband and a grandfather but also a friend and to the Sinn F&eacute;in Party which has lost a colleague and a friend, we extend our sympathy.

As a House and a nation, we pray that the bodies of the missing crew members, Paul Ormsby, Mark Duffy and Ciar&aacute;n Smith, will be found and returned to their families in order that they can say one last goodbye to them.  The events in the aftermath of the tragic accident, as outlined by so many Senators today, underline the importance of the work of the Irish Coast Guard and the bravery and courage of the men and women who go out in very dangerous conditions, often late at night, and put their own lives at risk.  We thank all those involved for their work and bravery.  We thank the community in Blacksod Bay, the 300 people to whom Senator Rose Conway-Walsh referred, who are involved in a voluntary capacity in helping to bring closure to allow the families grieve.

We extend our deepest sympathy to all of the Haughey family on their sad loss.  She gave to the nation the importance of civic life.  <\/p><p>Senator Fintan Warfield very eloquently touched on the death of Ryan McBride.  It is unbelievable that a young man could play soccer on a Saturday afternoon and be dead on the Sunday morning.  That shows how precious life is.  He was a young man who had assumed the captaincy of his club which he loved and for which he had played a leading role in the campaign this year.  He was a great leader on the pitch.  We extend our sympathy to his family on his untimely death. <\/p><p>Bishop Eamonn Casey was a pastoral leader and will be remembered for many things.  As Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen said, he was a champion of social justice.  As a seminarian in Maynooth, I had the pleasure of meeting him and recognised the importance of his work in Tr&oacute;caire.  When they were not very popular, he was a huge champion of the Irish in the United Kingdom.  Many will recall his near death experience at the funeral of &Oacute;scar Romero and his stance against the then President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, will be remembered.  He will be remembered for other reasons also.

It will be an opportunity to have a debate on the future of presidential elections and the role of the diaspora and how they will be able to vote, if it is carried by the people.  The caveat is that it will be a referendum of the people, which will happen in time.  It is important to recognise that the Constitutional Convention, in its fifth report, made a very strong recommendation on this issue.  I thank the members of the convention again.

Notwithstanding the remarks by Senator Boyhan, it is important to put on the record of the House that national outcomes for cancer patients have improved.  While we recognise that there are issues to be addressed, with an economy emerging from recession we will have more money to spend and we can invest wisely in our health system.  I hope that part of the Future Health document will address the issues raised by Senators Boyhan and Colm Burke around oncology and consultant posts.  This is a matter to which we need to refer back.<\/p> <p>As a former member of a health committee, which I chaired, Senator Burke has had regular interventions with the HSE around staff recruitment, staff retention and the need to go to the international market.  He has now been proved right.  With respect to Senator Boyhan's contribution on cancer, I would say that the number of newly-diagnosed cases is rising by 6% to 7% annually and it is projected to reach nearly 55,000 cases by 2030.  As a nation we need to build on the success of the national cancer strategy we adopted in 2006 whereby we have eight centres of excellence.  We need to look at how we can reduce the risk of cancer and also have a strategy that reflects upon the needs expressed by Senator Boyhan.  I would be happy to have the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, come to the House in that regard.<\/p> <p>Senator Lombard raised the subject of the proposed incinerator at Ringaskiddy in Cork.  I believe it is absolutely unacceptable that a decision has been deferred for the fourth time.  The process is elongated now by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which I know is independent, but it is a huge imposition on the residents of Ringaskiddy and the adjoining areas of Monkstown and Passage West.

I join both Senators in recognising that there is a need to continue to support people with Down's syndrome.  The Minister has made changes to the medical card scheme.  There is a need to thank the staff of the many organisations who look after people with Down's syndrome, and also to thank their parents and their families, and companies which employ people with Down's syndrome.  A number of friends of mine are gainfully employed.  I know a young man who is working in a canteen in Cork and it is a great source of joy to him that he can go into work every day, do his job and be recognised as being equal.

The report we are discussing was published on 7 February last.  The Rebuilding Ireland document is over six months old at this stage, having been published in late July 2016.  We received valuable input from Oireachtas colleagues during the development of the action plan and the fleshing out of the legislative and policy provisions arising from its commitments.  The Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in particular has dedicated much of its time and focus to housing and planning matters.  This House has debated these issues at length including, for example, before Christmas in the context of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill 2016.<\/p> <p>The cross-party collaboration and support for addressing this most challenging issue demonstrates the collective desire to deliver on the core objectives of Rebuilding Ireland and secure real outcomes in areas like increased supply, enhanced supports and more innovative approaches.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I appreciate the assistance and efforts of Members of the Oireachtas and members of local authorities.  The Minister and I are in the process of visiting all the local authorities.  I think this is the main priority for all parties and individuals across the board.  Directly elected councillors, Deputies and Senators are trying to focus on housing and to address this overall problem.  I will briefly outline on a pillar-by-pillar basis the key elements of the progress that was made during the final quarter of 2016.<\/p> <p>The overriding objectives for the Government under Pillar 1, which deals with addressing homelessness, are to stem the flow of people into homelessness, to ensure sufficient quality emergency accommodation is available and to work to secure long-term sustainable homes for families and individuals experiencing homelessness.  The new national mortgage arrears resolution service, Abhaile, and the associated scheme of aid and advice for borrowers in mortgage arrears were launched by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, in the autumn to assist those at risk of homelessness through mortgage arrears.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, announced significant changes to the mortgage to rent scheme that are designed to lead to a major increase in the number of households benefitting from the scheme.  The changes will make the scheme quicker, more transparent, easier to navigate for borrowers and, ultimately, more accessible to more households in mortgage distress.<\/p> <p>During the last quarter of 2016, significant emphasis was placed on delivering additional emergency accommodation for homeless people who sleep rough.  Over 200 additional beds were provided across a number of facilities in Dublin.  Enhanced targeted supports were made available in response to the specific needs of people in emergency accommodation, particularly families.  Some 2,700 sustainable exits from homelessness were achieved nationally during 2016.  This represented an increase of 16% on the 2015 figure.  A significant contributor to this, and to preventing individuals and families from entering homelessness in the first place, was the housing assistance payment homeless pilot scheme in Dublin.  Under this scheme, 810 stable housing tenancies were put in place in 2016, exceeding the target by nearly 50%.  Homelessness, particularly the number of homeless families and children in emergency accommodation, remains a significant challenge to be addressed.  The increased funding provided for homeless services this year, and the range of homelessness measures to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, will ensure that securing further substantial progress in this area remains a top priority in 2017.<\/p> <p>The key focus under Pillar 2, which deals with accelerating social housing, is on the delivery of an additional 47,000 social homes by local authorities and approved housing bodies through construction, refurbishment, acquisition and leasing.  The national roll-out of the housing assistance payment scheme will see it providing an important social housing solution for significant numbers of households, including those currently in receipt of long-term rent supplement.  The second quarterly report, which provides details of the social housing output in 2016, shows that almost 18,400 social housing supports were provided from a full housing budget spend of &euro;935 million.  This exceeded our ambitious target of providing 17,240 such supports.  Nearly 5,300 homes were built, refurbished or acquired, approximately 12,000 housing assistance payment tenancies were facilitated and over 1,000 rental accommodation scheme placements were made.  We are seeing real progress in the social housing construction programme.  A full schedule of the pipeline of social housing projects, accompanied by a report setting out the position at the end of 2016, was published by the Department last month.  It showed that 504 projects, involving the construction of over 8,400 units, were at various stages in the process at that time.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=21\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This report will be updated on a quarterly basis in tandem with future quarterly progress reports under Rebuilding Ireland.  This will enable all Members of the Oireachtas and members of local authorities to track the progress of social housing projects in various counties and to keep the pressure on at both a national and local level.  We are endeavouring to ensure that we all play our part in terms of increasing activity levels across all sectors.<\/p><p>In terms of the approval process for social housing construction projects, the main objective within the Department is to get good projects that represent value for money and deliver quality homes approved and built as quickly as possible.  We are building on the efficiencies gained from previous worthwhile reforms to the approval process in which my party colleague, Senator Paudie Coffey, played a major role, and adding to them.  In that context, the Department has recently published a report setting out a number of additional steps that will further streamline and enhance the approval process.  A timeline for the implementation of these additional actions has also been set out and the Department is actively engaging with the local government sector on this issue. <\/p><p>Accelerating social housing under Pillar 2 is also crucial to delivering some of the key objectives in addressing homelessness under Pillar 1.  Following the establishment of the rapid build procurement framework by the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, the Department has brought together all of the local authorities and the main approved housing bodies for a workshop on how the framework can help them in accelerating delivery.  The Housing Agency has been active in utilising its &euro;70 million rolling fund to purchase vacant properties from banks and investment companies, signing contracts for 238 houses and apartments, with the sale of 82 of these now closed.  Bids have been made on a further 98 properties.  In addition, the transfer of the acquired units to the approved housing bodies is being progressed which is crucial in terms of replenishing the revolving fund, thereby facilitating further purchases.<\/p><p>The roll-out of the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme to additional local authorities continued during quarter 4, with the scheme being activated successfully in nine additional local authority areas.  Subsequently, in the current quarter, the nationwide roll-out of HAP has been completed, with its introduction last week to the administrative areas of Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  A full update on this will be included in the next quarterly report.  Eligible households in all 31 local authority areas can now avail of the scheme, with &euro;153 million being made available for its operation in 2017.  Progress to date this year under the scheme indicates that it is well on track to achieve its 15,000 household target for the year.  <\/p><p>Pillar 3 is focused on accelerating the delivery of housing in the wider housing market and provides for a suite of actions dealing with funding and financing infrastructural provision, active land management, planning reforms and construction and design innovation.  A key area of work over the last few months has been the assessment of the more than 70 proposals submitted under the local infrastructure housing activation fund which is now almost complete.  I expect that this will allow an announcement to be made by the end of this month on the successful infrastructural projects which will open up land capable of delivering many thousands of new homes.  <\/p><p>In terms of State land management, the survey of State lands with housing development potential, focusing on Dublin and the main cities and urban areas, is progressing well.  The first phase of the mapping will be completed and published online in the coming weeks.  This phase will also include mapped details of residential land zonings across the country, as well as local authority owned lands available for housing.  We will be adding further layers of land mapping information to the system over the course of the second quarter.  As with many policy issues, information is key and this integration of different databases will enable us to assess and prioritise the release of centrally and strategically located lands that can deliver housing quickly.  <\/p><p>As committed to under Rebuilding Ireland, we have developed a monthly housing activity report, the second edition of which was published last week.  Planning permission was granted for a total of over 16,300 new homes in 2016, an increase of 26% on 2015.  Commencement notices for 13,334 new homes were submitted in the 12-month period to the end of January 2017, which is an increase of over 44%, year-on-year.  Completions for the 12-month period to end of January 2017 reached 15,256 homes, a year-on-year increase of 18%.  At a broad level, the indicators confirm that housing construction activity is continuing to strengthen.  Having regard to wider economic growth projections and the increasing levels of planning permissions and commencements, in particular, there is a growing level of optimism that higher levels of output will be achieved in 2017 and beyond.<\/p><p>Under Pillar 4, which deals primarily with the rental sector, the key action during the period covered by the quarter 4 implementation report was the publication of the strategy for the rental sector in December 2016.  Among the main measures arising from the strategy was the introduction of rent pressure zones, initially in the four Dublin local authority areas and Cork city, with a further 12 areas designated subsequently, on foot of a more granular analysis of rents data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017032100002#DD00300","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1490106600,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
