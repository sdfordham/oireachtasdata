Agreed.  Are there any matters arising from the minutes? No.  On correspondence since 13 December 2012, the following is correspondence received from accounting officers and Ministers.  Item 4A.1, correspondence, received 13 December 2012, from the National Development Finance Agency regarding a letter previously circulated to the Joint Committee on Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding the Poolbeg Waste to Energy project is to be noted and published.  Item 4A.2, correspondence, dated 10 December 2012, from Mr. Brendan Ryan, Chief Executive, Courts Service regarding providing a note on the proposed development of Wexford Courthouse is to be noted and published.  Item 4A.3, correspondence, dated 17 December 2012, from Ms Marie McLaughlin, principal officer, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding providing information requested by the committee at its meeting of 13 December 2012 is to be noted and published.  <\/p><p>  On item 4B, individual correspondence and-or complaints, correspondence, dated 12 December 2012, from Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan regarding the examination of multinational corporations' profitability and tax practices is to be noted and published.  Our remit is much narrower than our counterparts in the UK who conducted such an enquiry.  We cannot do this but we will look for a note on the issue from both the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners and we will examine the issue of tax avoidance at our meeting in 2013.  It is not within our remit, unfortunately, to call in any multinational corporation as witnesses.  I will inform Deputy O'Sullivan of that.  <\/p><p>  Documents relating to today's meeting include item 4D.1, correspondence, received 13 December 2012, from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade regarding a briefing paper on matters to be considered at the meeting of 20 December 2012, which is to be noted and published, and item 4D.2, correspondence, received 13 December 2012, from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade regarding the opening statement, which is to be noted and published.  <\/p><p>  The next item on the agenda is reports, statements and accounts received since the meeting of 13 December 2012.

The IDA and Enterprise Ireland are scheduled to meet with the committee on 31 January 2012.  However, the IDA informed us that the CEO, Barry O&rsquo;Leary, is now unable to attend the meeting.  The clerk has asked that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform provide a briefing requested by members in respect of the powers of inquiry Bill that will come before the Oireachtas next year and we will deal with Enterprise Ireland in the second half of that meeting.  Also, as I suggested last week, there are a large number of issues arising from our meetings on public-private partnerships which need to be dealt with centrally by the Accounting Officer of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and also by the Accounting Officer for the Department of Environment Community and Local Government and I suggest that we schedule a special hearing on this issue towards the end of February.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  <\/p><p>  Have members any other business to raise?  Members are very co-operative this morning.  Can we agree the agenda for the meeting scheduled for Thursday, 17 January at 10.00 a.m.?  We will meet with the utility regulators: the Commission for Aviation Regulation, the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Commission for Communication Regulation.  The agenda for the meeting will be their respective accounts for 2011.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012122000003#B00300","speaker":"965"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"2011 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts<br \/>Chapter 19 - Official Development Assistance<br \/>Vote 28 - Foreign Affairs and Trade<br \/>Vote 29 - International Co-operation","time":1355997600,"counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012122000003#B00700"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355997600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Mr. David Cooney (Secretary General, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) called and examined.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355997600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors' Gallery to turn off their mobile phones because the interference affects the sound quality of the transmission of the meeting.

Gross expenditure under Vote 28 amounted to &euro;209 million in 2011, the largest element of which was salary costs of 1,250 staff, which came to &euro;92 million.  Office premises expenses including costs associated with Ireland's network of embassies and missions abroad amounted to &euro;22 million.  The account shows that &euro;48 million was paid in contributions to international organisations while &euro;12 million was spent on support services for Irish immigrants.  Vote 29 for international co-operation is administered by the Department's Irish Aid unit.  Spending under Vote 29 accounted for 79% of the official development assistance provided by the State in 2011.<\/p><p> Chapter 19 is compiled each year to provide an overview of Ireland's official development assistance programme and its delivery.  Having grown over several years to a peak of &euro;921 million in 2008, expenditure on official development assistance declined in each of the past three years.  The total programme spend was &euro;657 million in 2011.  As the committee is aware, the UN has a long-standing target for developed countries to contribute development aid equivalent to 0.7% of GNP each year.  Ireland's programme expenditure reached a peak of 0.59% of GNP in 2008, which had fallen back to 0.52% in 2011.  Development aid is channelled through a variety of partner organisations, including Government bodies, NGOs, civil society organisations and multilateral aid agencies.  The delivery channel used in each target country depends on the type of assistance required and the conditions which exist there.  Risks of fraud, corruption and misappropriation are significant factors to be taken into account in devising an aid delivery strategy.  Robust systems are required to provide assurance to taxpayers that funds reach their intended destination, are used for their intended purposes and that projects have the desired impact.  The chapter therefore examines the Department's systems for audit and evaluation of its spending.<\/p><p> The Department has put in place a specialist evaluation and audit unit which aims to provide assurance that funds are used for their intended purpose and that value for money is achieved.  The primary focus of the unit's audit work is the assessment of the appropriateness and reliability of the accounting and financial management systems of the partner organisations through which aid is delivered.  The work of the unit is overseen by the Department's audit committee.  In early 2011, the unit adopted a new policy of carrying out formal assessments of public financial management systems in countries where aid is channelled through governmental systems.  These assessments encompass all elements of systems including budgeting and planning, accounting, auditing, reporting and local parliamentary oversight.  There is a particular emphasis on assessing the status, independence and capacity of national audit offices.  The policy is to carry out two assessments during each five-year strategic plan for a programme country.  The first assessment is carried out at the planning stage and concentrates on the risks associated with channelling funds through governmental systems.  The second assessment is at the mid-point of the five-year term and focuses on any changes to the public management financial environment.<\/p><p> The Department has reported that audit coverage of approximately 90% of expenditure in programme countries has been achieved in recent years through a combination of activities carried out by the Department's internal auditors, audits commissioned by Irish Aid or partner organisations and reports from national audit offices in recipient countries.  Qualified opinions were expressed in relation to 7% of the programme country expenditure in 2009 for which audits have been completed indicating that material concerns had been identified in the course of audit.  For a further 38% of Irish Aid expenditure in programme countries, the implication of the audit reports received was unclear.  This included scenarios in which either the report received expressed no clear opinion or the national audit office expressed a qualified opinion on one department or ministry but it was not possible to identify the precise amount of Irish Aid expenditure to which the opinion related.  We recommended that the Department establish a central system to record all audit reports received and to record and track over time the proportion of expenditure in each programme country receiving qualified or adverse audit opinions.  Clearer audit assurance must be sought where it has not been obtained in the past.<\/p><p> Irish Aid also provides funding on a multi-annual basis to support the strategic plans of five large Irish NGOs.  The evaluation and audit unit audits the control structures and governance arrangements in these organisations on a cyclical basis and completed audits in 2011 of grants awarded to GOAL and Concern.  At an overall level, the audits found that both organisations had complied with the requirements of the schemes and that expenditure had been properly accounted for, however the audits raised certain issues on corporate governance in GOAL.  The accounting officer will be able to outline the extent to which these have been addressed.<\/p><p> The unit also carries out an extensive programme of evaluation of aid on a cyclical basis co-ordinated with its strategic planning and formal procedures to track and follow up on recommendations.  Evaluations completed in 2011 of the country strategies for Zambia and Mozambique found that both were having a positive impact while highlighting a number of issues to be considered in the context of development of the next country strategy papers.  Following the recent field trip, members of the committee have first-hand knowledge of the work being done in Mozambique, the impact being achieved and the control issues which arise and how they are dealt with.  To facilitate meaningful evaluation across the entire programme of development aid, the chapter recommends that the Department should ensure that funding provided to partner organisations is linked to appropriate and measurable targets.<\/p><p> The committee is aware that since chapter 19 was completed, the Ugandan auditor general has reported on the misappropriation of &euro;11.6 million of donor funding, including &euro;4 million contributed by Irish Aid towards reconstruction in the north of Uganda.  It was not only a serious crime against the Irish taxpayer but also against severely disadvantaged communities in northern Uganda who were expected to benefit from infrastructural developments in health, education, water, sanitation and roads.  The accounting officer will be able to brief the committee on the outcome of the Department's investigations to date into that matter.  I intend to review the circumstances surrounding the misappropriation during the audit of the 2012 appropriation account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012122000003#B01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355998200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me to assist in its consideration of the 2011 appropriation accounts of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I am joined by colleagues who have a particular knowledge of aspects of the Department's work which may be of assistance.  I understand the committee has been supplied with general briefing material on the Department which gives a factual summary of its main areas of expenditure and receipt and I do not propose to rehearse that information in my brief opening remarks.  I will instead address a number of issues I know are of particular concern to the committee.  I thank the committee for taking time to travel to Mozambique to examine the Department's development programme there.  I look forward to discussing with members their comments on conclusions.  The programme in Mozambique is Irish Aid's largest priority country programme and is closely managed by results.  It demonstrates how Ireland can make an effective contribution to the fight against extreme poverty and hunger, help to build national systems and move in our lifetimes towards a scenario in which bilateral relations are defined primarily by mutually beneficial economic and trading relationships.<\/p><p>  The committee's visit to Mozambique took place against the backdrop of the misappropriation of &euro;4 million of Irish Aid funds in Uganda, which was uncovered by that country's auditor general.  It came as a significant shock to all involved in the Irish Aid programme and to the wider donor community.  Ireland reacted swiftly and decisively and the donor community has followed our lead.  On the Department's recommendation, the T&aacute;naiste immediately suspended all funding through Government systems in Uganda.  At our insistence, the government of Uganda has agreed to reimburse the misappropriated Irish funds and will shortly do so.  On learning of the fraud, I dispatched a team of auditors from the Department's evaluation and audit unit which reports directly to me to investigate the matter in Uganda.  The team's report has been made public and I am committed to ensuring we implement all of its recommendations.  A key finding of the report was that the fraud was very sophisticated and elaborate and involved exceptionally high levels of collusion at senior level which could not reasonably or normally have been anticipated.  However, the report highlighted a number of important areas in which Irish Aid's management control systems need to be strengthened.<\/p> <p>It is clear that, in common with the other donors involved, our risk assessments, based in part on the very strong international assessments of Uganda's public financial management systems, result in a stronger focus on tracking results on the ground than on the movement of funds once they were received by the Bank of Uganda.<\/p><p> Following receipt of the report from the evaluation and audit unit I initiated a full review of all management systems across the bilateral programme to ensure that risks are being identified and managed appropriately.  I directed the ambassadors, who are the sub-accounting officers for the country programmes, to carry out a full review of their management and risk assessment systems.  I have already received their responses and I have asked the evaluation and audit unit to examine them and identify matters in need of attention.  I am arranging to meet the ambassadors to review our systems and to underline the critical importance of managing risks effectively in all programmes supported by Irish public funds.  This forms part of a further general strengthening of the Department's risk management arrangements, which I have appointed a chief risks officer to lead and direct.  I am also seeking sanction for the recruitment of a professionally qualified chief financial officer to oversee financial controls across the entire Department, including the development programme.<\/p><p> I am ready to answer any questions the committee may have on this matter, on its visit to Mozambique or on the wider Irish Aid programme managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I am also happy to address any of the diverse range of policy, administrative, programme management and public service functions that the Department conducts through its headquarters staff and network of 73 diplomatic and consular missions abroad.<\/p><p> In the period covered by the 2011 report and more recently, the Department has continued to contribute actively to the drive to rebuild Ireland's international standing.  The historic back-to-back visits of Queen Elizabeth II and President Obama were successfully organised in 2011.  Each visit in its own way represented a major milestone in the consolidation and development of these key relationships and appreciably enhanced Ireland's overall image and profile in Britain and the United States.  Ireland is concluding a successful year of chairmanship-in-office of the OSCE, which culminated in the recent ministerial council meeting in Dublin, the largest intergovernmental conference ever held in the State.  External feedback on the organisation and management of the complex logistics and agenda surrounding the meeting has been very positive and Ireland's general performance in the chair will contribute valuably to the external perception of our country.<\/p><p> Ireland's recent election to the United Nations Human Rights Council for a three-year term, commencing next month, achieved in the teeth of very strong competition, was a further morale-boosting reminder of the standing Ireland has earned and continues to enjoy in the international community.  We are also about to assume the Presidency of the Council of the European Union for the seventh time.  My Department is committed to making its full contribution to a successful Presidency performance, delivered with maximum cost efficiency.<\/p><p> The Department continues to reduce its cost base and to make economies.  Like all public service organisations we are absorbing substantial reductions in resources, both human and financial.  However, despite a drop of 12% in our staffing complement I believe we have managed to maintain the range, quality and geographic reach of the various services we provide.  We have achieved significant efficiency gains through ambitious internal organisational restructuring, consolidation of functions and streamlining of our business processes.  Regrettably, at the end of 2011 it was found necessary to close three resident diplomatic missions, in East Timor, Iran and the Holy See.  The committee may recall that the matter was discussed when I last appeared before this committee in April of this year.  Overall, the annual administrative cost of the delivery of the Department's functions has been reduced by over 20% over the past four years.  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to make this short statement.  I will do my best to assist him and his colleagues in their considerations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012122000004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Cooney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355998800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cooney.

I will go straight into the interim report on Uganda and the &euro;4 million that was misappropriated.  I understand that the money will be in our account within the next couple of days, which is good news.  I do understand that this affair has had a profound impact politically and otherwise in Uganda.  It is fair to say that the auditor general there did his job.  Civil society played its part in uncovering this and there has been a significant fallout, not just here and not just in Uganda but with the other donors.  They followed our lead in the aftermath of the situation.  The individuals responsible for implementing the controls bypassed key controls and there was massive collusion, not just in political circles but with the Bank of Uganda.  On the donor side, controls were not applied, which made the fraud easier.<\/p><p>  Section 4 of the report states that in cases of payment made to the Ugandan Government in 2010 and 2011, in some instances receipts were not on file.  Irish Aid financial regulations require that a receipt be retained but are not adequately specific on the level of detail required.  Ideally a receipt should detail any subsequent transfer of funds to specific accounts.  The obvious question for this committee is how that happened.  How is it that receipts were not on file?  How is it that receipts did not detail subsequent transfers of funds?  Has Irish Aid checked the other programme countries to see whether that was standard practice or whether it was isolated in Uganda since the situation there came to light?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012122000005#D00400","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355998800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>In general terms, this fraud has created an extraordinary storm in Uganda and has convulsed the political system there.  I am sorry to say that this &euro;4 million may have had the greatest impact on Uganda, not for the reasons we would have wished but because the exposure of this fraud perpetrated by the Ugandan system has forced the whole country to face up to the existence of corruption in high places there.  It has also been extremely traumatic for the Irish Aid programme and for my Department and most particularly for the embassy in Uganda.  The extent of collusion at the highest levels of the public service and the exposure of the fraud was unprecedented in our experience for an aid programme.  We have been asking ourselves how this could happen.  Obviously the evaluation and audit report has identified some weaknesses in our system.  I believe it happened primarily because we were focused on the delivery end, where fraud is most likely to take place.  When the money reaches the ground it is most vulnerable to misappropriation.  The World Bank and the British Department for International Development, DFID, had made some quite detailed examinations of the Ugandan public financial management system and had expressed themselves satisfied with the procedures in the Bank of Uganda.<\/p> <p>In common with the entire donor community, perhaps we were not as alert to the possibility of this type of fraud as we should have been and as we will be in future.  In terms of what went wrong in Irish Aid, or more appropriately, in the roll-out of the programme in the embassy in Uganda, arrangements under the memorandum of understanding governing the programme which should have involved the money being tracked through the system were not implemented by our embassy or by the donors as a group.  We were all caught out.  This is something that should have been done but was not and needs to be done systematically.<\/p><p> When we paid the &euro;4 million into the account in the Bank of Uganda it was not transferred from that account into the account it should have been and, frankly, this should have been tracked.  There should be a way of tracking the money to ensure it ends up in the correct account.  Once money is put into an account into which many other donors also lodge money there is no way of dyeing it green and tracking through the system as it has become part of the wider pool.  However, we should have tracked it to its destination in the appropriate account.  We did not do so and we must look very seriously at this.  Management failures occurred in this regard.<\/p><p> When I wrote to all of the ambassadors I set out a series of questions I wanted them to answer, including whether we received receipts and whether money was being tracked.  This will be an essential part of our follow up.  The responses I have received are very reassuring, but we will not leave it there.  The evaluation and audit unit will investigate this very thoroughly, after which we will have a follow-up meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012122000005#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Cooney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355999400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Mr. Cooney cannot yet answer the question with regard to other programme countries as the evaluation and audit unit is dealing with it.

As far as the report is concerned financial management as set out in the memorandum of understanding was not sufficiently followed up by the donors in terms of ensuring they had a clear and proper overview of funding and expenditure in the programme.

We are the only donor with offices on the ground to determine when the money is coming down so all of our focus was on this.

The money went into the system and we were looking at what came out in the 55 districts.  We added up this money and ensured it was all delivered and that the roads and schools were built.  The PRDP, which is the major programme for northern Uganda, is very fragmented according to the report with many other donors, including the United States, working on a project approach.  With all of this fragmentation it is very difficult to have a full overview of the entire programme.  This is a problem for the Ugandan Government and all donors.

It was being delivered by UNICEF in Sierra Leone in this instance when its supply chain monitoring system identified a number of gaps.  UNICEF knew a certain amount of the food was missing and we dispatched our evaluation and audit representatives who determined approximately $700,000 worth was missing from the system of distribution in remote areas.  We took a very hard line.  We do not tolerate fraud.  UNICEF is a very good organisation which works very hard and we acknowledge that it works in difficult areas, but our policy is  one of no tolerance.  We worked carefully with UNICEF to identify the amount involved.  I was in New York and met with senior UNICEF management to explain our no tolerance policy and the need to give back the food.  The food was replaced in the warehousing system and we worked with UNICEF to ensure that monitoring systems were strengthened.  On receipt of assurances, we continued the programme.  To date, there has been no problem.  It has been a useful case study in which a problem was identified and reacted to quickly.

The inspector general provided a clear analysis of what happens and determined that approximately &euro;43 million was not fully accounted for, of which &euro;19 million has been returned, leaving a gap of approximately &euro;20 million.  Of the $22 billion which has been disbursed by the Global Fund, Ireland has provided approximately $140 million.  The amount of our money that would be represented in the unaccounted for figure would be a few thousand euro.  The Global Fund has been significantly strengthened over the last two years and we should note that it is the organisation most responsible for turning the tide on HIV\/AIDS, TB and malaria over the last five years.

I accept that.  The report is also very good.  It is sufficiently self critical of the systems we had and points to what we need to do.  I have faith in how the Department will deal with this and the record of Irish Aid and the team involved with regard to the job that has been done in the last ten years.  This will be dealt with, and the &euro;4 million was dealt with very well.  Systems will improve.  The witnesses have pointed out the deficiencies in the Department that must be addressed.<\/p><p>  Since Uganda, however, there has been a political reaction to the &euro;4 million that went missing.  It troubles me slightly that some individuals, out of a perverted sense of compassion for the less well-off, are issuing press releases denouncing cuts that target the most vulnerable here, such as domiciliary care allowance and respite care allowance, while at the same time making statements to the media that the Irish Aid budget should be cut by 75%.  If anyone wants to witness human depravity at its worst - and I have - he should go to Africa and visit some of the projects conducted by Irish Aid before issuing any more press releases about ending the funds those people rely on to survive.  Anyone who wants to get elected to the D&aacute;il should not do it on the backs of the sick and the dying.  We have seen in the last week one particular Senator who did both, issuing a press release to talk about the most vulnerable in this country, while at the same time talking about effectively ending the Irish Aid programme.  People must be careful and not use this economic environment for such crass populism that will ultimately endanger people's lives.  We saw in Mozambique, and I have seen this a number of times with Irish Aid, and with the Department, people doing their jobs, saving other people's lives and doing important work.  We got a sense of that after going there, looking at the projects and meeting the people who do the job on the ground.  We were impressed by Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca and his operation, and those who work with him, throughout Mozambique.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012122000009#H00200","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speech","time":1356001200,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses to the meeting.  I am sure the Irish Presidency of the EU will be a busy time for them and I wish them all the best for that.<\/p><p>  Deputy Deasy makes an interesting point.  We all value the health service but we still bring the HSE in here and question it to the nth degree in the interests of improving the health service.  That is the purpose behind this exchange.  There is no question in the bulk of citizens' minds about the value of the work being done by Irish Aid projects.  The question in the mind of every taxpayer, rightly or wrongly, after the Uganda episode, is how does he know the euro he is giving to overseas development projects is getting to the vulnerable people Deputy Deasy mentioned.  Sadly, in Uganda, &euro;4 million did not get to those it was meant to get to and did not help those it was meant to help.  It is important to mention that.<\/p><p>  I have read the interim report on the Ugandan situation.  There are obviously issues with the Ugandan structures, as the report acknowledges, and there are obviously systemic problems, as Mr. Cooney and Mr. Rogers pointed out.  That is also taken as a given.  We cannot, however, escape the fact there are at least three references in this report to key failings by the embassy.  I have read and re-read the report and two things stick out in mind.  The sixth recommendation refers to within the Irish Aid system, which is acknowledgment the systems are in place but there was a failure at our end to comply with certain controls and that failure to comply lessened likelihood of earlier detection.  The recommendation mentions a particular failure to ensure adequate financial data were set out, as per the memorandum of understanding.  That is not a criticism of the structures or Uganda; it is a criticism of the Irish embassy.<\/p><p>  Page 14 refers to skills and capacity within Irish Aid and to a potentially problematic HR situation, where the internal auditor was on maternity leave, there was not sufficient face-to-face hand-over, the replacement auditor was engaged on a part-time basis, and that person did not have a sufficiently detailed knowledge of the complexities of the programme.  There was also the issue of receipts not being on file.<\/p><p>  Those are three concrete examples of failure on behalf of our embassy.  I do not use the word \"failure\" lightly and I am not looking for heads to roll for the sake of it but we must get to the bottom of this.  It is particularly important on the basis of Mr. Carlos's remarks, from which I took some comfort, that what happened in Uganda was at extreme variance with normal processes in other places.  If that is factored in, it leads me to believe that other embassies are following controls and obeying the Irish Aid structures.  If that is the case should the staff in the Irish embassy in Uganda put their hands up and accept some responsibility for what happened?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012122000009#H00300","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1356001800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Absolutely.  I will put my hand up and accept my share of responsibility for that.  I accept the report.  There was a failure by the embassy to track this money.  That should have been done.  I acknowledge the staff weaknesses that were pointed out.  As I said earlier, one thing worse than having a fraud is not following up properly on it.  The report from the evaluation and audit unit will be followed up.  We have learned lessons from it, particularly as to how we prepare our staff.  Our staff, when they go abroad to take up positions as head of mission, should be better prepared and trained in financial management.  There needs to be a proper handover.  As regards the auditor, it was a problem that the internal auditor was on maternity leave.  Anyone who has worked in a business knows that maternity leave is a fact of life that one must deal with when it happens.  We did bring in an interim auditor but that person did not have the same knowledge of the programme as the full-time auditor.  There is not too much of a way around it, but there were issues on the staffing side that we must address.  I do not dispute any of these reports.  There were failings.  In some cases it could have been individual failings.  In other cases it could be the system failing in that people were not properly prepared.<\/p><p>  We have sent out a very thorough letter and have received reports from all our ambassadors.  We will be looking at this extremely thoroughly.  We do not take this lightly.  We have enormous pride in our programme.  I know everybody involved in Irish Aid feels mugged by what has happened.  We are determined that it will not happen again.  If we contributed to this in any way, which we clearly have in certain small aspects, we are determined to ensure that it will not happen again.<\/p><p>  As regards personal responsibility, my major concern about dealing with fraud is that we can deal with it properly and that people can deal with it openly.  My greatest fear is that the natural human instinct, to cover up to protect the programme, would happen, which would be a disaster.  I want to have a system in which people can own up to something wrong without thinking they will be sacked or whether the Secretary General will be fried by the Committee of Public Accounts.  Unless there has been dishonesty or corruption in our system or a complete failure of responsibility, we must be able to face up to shortcomings and deal with them.  I do not want people to be going about in fear if they discover a mistake or believing, if they discover they screwed up on something, that they must try to cover it up.  I want them to know that these things can be dealt with in a mature and responsible way.  The most important thing is to get on top of what happened and ensure it does not happen again.<\/p><p>  There were shortcomings in the embassy in Uganda.

The embassy staff, to their great credit, have put an enormous effort into working on the ground, travelling out there and setting up an office to ensure that all of the Irish taxpayers' euro are spent correctly.  There was a gap at the very top because they believed the money was safe in the central bank of Uganda because the IMF and the World Bank told them so.  The fiduciary risk assessment said the money was safe.  There was certainly a gap, as the Secretary General stated, in terms of the skills sets that we bring to the game.

What I can do is ensure the systems are in place and that everybody knows what they are expected to do.

I am not trying to finger somebody for doing this.  I do not want to go that route of having people in fear that they will lose their jobs because they have done something.

On the other hand it is universally acknowledged that we want to build institutions in a country and empower societies and countries to lead their own development and move towards a point where we can pull out of development assistance and have countries run their own development.  The more we can work through Government systems, the better.  If we are to achieve the millennium development goals then the more we can channel money through government systems, the better.  A balance must be found in building up reliable, accountable government systems.  The best way to do that is probably to build up reliable, accountable national institutions.  However, there are some people who believe that the risk is too great and this is a constant challenge for us nationally.  We only provide general budget support to two particular countries, Tanzania and Mozambique, but the European Union works through general budget support in a large number of countries.  The constant challenge is to get the balance right between effectiveness and the accountability issue.  That is what the report is about.  It is an annual debate and discussion and one which will come up throughout Ireland's EU Presidency as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012122000011#K01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Gaffey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1356003000,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I wish to make two final points.

In the past some people in the sector took the view that the question of remuneration of chief executives and others was a matter for the board.  However, we take the view - I gather the D&aacute;il and this committee take the same view - that if public money is channelled in large amounts to non-governmental organisations, it is a matter of public interest.  I believe this is generally accepted in most NGOs at this stage.<\/p><p>  Last year, we reformulated the long-term development grant process to 18 large NGOs and allocated some &euro;65 million per year.  We set up a new focus on the results to be achieved but also on the capacities and administration abilities of the individual NGOs.  One particular initiative involved the requirement in applying for such multi-annual funding to list the number, but not the names, of officials who are earning more than &euro;70,000.  From the applications received, the number of staff in the 18 NGOs, which have received funding this year and for the next four years, earning more than &euro;70,000 per year is 47.  We drew up memorandums of understanding with them on that money and we required that from now on, that is, from 2012 on, they should publish in their annual accounts these numbers by band of &euro;10,000 above &euro;70,000.  That specific information, not only the number earning above &euro;70,000 but the how many in each band above &euro;70,000, will be available in the 2012 accounts, which will come out in the first part of 2013.  I believe Irish Aid has played an important role in this regard in agreement with the NGOs in bringing out this level of transparency.  That aside, when it comes to how they respond individually to requests from the media and so on, it is really a matter for them.  Anyway, I believe that the environment has changed and that the Charities Act 2009 will change matters when the regulations are brought in.

My view on what happened in Uganda and our overseas aid programme was fundamentally changed by going to Malawi during the summer.  I wish to underscore heavily the comments Deputy Deasy ended with.  I spent one week at the end of August with Tr&oacute;caire.  It was an interesting experience to go with an NGO as opposed to going as part of an official body such as Irish Aid or the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I found it extraordinarily upsetting when I saw the conditions my fellow humans are in.  I found it even more upsetting that the people I was with informed me that what I saw represented great progress from where they had been five and ten years previously.<\/p><p>  I met several people, including our ambassador to Malawi, Liz Higgins.  I also met Anne Conroy from Irish Aid and I spent a good deal of time with the civil servants from the Malawian Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security in particular.  I was most impressed.  I followed some of the work that Anne Conroy and some of her colleagues carried out.  In many ways their work is embedded into the Malawian ministry.  When she was introducing me to people, I got the impression that she was almost part of the Malawian Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security organisational tree.  She did not suggest that she reported into a particular person but she said a certain person was someone she worked with closely.  He was a Malawian civil servant; I believe he was the head of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security.  I took two things from all of this.  The first was the degree of embeddedness, which I had not expected to see when I went over and I found it rather impressive.  The second point only made an appearance in our discussions when Mr. Rogers raised it.  He suggested that we should be mindful that we are discussing the developing world where they have particular difficulties.  The natural climate plays a large part but the remarkable misgovernance difficulties these countries have had for decades are a core contributory factor to the current difficulty.<\/p> <p>It is also the reason they are in such desperate circumstances.  We need to adopt a policy of appropriate realism about the situation in such countries.  My comment is not directed specifically at Malawi.  I only spent a week there but I noted that corruption, the use of taxpayers' money in ways we would regard as mind-boggling, is embedded in the governance systems and culture of these countries.  We must put in place the strongest systems possible with the understanding that some of the activities at government level in some of these countries are fundamentally unacceptable to us and they contribute to the difficulties in the first place.<\/p><p> Deputy Deasy finished his contribution with a speech and I am beginning with one.  What I regard as a good outcome of the Uganda situation is that the Ugandan comptroller and auditor general discovered it.  I agree that it is not all that possible to be positive because the situation was appalling.  However, the fact that it was uncovered by a Ugandan state official is very positive.  <\/p><p> I am open to correction from the delegates on any of my comments.  During my visit I saw the Irish Aid operation which is very small but very professional and hard-working.  Irish Aid has a policy of including the local population and training them.  Would this involvement inhibit the ability of Irish Aid to highlight the kind of difficulty it may encounter in these environments?  If I were a local young person operating in one of these environments and I became aware of corrupt activities being perpetrated by the most powerful people in my own country, I would think carefully before putting up my hand.  We have seen the difficulty encountered by whistleblowers in Ireland.  It is an entirely different scenario in some other countries.  I acknowledge that the delegates are the experts in this regard and I am open to correction.  My question is about the strategy of localisation and whether this creates difficulties for calling out the kind of problems that may be there or are suspected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012122000012#L00900","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1356003600,"counter":109,"content":"<p>The Deputy has made a couple of points to which I will respond.  On the general point about aid, I am delighted that Deputy Donohoe visited Malawi.  I only wish we had the facility in the programme to bring every Irish citizen out to see the work being done in the field.  The aid programme says a lot about the people of this country.  I am not responsible for setting the level of the aid programme which is a Government decision.  However, I acknowledge that we have kept it at the current level.  There is much to feel bad about over the past few years and quite a few things we might feel ashamed about but when we look back, this level of aid will be one of the things in which we can take great pride.  Notwithstanding our own problems, we still find the time and money to help people who are less well-off than ourselves.  This is part of the Irish tradition.  When the country was a lot poorer, people still found the capacity to support our missionaries around the world who were working with people less well-off than themselves.  I just wish we were in a position to show the Irish people not only what we are doing, but also to show them the abject conditions in which many of our fellow human beings live and the impact of even a small amount of help given to them.<\/p><p>  I was in Malawi earlier this year to visit our aid programme which I regard as having a number of very inspiring and positive elements.  Deputy Donohoe mentioned political misgovernance.  Malawi has had a recurring problem with misgovernance.  When I visited earlier this year, the previous president, Bingu wa Mutharika, was still in power.  He was a man who did a lot of good things when he first became president but, as they say, power corrupts and this was certainly the case with him.  He became very authoritarian and he was at total odds with the international donor community.  He died during the course of the year and his successor as President is Joyce Banda.  This is a very positive development from our point of view.  She has worked with us and she has visited Ireland.  We are hopeful that Malawi is on a better trajectory now.  Clearly, issues of governance exist in underdeveloped societies.  We need to remember that they existed in Europe when Europe was at a similar stage of development.  Much of our work is to support governance in an effort to improve it.<\/p><p>  In our view, we are entirely right to use local people in our programmes.  We do not simply give them the programme and then throw away the keys.  Our people are on the ground observing at macro level the developments in the country and the issues of governance.  At governmental level we do not need the locals to tell us when things are not good.  Perhaps at the micro level, if someone on the programme is skimming off at distribution level, then we rely on the people working at that level to inform us.  That is a risk not only for governments, but for NGOs.  We have experience of such occurrences in NGO programmes.  When one employs and trusts local people, it is unfortunate that, human nature being what it is, that trust is not always rewarded.  One must rely on the people one is working with.  I have no doubt that employing and empowering people and bringing income to the local level is the way to go, but we have to be vigilant.  That is the reason we keep our own people on the ground.  The greater the risk, the more determined we are to have our people on the ground.  This is the case in Karamoja in Uganda.  We are the only donor with people on the ground watching how the programme is being run, watching how the outputs are being managed.  It is all part of the risk that goes with operating in these areas but we have to help people to grow.  This is what had to happen in Europe.  When we look back from our relative comfort, we must remember that European society saw a lot more corruption and mismanagement in the past and we are still not immune from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012122000013#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Cooney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1356003600,"counter":110,"content":"<p>In 1990, I counted what I regarded as three democratic countries in Africa and there are now more than 35.

However, it is a long journey.  In my view, development co-operation means we need to have an exit strategy.  We do not want to be discussing charity to developing countries in 25 years' time.  We need to be able to end development aid in our lifetime.  I think this is under way.  As the Secretary General has said, the only way to do this is to empower populations, to ensure democracy, to protect human rights and to ensure those universal values are institutionalised across the Continent.  That is beginning to happen.  Although we hear all the bad news, there is an equal amount of good news.  The Deputy has seen the good news.  However, there is a long journey yet to travel.

Despite the huge progress being made, it is important to recognise that these are extremely difficult places in which to work, with real challenges from a governance and administrative point of view.  Ireland is operating within that environment and from what I have seen, I am absolutely satisfied that we are doing as good a job as is possible in managing this issue.  I thank the Secretary General, his staff and everyone else for their attendance.  On completion of the investigation, I emphasise the importance of publishing the report in the manner in which the Department has to date.  In their capacity as public representatives, members must deal with the question asked as to why, at a time when funding for respite care grants is being cut, money is being spent in other countries.  Having seen it, I now know the answer, but not everyone will be able to see it.  The way members can answer such questions is for the Department to continue to be as transparent about the work when it is completed.  That will provide a good answer to that legitimate question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012122000015#O00100","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1356004800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>If members bear with me, I have a few questions.  I do not know whether this is a speech because we have heard speeches, confessions and questions and it is Christmas time.  We are moving at a reasonable speed in dealing with the issues involved.  <\/p><p>  To touch on what was stated about frying Secretaries General or Accounting Officers when they attend the committee, as chief fryer and someone with a reputation, I welcome the approach the Secretary General has taken in putting out the full facts, both in respect of what happened in Uganda and the first report and on the need within the Department for a qualified accountant or chief financial officer.  In general, were Accounting Officers to approach the work in this way, to deal with problems and not continually blame the system but to improve it, we might have an even better exchange and system by the end of the process.  Moreover, people within the system might not be fearful, as some are, of coming forward and explaining just where things or people do not work.  Ultimately, everyone around this table or anywhere else makes mistakes.  Be it in politics or business, humanity can be messy at times and one must deal with this.  Consequently, I welcome the frankness of the Secretary General's exchange.<\/p><p>  In addition, I wish to take up Deputy Deasy's remarks on recent press comments.  I agree with him and note that a trip to Africa certainly can change one's mind about matters.  It was my first time to visit Africa in this way and to look at the situation in Mozambique as we did, with some other members of the committee.  Briefly, to separate what we saw with regard to health and agricultural issues, the development of the economy, the clearing of landmines, the provision of the most basic water pump and how that was celebrated within a local community it had to be seen to be believed.  It has an impact and leaves a mark or a person with a clearer understanding of what is going on in such countries.  I will cite Ruair&iacute; de Burca, the ambassador to Mozambique, who noted that if it was perfect, we would not be in the country.  That comment stuck in my mind as we went through the different projects and saw their impact.  One can relate them to what happens in Ireland and how we stand.  For instance, we met a woman who was obliged to walk 27 km to look after her pregnancy and the birth of her child.  Similarly, there were schoolchildren who were obliged to walk 7 km to get water and the installation of a pump meant they could now go to school.  These are things we take for granted and one does not actually understand their full impact until one meets such people face to face on the ground.<\/p><p>  I will repeat a point I made to the staff of the embassy there - the volunteers we met were simply astonishing.  I refer to local people who volunteer to attend in the homes of people with AIDS and so on and to provide home care.  While I acknowledge this also takes place here, given the other challenges in people's lives there, it is astonishing to think they can park these challenges and take up a different set of challenges.  Moreover, by delivering and helping with the investment we are making in their country, they add real human value to what we are achieving.  I was also struck by the professionalism of the embassy staff, their approach to audits and desire to achieve the best with the money they were getting.  I do not question any of this and I am sure I speak on behalf of all the delegation who travelled there when I express our thanks to the ambassador, Mr. de Burca, and his staff for the businesslike agenda they put together for us.  Members of the committee question the use of taxpayers' money and I was conscious of the use of taxpayers' money to enable us to travel there.  I consider it to have been money well spent because we were scrutinising the spending of &euro;37 million of taxpayers' money in the context of Ireland's aid to that country.  As members have been asked how much it cost and where they stayed, I have asked the clerk to the committee to put on our website precisely how much it cost, where we stayed and what we did while in the country.  The public has the right to know this information and it should be our first task to do this as a committee.<\/p><p>  While commending all of this, there is an issue in respect of accountability.  It has nothing to do with the package delivered on the ground but pertains to the capacity of people within 128 districts in Mozambique and the capacity of those in government in the equivalent of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to do the work.  Frankly, this capacity is not present in Mozambique and I can only speak from our experience in the country.  On one side, one has young children signing for the pencils they will use to do their homework to account for them, while on the other, the capacity is not present, in human terms, to provide for the necessary accountability for overall expenditure within these districts.  Moreover, such a capacity is certainly not present within the court of auditors in that country, the president of which we met, and something must be done in this regard.  I cannot and will not stand over the movement of &euro;37 million from Ireland to Mozambique in the context of the level of accountability for it at that most senior level.  The president of the court of auditors states it audits 41% of the level of expenditure in the country and presented his accounts to parliament on 30 November, yet when I asked the question with a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer as to whether one could account for the money Ireland gave to Mozambique, it remained unanswered.  As Deputy Paschal Donohoe has noted, in such countries one cannot account for everything, which is the nature of the beast with which one is dealing.  However, regardless of whether the president would not or could not answer the question, it remained unanswered.  This is not satisfactory either from a public accounts point of view at our end or for the people who work for the Department at the other end because they are doing their best.  The least one should expect from a government getting most of its revenue through foreign aid is that it be able to state that in Ireland's case, to the best of its knowledge, most of the money was spent and that capability levels within its governance structures were being improved.  That was the key issue for me and something must be done about it.<\/p><p>  What are we going to do about it?  This question must be answered because arising from this hearing and following the committee's visit there will come a report that will be laid before the D&aacute;il and the committee will be obliged to make recommendations.  I want to be able to make a recommendation, as I am sure other members do, that will complement the work being done by the Department.  While it has a list of achievements, this issue must be sorted out.<\/p> <p>What is Mr. Cooney doing about the issue of giving strength on the ground and influencing the equivalent of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office to at least respond directly to a country that is giving &euro;37 million in a way that will give us confidence to continue the aid programme?  That has to be done at senior level.  There is absolutely no question in my mind about that.<\/p><p> I have another question for Mr. Cooney.  In Mozambique - I referred to this as the happiness table - out of total expenditure audited for 2009, 17% was qualified and 26% was counted as \"other\".  I understand Mr. Cooney's point that we cannot get a 100% bill of health, although we can strive towards it, and we did have one in Vietnam.  Surely there are signs for the departmental auditors to pick up and say: \"Hang on.  If there is a query there, the lads back home and those fellows on the Committee of Public Accounts will certainly raise concerns over that, so let's improve our methodology of accounting or audit\".  If this had been the case, we would have obtained incremental improvements from 2009.  There were indicators that things were not all good in Mozambique and Uganda.  Yet we did not seem to react as quickly as I would have expected, given the level of funding and its importance for such countries.  I am not pointing at any one individual.  However, can Mr. Cooney give me a sense of why the signs were not recognised, including the issue of capability in the districts and the auditor general's office?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012122000015#O00200","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1356005400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Before I address the Chairman's questions, I thank him for his kind remarks about the committee's trip to Mozambique.

The Chairman's concerns about capacity are well founded and we have those concerns too.  As regards the Chairman's meeting with the national audit office - the Administrative Tribunal - the way in which the president of the tribunal responded to the Chairman's inquiry was unfortunate.  He basically did not respond to it.  I mentioned earlier the work that is being done to improve capacity there and the fact that Irish Aid has not been in the lead, so I will not go through it again.  It is being done by the Germans and Scandinavians.  In all honesty, the president would not be able to say that he specifically audited a line of Irish Aid funding.  He should of course be able to say that he audited the government budget as a whole, including, therefore, the money that Irish Aid put into that budget.  It is certainly regrettable that his answer was not as solid as it should have been.<\/p><p>  As regards what we will do about those weaknesses, the Chairman has put down a challenge that we will have to pick up.

While I do not wish to make excuses, there are a number of issues concerning formality and translation.  In addition, he had just sent his report to parliament and perhaps felt slightly precluded from talking about it in detail.

I do not accept for one minute, as I said to Mr. Gaffey before, that the president of the Administrative Tribunal could not comment on the report as it was being presented to parliament around 30 November.  This is a question of giving &euro;37 million, and more at times, to a country.  It is a substantial amount of that country's revenue.  He should have acknowledged that he was speaking to this committee that is trying to get answers, yet he gave no answer.  It was not because he was waiting to give the accounts to parliament.  Neither was it a translation issue; he has perfect English.  I came away from that meeting absolutely furious because of the fact that he was not clear and concise about his answer.  Up to then, we had received clear and concise answers from everybody, including individuals who were not directly employed by the embassy.  They were local, qualified people who were giving their own interpretation of how things could be done.  In fact, one lady who was very well qualified and assisted in the audit process said we were asking things of Mozambique that we do not even do ourselves at home in the context of auditing.  There was a fairly robust exchange about all of this stuff.  They have an accountancy system out there that would be well used across Departments in Ireland.  I am thinking particularly of the HSE.  That is a fact - it is a very good system.<\/p><p>  In responding, Mr. Cooney should bear all of that in mind.

I was appointed to the board of Bank of Ireland in January 2009. I have been a member of the board since then and a member of the nomination and governance committee. The committee oversaw the complete renewal of the board's non-executive directors, none of whose tenure at present pre-dates 2009.  As a member of the committee, I contributed to the successful implementation of compliance with very substantial new governance codes, including the Central Bank of Ireland's corporate governance code for credit institutions and insurance undertakings which became effective from 1 January 2011; the revised version of the UK corporate governance code; the Irish corporate governance annex to the listing rules of the Irish Stock Exchange; and the Central Bank of Ireland's fitness and probity requirements.<\/p><p>  Over that time 5,200 people in Bank of Ireland have been put through the required due diligence and assessment in accordance with these stringent fitness and probity requirements.  As a public interest director I see it as my function to ensure continued monitoring of compliance with these standards.<\/p><p>  The committee has presided over very significant change in the top echelons of the bank.  Of the 61 people on the board, group executive and direct reports to the group executive, at 30 September 2008, 62% have left or will have left the group in the next couple of months and 28% are in new roles.  All of the non-executive directors have left the group over that period as have five of the eight group executive team.  We now have a new experienced board.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank mandated a review of corporate governance at the Bank of Ireland by a major international firm in December 2010.  It concluded: <blockquote>The form of BoI governance complies with best practice guidelines.  We have also found no evidence that there are any major weaknesses in terms of how governance is &quot;lived&quot; at BoI. Finally, when comparing Bol with benchmarks, we found its governance to be broadly in line with international banking peers, and Board effectiveness to be better.<\/blockquote>The external review of board effectiveness in the fourth quarter of 2011 concluded that &quot;Board performance exceeded benchmarks on 45 dimensions out of 50 including critical areas such as knowledge, challenge and dissent&quot;.  In addition, the Bank of Ireland's restructuring plan has been agreed with the European Commission.<\/p><p>  I have been a member of the group remuneration committee from January 2009 to date and became chairman of the remuneration committee in January 2012.  During that period, the committee oversaw a major change in remuneration levels and employment structures in the Bank of Ireland.  Taking into consideration the changes in remuneration and reductions through voluntary redundancy in staff numbers, wage costs to the bank have reduced by about a quarter in the past four years.  There have been major changes to pay structures in terms of absolute salaries, variable pay and pension benefits.   More than 4,500 fewer people are working with the group since January 2009.<\/p><p>  The remuneration committee has ensured compliance with the very stringent provisions set out by the Minister of Finance, under the subscription agreement in 2009 and his subsequent letter of July 2011.  The latter was disclosed as part of the documentation in connection with the bank's successful recapitalisation, primarily from the private sector, in 2011.<\/p><p>  The remuneration committee led the revision of remuneration structures to ensure adequate reflection of risk in remuneration.  Specifically, it ensured the necessary changes were made to ensure compliance with the European Banking Authority requirements, in so far as possible in circumstances where bonus variable pay is not permitted in the Bank of Ireland.  This has included the identification of staff with particular influence on the risk profile of the group, the implementation of mandatory risk goals for all executives and managers, and the updating of the group remuneration policy to reflect the focus on risk.  <\/p><p>  The committee ensured appropriate public disclosures on remuneration in the annual report and accounts and Pillar 3.  The Central Bank of Ireland reviewed the group's compliance versus the EBA guidelines in 2011.  In addition, the Financial Services Authority reviewed the UK subsidiary's remuneration policy statement for 2011.  The remuneration committee made significant revisions to group remuneration policy and required management to conduct significant upgrading of the group's database of information on employees' remuneration.<\/p><p>  As a board member and public interest director whose career has spanned both the business and political spheres, I take a keen interest in how Bank of Ireland has met its stated strategy of supporting and benefitting from economic recovery in Ireland.  With regard to lending, I shall deal with mortgages first.  With an existing share of about 20% of the mortgage market, Bank of Ireland has provided about 40% of the new mortgages in the market in the year to date.  The mortgage market has increased by 7% in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.  This was the first positive year on year growth since 2006 and the third quarter in a row to show an increase.  According to the Irish Mortgage Council, approvals in the third quarter of 2012 are up 14% year on year supporting the bank's expectation that this improving trend will continue.<\/p><p>  Bank of Ireland continues to demonstrate its commitment to the mortgage market. For example, a &euro;1.5 billion mortgage fund was launched in December 2011 to support first-time buyers and movers purchasing a home during 2012.  Due to the oversubscription of applications to the fund a new &euro;2 billion mortgage fund was launched in October 2012 to cover the remainder of 2012 and 2013.  Other initiatives include the bank's negative equity mortgages for both those trading up and those trading down which was launched in April 2012, participation in the NAMA deferred payment initiative and hosting the Bank of Ireland's home buyers' week in October 2012.<\/p><p>  I shall now discuss mortgage arrears management.  Bank of Ireland has mobilised significantly around the management of mortgage arrears.  It is a large-scale programme that is well under way in the bank and supports our customers who are facing, or are in, financial difficulty with their mortgage repayments.  In the past year we have significantly increased the number of staff involved in our mortgage arrears programme.  We now have more than 700 staff across the group involved in the management of mortgage arrears.  We have made considerable investment in the training of our staff which is supported by internationally recognised experts in the field of mortgage arrears management.  We have the largest bank branch network in the country and we have trained mortgage adviser experts in each branch.  We also have mobile advisers throughout the country who can meet customers in their homes or an alternative location to their branches.<\/p><p>  We offer restructure options to between 400 and 500 customers every week and have added more long-term solutions to our products.  We have formally restructured more than 16,000 mortgages and more than 86% of those customers whose mortgages have been formally restructured are meeting their contracted payments.<\/p> <p>We also have a significant number of customers on informal arrangements with us.<\/p><p> Bank of Ireland business banking has achieved, and will exceed, its &euro;3.5 billion SME lending target for 2012.  This figure represents the bank's approvals for new and increased credit facilities for businesses and farmers.  Credit approved for customers seeking restructured facilities are excluded from these figures as reported by Bank of Ireland.<\/p><p> The &euro;3.5 billion represents a 16% increase in approvals in the year to date when compared with 2011, which is as a result of increased demand from several sectors in the Irish economy.  There has been increased demand from customers in the health care, manufacturing and hospitality sectors, and lending to farmers has also remained strong.  Increased demand for asset and commercial loan finance has also been a feature.  Of particular importance is the fact that lending to businesses and farmers has increased in all regions throughout the country, underpinning Bank of Ireland's confidence in its nationwide branch network.  Lending to Dublin businesses was up by 27% compared to last year.  With more than 40% of businesses located in the capital the bank believes this indicates that confidence is returning, as evidenced by the growth we have been seeing in credit demand from viable businesses in the second half of the year.<\/p><p> Bank of Ireland has just completed its seventh national enterprise programme in which we organised 80 events and networking meetings that more than 5,000 businesses and farmers attended.  Some 1,500 businesses also took the opportunity to showcase their products and services in Bank of Ireland branches.  In 2013, the bank will roll out a series of free SME lending clinics which aim to explain the lending application process primarily to start-up and micro-sized businesses.<\/p><p> We have an increased lending target of &euro;4 billion for next year and we are determined to achieve it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012122000003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355996700,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Thank you Mr. Walsh.

At the request of the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, I agreed to have my name included in a list of people who would be available to be appointed as public interest directors.  I was appointed from that list to the board of the Bank of Ireland in January 2009.<\/p><p>  As a board member I worked on the development of a strategy to stabilise the bank in order to safeguard the investment made by the taxpayer and to provide the public with an effective banking service.<\/p><p>  As a board member I have contributed to the significant progress made by Bank of Ireland in reducing the risk exposure of the State and moving it ever closer to being able to fund its operations without State support.  In September 2008, the State was guaranteeing &euro;136 billion of liabilities for the bank under the exceptional eligible liabilities guarantee scheme, generally known as ELG.  This amount  was down to less than &euro;26 billion in November 2012.  In its trading update on 13 November 2012, the bank announced that it had prepared for and was ready for the expiry of the ELG scheme.<\/p><p>  The bank has made significant progress in funding itself in the market without the support of the State guarantee.  Let me give an example.  Last week it raised &euro;250 million in ten-year subordinated debt and last month it raised &euro;1 billion in three-year asset-covered securities.  Both issues received strong market support even though they were not supported by a State guarantee.<\/p><p>  Bank of Ireland received a total cash injection of &euro;4.8 billion from the Exchequer and is very grateful to the Government and the taxpayer for that support.  The public interest directors and the board and management of the bank are making every effort to repay that money.  Already the bank has made cash payments of &euro;2.7 billion to the Exchequer.  This is composed of guarantee fees of &euro;1.3 billion, interest on the preference shares and on the contingent capital instrument of &euro;500 million and &euro;900 million in respect of warrants repurchased and recapitalisation fees.  In addition, I am confident the remaining State holding of &euro;2.8 billion of preference shares and contingent capital, which carry a coupon of circa 10% per annum plus the 15% of equity held by the State, will be profitable investments.<\/p><p>  I have been a member of the board audit committee since January 2009.  In that role I have taken a particular interest in ensuring the system of internal controls is fit for purpose and that the provision for bad and doubtful debts included in the accounts is well supported.<\/p><p>  As a public interest director I was anxious to ensure that risk governance at Bank of Ireland would be developed to ensure as far as possible that taxpayer support would not be required in the future.  In that context I was asked by the board to chair a group of non-executive directors to determine in the light of recent experience the most appropriate risk governance arrangements for the group and to recommend any necessary changes to the existing governance arrangements.  That group was established in February 2009.<\/p><p>  The work of that group had a strong public interest dimension because it was aimed at putting in place systems and structures that would avoid a repeat of the events that led to the taxpayer being called upon to support the bank.  As chairman of this group, I worked to bring about significant enhancements to the way in which risk was managed in the group.  The board readily accepted a recommendation that board-level engagement in risk oversight should be materially increased with particular attention being given to ensuring that risks were properly identified, assessed, controlled and managed and that strategy was informed by and aligned with the group's risk appetite.<\/p><p>  To put these changes on a firm footing, the board agreed in July 2009 to establish a board risk committee of non-executive directors and to restructure the executive risk committees.  To support the new risk structure, the board agreed to fund a programme of work designed to build up a uniform management information system across the Bank of Ireland group.  As a result of these changes, the board of the bank is in a much stronger position to direct, control and monitor the business.  As chairman of the board risk committee I played a key role in these developments.<\/p><p>  The major enhancement initiatives identified in 2009 have now been implemented and the progress the group has made in enhancing risk management has been recognised by external advisers.  In December 2010, Boston Consulting Group commented in its review commissioned in response to the Central Bank's risk mitigation programme that, &quot;risk management at BoI is broadly aligned with peer best practice.  There are no critical gaps and in some areas there is rapid improvement&quot;.<\/p><p>  In April 2012, Promontory Financial Group commented that its review commissioned in response to the Central Bank's risks mitigation programme that: <blockquote>...evidenced considerable strengths in the Group's risk governance framework reflecting a sustained focus from the Court in recent years.  Following the crisis, the profile of risk within the Group has been greatly enhanced and the Court and the Executive team are clearly focused on risk issues which receive detailed attention.<\/blockquote>  The board, the board risk committee and management are continuing to develop the risk governance structure to keep pace with best practice in the market and with the changing macroeconomic environment.<\/p><p>  I am happy to answer any questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012122000004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Considine"},{"type":"speech","time":1355996700,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Considine and Mr. Walsh for their opening statements.

The way I look at the public interest is that there are a number of dimensions to it.  At the State level, the first thing we have to do is repay the Exchequer and the taxpayer by remunerating the money they have loaned us - in other words, the &euro;2.8 billion of preference shares and contingent capital at about 10% a year.  We must enable the Minister to be in a position to cash in his shares if, in future, he so wishes.  The second thing is to provide a stable banking system to support the economy.  As the Chairman said, there is a real need to support enterprise and the rebuilding of the mortgage market.  We are doing both of those things.  Third, the governance changes I referred to are being made to ensure that never again will the Exchequer and the taxpayer be called upon to bail out the bank.  The fourth matter at that level is to generate the capital we will need to support that lending to the business and mortgage sectors.  In my view, they are top-level public interest requirements to which we must pay attention.<\/p><p>  The next level down is the sectoral level, which is about consumers, business people and mortgage borrowers.  While the Minister has not given us any specific directions in that area, it is clear from the guidelines that he has given us on lending to SMEs, that it is an area where he wants support for the economy.  Equally, it is clear from all of the debate that is going on about mortgages that the Minister wants us to give attention - as the Central Bank has made clear, as well - to how mortgage arrears are worked out.  That is what I see as the public interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012122000006#E01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Considine"},{"type":"speech","time":1355997900,"counter":267,"content":"<p>A question was raised about the public interest directors' remuneration.

There are consequences but these should ultimately look towards justice.  As the role of the witnesses is that of public interest director, I am not suggesting they have brought the public interest into disrepute.  On the contrary, I am of the opinion that the bank is in a far better position now.  The market capitalisation of the bank is about &euro;3.6 billion.  The reason for the increased value of a bank such as Bank of Ireland is that there were projected earnings to be made on the loans that were given out.  As the witnesses are aware, many of the mortgages given out in Ireland from 2005 to 2007 are 62.5% in arrears in the city of Dublin.  People have been given loans that will be paid back over 25 to 40 years.  It was a form of lending that had no basis in reality.  However, the repayments have a basis in reality when people's relative incomes have decreased and their capacity to repay those mortgages have decreased.<\/p><p>  The substantial element is that we as a generation, who are not represented on the board, are the people who are feeling the brunt of it.  I do not think there is anything in Bank of Ireland or any other bank to recognise debt forgiveness or debt write-down.  As my colleague Deputy Dara Murphy pointed out, this is the generation that is supposed to drive the economy and, at the same time, it is not getting a break out of what was a form of lending that had no basis in reality other than trying to achieve the bottom line in profit.

As the next year goes on, I think it will reduce that much further.  In relation to a number of other matters, it was given a directive to allocate &euro;3.5 billion to SMEs and has exceeded that figure in new and increased lending.  The Bank of Ireland has earmarked an increased amount for next year, some &euro;4 billion for small businesses.  The Bank of Ireland made provision of &euro;1.5 billion last year for mortgages.  That was fully taken up and a further &euro;2 billion is allocated for mortgages at the end of this year and for next year.  They have built up the number and capacity of people dealing with arrears to 739 staff and a trained person to deal with mortgage arrears provides this service in every single branch of the 250 bank branches throughout the country.  There is a menu of products to deal with mortgage arrears.  Let me add that Bank of Ireland has the least worst mortgage arrears.  Some 90% of 161,000 people who have owner-occupier mortgages are meeting their commitments fully.  By any of those yardsticks, Bank of Ireland is contributing to the development of the economy.

It is also in the interests of the State that the governance of the banking system should be strengthened to ensure we do not have a repeat of what happened previously.  It is in the interests of the State that the bank should be strong enough to lend to SMEs and mortgage holders, and the Bank of Ireland is doing that.  The bank has about 20% of the mortgage market and currently the rate of approvals is about 40%.  In the case of the SMEs, as we have said, we have exceeded our target of &euro;3.5 billion.

The bank has been supportive of the development role of the Government in the economy and that is in the public interest.  Some might not like to hear it, but the fact of the matter is the economy is slowly recovering.  That information is coming from a number of economic commentators and researchers whose job it is to examine such matters.  What we have done with mortgage arrears for example is to train, recruit and put in place more than 700 people to restructure mortgages to the tune of 400 to 500 per week.  We have retained our branch structure throughout the length and breadth of the country and trained personnel in every single one of those branches to give intensive care to people and provide a menu of packages because we want to keep as many people as possible in their homes.

Yesterday, I said I had a feeling of unreality listening to contributions.  It was akin to the film &ldquo;The Truman Show&rdquo;.  Today, I feel I am in a fog.  The reason is that this is the first opportunity to have an appraisal of the job of national interest directors on the board of Bank of Ireland.  They have been in place since 2009.  One could ask what has happened in that period.  First, what is the job description of the national interest directors?  We have discovered they do not have one; it is vague.<\/p><p>  Second, what has happened in the period to be appraised?  The bank effectively went bankrupt and the biggest exercise that had to be carried out was, first, to get an injection of share capital from the State, which it did.  I was at the annual general meeting where it was approved.  It was a joke that the life-saving injection had to be approved by the shareholders.  It is similar to having a formal meeting to approve life support for a patient in a hospital.  It was absurd, but people went through the charade.<\/p><p>  The next big exercise was the transfer of the NAMA loans to see how it would affect the bank.  They are the overview parameters.  The Bank of Ireland had a line-up on foot of the PwC exercise of &euro;16 billion of loans to go into NAMA and in the three months before the end of 2009 that figure was, unbelievably, revised downwards to &euro;12 billion.  I asked myself why.  The question was if &euro;4 billion less loans are being transferred to NAMA at a 30% discount it meant there would be a &euro;1.2 billion less requirement for capital, which would keep the bank out of State majority control.  That was the first thing.  As board directors, perhaps collectively and individually, they should have spotted that and wondered if it was a good judgment call.  It was a bad judgment call because the prudential capital assessment review that took place in March 2009 indicated that if Bank of Ireland got approximately &euro;5 billion before the year end all would be well and it could stay outside State control.  That was not a very honest exercise.  It would be much better if the bank had sufficient capital to do what it needed to do.<\/p><p>  Other speakers this morning asked where the bank stands now as regards writing down to honest collectable amounts the loans it had advanced over the period up to 2008.  The answer to that lies hidden somewhere in the fog of what the executive management, Mr. Richard Boucher, brought to us a few weeks ago.  Does either of the witnesses know the overall loan book of the bank off the top of their heads?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012122000014#N00600","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1356002700,"counter":450,"content":"<p>It is &euro;98 billion net of provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012122000014#N00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Considine"},{"type":"speech","time":1356002700,"counter":451,"content":"<p>Yes, it is &euro;105 billion gross and &euro;7 billion worth of provisions.

I will read them to you, if you give me one moment.  \"A non-executive director is a director who does not have a contract of service with the company and normally serves the company on a part-time basis.\"  Your role is that you were not actually elected to the board; you were appointed by the Minister of the day and have been there for the last four years.  As a non-executive director, you will have a management function in the running of the business other than assisting in the deliberations of the board.  You have a running function as a non-executive director.  You direct how the bank operates.  None the less, your legal powers and duties are identical to those of executive directors and for this reason you should ensure you have the same ability to obtain information from within the company as other directors, even though in practice you may use mainly summarised information submitted in the reports of the board.  How you gather the information on which you make your decisions can be in detail or in summary.<\/p><p>  More specifically, you have a duty of care which is required both by executive and non-executive directors.  In your situation, your duty of care is in reference to being a public interest director.  Your duties as a non-executive director will be intermittent and, as a result, you are not expected to give the same continuous attention to the company's affairs as that given by other executive directors.  We accept that.  However, Mr. Considine and Mr. Walsh are both there, having been well remunerated for four years to the tune of &euro;500,000 each.  On behalf of this committee, I am asking you what are you doing in the public interest.  You are servants of the State, operating on this board.  I can put out all the information here.  It says quite specifically that your duty under the legislation is owed to the Minister on behalf of the State.  That is why you are in there.  Your duty takes priority over any other duty you have as a director, even if it becomes inconsistent with the duty of the bank.  That is what it is.<\/p> <p>Legislation has been passed and people are hanging on by their fingernails, hoping for hope.  I am not interested in what Bank of Ireland is doing.  I am interested in what the public interest directors are doing with respect to the legislation.  That is what the committee wants to know.  I apologise for interjecting but we have arrived at the kernel of the roles and responsibilities of public interest directors.

I have always valued the role played by Oireachtas committees as a forum for real engagement with agencies and organisations from outside the Houses.  I genuinely appreciate the opportunity to, I hope, provide the committee with insight into my role in AIB.<\/p><p>  I understand the chief executive of the bank, Mr. David Duffy, and members of his team had a constructive meeting with the committee in October.  I assume as a result of that meeting members are probably <i>au fait<\/i>  with the current overall position of Allied Irish Bank in terms of the progress achieved in returning the bank to viability and the work ahead that must be completed.<\/p><p>  It is important for me personally and as a director of the bank to acknowledge the enormous debt owed by AIB to the Irish taxpayer, without which the bank would not exist.  As a member of the bank's board, all my efforts have been focused on actions to stabilise the institution, to help it regain viability and, by definition, to ensure the bank plays a critical role in the recovery of the economy and returns, over time, as much as possible of the State's investment.  This is a long and difficult journey.  Painful lessons have been learned from the financial crisis, lessons that are helping us in the reshaping of Allied Irish Bank as a strong bank, functioning without State support, keeping the impact on the customer central to all decisions.<\/p><p>  Like everybody else in this room and beyond I would like the bank to reach its goal quicker.  However, the current issues in the economy are unprecedented and unique and will take time to resolve.  The bank is vigorously implementing a strategy that will result in its return to viability while ensuring it plays a fundamental role in the recovery of the Irish economy.  Since my appointment to the board of AIB in January 2009, I have witnessed enormous and positive change in the organisation.  This re-organisation has ranged from a fundamental restructuring of the bank to a revised strategy to rebuild sustainability.  AIB has, at every stage, worked closely and constructively with the Central Bank and the Department of Finance through the relationship framework agreement.  I am pleased to say that AIB's relationship with Government and the regulator is constructive, open and marked differently from that which existed when I joined the bank in 2009.  <\/p><p>  When invited to join the board of AIB by the late Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, I was extremely conscious of the tumultuous effect the financial crisis had on the bank's relationship with Government.  That relationship is now much more constructive as the bank navigates a path back to viability.  The bank is in daily contact with the Department of Finance, senior management meet formally with Department of Finance officials on a monthly basis and the bank reports continuously to the Central Bank.  Like other company directors in the bank, I am, as a director, subject to the requirements of company law in the discharge of my duties.  My responsibilities are the same as those of other directors and I carry the same duty of care to our shareholders, namely, the Irish people, through the Government.  These duties are to protect and enhance the value of the company for the Exchequer.  The board has full responsibility for all operations and business of the bank in accordance with its legal and fiduciary duties.  It must ensure the bank is in compliance with all regulatory and legal obligations and must at all times, working with the management team, ensure business is conducted in a prudent and sustainable manner.<\/p><p>  I am also a member of Allied Irish Bank's board risk committee, which was established in the past two years, and a member of the nomination and corporate governance committee.  The bank's work is continuous and painstaking.  However, progress is evident on the ground.  A total of 2,000 bank staff are now employed in supporting customers experiencing difficulties with their loans.  We expect to see a rapid increase in the resolution of these types of loans in the next six months, where customers are working collaboratively with the bank.  I recognise the critical role of AIB in contributing to the resolution of unsustainable debt.  However, it is important to note that this is a complex issue and the bank's decisions in respect of debt restructuring must be based around the fundamental principle of any underlying affordability for the customer.  Any other outcome creates an expectation that debt will be written off, which is not economically viable.  In the year up to end October 2012, AIB approved &euro;1.2 billion in new mortgages, which is comfortably in excess of the bank's internal target for the year of &euro;1 billion.  The approval rate in the year to date is in excess of 70%.  During the same period, AIB's year-to-date SME lending reached &euro;3.75 billion, which is in excess of the Government's target for the year.  Approval rates for formal applications in the SME sector are in excess of 90%.<\/p><p>  There is constant debate in regard to whether the banks are lending.  Allied Irish Bank must lend to ensure it returns to a sustainable operating model that will allow it to generate its own capital and increase lending into the economy.  As a director, I acknowledge that the bank has more to do in terms of improving its processes and customer engagement on lending to viable customers.  However, the dynamics of the demand for new lending in the economy are complicated given the sheer volume of legacy debt which remains.  It is incumbent on all of us to change the message and to ensure people are not discouraged from seeking credit on the basis of perceptions.  The bank is continuously engaged in a process to promote lending through business initiatives for SMEs and mortgage holders and this will accelerate into 2013 as the bank seeks to implement its strategy more broadly. I am determined to ensure Allied Irish Bank supports the economy in its return to financial health in an expedited manner which demonstrates genuine leadership on the many complicated issues ahead while at the time treating customers fairly.  This is being done in full co-operation with the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. <\/p><p>   I understand the committee requires information in terms of my background.  I have a strong connection with the labour and trade union movement in Kerry.<\/p> <p>I also have a strong connection with the farming community in north Kerry, as my late mother came from a small-holding in Lixnaw.  There was, and is, a strong work ethic in my genes.  From the age of 14, I undertook summer employment in factories in Tralee, building sites in Birmingham or warehouses on Long Island.  This was all to help with defraying the expenses incurred in educational pursuits.<\/p><p> I am a graduate of Trinity College and qualified as a Barrister of Law at King's Inns.  I spent a number of years practising on the Munster circuit in the 1970s.  In 1979, I was elected to Kerry County Council and Tralee Town Council.  I was elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 1981 and became a Minister of State in the Department of Justice at that time.  I became leader of the Labour Party in November 1982, a position I held until 1997.  I was T&aacute;naiste, Minister for the Environment, and Minister for Energy during the coalition governments of the 1980s.  At that stage, I experienced difficult enough economic times.  I was again T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1993 to 1997, at which stage I stood down from the leadership of the Labour Party after 15 years.<\/p><p> Since exiting public life in 2002, I have been active in a number of business areas, especially in financial services and technology.  I have helped companies to develop business in the Middle East and Asia in particular.  I am particularly proud of my involvement with two companies based in Kerry, FEXCO and Altobridge, which are major employers in our region.  <\/p><p> I have also devoted an amount of time to my chairmanship of the R&eacute;alta Global Foundation, which is a charity involved in addressing the serious problems of HIV-Aids treatment for large numbers of people in Uganda.  In the past six years, we have raised over &euro;5 million, mainly for research in the area of anti-retroviral drugs in an effort to assist HIV-Aids sufferers in that country.  We also fund and manage an orphanage.  We have built three health centres in conjunction with the Ugandan government and have made a meaningful contribution to the quality of life for many citizens of that country. <\/p><p> Since my appointment to the board of AIB in January 2009 there have been 139 meetings of the main board.  There have also been 25 meetings of the board risk committee and nine meetings of the nominations and corporate governance committee since my appointment as a member.<\/p><p> In terms of my remuneration levels, in which I understand the committee is interested, I have received the following amounts of money since joining the board in 2009.  First, I would remind the Chairman that the first decision at my board meeting was to reduce directors' fees by 25% at that time.  I received the sum of &euro;26,000 in 2009, &euro;47,000 in 2010 and &euro;59,000 in 2011, bringing a total of &euro;132,000.  After a taxation level of about 54%, which brings it down to &euro;64,000, it would average about &euro;21,000 per annum for my services to the bank. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012122000019#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dick Spring","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1356006300,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have this opportunity to meet with the Chairman and other members of the joint committee and to discuss any aspect of my role as a Government-appointed director of the board of AIB.<\/p><p>  The committee has already heard details of the functions and duties of public interest directors.  Even though I am not a public interest director, as such, my position with AIB does not differ from that of my colleague Mr. Dick Spring.  I have carried exactly the same fiduciary responsibilities and onus of trust since I was appointed to the board in January 2010 as a Government nominee under the terms of the National Pension Reserve Fund Commission's preference share investment.  I am also deputy chairman of the AIB board and chairman of its risk committee since November 2010.  In this particular role I lead questioning of, and challenges to, the bank's risk tolerances levels, risk appetite on lending, and internal controls and procedures.  For my own part, I am clear that significant progress has been made in these areas since I joined the board.<\/p><p>  In addition to the clear legal imperatives that govern our functions, I am very much aware of the weight of expectation among the public that banks, particularly those in receipt of such large State support, should apply the utmost stringency and pragmatism to all their decision-making.  We have two critical goals here - to turn AIB around and restore it to viability, whilst ensuring that the bank contributes to economic recovery, both in terms of new lending and in resolving the significant challenges of customers in difficulty.  I believe that, as these goals are fully achieved over time, public sentiment will change and we will convert negative perception into positive reality.<\/p><p>  There is no clear definition of what is in the public interest at any given point in time.  Critically, however, the public interest can be served by ensuring the achievement of a sound, prudently-run banking system that can drive economic recovery through appropriate lending and offering security for deposit holders.  The duty of all of the board's directors is to safeguard the shareholder's interest which is, by definition, the Irish taxpayer who has supported this bank to such an enormous degree.  Without a return to viability and the reduction of dependency on the State, the common good will not be well served.<\/p><p>  I joined the AIB board almost three years ago, two years after the economic crisis broke.  In my time on the board I, too, have seen significant stabilisation and recovery in the bank and the pursuit of policies that will enable recovery: reduced funding costs; the aligning of loan pricing to funding costs; the reduction of bad debt provision levels; putting in place processes to allow for the systematic tackling of the mortgage arrears crisis, while assisting large numbers of customers in difficulty; and the achievement of lending to business targets, as set out internally and by the Government.<\/p><p>  Following the banking collapse and the unfolding financial crisis that businesses, individuals and families confronted, AIB has had to mobilise significant resources by way of response.  Untangling debt issues for businesses and home-owners does take time and the bank is coming to grips with the complexity of these problems and expediting an appropriate response.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge that the bank has more to do in these areas.  However, the complexity and scale of the problems cannot be underestimated and there is no simple and easy solution to these issues.  The bank must continue to work diligently, methodically and as expeditiously as possible to ensure viable long-terms solutions are put in place.<\/p><p>  Perception is a powerful force and AIB is also battling against the widespread view that it is still not lending to business.  However, the reality is that AlB's SME and mortgage-lending targets are being met and exceeded.  The perception that exists will, in large part, be changed by the continued focus of our staff in engaging positively with customers as they make formal applications for credit.  After almost three years on the board of this bank, I am confident that in time it will reach the objective of making a return to the Irish taxpayer while ensuring economic recovery.<\/p><p>  Since my appointment to the board in January 2010 there have been 102 meetings of the main board where I serve as deputy chairman.  There have also been 25 meetings of the board risk committee of which I am chairman.<\/p><p>  I gather that the committee is interested in my background, as well as that of Mr. Spring, so I will briefly go through that.  I joined the civil service in 1960 as an executive officer.  I was appointed to the Department of Industry and Commerce and was immediately sent to an outfit called An Foras Tionscal, which at that stage was the grant-giving agency of the IDA.  In mid-1963, I was successful in a competition for administrative officer in the Department of Finance.  I was assigned there to what was regarded at the time as one of the worst sections - the pensions section - which actually turned out to be quite interesting.<\/p><p>  When Dr. Ken Whitaker was appointed governor of the Central Bank he invited me down and I spent two years there which gave me some knowledge of monetary policy.  I then came back to the Department of Finance and was in the finance division, which dealt with all the financial affairs of the State.  I was also involved with the EU when we joined in 1972.  In 1985, I was appointed secretary of the Department of Defence when these positions were opened up to people generally in the public service.  On the change of Government in 1987, I was brought back to the Department of Finance by the then Taoiseach.  I was appointed as secretary of national debt management there, with a view to doing something about the national debt, which was a huge issue at the time.<\/p><p>  In 1990, under legislation passed by the Oireachtas, I was asked to establish the NTMA, which I did.  The aim was to try to get debt service costs down.  At the time, the debt-service was a huge burden on the Exchequer.  It was a question of whether to cut health, social welfare and education or the debt service costs.  Politically, the debt service costs were obviously much more acceptable.  That was the main reason for setting up the NTMA.  It went on to establish the State Pension Fund which at its peak had &euro;25 billion in it.  We also set up the State Claims Agency which dealt with anybody who wanted to sue the State or hospitals.  We also set up the National Development Finance Agency.  I ran that organisation for 19 years.  I retired, or resigned, just over three years ago.<\/p><p>  During the course of my career I was a member of the EU monetary committee in Brussels and was on the board of the European Investment Bank.  I was on other committees.  I was a member of the OECD's capital markets committee.  I was also part of the delegation to the IMF and World Bank boards.  I was chairman of the group that set up the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, EBRD, to bail out the countries of the former Soviet Union when it broke up. <\/p> <p>I have a diploma in public administration, a B.Com, a master of Economic Science and a PhD in Economics from UCD.  The President of France made me a Chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur for my efforts in setting the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, EBRD.  At present, apart from the board of AIB, I am on a number of other boards, both <i>pro bono <\/i>and others.  In terms of remuneration, which is available in the bank's annual reports, I received the following amounts in the execution of my various roles.  In 2010, I received &euro;98,000; in 2011 I received &euro;150,000.  I should add, as Dick Spring has said, roughly half of that amount goes back to the State and I never see it, the differential in the amounts between the two years is due to my appointment as deputy chairman and chairman of the risk committee with effect from 1 June 2010.  <\/p><p> I am happy to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012122000020#U00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Michael Somers","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1356006900,"counter":626,"content":"<p>Thank you Dr. Somers.

When Mr. Richie Boucher came before the joint committee in November last, he stated emphatically that directors of the bank, public interest or otherwise, are directors whose job under company law is to serve the interests of the banks.

At that stage I just wanted to make a clean break of things.  I had worked for 49 years in the public service.  He asked me if I would join the board of AIB and I said no to that request.

Under the 2010 Act, everybody was told their first obligation was to develop credit and so forth, legislation with which the committee is familiar.  I am the second longest serving director, after Mr. Dick Spring, on the board.  All the people appointed were new to me.  They were all on a list that the Minister for Finance had or were recommended to him by the chairman of AIB.  They all had to be cleared by the Minister for Finance.  Unless they were cleared by him, they were not appointed.  These directors are as much appointed by the Minister for Finance as I am.  By the way, I offered to go up for election, the same as everyone else, because there was an issue about whether we were regarded as independent non-executive directors.  I do not believe there is a significant difference between what we are trying to do, how we were appointed and the others on the board, four of whom are not resident in the State.<\/p><p>  We are all trying to get this bank back in order again.  It is essential for the economy to have a working banking system.  We have spent ages at this.  As this is an extraordinarily complex area, one needs people who know about financial affairs.  I heard Mr. Spring say on occasion that there are an awful lot of moving parts in this.  We are trying to keep track of all of these.  We are trying to get the bank funded and get more deposits in.

To pick up on what the Chairman asked about, namely, the fact that we had not come before the committee, we are quite happy to do so.  We are happy for the committee to formalise an exchange on an annual basis.  It is important in an exchange such as this that we can get information to the public that might not normally be disseminated.  I am not sure how interested people are in reading bank annual reports.<\/p><p>  Apart from our fiduciary duties under company law, the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act puts it all into a new ball game.  As Dr. Somers has said, all directors are now practically public interest directors.  I look on the public interest concept as being very wide in terms of making sure AIB is able to function.  It is a pillar bank and a major bank in the State.  It must be able to give credit.  If a bank is not lending, it is not making money, and if it is not making money, then it is not viable.  Without a functioning bank in the State, this country will not get back on its feet.  To be blunt, it has been a horrendous journey from the crisis of 2008.  The deputy governor of the central bank in the United Kingdom said that this crisis was of such magnitude that no politician, banker or economist currently alive has any experience of a crisis of such seriousness.<\/p><p>  A total of 48 of the top management in the bank who were there during the crisis are gone.  We are taking costs out of the bank on a daily basis.  We aim to take out approximately &euro;400 million between now and 2014 to bring our costs-to-income ratio down so that the bank will be viable.  At the end of all of that, apart from having a solid pillar bank, I hope we will be in a position to repay the taxpayer because the bank would not exist without the money that has been put in through the Oireachtas by the taxpayer.  However, it is one hell of a difficult journey.  We are giving it our all.  In fairness, we have a new team.  As Dr. Somers has described, we could not get a chief executive of the bank for a long time.  We had a number of chief risk officers who effectively ran out of the place.  They did not want to stay.

If the bank can do a good estimate now of what households and businesses need in loan write-down to get back to repayable amounts over their normal expected income levels in the next five to ten years, then it can present its best argument to the euro system that this is it and we are getting it right.

I draw the attention of the public interest directors to what Mr. Fergus Murphy of AIB said in answer to me when he was before the joint committee.  He said the sum written off thus far is &euro;600,000.  He said any write-offs will be minuscule or near zero.  He said that on a balance sheet of &euro;95 billion, &euro;600,000 is zero and that AIB was not writing off debt.  Do the public interest directors agree with that and do they believe that is the position the bank should take after the Personal Insolvency Bill is enacted?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012122000024#Y03200","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1356009300,"counter":710,"content":"<p>AIB will comply fully with the terms of the legislation.

There has been a great deal of discussion of debt forgiveness and what forgiveness means exactly.  I am long in the tooth and a Roman Catholic and forgiveness has a certain meaning to me.  It means one goes to confession and one's wrongdoings are forgiven.  While the bank is not going to engage in divine mercy, it will deal with individuals and consider the totality of their liabilities and their income and leave them with a sufficient amount of cash to have a reasonable quality of life.

This is the third set of hearings on this matter.  The context is simple - a general distrust of the public in the banking system and a lack of understanding or faith in the public interest directors.  Section 48 of the Act has been quoted at length.  There is clearly a need for the Minister to put in place guidelines for transparent lines of reporting, which is currently lacking in the system.<\/p><p>  I would like to touch briefly on the &euro;600 million referred to.  We met previously with officials from the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank at which time officials from the Bank of Ireland stated emphatically that the figure of &euro;3.5 billion represented new lending.  Mr. Duffy from Allied Irish Bank stated that &euro;600 million of the &euro;3.5 billion was new lending and the remainder represented restructuring.  Be that as it may, &euro;600 million in new lending is very little.  I do not concur that there is no demand for lending.  The problem is the type of lending available.  The banks have become extraordinarily risk averse.  We are trying to get the SME sector going.  What I am hearing on the ground from the SME sector is that much depends on the individual within a bank with whom an applicant is dealing.  I believe there is a need for the banks to put in place defined communications structures in regard to dealings with customers.  I am astounded to hear there was no risk committee in the bank.  <\/p><p>  I would like to hear from Mr. Spring and Dr. Somers regarding the type of structures around loans that were in place in AIB when they took up their appointments on the board.  Dr. Somers referred to his relationship with AIB when employed by the National Treasury Management Agency in terms of its capacity to invest in Government bonds.  What is the current position in that regard?  I would like if the witnesses could give us a flavour of what they found when they took up their appointments.  For example, if the bank had no risk system in place at that time, it should offer some leverage in terms of its dealings with people in difficulty with mortgage loans etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012122000028#CC01600","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1356011100,"counter":786,"content":"<p>The Deputy needs to give the witnesses some time to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012122000028#CC01700","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1356011100,"counter":787,"content":"<p>With respect, I have been very patient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012122000028#CC01800","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1356011100,"counter":788,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012122000028#CC01900","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1356011100,"counter":789,"content":"<p>The Chairman is eating into my time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012122000028#CC02000","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1356011100,"counter":790,"content":"<p>With respect, the Deputy has been allocated plenty of time in each of the three modules.

Will the witnesses comment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012122000030#EE01100","speaker":"1048"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1356012300,"counter":854,"content":"<p>The ECB is doing a great service for the State in that it is providing a very large amount of money at an interest rate of 0.75%.  It has also provided three year money, which is quite unusual for a Central Bank.  Usually the period of lending by a Central Bank is much shorter.  It has also undertaken to buy up bonds.  Many people say the ECB should take some of the pain for what has happened.  There is an issue about the ECB and I am telling members what I understand the scene to be because there may be subtleties that are lost to me, but its share capital is &euro;10 billion, and effectively if it loses money it has to be recapitalised in some way or another.  It can be recapitalised by the regional Central Banks and if it cannot do it, it will have to come from the Exchequer.  It does not have the ability to take on board losses.  People have also spoken about the ESM and some people have suggested that the &euro;20 billion put in by the State could be taken over by the ESM.  Frankly, I do not think it can because the ESM will have to borrow its funds on the international markets.  It needs a good rating.  As far as I know, it has been downgraded to AA plus and it does not even have a AAA credit rating.  It cannot afford to take any losses either or else it will not be able to raise money at a reasonable rate on the market.  The idea that the EMS would be the solution to our problems in taking on board the losses of the Irish Banks would not work.

I am accompanied today by colleagues from the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.<\/p><p>  As the committee is aware, the single supervisory mechanism constitutes two regulations which were published by the European Commission on 12 September 2012.  Taken together, the regulations will introduce the first stage of the banking union, the single supervisory mechanism, SSM.  The remaining elements are the completion of CRD IV &ndash; the Basel III capital requirements for banks, the common deposit insurance and a common resolution framework, to which I will return later.<\/p><p>  The two proposals before the committee which we are discussing today are a proposal for a Council regulation conferring specific tasks on the European Central Bank concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions - the ECB proposal; and a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Regulation (EC) No.1093\/2010 establishing a European supervisory authority - the European Banking Authority - the EBA proposal.  The Commission also issued a communication to the European Parliament and the Council, A Roadmap towards a Banking Union (COM 510) on 12 September.  The communication sets the single supervisory mechanism in context and indicates further work towards a banking union beyond these first proposals.<\/p><p>  The ECB proposal aims to introduce a new single supervisory mechanism, SSM, within which the ECB and national competent authorities, NCAs, will co-operate.  Under the proposal, the ECB will have responsibility for the supervision of credit institutions in the euro-area member states and, with a view to maintaining and deepening the Internal Market, member states whose currencies are not the euro will have the right to opt into the SSM.  The EBA proposal aims to introduce the necessary changes to the 2010 EBA regulation in order to ensure decision-making structures continue to be balanced and effective and preserve the interests of all its members.  That will assist in avoiding fragmentation of the Internal Market following the establishment of the SSM.  The banking union will be complete when the single supervisory mechanism is joined with European bank resolution and deposit guarantee mechanisms.  The completion of CRD IV will be also an important element in that regard.<\/p><p>  I propose to take a few minutes to set out the main elements of the ECB regulation under the proposal as published by the Commission in September, which is the subject matter of today's discussion.  The main elements were the conferral on the ECB of specific tasks and policies relating to the prudential supervision of all euro area credit institutions.<\/p> <p> The main elements were, as follows. The conferral on the ECB of specific tasks and policies relating to the prudential supervision of all euro area credit institutions.  The ECB would have exclusive competence for a list of prudential supervisory tasks, including authorisation and licensing. The ECB, with the support of the national supervisors, would form the single supervisory mechanism. National supervisors would assist the ECB and comply with its instructions.  National supervisors would remain responsible for supervisory tasks not transferred to the ECB, such as supervision of third country branches, supervision of payment services, on-site verifications, implementing guidance or regulations issued by the ECB, and anti-money laundering prevention.  It would have explicit and significant responsibility to safeguard financial stability in the EU. The ECB would be responsible for co-ordinating the position of the competent authorities of participating member states in EBA decision-making contexts. There would be a full separation between the ECB's role in monetary policy and the exercise of supervisory functions.  A supervisory board encompassing the specific expertise of national supervisors would be set up to achieve this.  The ECB governing council would remain ultimately responsible for supervisory decision-making, with the supervisory board carrying out clearly defined tasks and related decisions.  Any non-euro area member state and the ECB could enter into close co-operation.  The ECB would then carry out its supervisory tasks in relation to credit institutions established in that non-euro member state.  The ECB would be required to act independently in carrying out supervisory functions. It would be accountable to the EU Parliament and to the Council.  While the ECB would start supervisory tasks as soon as possible, implementation would be on a phased-in basis.<\/p><p>  Accompanying the ECB regulation was the EBA regulation, which is the second element of the single supervisory mechanism proposals.  It is the proposed regulation amending the existing regulation establishing the European Banking Authority.<\/p><p> From January 2011, the regulation of financial services across Europe has been overseen by the European Supervisory Authorities, ESAs.  There are three European supervisory authorities: the European Banking Authority, EBA; the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA; and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA. The EBA is the regulatory agency tasked with improving co-operation between national supervisors and continuing the development of a single rule-book for financial services in the EU.<\/p><p> The main amendments to the EBA regulation under the Commission's proposal, as published in September, were as follows. In imposing a binding decision to resolve disagreement between supervisors or to require action in an emergency situation, the EBA could request the ECB to follow its decision but could not require the ECB to do so.  Where the ECB did not comply, it would have to provide adequate justification for non-compliance. There would be given to an independent panel dealing with the EBA, powers concerning breaches of EU law and the settlement of disagreements between national supervisors.  It was proposed that a three-person panel would be required to include at least one member from a non-participating member state. The EBA management board would be required to include at least two representatives from member states not participating in the single supervisory mechanism. EBA voting on decisions relating to regulatory matters would continue to be based on qualified majority voting but with certain safeguards for non-euro member states.<br \/>That is a description of the proposal as presented in September.<\/p><p> Following the publication of the proposals, the European Council set up an <i>ad hoc  <\/i>working party.  In view of the importance of the proposals and their complexity, officials and experts from each member state came together to examine the proposals.  The <i>ad hoc <\/i>working party met eight times between late September and early December.  The negotiations allowed the Presidency to submit to ECOFIN ministers compromise draft texts on both regulations for final political agreement.  The committee might note that, judging by the way the Council works, this was an exceptional measure.  It involved a considerable commitment to these regulations and reflected the priority given at EU level to drawing a conclusion as soon as possible.<\/p><p> Arising from the work of that group, on 12 December, ECOFIN finance ministers reached a Council general agreement on the ECB and EBA regulations.  As part of the council deliberations the text was amended to take on board the concerns of member states, so there has been considerable amendment to the original proposals as I have just outlined.<\/p><p> As EU President from 1 January, Ireland will now be tasked to represent the Council position in trialogue negotiations with the European Parliament. I will now briefly describe the current agreed proposal by the ECOFIN ministers.<\/p><p> Chapter I, articles 1 and 2, deals with subject matter, scope, and definitions. Chapter II deals with co-operation and tasks, and comprises articles 3 to 7.  These are some of the important provisions of the regulation. Article 3 ensures the ECB and national supervisors co-operate closely in pursuit of high supervisory standards and that the ECB co-operates with the European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, and the European Stability Mechanism, ESM.  Article 4 provides for the tasks conferred on the ECB.  Article 5 establishes the criteria by which the ECB will determine which credit institutions it will supervise directly and those where it will rely on national supervisors to implement the supervisory guidelines and instructions of the ECB.<\/p><p>  The criteria for this assessment are based on an assets on balance-sheet threshold of &euro;30 billion or an assets-to-GDP ratio of 20%. It is important to keep in mind that the ECB will exercise oversight over the functioning of the entire system and will retain the right to intervene to supervise directly any credit institution in any participating member state where it considers it to be necessary.<\/p><p> Article 6 provides for non euro-area member states to enter into a close co-operation with the ECB to join the SSM.  It provides for circumstances where one of these objects to a decision of the governing council of the ECB. Chapter III deals with powers of the ECB, and comprises articles 8 to 15.  The ECB can, within the SSM, direct national supervisors to take action. <\/p><p> Under article 9, the ECB has rights to information from legal and natural persons, and provides for the sharing of this information with the national supervisors.  The ECB, supported by national supervisors, as the case may be, can conduct on-site investigations. Article 13 provides for specific powers relating to authorisations and article 15 allows for the ECB to issue administrative sanctions.<\/p><p> Chapter IV deals with organisational principles and comprises articles 16 to 25.  Article 16 confirms the independence of the ECB and the supervisory board.  Article 17 makes the ECB accountable to the European Parliament and to the Council.  Significantly, it includes a separate provision allowing for national parliaments to ask questions of the ECB and to invite the chair of the supervisory board to participate in an exchange of views.  National supervisors will continue to be accountable to national parliaments.  Furthermore, article 17 requires the ECB to prepare reports on the execution of tasks under the regulation. Article 18 ensures the operation of ECB monetary policy is separate from supervisory policy. <\/p><p> The supervisory board of the SSM is created under article 19.  It will be composed of members of the ECB and the national competent authority from each participating member state.  In most cases, the supervisory board will take decisions on the basis of one member, one vote.  A steering committee of the supervisory board will be appointed on a rotational basis to support the work of the supervisory board.  Article 24 allows the ECB to levy fees on the supervised entities in relation to the costs incurred by it in the operation of tasks conferred upon the ECB by the regulation. <\/p><p> Chapter V deals with general and final provisions, and comprises articles 26 to 28. The ECB will assume its full tasks under the regulation on 1 March 2014, or 12 months from the date the regulation enters into force.  In the transitional period from when the regulation enters into force and the ECB assumes its full tasks, the ECB is required to prepare a quarterly report on the implementation of the regulation for the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.  During this transitional period, the ECB will retain the right to assume the supervision of any credit institution in a participating member state where it considers it necessary, or if the ESM requests that it do so, as a precondition for direct recapitalisation by the ESM.<\/p><p> Article 26 provides for a review at the end of 2015, which will be repeated every three years thereafter. <\/p><p> As regards the EBA amending regulation, the main change from September is that additional safeguards are given to member states who are not participating in the SSM in relation to decision making in the EBA. Decisions on regulatory matters will continue to be made by qualified majority voting, QMV.  However, it will have an additional safeguard in that decisions will be deemed adopted only if they are supported by a simple majority of member states participating in the SSM and a simple majority of non-participating member states.<\/p> <p>When decisions are taking on a breach of law or binding mediation, an independent panel will be established to prepare the relevant decisions.  Each such panel will consist of a chairperson, three representatives from participating member states and three representatives from non-participating member states.  Decisions of a panel will be taken by simple majority.  Where a panel proposes a decision to the board of supervisors, the board will adopt it by a simple majority of participating member states and a simple majority of non-participating member states.<\/p><p> The SSM is the first element of the package of banking union measures.  It is necessary to conclude as a matter of priority discussions on the remaining elements.  The December European Council conclusions call on co-legislators to agree proposals for a recovery and resolution directive and deposit guarantee scheme prior to June 2013.  A more harmonised deposit guarantee mechanism would contribute to a more complete banking union.  Its absence has increased the cost of bank failures to taxpayers and complicated their handling.  The Commission's recent proposals on a bank recovery and resolution mechanism represent an important first step towards an efficient, financially sound, Europe-wide bank resolution regime.  They aim to provide a harmonised toolbox at EU level.  To overcome the challenges surrounding the orderly resolution of cross-border institutions an independent resolution authority will be required to exercise independently the bank resolution function across the eurozone.  Heads of state and the Commission have indicated their commitment to bring forward proposals on such a resolution function mechanism.<\/p><p> Members will be aware that the capital requirements regulations and directive are currently under discussion in the trilogue negotiations in the Commission and European Parliament.  The package known as CRD4 aims to strengthen the effectiveness of the regulation of credit institutions and investment firms and to enhance financial stability.  The proposals aim to transpose the agreement reached by the Basel committee on banking supervision as endorsed by G20 leaders.  Ireland has taken over from the Cypriot Presidency of the EU and it is our intention to complete negotiations under this file.  We have commenced initial discussions with Council, Parliament and the Commission and early indications are that all parties will enhance their co-operation with a view to reaching an early agreement with the European Parliament.  CRD4 is seen as important to a single supervisory mechanism which provides common standards to be applied across the single supervisory mechanism area.  Under the EBA proposal the Presidency has commenced trilogue negotiations with the European Parliament.  The ECB proposal will be decided according to the procedure set out in Article 127(6) of the Treaty which requires consultation with the European Parliament only, however both regulations will be considered as a package in the negotiations with that body.<\/p><p> Ireland's Presidency will give priority to the banking union package to ensure the remaining pillars, CRD4 and harmonised resolution and deposit are put in place as soon as possible to complement the single supervisory mechanism.  As President of the Council, Ireland will be required to reflect the views of all member states in concluding negotiations and will act as an honest broker while having due regard to national considerations.  I am happy to take questions or clarify anything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012122000032#KK00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Carrigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1356014100,"counter":884,"content":"<p>It has been a busy day and, indeed, week and we will not detain the witnesses long.

One could have concerns, especially given my perception of the attitude of the ECB.  I have made this point a number of times.  At the beginning of 2008 the ECB issued a guideline to States and to Central Banks in which it states that if states needed to rescue banks, if possible they should avoid nationalisation but even if they nationalise them they should avoid diverting the goals of the bank from profit maximisation to other social goals.  That is its directive because it believes that to be in the best interests of banking, but as some of the discussions we have had earlier today and much of the discussion between the Parliament and banks at present, we might have a very different view of that.  We might think it would be a good thing if the banks took social and macro-economic goals more into account when deciding their policies.  To put some of this into context, it would be useful for us to know what the rules are, how far-reaching they are.<\/p> <p>Some of them are about the level of capitalisation, possibly risk management and so on, but how far reaching are they and will more rules be developed and, if so, will we see them in a clearly understandable form in order that we know what rules are being applied to the banks and then we can decide whether they are a good idea? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012122000036#OO02500","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1356015900,"counter":943,"content":"<p>May I make an interjection?

There is a rule book.  At least some of the rule book is written.  When Mr. Aidan Carrigan speaks about the fact that we are looking at CRD, he is referring to the capital requirements directive No. 4.  By definition there were three previous directives, at present we are on the third version.  As it is being expanded there will be more rules.  Yes, one can see the rules to the extent that they are EU legislation, to the extent that the EBA issues rules, guidelines, standards, all of which are published.  They go through a consultation process and are finalised and published.  I cannot give a guarantee that they will be particularly user friendly, by their nature they are legalistic and technical but they are available.  Further rules are being developed.  Therefore, the area about which the Deputy inquired, which might be captured under bank resolution, for example, currently the CRD would not go that far but they are working on a resolution directive which, in my recollection of the outcome of the recent summit, was that they wanted that finalised in the first half of 2013.  That is working on a basis of national resolution regimes.  Any aspiration to a pan-European resolution regime is somewhat further out but it is one of the goals of banking union and is recognised both by the Heads of State and, I think, by Mr. Draghi, in some recent statement that is essential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012122000037#PP01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Burke"},{"type":"speech","time":1356015900,"counter":952,"content":"<p>All this is a precursor to the operation of the ESM.

All the information I present is based on published articles by established scientists writing in recognised peer-reviewed medical journals, and it is referenced in the material that I have previously submitted to the committee.<\/p><p>  Despite the current economic climate, we are spending &euro;10 million per year on a vaccine against cervical cancer which has not been proven in any part of the world to work.  In the words of Dr. Charlotte Haug of the Norwegian Medical Association, writing in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine<\/i> about HPV vaccines, we cannot base costly decisions on unproven assumptions.  Dr. Haug is one of the many clinicians and scientists around the world who have raised serious concerns about HPV vaccines.  With more than 20 years of experience in health care fields, and currently studying for a master's degree in health economics, I became concerned about Gardasil while researching an article that was published in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  In France, Gardasil is prohibited from being promoted as protective against cervical cancer because it is clear the impact of the vaccine is unknown.<\/p><p>  There are three important questions to ask here.  Is it necessary?  No, it is not.  Is it effective?  We do not know.  Is it safe?  Again, we do not know.  Against this backdrop, we are vaccinating 12 year old girls, 99.9% of whom are unlikely to ever develop cervical cancer.  For the 0.1% who do develop it, on average it will be in 30 years' time.  Dr. Diane Harper, one of the lead scientists working on the development of the vaccine, has stated that if Gardasil is given to 11-year-old girls, and the vaccine does not last at least 15 years, then there is no benefit, only risk, for these young girls.  Does this make sense?  Does it not make more sense to put our limited resources into strengthening screening programmes that cannot cause harm and whose effectiveness we know?  In Ireland, the HSE leaflet promoting the vaccine states on its front cover that the HPV vaccine protects us from cervical cancer.  This is plainly untrue.  When the State makes a strong recommendation to its citizens about a health intervention, the information should be based on fact, not conjecture.  It is up to the parent of each child receiving this vaccine to make this informed decision and they can only do so if they have the correct information.  By exaggerating the benefits of the vaccine, parents are unable to make accurate and informed decisions.  The marketing of this vaccine has been criticised, and an article in the <i>American Journal of Bioethics<\/i> noted on Gardasil that pharmaceutical lobbying is a poor substitute for well-reasoned public health debate.  Consent for a medical procedure in Ireland must legally be full, free and informed.  I doubt if anyone here is comfortable with actively misinforming the public.  I ask the committee to ensure this leaflet and promotional material are changed to represent the evidence.<\/p><p>  For politicians, getting the best value for money is crucial.  All of the members here today are at the coalface of budgetary restrictions and every day they deal with the fallout for constituents whose front-line services are being cut.  It is vital that our scarce resources are spent only on evidence-based medical interventions.  During previous D&aacute;il debates on this issue it has been stated that failure to introduce this vaccine could result in the unnecessary deaths of women.  This sort of emotive statement makes it very difficult for politicians to tease out the scientific facts, but this is what I am asking the committee to do.<\/p><p>  This vaccine is unproven and represents a massive waste of valuable resources.  My recommendations to the committee are that the programme should be discontinued based on the current facts and, at the very least, parents must not be misled and this promotional material should be changed so it is truthful.  I put these issues before the committee because I believe, and I am sure members do too, that politicians have a duty of care to the people to defend their right to make informed choices for their children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000003#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Paula Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1355995800,"counter":967,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Byrne for that excellent presentation.

In Ireland at present, all 12- and 13-year-old girls in first year of secondary school are being subjected to a vaccine for a disease they may never come into contact with.  That is not even to state that the HPV infection goes on to create cancer.  Many people have had HPV infection without developing cancer.  That is an important statement: all our girls are being subjected to this vaccine in first year but only 1% are likely to have the infection.<\/p><p>  The adverse reactions reported as a result of the vaccine have been noted by Judicial Watch, the public interest group based in Washington that investigates and prosecutes Government corruption.  It announced that it has received new documents from the US Food and Drug Administration, dated 19 October 2011, under the US freedom of information legislation, detailing reports of adverse reactions to the vaccine.  The report details 26 new deaths between 1 September 2010 and 15 September 2011, as well as incidents of seizures, paralysis, blindness, pancreatitis, speech problems, short-term memory loss and Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome.  The documents are from the FDA's vaccine adverse event reporting systems.<\/p><p>  We are all led to believe vaccines are safe and can be given without harm.  If that is the case, why has the national vaccine injury compensation programme in the United States paid out almost $2 billion in damages to those who have suffered serious adverse reactions to vaccines?  We cannot state that vaccines are safe when compensation is being paid to families.  There are cases of girls who have died.  Jessica Erickson died 40 hours after she received her third vaccine.  Her parents came home from work to find her collapsed in her bathroom.  She is not the only girl this has happened to.  Those in authority are not listening to parents' concerns, however, and children have become very ill after administration of this vaccine.  This is a disease that will lead to cancer in less than 1% of women, but we are submitting all our young children to a vaccine that carries such high risks.  That is not very ethical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000003#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Jacqueline Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1355995800,"counter":969,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hogan for that presentation.

We look forward to working with the committee and extending co-operation and assistance to the Chairman and members in their work.<\/p><p>  The committee requested information on specific issues prior to this meeting and will have already received the written information on these issues.  Accordingly, I will comment briefly on some of the key issues regarding immunisation.  Vaccines have saved more lives worldwide than any other public health intervention apart from the provision of clean water.  A well-functioning national immunisation programme is essential for any country.  The national immunisation programme, which is consistent with Government policy, aims to promote health by preventing death and disability from vaccine-preventable diseases.  The programme provides infant and school immunisation free of charge to all children.  Since September 2011, the national immunisation programme has administered a vaccination catch-up programme against HPV, which can lead to cervical cancer, for all girls in secondary school.  This was one of the commitments given in the programme for Government and was achieved within the first 100 days, as promised.<\/p><p>  The uptake of primary childhood immunisation - that is, the six-in-one vaccine - nationally at 24 months of age has increased from 83% in 2001 to the 95% uptake rate recommended by WHO since 2011.  The national measles, mumps and rubella, MMR, vaccine uptake at 24 months has increased from 69% in 2001 to 93% in 2012.  Since October 2012 a school-based MMR catch-up programme has been operated by the HSE to target those children who have not received the required two doses of MMR vaccine.  This measure will assist in addressing the WHO target to achieve elimination of measles by 2015.  In October 2000 the meningococcal C vaccine was introduced to the primary immunisation schedule.  In 1999 there were 135 cases of meningococcal C infection and five associated deaths.  In 2011 there were two cases of this illness.  No deaths have been associated with meningococcal C infection since 2008.  Pneumococcal vaccination has resulted in an 83% reduction in the number of cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in children under two years of age.<\/p><p>  In spite of these achievements, it is important not to become complacent.  The WHO is working towards the elimination of polio globally.  In 2001, the European region was declared polio-free.  However, in April 2010, a wild-type poliovirus type 1 outbreak was confirmed in Tajikistan, representing the first importation of a wild-type poliovirus into Europe since the region was certified polio-free in 2002.  In January 2000, a large outbreak of measles in Dublin resulted in 100 children being hospitalised.  Six cases required intensive care treatment and there were two measles-related deaths.  It should be noted that the cost of treating a case of measles has been shown to be 23 times the cost of vaccinating one child against measles.  Since early 2011 there has been an increase in the incidence of pertussis - that is, whooping cough.  This year, up to 1 December 2012, 437 cases of pertussis have been notified to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, and there have been two pertussis-related deaths.<\/p><p>  These events underscore the importance of constant effort and commitment to ensure a high uptake of vaccination.  In particular, hard-to-reach groups such as the Traveller community, ethnic minorities and those who object to immunisation on religious or moral grounds require diligent campaigns underpinned by unambiguous, simple, evidence-based information to highlight the importance of vaccination at both individual and population level.  As many vaccine-preventable diseases have become so infrequent, parents may be unaware of the serious nature of some childhood illnesses.  This makes it all the more important for all health care professionals involved in immunisation to explore new ways of communicating the benefits and risks of immunisation to parents.  The national immunisation office has already commenced a number of worthwhile initiatives in this area.<\/p><p>  Pharmaceutical companies continue to develop new vaccines, which may be added to our national immunisation schedule.  This is beneficial in that it protects our population from an increasing number of illnesses, but on the other hand it is challenging due the increased complexity and costs of our immunisation programmes.  Prior to the introduction of any new vaccine, a health technology assessment is performed, including a cost-benefit analysis, to help inform policy decisions.  New models of vaccine delivery continue to be explored in order to increase efficiency within a sustainable budgetary framework.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive all remain committed to providing a first-class national immunisation service.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it and will answer any questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000004#H00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colette Bonner"},{"type":"speech","time":1355996400,"counter":971,"content":"<p>I welcome all the groups who have made presentations this morning.

It is a matter of major importance that we try to get to the facts.<\/p><p>  I have a number of question on the Gardasil vaccine.  Up to the end of last month, we were advised that the Irish Medical Board received 650 reports of adverse reactions associated with this vaccine.  Is it possible to elaborate on the monitoring mechanism for identifying adverse reactions?  What is the range of adverse reactions presenting?  Have there been unanticipated adverse reactions?  Is there a question mark as to their association with the Gardasil vaccine?  What supports have been put in place for those who have presented with adverse reactions?  The last question is the most pertinent.  We have heard the argument as to why Gardasil should not be employed as it is, but will Ms Byrne or another witness elaborate on its understood success?  Can we point to a reduction in cervical cancer cases as a consequence of its application across the cohort of young women to whom it has been given?  That is critical information which would be of interest and help to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000004#H00600","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1355996400,"counter":976,"content":"<p>I will try to contain myself.  Uniquely, I am probably the only person in this room who has ever had to tell somebody that she had cervical cancer and might die from it or might never have children again as a result of treatment.  Uniquely in this room, I have heard people with tear-streaked eyes question whether they had this disease because they were infected with the virus.  I would do all in my power to save any one of those people from having cancer, provided the safety benefit ratio showed it was effective.  Clearly, the safety benefit ratio shows that vaccination is effective.<\/p><p>  I apologise but I will be a little less diplomatic than I normally would be because of the reaction to vaccination.  In the way that honey attracts bees, there is something about the issue of vaccines that attracts people from a paranoid fringe who will blindly and obliviously cocoon themselves away from facts in pursuit of prejudices.  It has come to light on this issue.<\/p><p>  Let us have a few facts.  Members have heard about the rarity of cervical cancer in Ireland.  We have 75 to 100 deaths a year from cervical cancer in Ireland.  These deaths occur at a younger average age than deaths from other cancers.  This is primarily a disease of the younger middle-aged woman.  It is also a disease we see in women in their 20s and 30s.<\/p> <p> While the witnesses may argue that between 75 and 100 deaths per annum is not enough to justify vaccinating 30,000 girls, I believe they do justify vaccination.  Even if that were not the case, what about the other women who get cervical cancer but are cured?  At this point, the cure for cervix cancer involves the use of less mutilating surgery in a tiny number of cases.  For most people, however, there is a choice.  They can have surgery to remove the womb, ovaries, fallopian tubes and part of the vagina.  For many of the women in question, their reproductive ambitions will be no more and in addition to the physical and psychological stigmata of surgery, they will live with the knowledge that they will not become parents.  For most others, they can have radiotherapy and, increasingly, chemotherapy.  This will involve having the entire pelvis radiated, that is, the vagina, uterus and part of the rectum and bladder.  I do not want to frighten people who are going through this treatment because it often cures people who would otherwise die.  However, any woman who has this treatment will always know she has had it because it is life-changing.  It is not like having a small growth removed from the skin.  It is a treatment that will likely leave the person with profound sexual issues and probably bladder issues and issues relating to discomfort in the rectum, etc.  The treatment also has a small but finite risk of causing one to get a second cancer such as leukemia later in life.  We should seek to do anything that will preclude 300 women from having to get this treatment, of whom between 75 and 100 will die despite it.  <\/p><p> There are another few nuances to this issue.  It has been shown in trials, although the witnesses may be dispute the figures if they wish, that the vaccine that is widely used here decreases the incidence of the very early cervical cancer lesions.  While these will not proceed to cancer in some cases, in many cases they will proceed to cancer.  In every case of advanced cervical cancer, these lesions are the first warning that the cancer will occur.  Nobody skips straight to advanced cancer by never having an early stage cervical cancer.  Again, a large amount of nonsense has been spoken on this matter.<\/p><p> Many hundreds of women, probably thousands of them, have lesser degrees of surgery and surgical interventions and treatments such as laser treatment performed for other pre-cancerous lesions that have the potential to develop into cancer.  For these reasons, I had my two beloved daughters vaccinated when they were young teenagers approximately ten years ago and before a national programme was introduced.  I did so because the data were so compelling.  Harold zur Hausen is one of the saints of modern medicine and one of the few people who goes to bed every night knowing that all around the world hundreds, if not thousands, of women are saved because of the research he did.  I am old enough to remember when people believed cigarette smoking and herpes caused cervical cancer.  To hear the name of this sainted genius who worked out the cause of cervical cancer being blemished and to have him misquoted in this room is highly irritating.  Professor zur Hausen is a supporter of cervical cancer vaccination.  On a previous occasion when a politician tried to raise spurious arguments against the vaccination, he demolished the arguments made on radio.<\/p><p> As to whether the vaccination works, the randomised trials clearly show that the incidence of early cervix cancer is dramatically decreased with vaccination.  In addition, 80% rather than 100% of cervix cancers are caused by-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000004#H00700","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355997000,"counter":978,"content":"<p>The Senator's time has elapsed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000005#J00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1355997000,"counter":979,"content":"<p>I will make one final point given that we spend enough time in this room discussing raim&eacute;is.

This is a little like arguing that we do not need to prevent children from playing with matches or drunks from falling asleep with a cigarette in their hands because we have a fire department or that we do not need to wear seatbelts because we have neurosurgeons who will patch up one's brain if one receives a head injury.  We need to waste as little time as possible on this issue.  It is widely accepted that no jurisdiction in the world has discontinued the vaccine programme and no leading group of experts has stated we should stop vaccinating for cervical cancer.

Sadly in this country, this basic requirement is ignored at times.<\/p><p>  Ms Hogan pointed out that adverse reactions to the HPV vaccine have been recorded in Washington.  How many such cases have been recorded and what is the ratio of adverse reactions to the number of vaccinations administered?  It is important to have balance in this matter.  <\/p><p>  The officials from the Department will correct me if I am wrong but I understand that in respect of all vaccines, decisions must first be taken on the efficacy of the product in question, after which a cost-benefit analysis is carried out.  Senator Crown highlighted the significant benefits associated with the HPV vaccine.  One must weigh up the adverse reactions to the vaccine and their incidence and scale against the risk of not vaccinating.  <\/p><p>  It is frustrating that medical policy makers in this country ignore and are afraid to acknowledge that there are adverse reactions associated with vaccination.  It is a medical fact that no vaccine is 100% safe, there are risks associated with vaccines and people are damaged by them.  The number of adverse reactions to vaccines is probably higher here than elsewhere in Europe probably as a result of our limited genetic pool.  The issue is the scale of adverse reactions, that is, whether they are minor or severe. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000005#J00800","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1355997000,"counter":985,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy have any facts to back up his assertions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000005#J00900","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1355997000,"counter":986,"content":"<p>Senator Crown was not interrupted and should allow Deputy Naughten to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000005#J01000","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1355997000,"counter":987,"content":"<p>As Senator Crown noted, the issue of enlightenment arises in respect of vaccines and a full and open debate is needed on the issue.  For the record, I have three children, all of whom have been vaccinated with all of the relevant vaccines.  While I have no hesitation in having my children vaccinated, parents need to be given all of the information to allow them to weigh up the decision on vaccination.  An issue arose recently in respect of a parent of a child who had an adverse reaction to the second administration of a particular vaccination.  The child's general practitioner refused to administer the third dose and chose instead to refer the child to a specialist before a decision is made on the issue.  The position is changing in this country regarding vaccines.<\/p><p>  One of the reasons we invited departmental officials before the joint committee was to receive an update on what has been done since the committee reported on this issue in 2001.  Its report stated that \"in the light of the huge benefits of immunisation and the small number of children who experience serious adverse reactions a no-fault compensation scheme should be introduced in Ireland\".  Ireland is the only country in Europe that has not introduced such a compensation scheme.  Most countries have had such a scheme in place for years, yet nothing has been done over the past 11 years to implement the joint committee's recommendation in this regard.  In the United Kingdom, the maximum possible payment under a compensation scheme is &pound;120,000 and the average payment is &pound;3,800. <\/p> <p>Anyway, there is a scheme in place and there is public acknowledgement that some children are damaged by vaccines.  The reality is that the risks of having a vaccination programme rolled out are far less than the great benefit to children and to society as a whole.  However, some acknowledgement must be given to this.<\/p><p> Previously, the committee made a recommendation to the effect that there should be a link developed between the birth registers in the country in order that the information technology system in place could trace children.  At the moment there are four separate information technology systems with eight implementations throughout each of the former health boards.  When will we get our act together and have one information technology system for a vaccination programme?  When will we have a system in place whereby we can have traceability through the children's allowance system to know where children are or where they have slipped through the loop?  Such traceability is not in place at the moment and it is undermining our vaccination programmes as a result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000005#J01100","speaker":"1177","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355997600,"counter":989,"content":"<p>I have one or two questions and I wish to reply to some of the things that have been said.  I am not a medical expert, I am a politician but above all I am a parent.  Like Senator Crown, I have four beautiful daughters, two of whom have gone through all the vaccination stages for cervical cancer.  As a parent my issue is trust and who I trust.  I trust my general practitioner.  I have gone to my GP for the past 40 years.  He has been with me at each stage.  We went through all the various stages of illness, my pregnancies and so on.  Therefore, a sense of trust has been built up.  As Deputy Naughten has noted, with every vaccination a parent realises there is a small percentage or chance that something can go wrong.  It is like having an operation.  I have a beautiful granddaughter who has had all her vaccinations.<\/p><p>  There is an issue about accountability and I wish to develop the point made by Deputy Naughten.  When children go to school or start in a creche, there should be a format to ensure every child has received his or her vaccinations.  Since she has started in the creche, my granddaughter has picked up everything going in the classroom.  I believe many children are going to school, including, unfortunately, some children who are from other countries, who do not have the proper vaccinations.  This is a real issue for many parents.  I thank the delegations for the presentations.  I found both of them very interesting.  However, as a parent my trust lies with my GP.  He is the medical expert and I am not.  I am unsure whether it is naivety or blindness but at the level of being a parent there is a time to put the politician away for a while.  I trust my GP when I go to see him and I trust the information and evidence he provides.  This is the reason I go and I know that is the same for many parents throughout the country.  They do it for the same reasons, because a trust has been built up with the general practitioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000006#K00200","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1355997600,"counter":990,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming here today and for presenting to us.

Anyway, it is incumbent on all of us as parents to ensure that we are as educated as possible with regard to what we are providing for our children and to make informed decisions in this regard.  Against this backdrop we need to recognise that with every vaccine there is a slight risk.<\/p><p>  I am sorry if this is not the appropriate venue but I have written many times to the Department of Health and to the Minister about it.  Reports were commissioned by previous Governments on the whooping cough vaccinations scores of years ago.  I genuinely believe they are sitting on shelves.  What genuine consideration has been given to the recommendations of the previous Oireachtas committees and the reports issued by previous Ministers with regard to setting up a no-fault compensation scheme for children who were damaged by vaccines?  This does not relate to cases that might arise in ten years' time or perhaps next year.  It relates to children who were genuinely damaged by previous vaccines.  The responsibility on the State is to address this issue and it is nothing short of a disgrace that we have had children who were inflicted with this in an awful way in the 1970s and 1980s.

We also detected the presence of HPV-16L1 particles within the cerebral vasculature with some HPV-16L1 particles adhering to the blood vessel walls. HPV-18L1 antibodies did not bind to cerebral blood vessels nor any other neural tissues. IHC also showed increased T-cell signalling and marked activation of the classical antibody-dependent complement pathway in cerebral vascular tissues from both cases. This pattern of complement activation in the absence of an active brain infection indicates an abnormal triggering of the immune response in which the immune attack is directed towards self-tissue.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000007#L00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Jacqueline Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1355998200,"counter":1006,"content":"<p>I will have to ask Ms Hogan to cease now.

I was the person who introduced the cervical screening programme first in the mid-west as part of the national campaign.  All public health programmes such as screening and immunisation have both benefits and risks.  The screening programme equally has risks as much as vaccination has risks.  Both programmes happen because the benefits greatly outweigh the risks.  That is the fundamental decision made before any other decision about money or cost-benefit analysis.  The first decision is whether the benefits far outweigh - not even outweigh - the risks.  Senator Professor Crown has left the room but it is different even from how he would try to treat somebody.  It is a very different decision.  It is not just that it is better but it actually far outweighs the risk.  It is carried out on people who do not have the disease or are unlikely to get the disease so one must be very careful.  That is the first fundamental decision which is made with regard to all these programmes.  However, I agree that both screening and immunisation programmes cause problems.  We are very upfront about all of that in all our literature, both in hard copy and in greater detail on the Internet.  We accept that all Internet information is not available to everybody but the hard copy literature shows that clearly.<\/p><p>  We state very clearly in that document that the HPV vaccine only prevents 70% of cervical cancers.  It does not prevent all cervical cancers, just as much as the cervical cancer screening programme does not prevent all cervical cancers.  Neither programme does this.  We are clear that these are preventative programmes.  The information booklet took quite some time to be produced because we went through a very detailed process.  We asked people to review the booklet with regard to the language and content used.  We were told whether there was too much or too little information in the document.  It is regularly revised and re-examined, as is all our immunisation documentation.  We seek to present that information to everybody in so far as possible.<\/p><p>  Whether these programmes are necessary is one of those fundamental decisions.  To be clear, the HPV vaccine does not just prevent cervical cancer.  It prevents the precursor to it but it also prevents another disease which is extremely common, anal-genital warts.  We will not see the explicit impact of the vaccine on cervical cancer for quite some time because like all cancers it takes a time to come about.  It takes ten to 20 years to occur. <\/p> <p>In Australia, which was one of the first countries in the world to have a systematic programme of HPV vaccination, there has been quite a significant reduction in the number of people under the ages of 20 and 25 who have anal-genital warts.  We know that anal-genital warts and cervical cancer are caused by HPV infection.  That gives us a very strong indication that we will see a reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer, but we have not seen it yet.<\/p><p> One aspect of immunisation is that the vaccines are tested in a slightly different way.  Other witnesses such as Dr. O'Flanagan could speak on this.  In a sense one is saying that it will prevent something, which is always very difficult to prove.  Most drugs are for a disease that exists and they stop that disease.  With immunisation, we are saying that the disease does not come about.  That is a problem for us because some people want to know why they are still being vaccinated against diphtheria and typhoid when we do not see those diseases.  People ask why they are being vaccinated against polio when they do not see that disease.  However, these are still extremely important diseases.<\/p><p> An expert committee, the national immunisation advisory committee, has examined the issue of how to deal with children coming from different countries with different schedules of vaccines.  We have provided in the documentation advice that is given to the various doctors and also to parents on what they need to do.  There are different schedules of vaccines.  Most countries in Europe have pretty much the same immunisation programmes.  We try to make sure that children complete the programmes they have started and also get the vaccines that are given in this country that they may not have got in their own countries.  There is literature on that in the documentation, and that literature is given to all GPs and other people who give immunisations.  It is available on our website, the website of the national immunisation office and the website of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000007#L01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Kelleher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355998800,"counter":1014,"content":"<p>Is there a systematic attempt to talk to those concerned?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000008#M00200","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355998800,"counter":1015,"content":"<p>That is done primarily via general practitioners.  In addition, when such children arrive in school, we have school immunisation teams which will pick up on that.  It is done at that stage when the child comes in contact with the system, primarily via general practitioners.  I cannot say every general practitioner will do so, but virtually every general practitioner will ask a parent who brings in a one, two or three year old child what vaccinations the child has received if they have come here from abroad and, on noting what the child needs, the general practitioner will provide it.  The State provides for that and also pays for it.  It is not a major difficulty.<\/p><p>  I find it slightly problematic when people suggest that we do not talk about the problems.  We have repeatedly spoken about the problems concerning immunisation.  I recognise as much as anybody that the programmes have risks, and we are very clear about this.  I spoke to the committee when the report on immunisation was published in 2001; one of the recommendations made by the health boards at that time was that a vaccine damage scheme should be introduced.  We were strongly of that view.  We believe that to support the programme, something of that nature needs to be put in place.  The provision of such a scheme is very important.  Even without such a scheme at present, we have made great strides in rates of immunisation.  We have hit the target set for the HPV; the immunisation rate has gone over 80%, which is the desired level.  It is an amazing rate to have achieved quite rapidly and in quite a short period.  We have made those changes.<\/p><p>  We are currently in the process of putting together a single IT system for the country.  It is quite complex but incredibly necessary.  One of our difficulties has been that during the past five years a number of short-term projects, such as the introduction of new vaccines for pneumococcus, pandemic influenza and HPV, have diverted us from such longer-term projects.  We are very clear that we will not introduce any vaccine in this country unless the benefits totally outweigh the risks at the population level.  My colleague Dr. Gilvarry will speak about the issue of adverse events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000008#M00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Kelleher"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355998800,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>I will give a few facts on the licensing of the vaccine worldwide before I go into the adverse events.  Gardasil has been licensed across the European Union since 2006 and is used in most of the 27 member states in their immunisation programmes.  It is also approved in about 130 countries worldwide, including by the FDA, the TGA in Australia and Health Canada.  More than 110 million doses have been distributed, which equates to the vaccination of around 33 million children or adolescents with the three-dose schedule.  When a vaccine comes to market there must be evidence that it works.  A licence is given for the vaccine on the basis of the benefits versus the risks.  The benefits of Gardasil, and the licensed indications, are the prevention of pre-malignant genital lesions and cervical cancer.  That licence is based on evidence across the European Union.  I have said it a hundred times, and we have heard it here today, that no medicine or vaccine is without risks.  That is why we have an extensive post-marketing monitoring programme at the Irish Medicines Board, across the European Union and worldwide.  When the vaccine was first introduced into the immunisation programme in 2010 the Irish Medicines Board issued a special drug safety newsletter advising of the benefits but also of the risks and the adverse reactions we knew of at that time, and it asked health care professionals to report any adverse reactions they were seeing.  In terms of transparency, as the programme proceeded every month we updated our website to indicate the reactions we were seeing and the number of such reactions.  In the first year of the programme we saw more than 450 reactions, while in the second year of the programme the number decreased to 150.  The vast majority of the adverse reactions we saw were as expected and were non-serious.  They were syncopes and faints in young girls in school, sometimes before the injection rather than after it, headaches, malaise, muscle pains and gastrointestinal upset - nothing that was extremely worrying.<\/p><p>  To answer one of the questions posed, when 33 million children are vaccinated worldwide with three doses of the vaccine, one will see unexpected side effects with a temporal association with the vaccine but not necessarily a causal relationship.  To date across the European Union and worldwide we have identified no risks additional to those that were known when the vaccine was licensed, and the benefits still far outweigh any risks to this vaccine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000008#M00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joan Gilvarry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355998800,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>In regard to a national vaccine injury compensation scheme, an expert group was set up and has reported.

She seemed to jump from that to the idea that we should not vaccinate everybody.<\/p> <p>The difficulty, of course, is that we do not know which 1% will get the disease.  The only way to protect people from a serious and fatal illness is to ensure that we vaccinate everyone.  This occurs for many vaccine-preventable diseases.  We have universal vaccination programmes not because these diseases kill everyone but because they kill some.  This is the only way in which we can prevent these fatalities from occurring.<\/p><p> The other comment I wish to make pertains to Ms Paula Byrne's concern about the information and literature provided in Ireland and the statement that the vaccine prevents cervical cancer.  Similar literature that is provided in many other countries.  For example, I have to hand the vaccination statement of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, which is handed out to parents in the United States.  It states precisely the same thing - that is, that the vaccine can prevent most cases of cervical cancer in females.  It is known that the vaccine prevents the precursors of cancer and that this is the way to prevent cancer.  This is well accepted internationally, including by all major health organisations such as the CDC and the WHO.

I put it to him that he is correct in that the aforementioned recommendation regarding a no-fault compensation scheme was made 11 years ago.  As he is aware, every other country in Europe and every other developed country in the world has put in place such a system.  Nevertheless, Ireland still has not done so.  It must be acknowledged publicly that in a limited number of cases there are severe adverse reactions to vaccines, and those children and their families should be treated in a humane manner.  To revert to the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, is it not true that in many cases parents have been obliged to fight and are still fighting for a public acknowledgement that their children were damaged by the vaccine or may have been damaged by the vaccine?  Is it not the case that they are subsequently obliged to fight for even the most basic of services?  Dr. Kelleher is aware the State has acknowledged 16 cases.  An <i>ex gratia<\/i> payment of &pound;10,000, with a confidentially clause tied into it, was made to those particular families when Dr. Woods was Minister for Health.  Does Dr. Kelleher not think this matter should be getting a far higher priority within the Department and that there should be public acknowledgement that these children and their parents should be treated in a humane manner where, in all probability, they have been damaged by the vaccine?  This pertains to very small numbers and Dr. Kelleher's point regarding proportion is correct.  However, while the benefits far outweigh the risks, this does not mean one should shove the risks under the carpet or ignore those families and parents.  This issue has been considered and navel-gazed within the Department since 2001.  I met the Minister in April 2002 on this subject.  A report was produced, followed by an expert group report, which now is gathering further dust, although the Department has stated consistently since 2009 that it is considering it.  It took a long time even to get the aforementioned report published.

Perhaps Dr. Kelleher can explain a point to me.  Other than cases in which the benefit of the doubt has been given, how many confirmed cases of serious life-changing damage from vaccines have really been proven in Ireland?  I mean causally proven and not simply temporally associated cases of damage from any vaccine in Ireland.  Second, what vaccine is considered to be the most risky in this regard?<\/p><p>  I wish to make two brief points.  A highly inaccurate statement was made again about the level of coverage of the HPV vaccine.  The currently used vaccine is Gardasil, which prevents four subtypes of HPV, including two subtypes which are incriminated in the great majority of viral cervical cancers and virtually all cases of genital warts.  The alternative product only covers the two cervical cancer-causing subtypes.  That product did not win the bidding competition in Ireland at the time.  All of the many other subtypes of HPV have in most cases not been clearly shown to be associated with any health risk.  It is a virus that passes through and passes out.  The subtypes that cause cancer or warts or result in greater morbidity are those that are well covered by the vaccine.<\/p><p>  To put some perspective on this matter, everyone should realise what happened when the really spurious paranoia-driven scare about the MMR vaccine occurred in England and vaccination rates dropped below the level that would give herd immunity.  There was a colossal increase in all of the diseases that are protected against by the MMR vaccine, which resulted in many cases of brain damage and many deaths.  I ask Dr. Kelleher to answer that question for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000009#N00400","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1355999400,"counter":1025,"content":"<p>I will ask Ms Hogan and Ms Byrne to conclude, after which we will finish up with Dr. Bonner and Dr. Kelleher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000009#N00500","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355999400,"counter":1026,"content":"<p>We have talked a lot about the risk-benefit ratio and obviously, this is the key point in all the decisions that parents must make.

If one is clear that this vaccine will prevent one's child from cervical cancer, one will take risks that one might not take if one understood that the benefits were not quite so clear-cut.<\/p><p>  I am studying health economics at present and as part of my studies, we looked into various cost-effective analyses that were conducted around the world.  The results one gets at the end of a cost-effective analysis depend on the inputs, and they vary hugely.  For example, one of the main points that varies in those analyses was the effectiveness of the vaccine.  In Ireland, the vaccine's cost effectiveness was assumed to be 95%.  However, &quot;assumed&quot; is the key word, as it is stated quite clearly in documentation from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, that assumptions were made that the vaccines were 90% or 95% effective - I forget which.

The numbers at the moment appear to be around 30 to 40, although that could grow.  Unfortunately, they developed a severe form of narcolepsy.  We are providing as much support as possible to those people at the moment.  We are paying for treatment and for them to visit non-public services where appropriate.  We are giving them support in different ways.  Where they request medical cards they are being given the discretionary medical cards.  We are also giving other costs.  We have been working with our colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills to provide educational support for them.  Therefore we are clearly committed to trying to support such individuals.  As the committee has heard, however, the vast majority of problems that happen with immunisation are minor.  <\/p><p>  Having said that, we have heard that some people get anaphylactic shock.  It is uncommon but all our staff are regularly trained in how to deal with anaphylactic shock.  All of those are now dealt with immediately by the staff.  They are resuscitated immediately and looked after.  We are careful about all these issues.  <\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question, we have tried to give as much support as possible to the people who seem to have been affected by the H1N1 vaccine.  I am not saying that we have done everything because that is never possible, but we have made every effort to try to help them.  We have brought in colleagues from other Government Departments to support us as well.  They have been very helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000010#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Kelleher"},{"type":"speech","time":1356000000,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>I ask the Senator to be brief as we are over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000010#O00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1356000000,"counter":1035,"content":"<p>My question was how many cases does Dr. Kelleher believe have had serious long-term damage as a result of vaccines in general in this country?

The Meningitis Research Foundation represents around 1,200 families in Ireland that have been affected by meningitis and septicaemia.  I am here to talk about meningococcal infection which is the leading cause of meningitis in Ireland.  As members of the committee can see from the first slide, the people of Ireland suffer far more from this illness than anywhere else in Europe.<\/p><p>  The next slide tells us a bit more about the disease.  It is a deadly, disabling and disfiguring disease.  Meningitis happens when bacteria inflame the protective covering of the brain, resulting in swelling.  This can cause damage to brain tissue which can be irreversible.  Septicaemia happens when bacteria attack the lining of the blood vessels leading to shock, which is rapidly fatal in 20% to 50% of cases.  Widespread clotting throughout the body can cause amputations and damage to organs. <\/p><p>  The second photos shows that is what is happening to the little girl's tissues.  Unfortunately, that little girl went on to lose both legs and parts of both her hands to meningococcal septicaemia.  It is the leading infectious cause of death of children in Ireland.  There are long-term after-effects for about one in three survivors.  For obvious reasons, it is top among illnesses feared by parents.  This is because it is so devastating and because it strikes so suddenly, mainly at healthy children, so one cannot predict who will be affected.  The onset is so rapid that there is only a brief window for effective medical treatment.  Because the effects are so dire, the cost can be staggering. <\/p><p>  The third slides deals with the after effects, which differ depending on whether the person has been affected by meningitis where the damage is mainly neurological or due to damage to the ear.  In the case of septicaemia, the damage is obviously down to tissue and organs.  The effects range from very damaging and permanent effects, in the worst cases where children have such severe brain damage that they are never able to lead an independent life. <\/p> <p>Even children who are less severely affected can have the sort of subtle cognitive and psycho-social problems that will have an educational impact and will limit their educational attainment.  This will have a major impact on their quality of life and the lives of those around them.<\/p><p> I will touch briefly on the fourth slide, which deals with work done in the United Kingdom which examined very severe cases of meningitis and septicaemia.  One can see that the cost - not only the cost of the distress caused but also the cost of treating these children, plus the long-term medical costs to the State of specialist equipment and specialist education as well as direct social care costs - can amount to more than &euro;5 million over a lifetime for a child severely affected by meningitis or up to &euro;4 million for a child affected by septicaemia.  There are also high costs with regard to litigation.  Fortunately, this is rare, but it is a disproportionately high cost both in terms of the number of cases brought and, even more so, in terms of the payouts.<\/p><p> Early diagnosis and treatment are vitally important.  Major advances are not likely through improvements in this area because it is so difficult.  With regard to early symptoms, people know about the rash.  We have done a great deal of work over the years to draw attention to and educate the public about the symptoms so that people can get help early if they think that they or their children have the illness, but the early symptoms resemble milder illnesses.  Even the best-trained general practitioners will miss cases.  Some 50% of cases are sent home the first time they present to their general practitioner.  There is only a short window for effective intervention and it is difficult to improve matters based only on earlier diagnosis and better treatment.  Hopefully, the guidelines put out by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre earlier this year will make a big difference in enabling better diagnosis and better treatment, but in terms of making major advances, the solution is prevention.<\/p><p> The seventh slide shows the impact that the Hib, <i>Haemophilus influenzae<\/i>type b, vaccine has had over the years.  The record of meningitis vaccines in Ireland shows what immunisation can achieve.  Hib, which was once the leading childhood cause of meningitis, has now been almost eliminated.<\/p><p> The following slide shows the incidence of meningococcal disease in Ireland when the MenC vaccine was introduced.  Meningitis C was once nearly as common as meningitis B and it has now dwindled to only a handful of cases.  As Dr. Bonner stated earlier, there have been no deaths from meningitis C since 2008.  That has been a triumph.  It is fantastic.  Pneumococcal vaccination has also had an impact.  It has reduced the number of cases of pneumococcal meningitis in young children, which is great.<\/p><p> For decades group B streptococcus has been the leading cause of meningitis and although cases, coincidentally, are at a fairly low point, the disease circulates unchecked.  There is nothing to control it - we have 100 cases this year and we could have 200 cases next year.  One can see that over the past decade, we have seen 100 to 200 cases a year resulting in five to 15 deaths, and probably 30 to 60 persons with long-term effects that can prevent them growing into adults who can have a reasonable quality of life, contribute to the economy, etc.  In this report from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, the author stated that meningitis will remain a major public health problem until a MenB vaccine that is effective in children is available.  However, we are actually at this point at last.  Last month the European Medicines Agency announced a positive opinion on the first ever MenB vaccine, and a licence is due next month or in February.  We are hopeful that at last the means exist to put an end to this terrible disease.  We have high hopes for it and we urge the Government to ensure that the vaccine is introduced without delay.  The committee has seen how fantastic the MenC vaccine was.<\/p><p> It took seven years from the time that the pneumococcal vaccine was licensed for it to be introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000010#O02800","nonspeaker":"Ms Linda Glennie","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1356000600,"counter":1058,"content":"<p>There is a vote in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000011#P00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1356000600,"counter":1059,"content":"<p>Even a delay of a year would mean deaths and cases of brain damage, deafness and amputation that could be prevented.

I cannot remember exactly, but I have some notion in my head that Dr. O'Flanagan attended at the time.  I could be wrong.  I do not know if she did but it is in my memory that she might have.  One young boy was lost and the other survived - two incidents simultaneously.  Of course, the tragedy is that a surviving child's potential is seriously affected.  There are many similar instances.  It is welcome that in the fourth slide Ms Glennie presented the holistic in-the-round cost or real cost.  The cost does not include only the treatment or whatever.  Perhaps Ms Glennie has been a little conservative in terms of a lifetime's projection in real terms.<\/p><p>  What is the likely time for completion of the work of the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, on Bexsero?  I understand it is a matter of determining Bexsero's application and suitability and obtaining confidence to proceed with it here in Ireland.  When will the NIAC report and when can we expect certainty in this regard?  Would the HSE, the Department of Health and the IMB representatives like to comment as to their understanding of the potential of Bexsero to have an impact on meningitis B?  Does it have the same potential impact as the MenC vaccine has already demonstrated?  The graph on the eighth slide shows a significant decrease in incidence as a result of the introduction of the MenC vaccine.  Can we expect a similar impact with the introduction of Bexsero?  What data support this claim?  If it is indeed the case that those with the professional competence to make that assessment so recommend, how promptly can we expect it to be introduced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000011#P00600","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1356001200,"counter":1062,"content":"<p>I apologise for the length of the witnesses' stay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000012#Q00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1356001200,"counter":1063,"content":"<p>Is there any explanation for the incidence of meningococcal disease across Europe and Ireland?

When we introduced the meningococcal C vaccine, we also rolled out a catch-up campaign to vaccinate a larger group in the more susceptible population against the disease.  This is the type of decision that needs to be made.  The next stage is to ask the pharmacology economics unit at St. James's Hospital to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of whether it is appropriate to introduce it as a routine vaccine or to include a catch-up campaign for children under the age of two, under the age of five or primary or secondary school going age.  The meningococcal C vaccine included all young adults under the age of 20.  Issues also arise in respect of logistics and whether the system is able to achieve some of these objectives.  We are also in the middle of other campaigns at present, including the HPV campaign and the HPV catch-up campaign for girls in secondary school.  We also face a problem with both measles and pertussis and we are trying to increase vaccination rates for those diseases.  The final decision on introducing the vaccine will be up to the Department of Health and the Government.  Some of that will be reflected in the cost-benefit analysis.  Depending on what is proposed, the administration costs may be high or relatively low.  It will be simply be a matter of performing two tasks at the same time but if we ask people to do something de novo we could incur additional costs.<\/p><p>  We are all medical practitioners.  I spent my clinical time in paediatrics in the early 1980s.  The changes we have seen in terms of meningococcal C, Hib and the pneumococcal vaccine have been immense.  I used to have immense fears for children coming in with these diseases because they presented in a very poor condition and our ability to treat them was problematic, even in terms of inserting a needle.  Changing methods of treatment but also the vaccines have made a big difference.  Current medical students have no idea what Hib is.  When I was a junior doctor croup was one of the most frightening diseases I saw.  We have experienced difficulties recently with pertussis, or whooping cough, but many doctors do not recognise its symptoms.  It is a dreadful disease and is especially problematic for young children.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately there have been two deaths in this country in the last year from whooping cough in babies who could not take the vaccine.  This is one of the fundamental issues in terms of vaccination.  Immunisation is not only a question of protecting oneself.  As a society we also have an obligation to protect the vulnerable.  In these circumstances, vulnerable members of society include babies under the age of three months who have not started their vaccination programmes.  These programmes put an onus on us as a community to protect the vulnerable.  Vaccinating one's child also protects those babies who cannot yet take the vaccine and one's own baby until he or she is one or two months old.  If this vaccine is seen to be effective we will have what is known as herd immunity and the incidence of disease will drop down to one or two because infection cannot spread.  Some of these vaccines also impact on the elderly.  The pneumococcal vaccine is only given to children but evidence from elsewhere in the world indicates that it helps to reduce the incidence of the disease among elderly people because it is not as widespread in the community.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012122000012#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kevin Kelleher"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1356001200,"counter":1066,"content":"<p>I thank the Meningitis Research Foundation for its balanced and considered presentation.

We need to wait for it to be licensed.  NIAC needs to consider it, which it is doing to a degree.  NIAC would take three to six months to get through some of that because it also needs to seek an external evaluation.  NIAC is a classic health committee within Ireland.  It comprises a group of people who have totally different day jobs.  They meet every month or every other month in their own time in the evenings to consider this work.  We are asking people to do this outside their working lives.  We are not trying to move away.  Everyone present hopes this vaccine turns out to be as good as MenC and we firmly hope we can introduce it like we introduced MenC.  However, there are some other issues.  As I have said we are also in the throes of other immunisation issues.
