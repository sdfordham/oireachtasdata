The situation in all affected areas, including Athlone and Donegal, is being monitored and CWS staff are engaging with the local authorities and other agencies to ensure supports are being provided to those affected as swiftly as possible.  Staff are assessing and meeting the demand for assistance by the public as the needs arise and are visiting the homes of persons affected.<\/p><p>In dealing with emergency events of this nature, the DSP generally adopts a three stage approach as follows:<\/p><p>- Stage 1 is to provide emergency income support payments (food, clothing and personal items) in the immediate aftermath of the event.  A relatively small amount of financial assistance is generally provided initially with payments around the country ranging from &euro;100 to &euro;500 depending on family size;<\/p><p>- Stage 2 generally involves the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items.  It is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes will become known;<\/p><p>Stage 3 is to identify what longer term financial support or works are required.  It could take several months before this stage of response commences and this involves a cross Departmental\/Agency response.  Works carried out can include plastering, dry-lining, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring and painting.<\/p><p>The humanitarian assistance scheme, which is means tested, is available to assist people whose homes are damaged by flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair.  The means assessment for Humanitarian Assistance is more generous than that applied under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in general.  For example, a family consisting of a couple and two children with a gross household income of &euro;70,000 or less will receive 100% of the amount allowable in respect of their application.  For each whole &euro;1,000 of household income above the &euro;70,000 the couple will be required to make a personal contribution of 1% toward the amount allowable.  The amount allowable in any particular case refers to the amount the officer administering the scheme determines is required to replace essential losses and to make any essential repairs.  <\/p><p>The Government has not set a limit on the amount that can be paid to an individual household under this scheme.  Levels of payment depend on the relative severity of damage experienced and the household's ability to meet these costs.  <\/p><p>The current situation in Athlone is being reviewed and assessed by local CWS officials on an ongoing basis.  The Department's input is being co-ordinated with the other emergency services at a local level including Westmeath County Council in ensuring that those who require assistance as a result of the flooding can access CWS services as required.  Emergency CWS clinics have been established in Grace Park Road Athlone, operating mornings and afternoons. <\/p><p>Similarly, officials in County Donegal have been in contact with individuals who have suffered damages following flooding and a small number of claims have been made. <\/p><p>People seeking assistance under the scheme should contact their local DSP Intreo Centre or CWS office who will be able to offer assistance.  Department contact phone numbers for persons in affected areas are available on the Department's website, as follows:<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500066#WRC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Eligibility","counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500066#WRC02800"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[44678\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500066#WRC02900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"why a person (details supplied) in County Kildare who is in receipt of jobseeker's allowance does not qualify for the Christmas bonus payment.","asker":"949","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>A bonus of 75% of the normal weekly payment was paid in December 2015 to people getting a long-term social welfare payment.

The necessary legislation to effect these recommendations was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997 (now incorporated in the Social Welfare Consolidated Act 2005) which provided for the implementation of the change in two stages, with the paid contribution requirement being standardised at 260 from 2002, rising to 520 from April 2012.<\/p><p>Social welfare supports will continue to be available to those who need it most and where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions, such as the State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is 95% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500067#WRD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Payments","counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500067#WRD01200"},{"type":"question","counter":150,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[44902\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500067#WRD01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied) in County Kerry under the invalidity benefit scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":151,"content":"<p>The person concerned has been awarded disability allowance with effect from 16 September 2015.

Short-term welfare payments, such as Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit, Maternity Benefit, Illness Benefit and FIS, have never been eligible for the Bonus, and similar arrangements continue to apply this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Christmas bonus (when paid in the past) was administered for SWA recipients by the Community Welfare Service (CWS) of the HSE. The CWS transferred into this Department in late 2011. Prior to the abolition of the Bonus in 2009, there was variation in the administration of the bonus across HSE areas.  When the bonus was re-introduced last year, entitlement was standardised for SWA recipients in line with Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance.  It should be noted that persons on Basic SWA (with a duration of less than 15 months) who are awaiting a decision on a long term scheme (to which the Bonus applies) will receive the Bonus if entitlement to the relevant scheme is backdated to cover the week in which the Bonus would have been payable for 2015.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to review the schemes eligible for the bonus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500067#WRD05300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500067#WRD05400"},{"type":"question","counter":192,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[44971\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500067#WRD05500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a decision has been made on an application for a carer's allowance by a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":193,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person concerned on the 11 September 2015.

The Community Services Programme supports community companies that operate on a community business or social enterprise model. Companies supported by the CSP generate and use income from the services they provide to pay staff, meet overhead costs and to contribute to future development.  The CSP provides a contribution to the wage cost on the basis that the services are not fully self-financing or the cost of provision would be prohibitive on users.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, there are 398 active contracts in place with community companies at a cost of &euro;42 million per annum.  The Programme directly supports 2,110 full-time positions. Of these positions, a financial contribution of &euro;32,000 per annum is made to support the employment of managers, of which there are 312 currently.  Funds are also provided as a contribution to the cost of employing people in some 1,800 full-time equivalent positions.  The Department estimates that some 2,800 people are employed across these companies with direct CSP support.  Another 1,100 people are employed in these companies without public funding support.  Additionally, the companies provide some 1,500 work placements through CE, the Rural Social Scheme and T&uacute;s.  These companies are valuable to the social fabric of the country and provide very good quality services, particularly in poorer urban areas and rural villages where services are not widely available. <\/p>  <p>  Since the CSP became operational in 2006, it has helped companies to move from a situation where the minimum wage was paid to a position today where 60% of employees are paid above this level.  The Department is committed to working with the remaining companies to work towards paying a reasonable wage.  The resurgent economy will support this move.  A core requirement of the Programme is that service providers generate non-public revenues from their operations by the sale of goods, charging fees for services delivered or fundraising.  <\/p>  <p>  Companies in contract with CSP must be not-for-profit, social enterprise or community business in nature.  This does not mean that they should not aspire to make reasonable returns from their activities that allow for a good wage to be paid.  The CSP operates very clearly on the basis that it provides a &ldquo;contribution only&rdquo; to offset the wage costs of service provision.  However, it is entirely a matter for each service provider to set their own wage levels.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputies should note that some 45% of non-management staff are paid the minimum wage in companies in contract to the CSP, contrary to the requirements of the programme to pay the local pay rate.  Ten percent were paid above the proposed living wage of &euro;11.50 per hour and the remaining 45% are paid between these ranges.  The development of the Programme and the companies in recent years has ensured that the majority of companies do not continue to operate with a low pay model.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department is working with Pobal to put in place arrangements that will allow companies to apply in a structured manner to access short-term financial support, if that is needed to deal with the issues identified.  The arrangements which are being prepared will be notified to companies early in the New Year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500067#WRD06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":203,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500067#WRD06600"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[45060\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500067#WRD06700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the ground rents payable by her Department or agencies under her remit, by named property, by name of landlord, by amount payable, in 2015 and in 2016, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":205,"content":"<p>The Department of Social Protection is not aware of any ground rents payable for any property either under our remit or payable by an Agency under our remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500067#WRD06800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500067#WRD06900"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[45064\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500067#WRD07000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of an application for a disability allowance by a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":208,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department has received an application for disability allowance from the above named person on 12 November 2015.

NAMA's role is, like the owner of any non-performing loan, that of a secured lender which makes a commercial decision to advance funding to maximise its return. As a secured lender, NAMA provides funding to its debtors and receivers where it is shown that this will increase the overall recovery for NAMA from the security being funded.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for the Environment, Local Government and Community has responsibility for planning legislation.\u00a0Part V of the Planning and Development Act dictates the required provision of social housing as part of\u00a0new\u00a0residential developments. Residential projects delivered by NAMA debtors and receivers, which may be funded by NAMA,\u00a0are subject to the same planning requirements as all other applicants in the planning process, including Part V legislation which requires the provision of 10% of housing units for social housing. The\u00a0Government recently amended Part V to remove the ability of developers to account for their social housing commitments through cash payments to local authorities and furthermore to ensure that the social housing will be located predominantly on the site of the original developments, not off-site as had been a feature of Part V since its introduction. NAMA debtors and receivers will\u00a0fulfil their Part V obligation to deliver 10% of residential units in the form of on-site social housing units. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, I have recently\u00a0explained that NAMA cannot subvent the supply of social housing.\u00a0 Section 10 of the NAMA Act requires NAMA to act in a commercial manner to obtain the best financial return for taxpayers.\u00a0 In line with NAMA's obligations under Section 10, all residential projects will be required to pass a stringent commercial viability threshold before NAMA approves funding and funding\u00a0will\u00a0only be made available if it is expected to\u00a0increase the overall recovery for NAMA\u00a0from the security being funded.\u00a0NAMA must act akin to a private sector commercial entity. \u00a0In essence any\u00a0funding that NAMA may provide must be expected to\u00a0enhance NAMA's overall\u00a0recovery on its loans. \u00a0More specifically, any\u00a0funding provided by NAMA\u00a0must be provided on commercial terms to its debtors and any resulting units constructed must be sold at the prevailing market rate to ensure that NAMA is maximising the recovery on its loans.<\/p>  <p>  With NAMA estimating that 20,000\u00a0residential units\u00a0may be delivered under its Residential Funding Programme between 2016 and 2020, the corresponding Part V contribution\u00a0of\u00a02,000 social housing units\u00a0should not be forgotten. \u00a0As with any delivery of housing, the\u00a0Part V contribution is a meaningful contribution to social housing supply.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, NAMA has already played a very important role in facilitating, on a commercial basis, the supply of houses and apartments for social housing from within its existing portfolio. By the end of this year, NAMA will have facilitated the supply of 2,000 houses and apartments for social housing through its debtors and receivers. This equates to more than one-third of total social housing provision under Part V (Social Housing) legislation in the years between 2002 and 2011. It should also be noted that NAMA originally made over 6,500 houses and apartments available for social housing under this commercial initiative but local authorities confirmed demand for just over 2,500 of these.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, NAMA's contribution to the housing market and, by association, social housing, is ongoing,\u00a0timely and welcome. The core housing issue that we currently face is that of insufficient supply across all types of housing including social housing. \u00a0It is only by substantially increasing housing supply generally, particularly in the greater Dublin area, that we can deliver a sustainable solution to the current housing situation. By increasing the level of housing output, Part V will ensure the direct supply of a certain amount of\u00a0social housing. \u00a0An increase in the level of housing output will also\u00a0increase the affordability of housing generally, which in turn will have a positive effect on the\u00a0ability of local authorities\u00a0to provide social housing directly.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  NAMA will continue to\u00a0play a\u00a0role in addressing this shortage but, for the reasons outlined above, it is not feasible\u00a0to\u00a0expect the\u00a0Agency\u00a0to\u00a0be a\u00a0panacea or to provide units on anything other than commercial terms.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government has a number of strategies in this regard, which I have previously remarked on - namely our\u00a0Social Housing 2020 strategy, which will provide 35,000 new social housing units over the period to 2020, a significant\u00a0increase in funding for addressing\u00a0social housing and homelessness to tackle more immediate issues facing families, and the recently announced amendments to rent reviews.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500069#WRF02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500069#WRF02550"},{"type":"question","counter":308,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[44784\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500069#WRF02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the details of the total net discretionary revenue measures in each year from 2017 to 2021, as per the economic and fiscal outlook provided with budget 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":309,"content":"<p>The levels of discretionary revenue measures for the period 2015 to 2021 are set out in Table A6 on page C.49 of the Budget 2016 book.<\/p><p>A breakdown of measures for the period 2017 - 2021 is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Discretionary revenue Measures<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>2018<\/th><th>2019<\/th><th>2020<\/th><th>2021<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro; billion<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carryover of Budget 2016 measures<\/td><td>-0.30<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carryover of 2016 non-indexation of Tax system<\/td><td>0.10<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carryover from previous Budget measures<\/td><td>0.01<\/td><td>0.01<\/td><td>0.04<\/td><td>0.01<\/td><td>0.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Total <\/b><\/td><td><b>-0.19<\/b><\/td><td><b>0.01<\/b><\/td><td><b>0.04<\/b><\/td><td><b>0.01<\/b><\/td><td><b>0.00<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>% of GDP<\/b><\/td><td><b>-0.1<\/b><\/td><td><b>0.0<\/b><\/td><td><b>0.0<\/b><\/td><td><b>0.0<\/b><\/td><td><b>0.0<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table>Source: Department of Finance<\/p><p>Carryover of Budget 2016 measures takes account of the full year cost against the first year cost as outlined in the Taxation measures described on pages A.5 to A.8 of the Budget 2016 book.<\/p><p>It should also be noted that there is a provision for indexation of the income tax system included in the baseline Budget figures.

Following on from that, an  implementation timetable for the 2012\u00a0Act was devised in consultation with stakeholders, including credit union representative bodies. <\/p>  <p>  Commencement of all sections of the 2012 Act has been aligned with the credit union financial year and the introduction of the underpinning Central Bank regulations, with a view to implementation of the 2012 Act in a coherent and cohesive manner. This has provided credit unions with the time necessary to ensure that\u00a0the required processes\u00a0and procedures are in place prior to implementation of each tranche.<\/p>  <p>  I have met with the three credit union representative bodies and their concerns around the new regulations\u00a0were discussed. Officials from my Department have also met with the sector.\u00a0It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations by the Registrar of Credit Unions.\u00a0These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act. <\/p>  <p>  Separately to the consultation process, as outlined in the Central Bank's feedback statement on CP88, I proposed that in the interests of clarity and fairness, credit unions are provided with details of the process of applying for a retention of savings above the limit amount.\u00a0 I have been informed by the Registry of Credit Unions that all credit unions have been contacted\u00a0and given\u00a0further information on its application criteria for the retention of savings in excess of &euro;100,000.\u00a0 The Registry of Credit Unions intends to engage with the representative bodies and to invite comments from them prior to finalisation of the application process.\u00a0On finalisation of the application process, the Registry will provide an application form and explanatory notes in order to assist credit unions in making an application. It is anticipated that application forms will be available this month.\u00a0 It is envisaged that applications will be accepted in the first quarter of 2016 and that applicant credit unions will be informed by the end of the second quarter of 2016 on the outcome of the process, which is well within the 12 month transitional period. Where a credit union has demonstrated that it meets the criteria, it will be in a position to retain members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000 held at the commencement of the regulations. <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the steps that have been taken to provide clarity for credit unions on the criteria for retaining\u00a0savings of over &euro;100,000 and I also welcome the Central Bank proposed engagement with the representative bodies to seek their comments on the application process.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also informed me that it is committed to undertaking a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit, once the impact of the restructuring process can be assessed. It is envisaged that this review will commence within three years of the introduction of the regulations. My officials have asked the Central Bank to consider accelerating  this review and this is currently under consideration by the Central Bank. The Central Bank has agreed to provide regular updates to my Department on developments\u00a0regarding this matter.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that it has been necessary to put lending restrictions in place in credit unions where there are regulatory concerns and resultant risk to members' savings. These lending restrictions are reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether or not they are still set at appropriate levels.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In February 2015 the Central Bank commenced a lending restriction review initiative, whereby credit unions that are subject to a lending restriction, but are satisfied that they have made the necessary improvements and have embedded these improvements in robust risk sensitive lending practices, could apply for a review of their lending restriction. The closing date for receipt of applications to review lending restrictions under this initiative was 30 September 2015.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank further informs me that at this stage where a review has been completed 74% of the applicant credit unions have had their lending restriction lifted and are now operating under the board's stated credit risk appetite. C.40% of credit unions that applied made their application in September. The majority of these applications are still in the process of review.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This review has reduced the number of credit unions with lending restrictions as currently approximately 35% of credit unions have a lending restriction compared with 52% at the start of the review process.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further informed me that all credit unions were contacted and invited to attend\u00a0information seminars being held around the country from mid to end November. These seminars provided credit unions with the opportunity to engage with the Central Bank\u00a0 on the new regulations and to discuss development of the credit union business model,\u00a0including any changes to the regulatory framework that might be required to facilitate those developments.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is\u00a0absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500069#WRF03300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies Expenditure","counter":319,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500069#WRF03350"},{"type":"question","counter":320,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[45055\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500069#WRF03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the ground rents the Department or agencies under its remit will pay, by named property, by name of landlord and by amount payable in 2015 and in 2016 in tabular form;

The study is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW, working in partnership with the local authorities.<\/p><p>A national public consultation on the draft flood maps is currently on-going until 23 December 2015. Details are available at the local authority offices at County House, Lifford and Letterkenny Public Services Centre, Neil T Blaney Road, Letterkenny and on the consultation website .<\/p><p>The Programme involves the development of preliminary flood risk management options and flood risk management plans. In relation to assessment of flood risk in Raphoe, the flood risk management options report is nearing completion by consultants on behalf of the OPW. Public consultation on these options will be held early in 2016. Feedback received during the public consultation will then inform the relevant Flood Risk Management Plan to be prepared for consultation and completion by the end of 2016.  <\/p><p>The Plans, which are scheduled for completion by the end of 2016, will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner.<\/p><p>Further information is available on the study website: .<\/p><p>Investigation of flooding, in the first instance, is a matter for each local authority to investigate and address. Donegal County Council may carry out flood mitigation works using its own resources. The Council may also apply to the Office of Public Works (OPW) for funding of flood mitigation works under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  This purpose of this scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor works to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  The scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame. <\/p><p>Under the scheme, applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost no more than &euro;500,000 in each instance.  Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects, with the balance being funded by the local authority concerned.  Any application received will be considered in accordance with the scheme eligibility criteria, including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of resources for flood risk management.

A total of 11,500km of river channel form part of the Arterial Drainage Schemes, and approximately 730km of embankments. While new Arterial Drainage Schemes are no longer being undertaken, the OPW has a statutory duty to maintain the completed schemes in proper repair and in an effective condition. The annual maintenance programme typically involves some clearance of vegetation and removal of silt build-up on an average five-yearly cycle. The location of the Schemes undertaken throughout the country is provided in the spreadsheet below.<\/p><p>The purpose of the Arterial Drainage Schemes was primarily to improve the drainage of agricultural lands to enhance production. This typically involved lowering or widening river beds to facilitate the drainage and discharge of neighbouring lands and drainage channels. While not the primary purpose of the Schemes, they did also provide enhanced conveyance capacity where they passed through towns, villages and dispersed rural communities that in turn has reduced the flood risk to properties in these areas.<\/p><p>Drainage Districts are areas where drainage schemes to improve land for agricultural purposes were constructed under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925. 170 Drainage District Schemes were established, covering 4,600km of channel.

The statutory duty of maintenance for these schemes lies with the Local Authorities concerned. <\/p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works (OPW) carries out its own programme of Arterial Drainage Maintenance to a total of 11,500km of river channel and approximately 730km of embankments. These are arterial drainage schemes completed by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995, whose purpose was primarily to improve the drainage of agricultural lands to enhance production.  This typically involved lowering or widening river beds to facilitate the drainage and discharge of neighbouring lands and drainage channels.  While not the primary purpose of the Schemes, they did also provide enhanced conveyance capacity where they passed through towns, villages and dispersed rural communities that in turn has reduced the amount of flooding that could occur in these areas.<\/p>  <p>  While new Arterial Drainage Schemes are no longer being undertaken, the OPW has a statutory duty to maintain the completed schemes in proper repair and in an effective condition. The annual maintenance programme typically involves some clearance of vegetation and removal of silt build-up on an average five-yearly cycle. <\/p>  <p>  The term dredging is sometimes used to describe such channel maintenance operations. Maintenance of channels is carried out using suitably rigged hydraulic excavators which remove the build up of water entrained silt and vegetation from the channel bed thus restoring the original channel conveyance capacity to the standard of the completed scheme. It does not involve any further deepening or widening of the existing channel. <\/p>  <p>  For channels impinging on or within Natura 2000 Sites assessments under the Habitat Regulations are undertaken in advance of the works and for many schemes a five yearly environmental assessment is now place. OPW maintenance operations are carried out in accordance with OPW Environmental Management Protocols and Standard Operating Procedures. <\/p>  <p>  Local flooding issues are a matter, in the first instance, for each Local Authority to investigate and address, and County Councils may carry out flood mitigation works using their own resources.  The OPW operates the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  This purpose of this scheme is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  The scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government's core strategy for addressing those areas at most significant risk and impact from flooding is the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.

The Action Plan for Jobs has been an annual process whereby changes right across Government have been developed, and then implemented with a strict timetable overseen from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Office. The focus of the actions is to achieve key targets, principally getting 100,000 people back at work and improving the business environment for growing strong enterprises. To date, over 135,800 jobs have been created, including an additional 20,000 employed in the South West region from the start of the APJ process in Q1 2012 to Q3 2015. <\/p>  <p>  My Department coordinates the development of the annual Action Plans across government departments. While I do not have direct responsibility for energy policy, which rests with my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, we have discussed this issue in the broader context of sustaining and growing jobs in the South West region. Specifically in July this year we launched the South West Regional Action Plan for Jobs, developed following a consultation process with private and public sector stakeholders in the region, with the objective of growing employment in the South West by over thirty thousand by 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Today there are over 158 IDA Ireland supported foreign subsidiaries in the region employing more than 30,500 people, 717 Enterprise Ireland supported companies employing 26,600 people, together with 4,500 employed in 910 Local Enterprise Office supported firms. Employment in IDA and EI assisted firms combined has increased by 7,600 between 2012 and 2014.

In light of that conclusion, the Government had agreed that Minister White&rsquo;s Department should liaise with the Irish oil industry and appropriate public bodies to determine any policy options that might facilitate the commercial future of refining in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Minister expects to brief the Government on the issues again, and I and my Department remain engaged on this agenda to help to ensure a secure, sustainable and competitive supply of oil for Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  My intention is to publish the 2016 Action Plan in mid-January 2016.

At the end of that period, all PIEs must re-tender for audit services.  <\/p>  <p>  Member States then have an option to allow PIEs to reappoint the same auditor for a second period of up to 10 years.

The EU also adopted a new Regulation that introduced a comprehensive prohibition on commercial fishing for seabass by all EU Member States fishing vessels in the Irish and Celtic Seas for 2015. This underpins the conservation actions already taken by Ireland for over 20 years with regard to this vulnerable stock. The EU has also increased the minimum landing size for seabass for 2015 and again Ireland supported this measure. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the TAC and quota proposal for 2016, the Commission has proposed, and I generally welcome, further conservation measures for this stock including a continuation of the comprehensive prohibition on commercial fishing for seabass by all EU Member States fishing vessels in the Irish and Celtic Seas for 2016. However, we have a concern that the proposal as it stands, while aimed at protecting the stock, may inadvertently harm the highly regulated recreational angling sector in Ireland. The current proposal would ban all angling activity for seabass for the first six months of the year and a one fish per day rule for the rest of the year. Currently Ireland operates a 2 fish per day rule and the rest of the EU applied a 3 fish per day rule in 2016. I fully support the one fish per day limit suggested, however as I agree with the Deputy on the potential harm to our tourism sector, I do not support a complete ban on angling for the first six months of the year. Irish anglers are not the reason that seabass is continuing to decline and Ireland has been at the forefront of conservation measures for this stock for decades. It would in my view be unfair to take such a severe approach to the recreational sector in Ireland given their ongoing efforts to protect the stock. Consequently, I will endeavour, at December Council, to persuade the Commission that a catch and release recreational fishery be permitted to continue during the first six months of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500073#WRK05900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Harbours and Piers Development","counter":593,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500073#WRK06000"},{"type":"question","counter":594,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[45382\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500073#WRK06100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will examine a project (details supplied) for possible future development; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":595,"content":"<p>Responsibility for development, and subsequent repair and maintenance of a pier at Cromane rests with Kerry County Council.

Under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, any person found guilty of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation shall be liable to imprisonment for a period up to life.  It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years.<\/p>  <p>  On 23 September, I published the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015, as approved by Government.  The Bill provides for two new offences of purchasing sexual services, in the context of prostitution.  The purpose of these offences is to target the demand for prostitution.  The first is a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person, in the context of prostitution, and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and\/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not commit an offence.<\/p>  <p>  These proposals have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012.  The new offences also implement the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.  Both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament have recognised the effectiveness of the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual services as a tool in the fight against human trafficking.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill was most recently considered in the Seanad on 11 December and the enactment of this Bill is a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500074#WRL03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Offences","counter":648,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500074#WRL03150"},{"type":"question","counter":649,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[44763\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500074#WRL03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of fixed charge penalty notices issued to learner drivers for driving without being accompanied by a fully qualified driver, for non-display of L plates in 2014 and in 2015 to date, how many persons paid these notices within the 56-day period, how many of those who did not pay within this period were issued with summonses, by District Court, were listed to appear in court, were convicted and had penalty points applied; the number of persons who had their licence numbers recorded, by court, for each of the offences; how many received four points and a conviction, by court; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The first is where the details are provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prior to submission of an application for a summons in respect of the offence.  Where the driving licence number is so collected, the driving licence number is sent electronically to the Courts Service with the summons application and the licence number is updated to the Courts Service computer system.  Under the second method, the details are collected by the Court Registrar where a licence is produced to the court at the hearing of the offence.  As outlined above, if the licence is produced, the Court Registrar records the licence number and the number is updated to the Courts Service computer system.<\/p>  <p>  Where a driving licence is produced to the court during the course of court proceedings relating to penalty point offences, the Court Registrar records the driving licence number.  Following the completion of the proceedings the driving licence number is updated to the Courts Service computer system if the accused is convicted of the offence before the court.  Subsequently the details of the conviction and the associated driving licence number are sent electronically to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for the application of penalty points.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that where an accused is summonsed to appear before a court and subsequently convicted of the offence, if a driving licence is not produced to the court, the Court Registrar records in the Court Minute Book or on the summons that no driving licence was produced.  The non- production of the driving licence is recorded whether or not the accused appears before the court.<\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that there is no project underway to electronically record the non-production of a licence in court.  However, I want to assure you that my Department is in contact with the relevant agencies with a view to ensuring that the most efficient and effective processing and recording of data in respect of non-production of licences applies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500074#WRL03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":656,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[44767\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500074#WRL03700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to the reply, dated 3 November 2015, to Parliamentary Question No. 545 of 3 November 2015 wherein she stated that the statistics were being collated, if she now has these figures available; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend themselves in person or through legal assistance of their own choosing, or if they have insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require. The Deputy will appreciate that the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.<\/p>  <p>  The assignment of lawyers or the granting of aid are matters for the Court and, as such are handled by the judiciary on the applicant's appearance in court. Criminal prosecutions originate in the District Court and if so satisfied, the Judge will grant a criminal legal aid certificate. Figures are not kept in such a way as to be able to provide a breakdown of the number of certificates granted for criminal legal aid in County Galway, broken down by category of offence and the cost of same. There is no limit to the number of times that a person can be granted legal aid under the Scheme.  Whether or not an applicant has received legal aid previously is not a consideration in determining eligibility for legal aid and such information is not recorded by the Courts Service. An applicant's previous convictions are also not a criterion for the granting of criminal legal aid under the Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500076#WRN02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Transport Data","counter":746,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500076#WRN02500"},{"type":"question","counter":747,"qnumday":307,"qnumall":"[45221\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500076#WRN02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"how many Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na vehicles, by type, were in operation at the end of each year since 2010 to date, how many are to be decommissioned in 2015 and how many new vehicles will be provided in 2016, in the Galway west division; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1108","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":748,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate decisions in relation to the provision and allocation of Garda vehicles are a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the light of her identified operational demands and the availability of resources.

This includes personnel, Garda vehicles and the various technologies utilised to support front-line Garda&iacute; and intelligence-led operations against organised crime.  This process takes account of annual policing priorities determined by me as Minister for Justice in consultation with the Garda Commissioner as provided for under section 20 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Garda authorities are continually looking to ensure that the latest information, communications and forensic technologies are sourced and deployed to achieve their strategic objectives as set out in the context of their annual policing plans, as provided for in section 22 of the 2005 Act.  This policy is designed to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be properly resourced to meet the evolving needs of a modern effective police force and take advantage of proven up to date technological developments in crime detection and prevention as they occur.<\/p>  <p>  Any proposals in relation to the use of drone technology loaded with recording equipment would need to consider potential legal issues including in relation to privacy, data protection and the permitted use of surveillance equipment and also their potential effectiveness having regard to their limitations as to distance and battery life. This Government is committed to delivering a visible and responsive policing service through highly-mobile and responsive Garda patrols in urban and rural areas.

It will also provide additional funding for Garda surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing. This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles. We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.

In excess of &euro;5 million is being committed to support Operation Thor. This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures.<\/p>  <p>  This intensive, targeted operation has to be seen in the context of the major investment that this Government is making in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.<\/p>  <p>  Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner, in consultation with her senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including the additional allocation of the &euro;5 million to support Operation Thor.  The Commissioner has assured me that she will aim to maximise the use of these additional resources. A large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders. Figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service indicate that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars. Targeting these prolific offenders is a priority, consequently the allocation of resources under Operation Thor will be intelligence led and based on analysis of crime patterns  by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The aim is to deploy resources in advance of where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na anticipate crime might take place in order to prevent the crime occurring.<\/p>  <p>  In this context the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to detail the additional resources that will be made available to any one County under Operation Thor.  However the Commissioner will continually review the allocation of resources under the Operation, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities across the Garda Regions so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.  I am confident that this comprehensive operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supported by Government investment, will help disrupt the activities of burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders and will improve  the safety of all our communities across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500076#WRN03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Refugee Numbers","counter":758,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500076#WRN03700"},{"type":"question","counter":759,"qnumday":311,"qnumall":"[45235\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500076#WRN03800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons of Syrian origin or claiming to be of Syrian origin refused leave to land at various points of entry, the reason in each case, by age, by gender by country to which they were returned, in 2015 to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"998","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":760,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[45236\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500076#WRN03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons of Eritrean origin or claiming to be of Eritrean origin refused leave to land at various points of entry, the reason in each case, by age, by gender of the persons refused, by country to which they were returned, in 2015 to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"998","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":761,"qnumday":313,"qnumall":"[45237\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500076#WRN04000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons of Afghan origin or claiming to be of Afghan origin refused leave to land at various points of entry, the reasons in each case, by age, by gender of the persons refused, by the country to which they were returned, in 2015 to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"998","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":762,"qnumday":314,"qnumall":"[45238\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500076#WRN04100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons of Iranian origin or claiming to be of Iranian origin refused leave to land at various points of entry, the reason in each case, by age, by gender of the persons refused, by country to which they were returned; in 2015 to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"998","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":763,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 311 to 314, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that in the period concerned the number of persons refused leave to land at approved ports of entry to the State from the nationalities referred to by the Deputy was as follows: Afghan 139, Eritrean 11, Iranian 44 and Syrian 59.

While it is the case that a shortfall in staffing numbers on a particular day can impact negatively on service provision, the Irish Prison Service is actively pursuing the option of having all libraries in prisons managed by long-term, suitably trained prisoners, with professional oversight in order to maximise the service.

This involves a specific orientation in the delivery of services to prisoners and an emphasis on prisoners taking greater personal responsibility for their own development through active engagement with both specialist and non-specialist services in the prisons.<\/p><p>Following committal the Integrated Sentence Management Coordinator conducts a First Contact Assessment.  This First Contact Assessment identifies the needs of the prisoner in several areas such as accommodation, education and offending behaviour.  Referrals are made on foot of this assessment to services within the prison such as Education, Work\/Training and outside agencies providing an in-reach service.  The various actions recommended by these services are compiled into a Personal Integration Plan.  This is a plan of actions for the prisoner to complete during his\/her time in prison.  The Personal Integration Plan will be reviewed regularly depending on the length of the sentence.  Approximately 9 months prior to the release of the prisoner, a Community Integration Plan will be developed. This sets out a plan for the prisoner to prepare for his\/her release. <\/p><p>The end result is a prisoner centred, multi-disciplinary approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress.  Important issues such as accommodation, income support, training or employment are addressed to help the prisoner resettle into the community on release and reduce the risk of re-offending.<\/p><p>Integrated Sentence Management Coordinators are also active participants in sentence planning for certain categories of prisoners serving less than one year, for example, female prisoners, prisoners who have declared their risk of homelessness on release, or prisoners participating in the Community Support Scheme.

Firstly, it is generally best that complaints are dealt with locally when they occur and all efforts made to resolve them with the patient or person who has the complaint.  The Health Act 2004 (Part 9) states that a person has the right to complain about any action of the Health Service Executive (HSE) or a service provider that they believe was not fair or had an adverse effect on them.  The HSE has appointed designated Complaints Officers to ensure the effective management of complaints throughout their relevant areas of responsibility and a person can make a complaint in writing, in person or over the telephone. The HSE actively encourages and promotes consumer feedback and links with customers on a regular basis to ensure that the complaint handling processes are effective, are being communicated and are achieving outcomes that are satisfactory to the consumers. The HSE continues to seek improvements in its complaint handling ability and capacity in order to respond to the needs of patients.<\/p><p>If an individual is unhappy with the way in which his\/her complaint was dealt with at the point of care the National Advocacy Unit of the HSE will appoint an independent officer to review the complaint. The Executive also has a National Safety Incident Management Policy which sets out the steps to be taken in an investigation; when independence from the HSE is required, the HSE policy provides for national and international experts to be part of reviews. If an individual is still unhappy with the outcome of this process he\/she can request an independent review of the complaint from the Office of the Ombudsman.<\/p><p>In addition if an individual is unhappy with the level of care provided by a regulated health service professional such as a doctor, nurse or other healthcare professional, he\/she may make a complaint to that employee's professional regulatory body.<\/p><p><i>Healthcomplaints.ie<\/i>is an on-line information service which was developed by the Office of the Ombudsman in cooperation witha number of organisations including my Department and the HSE. This service provides information on how to make a complaint or give feedback about health and social care services in Ireland. This website has been developed for people who use health and social care services in Ireland, as well as for their families, care-givers and advocates.<\/p><p>Work on a new independent national model for patient advocacy has commenced. This advocacy service will be external to the Department and the HSE and will be in line with international best practice. The exact functions of the advocacy services have not been decided at this time. It will, however, be established primarily to support patients and will provide guidance on how to make complaints and navigate through the health service. Naturally, the Department will be seeking the views of those individuals and groups currently involved in the provision of advocacy services such as Mental Health Reform and looks forward to receiving their proposals on advocacy services. It is also planned  to simplify the process of making complaints for patients and will look to extend the powers of the Ombudsman in relation to complaints in this regard.<\/p><p>I should also point out that earlier this year, an Expert Group which I appointed to review the Mental Health Act 2001 published its report. One of the issues looked at by the Group was the complaints procedures that currently exist within the service and the suggestion of providing for a separate Mental Health Ombudsman. It was felt by the Group that complaints about mental health services already have access to a number of options including the existing Office of the Ombudsman and the fact that a separate complaints system for mental health patients could be seen as discriminatory, it would be premature to recommend a separate Mental Health Ombudsman at this juncture. The Group did however recommend that this issue should be re-examined as part of the suggested five to ten year review of any new Act.<\/p><p>Work on a General Scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act 2001 based on the recommendations of the Expert Group review has commenced. During the course of this work, there will be further engagement and consultation with a wide range of stakeholders and relevant  groups, including Mental Health Reform  and their observations and comments on all aspects of the revised legislation will be taken into consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500079#WRQ05500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regulatory Bodies","counter":910,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500079#WRQ05600"},{"type":"question","counter":911,"qnumday":384,"qnumall":"[44755\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500079#WRQ05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of his proposals to regulate psychotherapists and counsellors.","asker":"983","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":912,"content":"<p>Psychotherapists and counsellors are not currently regulated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.

All employees including medical staff are required to disclose and report incidents in line with the HSE's Safety Incident Management Policy. Creating a culture of open disclosure and learning from the things that go wrong is the bedrock of making systems safer. Open Disclosure is defined as 'an open consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare. This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the patient informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event'.<\/p>  <p>  I recently announced that the Government has given its approval to the drafting of provisions to support open disclosure of patient safety incidents. This will be included in the Department of Justice and Equality&rsquo;s draft Bill on Periodic Payment Orders which is well advanced. The legislation is part of a broader package of reforms aimed at improving the experience of those who are affected by adverse events. <\/p>  <p>  This legislation builds on the joint development by the HSE and State Claims Agency of the National Policy on Open Disclosure (2013).  The HSE is progressing the implementation of the Policy across all health and social care services.  We all know that when error or harm is experienced by a patient, the trust and confidence of that patient and their family are compromised.  That is why honest, open disclosure and communication, which demonstrate empathy and sensitivity, are so essential. The intent of this legislation is to provide certain legal protections for healthcare staff for open disclosure, which is undertaken in good faith and in compliance with national standards. This will give further support to those staff in their communications with patients and family members if an adverse event occurs. The Ethical Code of Practice set out by the Medical Council also makes clear the responsibilities of doctors in relation to open disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  Open disclosure is now HSE policy and therefore any unjustified breach of the policy (as with any HSE policy) will be managed in line with the HSE disciplinary procedures. Where potential deviations have been identified the Healthcare records must be reviewed to ascertain any documentation in relation to communication with the patient about the adverse event and to establish if any rationale for non-disclosure has been documented. Where there is no evidence that open disclosure has occurred the incident must be reviewed with the staff involved in the event. The patient must be informed of the event and the impact of the event explained and acknowledged. The patient should also be informed of the initial failure to disclose and an appropriate acknowledgement, explanation and apology provided.<\/p>  <p>  From a patient safety perspective the key focus of open disclosure is on learning so that systems and processes can be improved in order to reduce potential future harms to patients. If a person is not satisfied that a health professional or administrator has fulfilled their obligations regarding open disclosure then that person has recourse to the HSE's complaints procedures. It is also open to a person to raise a complaint with the appropriate professional regulatory body or with the Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500080#WRR02600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":955,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500080#WRR02650"},{"type":"question","counter":956,"qnumday":402,"qnumall":"[44871\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500080#WRR02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a nurse will be appointed to a school (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":957,"content":"<p>The particular issue raised by the Deputy is a service matter for the Health Service Executive.

In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold. Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs.<\/p>  <p>  The Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) payment is made by the Minister for Social Protection to carers in respect of a child at home under 16 years of age with a severe disability, where it has been determined that the child requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age. Eligibility for the DCA is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required. As such it is not possible to say if a particular child or any particular medical condition or disability will qualify for a payment under the DCA scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility, known as the Keane Report, recommended that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card and that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions for medical card eligibility. Nonetheless, it is clear that there are people &ndash; including children - with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, the Clinical Advisory Group on medical card eligibility was established by the HSE to develop a framework for assessment and measurement of the burden of disease and appropriate operational guidelines for the medical card scheme. However, the Clinical Advisory Group has not recommended that children in receipt of the Domiciliary Care Allowance should automatically qualify for a medical card. In advance of the Group completing its work, there are no proposals to issue automatic medical cards to one particular group.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to making the medical card system as responsive as possible to the circumstances of people with significant medical needs. As a result of a range of improvements, the HSE is exercising greater discretion. Consequently, the number of discretionary medical cards has increased by about 84% - from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to nearly 96,000 at the beginning of November this year.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, the proper way to address this issue is to develop a system of universal health care, which is at the centre of Government health policy. Otherwise, whenever there are qualifying rules, there will always be a person who is above the means test, does not have the selected disease, or is not in receipt of the specific social welfare payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500080#WRR03500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointment Delays","counter":968,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500080#WRR03550"},{"type":"question","counter":969,"qnumday":406,"qnumall":"[44918\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500080#WRR03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the lengthy delay in a person (details supplied) in Dublin 22 receiving an appointment at Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin for emergency surgery, when a date for the surgery will be provided.","asker":"1008","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":970,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

As there are approximately 8,000 rare diseases, the National Plan for Rare Diseases was launched in 2014 by the then Minister for Health and this sets out the general approach.  The National Rare Disease Plan recommended that an Oversight Implementation Group of relevant stakeholders led by the HSE and including patients' groups, be established to oversee and monitor implementation of the plan's recommendations.  This group was established by my Department earlier this year and it has met on a number of occasions.  One of the principal recommendations in the Plan was the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases.  This programme will be responsible for, among others: Mapping, developing and implementing care pathways for rare diseases; facilitating timely access to centres of expertise - nationally and internationally; developing treatment guidelines for many rare disorders; and developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In line with this recommendation, a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was established last year under the National Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division of the HSE.  The programme is a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  This clinical programme will ultimately be a channel for advancing and implementing other recommendations in the plan, such as those on National Centres of Expertise for rare diseases; and in this vein, the programme has designed a framework for the designation of Irish Centres of Expertise in line with the recommendations stipulated in the national plan.  This framework will touch on a number of recommendations in the national plan, including those that refer to fortifying research functions for rare diseases. <\/p>  <p>  The programme and my Department will be encouraging designated centres of expertise to participate in European Reference Networks (ERNs) for Rare Diseases in line with our national plan.  ERNs are European networks connecting health care providers and centres of expertise so that international expertise on specific rare diseases - such as Bannayan Riley Ruvalcaba Syndrome - may be pooled together for the benefit of patients.  Any centres applying for membership of an ERN must have strategies in place to ensure that care is patient-centred; that patients' rights and preferences are respected; and must show a research component to their work. Hence, the recommendations in our national plan that relate to empowering and protecting patients and carers, and research on rare diseases will be fulfilled in part through this process.  In 2014, I announced &euro;850,000 for investment into rare disease research.  Five charities will provide matching funding bringing the total investment to &euro;1.9 million. They will share &euro;850,000 in State funding to take part in international research into rare medical conditions.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) featured prominently in the recommendations of the National Rare Disease plan.  The  national office has now been funded and established by the HSE  and its work will be led by a Consultant Geneticist who will be supported by a Genetics Counsellor and an Administrative Officer.  It will, among other functions, provide up-to-date information regarding new treatment and management options, including clinical trials.  In addition, the post of Information Scientist for the office is being funded jointly by the HSE and the EU Commission with a number of recommendations in mind.  These refer to rare disease registries and the utility of data currently captured in health information systems.  The NRDO has already performed a preliminary situation analysis of the existing rare disease registries and is in the process of assigning these known registries on our national Orphanet site, which is the international rare disease reference and information portal funded by the EU.  The EU Commission has started the development of a European Platform on Rare Diseases Registration.  Its principal goal is to enable sharing and use of rare diseases' patient data across Europe, among the multitude of existing patient registries, within and across rare diseases.  Thus the registration of all registries in Ireland - including any proposed registry on Bannayan Riley Ruvalcaba Syndrome - will be encompassed by the work of the EU Commission with the participation of EU member states, including Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The national plan for rare diseases recommended that the Health Identifiers Bill and the Health &amp;amp; Patient Safety Bill be published.  The former was published in 2013 and enacted in 2014.  It is now being implemented by the HSE.  A revised and much expanded General Scheme of a Health Information and Patient Safety Bill was approved by the government in November of this year and published on the Department's website.  Two recommendations in the national plan refer to training in rare diseases for healthcare professionals.  My Department is contacting formally the various healthcare representative and professional bodies about implementing these recommendations.  Finally, rare diseases have already been tabled on the agenda for North-South meetings.  Therefore, future work to deepen cooperation between both jurisdictions on rare diseases is anticipated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500081#WRS03500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":1029,"qnumday":428,"qnumall":"[45070\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500081#WRS03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the expertise that is currently available within the Health Services Executive regarding diagnosis and subsequent management and care of children and persons with a diagnosis of Bannayan Riley Ruvalcaba syndrome.","asker":"1066","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1030,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.

Patients have the ability to apply to the HSE TAS seeking access to public healthcare outside the state through model form E112.  The application requires the patient's Irish based public referring hospital consultant, following clinical assessment, to certify, among other things, that the treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs. The treatment must not be available within the State or not available within a time normally necessary for obtaining it. It is not considered appropriate that a referring consultant here be required to provide proof that a patient attended an appointment in a hospital abroad under this Scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme as provided for in the EU Regulations and Department of Health Guidelines, does not include a provision for travel and subsistence expenses for patients or their relatives travelling abroad to avail of approved treatments as the primary function of the TAS is to fund treatments for public patients. In keeping with the functions of any state healthcare agency, the Regulation only requires the state agency to fund the treatment. However the HSE, subject to available funding, may provide assistance towards reasonable economic air or sea travel fares for patients, and in the case of a child or where medically necessary one accompanying adult is also funded. This is in recognition of the additional cost that a patient availing of a treatment which is not available in a tertiary service in Ireland may experience in using the Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The TAS Travel Policy was implemented in November 2009 to standardise and provide equity to the provision of entitlements relating to travel expenses. Expenses other than air\/sea fares are not admissible.  However, patients who experience difficulty funding any additional costs may apply to the Department of Social Protection for assistance as an exceptional needs payment. It should be noted that, in general, patients do not incur subsistence costs when undergoing treatment abroad as such costs are included in the cost of the care that the patient is receiving.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE fully accepts there have been delays in processing the reimbursement claims for patients during certain periods over the past 2 years, owing to staffing issues in the TAS office including a long-term staff absence due to illness. The TAS office has offered apologies to patients affected by such delays. During those periods, priority has been given to processing applications over travel claims so as to facilitate approved applicants to receive their treatment under the Scheme.\u00a0The TAS office genuinely regrets this situation and acknowledges the difficulties this can cause for individual patients and\/or their families.\u00a0 Arrangement made by the TAS office have permitted the backlog of claims up to 24 November to be cleared and the aim is to ensure that all claims are processed before Christmas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500082#WRT04500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Data","counter":1084,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500082#WRT04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1085,"qnumday":451,"qnumall":"[45167\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500082#WRT04700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons 80 years of age and over who are in receipt of a full medical card, the economic cost of a medical card (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1086,"content":"<p>Officials in my Department have sought clarification from the Deputy's office concerning the question and the details supplied as they do not appear to relate, but have not had a response.<\/p><p>Should the Deputy wish to resubmit a question at a later date, I will be happy to provide a response. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500082#WRT04800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospice Services","counter":1087,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500082#WRT04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1088,"qnumday":452,"qnumall":"[45177\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500082#WRT05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of Saint Brigid's Hospice, also known as the Drogheda Memorial Hospital, on the Curragh in County Kildare including the extent of the works being undertaken, the timescale for completion of the works and the re-opening of the hospice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1089,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

We share the deep disappointment of the victims and survivors of the Troubles and their families. <\/p>  <p>  It was not the Irish Government who pressed for an agreement that completely left aside the legacy of the past. However, when it became clear that the choice was between having an agreement which uncoupled the past and having no agreement at all, the Government most reluctantly agreed to have a less comprehensive deal that would at least ensure that the devolved institutions would be protected and placed on a stable and sustainable footing. <\/p>  <p>  I remain convinced that the provisions of the Stormont House Agreement for dealing with the legacy of the past offer the best possible way of bringing whatever healing is possible to those affected by the Troubles, including those affected by collusion. When discussing the past in Northern Ireland and its legacy of loss and hurt, iconic tragedies such as Dublin-Monaghan remain central to our work. I believe these new institutions can help to deliver truth and justice to families who have waited too long. It is therefore vitally important that the new institutions have the trust and confidence of the victims and survivors and their families. Their needs will therefore remain central to the Government&rsquo;s work in this area. <\/p>  <p>  What is important now is that we find a way forward that banks the good progress already achieved during the talks on legacy issues and secures a solution to outstanding matters, including the key issue of striking the right balance between the onward disclosure needs of families and the national security requirements being sought by the British Government.<\/p>  <p>  To this end, I met with Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Victims&rsquo; Commissioner on 26 November to discuss the concerns of victims and possible ways to take the issue forward in a manner that satisfies these concerns. I also met the Northern Minister for Justice, David Ford, on 11 December to discuss possible next steps and I will be meeting the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, later this month to explore potential options aimed at resolving the outstanding issues on dealing with the past. <\/p>  <p>  In my discussions with her, I will again raise the All-Party D&aacute;il motions of 2008 and 2011 urging the British Government to allow access by an independent international judicial figure to all original documents in their possession relating to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. When we last discussed this issue on 8 October, the Secretary of State assured me that she would consider afresh how the British Government could respond to the D&aacute;il motions.  I am disappointed that the British Government has not yet positively responded to the requests made in the All-Party D&aacute;il motions and I will ask the Secretary of State again to provide a positive response to the D&aacute;il motions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500084#WRV04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":1208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500084#WRV04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1209,"qnumday":493,"qnumall":"[45056\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500084#WRV05000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the ground rents payable by his Department or agencies under its remit, by named property, by name of landlord and by amount payable, in 2015 and in 2016, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

On 8 October, a conference focusing on migration flows into the EU through the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkans route took place in Luxembourg attended by both JHA and Foreign Ministers.  The Conference issued a Declaration endorsing a five-pronged approach to addressing the migration challenge.<\/p>  <p>  On 11\\12 November EU Heads of State and Government met their African counterparts at a migration summit in Valletta.

Ireland is contributing &euro;3m.<\/p>  <p>  On November 29th an EU-Turkey summit meeting was held at which the EU agreed to provide a financial package worth &euro;3 billion to help Turkey accommodate the more than two million Syrian refugees residing in the country.  As part of the agreement, there is to be a concerted effort by Turkey to cease the flow of irregular migrants.  It has long been recognised that the cooperation of Third Countries is essential if the EU is to manage the migration flows.  The agreement with Turkey represents an important step in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  On 14 December, in the margins of the EU Foreign Affairs Council, I participated in a working lunch with Turkey&rsquo;s foreign minister where the Syrian situation was one of the items discussed.<\/p>  <p>  These initiatives demonstrate the determination of the EU to work as hard as possible to see the refugee crisis resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500085#WRW01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"question","counter":1245,"qnumday":507,"qnumall":"[45465\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500085#WRW01900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on meetings held and topics discussed during his recent visit to United Arab Emirates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1246,"content":"<p>I visited the United Arab Emirates on the 7<sup>th<\/sup>and 8<sup>th<\/sup>of December (arriving there late on December 6th).<\/p><p>I held a number of meetings with senior Emirati officials.

The PWA International application, which is currently awaiting approval by the European Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, will be published following its approval.  A decision on this application is expected this month.<\/p>  <p>  The LTAI EGF programme will run until 19 September 2016.  The overall programme allocation is some &euro;4.15m including an EU contribution of &euro;2.49m, representing 60% of the total.  While the number of redundant workers is 424, based on previous experience the targeted number of redundant workers under the Programme is set at 250 and the number of young persons under the age of 25 not in employment, education or training (NEET persons) is set at 200.  In accordance with Article 6(2) of Regulation EU No 1309\/2013 on the EGF, the number of NEETs cannot exceed the number of targeted beneficiaries.<\/p>  <p>  While the target number of NEETs could be increased to 250, engagement with the NEET cohort is proving challenging in the time-limited context of EGF programmes.  At end August 2015, 76 NEETs, representing 38% of the 200 target, had participated in EGF related programme measures.  Two separate listings of verified NEET persons have been supplied to date by the Department of Social Protection to my Department and these persons have been contacted by the SOLAS EGF Co-ordination units on a number of occasions.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has recently processed an interim advance payment on LTAI EGF programme enterprise supports to Enterprise Ireland for &euro;68,306 in respect of supports being provided by local enterprise offices in South Dublin and Kildare.  Individual service providers did not submit expenditure estimates to my Department for inclusion in this EGF programme application.  Rather beneficiary surveys, cited training needs, estimated participation rates and averaged measure delivery costs informed estimated total programme expenditure.  It must be stressed that final programme expenditure is, as with any EGF programme, dependant ultimately on the take-up of measures, and the particular measure type, by many hundreds of individuals on a personalised choice basis.  As the programme will run until next September and public beneficiary bodies are funding the cost of EGF measures from national budgets and will subsequently submit expenditure declarations at programme end, it is difficult to accurately forecast the final expenditure.  However, I understand that take-up of EGF support measures offered to date is less than anticipated.  As mentioned earlier take-up among the NEETs was 38% at end August while the former worker take-up was at 77% of the targeted beneficiaries at that time.  The improved economic climate resulting in a re-employment rate of some 60% at end August may be a factor which mitigates against a higher programme participation rate.  Lower than estimated take-up rates will result in lower final total expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  EGF beneficiaries may avail of the full suite of courses, whether standard or specialised, offered by various service providers from within the public and private education and training sectors.  In particular, the EGF Training Grant scheme administered by SOLAS enables a wide range of flexible personalised guidance, training and education supports to be taken up.  In terms of specialised programmes to date, while the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board works closely with the EGF Co-Ordination Unit in Solas and while it has not to date provided any specialised programmes for LTAI workers, it has provided individual supports and has facilitated the on-site provision of the tailored NFQ level 8 Higher Diploma in Coaching\/Coaching Psychology which was initiated by the Co-Ordination Unit and is being provided through University College Cork.  This is a progressive course following on from the earlier ''Dealing with Change, Challenge and Opportunity Mindfully' guidance programme delivered in Tallaght.  Other specialised courses include modules of the Bosch Diagnostic Technician Programme leading to automotive technical accreditation and the provision of individual career development supports through the EGF training grant scheme.  Discussions are ongoing as to whether there is scope for additional tailored course provision, in terms of delivery timescale and content and sufficient beneficiary interest.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to liaise with the EGF Coordination Unit and other partners to maximise engagement with the programme.  The potential involvement of community and voluntary organisations as suggested by the Deputy is being considered for this and future programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500085#WRW03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1078"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Supervision and Substitution Scheme Allowance","counter":1257,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500085#WRW03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1258,"qnumday":509,"qnumall":"[44697\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500085#WRW03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her plans to restore the yard duty payment for teachers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1259,"content":"<p>Under the Haddington Road Agreement (HRA), the supervision and substitution (S&amp;S) allowance was discontinued with effect from the commencement of the 2013\/14 school year.

Copies of the Guidelines have been circulated to all schools.  The Guidelines emphasise the need to integrate all elements by using a coordinated whole-school approach in the promotion of social emotional well-being\/mental health.  This includes developing and integrating the Health Promoting Schools process, the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, and the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support.  The Special Education Support Service (SESS) has a particular remit for provision of training in regards students with special needs.

Much of this learning already takes place in Irish classrooms where a child's sense of their own identity and belonging is nurtured and valued.  It is intended that the new ERB curriculum will ensure that every child has the opportunity for such learning, and that the good practices which already take place in schools are recognised.  The consultation on the proposals for this new curriculum is now open and will continue into spring 2016.  The NCCA will be engaging with a range of audiences, including: teachers, schools, parents, children, educational partners, patrons, children's advocacy groups and other members of the general public.  As part of the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, the NCCA has already been tasked with looking at the suggested time framework for subjects contained within the primary school curriculum and advice on this is due in 2016.

This process was conducted in a robust manner consistent with EU and national Procurement Guidelines, and a panel of preferred suppliers was identified. The benefits of the new arrangements include the reduction o f the bureaucratic and administrative burden for local community groups, who no longer have to get three tenders every six months and, consequently, frees up these groups to spend more time on engaging with their elderly neighbours.     <\/p>  <p>  Following the meeting of the 10 of December 2014 between Minister Kelly and Deputy Ryan, a question arose as to whether this meeting impacted the procurement process or could render the process void. As a result, the tender process was paused by my Department pending clarification of a number of technical issues in this regard, and legal advice was sought on whether the process was impacted. <\/p>  <p>  In clarifying the technical issues, the focus for my Department was on ensuring that the parameters set out in the Pobal tender competition were in compliance with national and EU procurement guidelines and directives. Having considered the matter fully and taken advice, the process was found to be robust and compliant and it was agreed that Pobal would proceed with the tender process and bring it to a conclusion. <\/p>  <p>  As part of this review, it was confirmed that there had been no interference in the tender process or its outcome by any third party. As a result, the tender process was unaltered from the evaluation carried out independently by Pobal, and the original recommendations remained valid. Consequently, there was no need to contact the tender applicants. The pause in the process, however, required a rescheduling of technical development work for the programme schedule within Pobal which pushed back the planned rollout date to September 2015. However there was no significant impact or additional cost as a result of this pause in the schedule as my Department continued to administer the scheme in the interim to ensure continuity in service to support the elderly in their own homes.<\/p>  <p>  As the criteria and scoring under the tender evaluation process were a matter for Pobal, I am not in a position to comment on such matters. However, I understand that the evaluation process was comprehensive and objective, centred around a designated set of procedures and disciplines. The results of the evaluation process were submitted to Pobal senior management, who ultimately decided the matter and signed off on the recommendations therein.<\/p>  <p>  Having fully reviewed this matter, my Department is satisfied that the tender process managed by Pobal was conducted in a robust manner and adhered to EU and national procurement guidelines and directives. Pobal have confirmed that all decisions regarding the procurement process and its outcome were made independently by them in accordance with these guidelines. As a result, the issue of terminating the tender process does not arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500087#WRY05400","answer":true,"speaker":"964"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreshore Issues","counter":1407,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500088#WRZ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1408,"qnumday":570,"qnumall":"[44898\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500088#WRZ00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he has initiated enforcement proceedings under the Foreshore Acts for illegal dumping in a location in County Galway (details supplied) ","asker":"1044","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1409,"content":"<p>My Department has sought legal advice on how best to deal with the foreshore issues arising at the area in question.

","asker":"1022","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1442,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 579 to 585, inclusive, together.  <\/p><p>The statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments 2013 identified 89,872 households assessed by housing authorities as being eligible and in need of some form of social housing support as at 7 May 2013. The 2013 results provide details on the number of qualified households on the waiting lists of each individual authority and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <\/p><p>.<\/p><p>The 2013 figures are the most up-to-date and reliable figures available and are based on a comprehensive review by housing authorities of the households on their waiting lists on a set date in accordance with a prescribed methodology to ensure consistency. This process involved local authorities contacting individual households to confirm their continued requirement and qualification for social housing support. The 2013 figure is of course subject to ongoing fluctuation due to households being allocated housing and new households applying for housing support. <\/p><p>Taking the numbers on a housing list without a full assessment of eligibility and need would be a flawed process as it does not compare like with like. Such figures are based on the numbers of households currently held on file by individual local authorities, which were not subject to the comprehensive review applied under the 2013 summary. For example there may be households included where members of the household have secured employment or whose circumstances may have otherwise changed since 2013 meaning the household is no longer qualified for or in need of social housing. The 2013 figures do not include duplicate entries and those already in local authority, voluntary and co-operative housing or the Rental Accommodation Scheme, and as such, are the most accurate that are available. <\/p><p>By way of illustrating this point, I understand that one local authority wrote to all households held on file as requiring social housing in August of this year, in the context of changes to the social housing allocation procedures locally. In 2013, at the time of the last full assessment, the authority had a waiting list of 6,440 households. In response to a Freedom of Information request this year it reported 8,043 households on file for social housing purposes. As a result of the recent correspondence and based on the responses received the local authority identified 5,790 qualified households on its waiting list at the end of October with a further 528 on transfer lists. The local authority in question accepts that some households may yet still respond and is open to that eventuality. This example illustrates the risk of taking the waiting list as being the number of households on file at a point in time without the requisite check for ongoing eligibility and need. <\/p><p>I recognise that we need up to date and comprehensive data on housing need on an on-going basis but this data needs to be robust and must be gathered based on a sound methodology. In order to ensure we have that data, the Social Housing Strategy 2020 includes a commitment to undertake a statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments on an annual basis from 2016 onwards. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500088#WRZ02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fire Safety","counter":1443,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500088#WRZ02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1444,"qnumday":586,"qnumall":"[45162\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500088#WRZ02800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"what the Dublin Docklands Development Authority is doing, as owner of the Longboat Quay common areas, to ensure that the cost for the Longboat Quay fire safety works are urgently addressed, so works can commence on fire safety ","asker":"1022","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1445,"content":"<p>The matters raised by the Deputy are currently before the Courts and, as a consequence, are sub judice.

In a BID, a group of businesses are empowered, where a majority of those businesses agree, to raise a special levy payable by all the businesses in the defined area to pay for complementary local services and improvements, within that defined area.   <\/p>  <p>  The Act sets out a framework for comprehensive consultation with the public and business community in an area. In the first instance, a BID proposal submitted to a local authority must be made available for public inspection under section 129D. Following publication of a BID proposal, the local authority must, by way of public notice, invite submissions from the public on the proposal. If following consideration of the submissions received, the local authority is of the opinion that the BID proposal may be inconsistent with the interests of the local community, it must notify the BID proponents of the nature of the inconsistency. <\/p>  <p>  Section 129G provides for the holding of a plebiscite, organised by the local authority, to determine the level of support among ratepayers in an area. In the BID plebiscite, each rateable business has one vote.

The State is not a service provider and can only intervene, subject to EU competition rules, to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services.<\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which was delivered by Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;), is an example of such an intervention. The Scheme operated from December 2008 to August 2014, and ensured the availability of a basic and affordable retail broadband service to some 238,000 fixed residences and businesses located in 1,028 Electoral Divisions across 25 Counties. Combined with private investment, it allowed Ireland to meet the EU Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;Digital Agenda for Europe&rdquo; target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service.

Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.

Today, cable is delivering speeds of up to 240 Mbps to over 700,000 addresses and eFibre services of up to 100 Mbps are available to circa 1.2m addresses. <\/p><p>Legislation enacted in 2014 has enabled the use of ESB&rsquo;s national distribution system to deliver fibre services. This has resulted in SIRO entering the market, adding increased competition for ultra-fast services. Two companies are now investing in fibre-to-the-home services.

A well balanced fuel mix that provides reliable energy, minimises costs and protects against supply disruptions and price volatility, is essential to Irish consumers as we make this transition. To achieve this, it is vital that our natural energy resources continue to be developed. By 2050, greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector will be reduced by between 80% and 95%, compared to 1990 levels in line with the EU objective. Fossil fuels will remain a progressively decreasing part of the energy mix as we transition to a largely decarbonised energy system by 2050, and significant progress is already being made in increasing the share of renewables in that mix.<\/p>  <p>  Our immediate focus is on the period to 2020. In addition to the EU's 2020 targets for emissions reductions, the 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter transport target also being legally binding. Figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland show that, in 2014, 8.6% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirements were met from renewable sources. More specifically, the SEAI has calculated that 22.7% of electricity, 6.6% of heat and 5.2% of transport energy requirements were from renewable sources. Biofuels represented 1.9% of gross electricity consumption in the same year. This means we were just over halfway towards each of the separate targets for contributions of renewable energy in electricity, heat and transport. The SEAI has estimated that this avoided &euro;346 million of fossil fuel imports.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is ambitious to make a cost-effective and fair contribution to the EU's overall 2030 ambition, which seeks to have at least 27% of energy demand met from renewable sources by 2030. To this end, Government policy will continue to be supportive of the increasing deployment of renewable energy. In addition, to the extent that non-renewable sources will remain an ever decreasing part of the energy mix, Government policy will also seek to reduce import dependency by supporting the identification and harnessing of indigenous supplies. Corrib gas coming on stream will make a significant impact on reducing energy imports, meeting 40% of all-island demand in its first years of production.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500090#WRBB01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":1518,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500090#WRBB01250"},{"type":"question","counter":1519,"qnumday":614,"qnumall":"[45367\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015121500090#WRBB01300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he has examined the extent of broadband deficiency in terms of availability, quality and speed in rural and in urban areas; if the ongoing investment programme will address these issues; if he has identified specific deadlines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Ireland aims to meet this target mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.<\/p>  <p>   The Biofuels Obligation Scheme was introduced in July 2010 as the primary means through which Ireland would meet the transport target and is the principal support for the uptake of biofuels in Ireland. The scheme, administered by the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA), is certificate based and, since January 2013, an obligated road transport fuel supplier, at the end of each calendar year, must hold six biofuel obligation certificates for every 94 litres (6.383%) of petroleum based fuel it has placed on the road transport market. Two certificates are awarded for each litre of biofuel produced from wastes, residues, non-food cellulosic material, and ligno-cellulosic material placed on the market with one certificate awarded per litre of other biofuels. Certificates are only issued for biofuels that have been demonstrated to have complied with the sustainability criteria of the Renewable Energy Directive.<\/p>  <p>  The 2014 Biofuels Obligation Scheme Annual Report, which can be downloaded from www.nora.ie, reported that almost 167 million litres of biofuel was placed on the road transport fuel market. Over 114 million litres was biodiesel (69%), of which 98 million litres of which was produced from wastes and residues, with approximately 25 million litres produced in Ireland. The remaining biodiesel was produced from oil crops, such as rape seed, palm and soy, all of which were imported. All bioethanol was imported and was from crop based feedstocks.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission recently adopted a Directive which limits to 7% the amount of energy that Member States can count towards their 2020 renewable energy targets in transport from certain crop based biofuels, whose use could lead to Indirect Land-Use Change (ILUC).
