In the Cork County Council area, the top ten companies were paying &euro;27 million in commercial rates, while in Dublin the figure was &euro;67 million.  A lot of money is being paid to local authorities by way of commercial rates.  In the Galway City Council area, the total was &euro;4 million, in the Limerick City and County Council area, the total was &euro;12 million.<\/p> <p>My Commencement matter is concerned with whether we are getting value for money from our local authorities.

Has the Department, in the last ten or 15 years, carried out an assessment of the amount of money it is costing to run individual local authorities, the number of staff employed, the services being provided and the value for money being obtained?  If not, is it not time to conduct such a review to determine how we can make our local authorities more efficient and improve the services provided by them?  This is particularly important now, given the huge demands in terms of providing housing.  There is a need to ensure that once local authority houses become vacant, they are turned around in a timely manner.  That was a source of many complaints in the recent past.  We must also ensure that the maintenance of local authority housing is efficient and cost effective.  Other areas of responsibility include roads, drainage and many other services and it is about time we had a review to see how we can help our local authorities.  It is important that support is provided to them by central government.

Rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces, all essential elements to create the environment in which businesses can prosper.  The local government audit service provides independent scrutiny of the financial stewardship of local authorities.  The local government audit service carries out audits of local authorities and other bodies in accordance with its code of practice, thereby fostering the highest standards of financial stewardship, governance and public accountability.  The audit service also promotes the achievement of value for money in local authorities by undertaking value for money studies and publishing reports thereon.  The value for money unit of the local government audit service has carried out a number of studies over the years into the value for money of various local authority activities.<\/p><p>The national oversight and audit commission, NOAC, was established in July 2014 under the Local Government Reform Act to provide independent oversight of the local government sector.  Its functions are wide-ranging, involving the scrutiny of performance generally, and financial performance specifically, supporting best practice, overseeing implementation of national local government policy, monitoring and evaluating implementation of corporate plans, adherence to service level agreements and public service reform by local government bodies.  The NOAC reports, published in 2016, include the local authority performance indicators and public spending code quality assurance reports for 2015, the rates collection report, the financial performance of local authorities 2013-2015 and a review of local authority performance of the functions under the private rented houses regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#A00500","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The information about the publication of the report is interesting but there has been no public debate on it and maybe it is time we had one.

Much outrage has been expressed about the slaughter in Syria and Iraq but very little about the daily bombing in Yemen where thousands have perished since Saudi Arabia and its allies began an air campaign a year and a half ago.  Nor has there been much public criticism of American aid to the campaign.<\/p> <p>Yemen was plunged into civil war in 2014 when Houthi rebel ousted the Saudi backed dictator Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi.  Saudi leaders commenced a military drive to defeat the rebels and reinstal Hadi as President.  The Saudi bombing campaign began in March 2015 and Saudi Arabia has intentionally targeted numerous homes, factories, markets, schools and hospitals.  The methods used by Saudi Arabia very likely constitute war crimes against the civilian Yemeni population, blowing up funerals, prisons and hospitals, slaughtering men, women and children.  Amnesty International has called on the US to halt the shipping of weapons that are being used in the Yemen war, citing data that a confirmed US-made explosive was used in an attack on a Yemeni hospital on 15 August.  The medical facility, Abs hospital, run by M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res was hit by a strike that left 11 people dead and 19 others injured.  I know the Minister will agree that any attack on a medical facility in a war zone is an affront to humanity.  Fragments from US-made MK82 guided bombs have also been found at a site of a Saudi bombing of a community hall, where 140 people were killed and over 500 injured.  The ITV news correspondent, Neil Connery, has verified this and there are other examples I can cite if required.<\/p> <p>The world knows the key role the US is playing in this war.  Indeed, the US has supplied Saudi Arabia with more that &euro;20 billion worth of weapons during its Yemen campaign.  We also know the US has flown missions for Saudi aircraft and supplied Saudi Arabia with weapons and targeted intelligence and is, therefore, complicit in Saudi Arabia's atrocities by any normal definition.  Is the Government of which the Minister is part also complicit?  Despite numerous requests the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will not provide any information about the US military planes that use Shannon.  Shannonwatch has been keeping its own watch for many years and its figures show a significant increase in the numbers that passed through in September.  We know that the US military is the main supplier of mid-air refuelling planes for the Saudis with regard to this war and we know that an increased number of mid-air refuellers have passed through Shannon this summer.  A large number of contracted US troop carriers and cargo planes have passed through Shannon, which have been granted permits to take weapons through the airport by the Minister's Department.  Omni Air International has been a regular carrier and we know from flight records that one destination for recent flights in September was Al-Udeid air base in Qatar.  This is the main headquarters for the Qatari airforce that, along with Saudi Arabia, has been bombing and killing innocent Yemeni civilians.  It also serves as a logistics command and hub for US operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria and now Yemen - civilian life has disintegrated in those places yet the Government and the Department pretend it is nothing to do with us.<\/p> <p>Let us join the dots on this.  We know that Saudi Arabia is guilty of heinous war crimes and that the US military has supplied the weaponry for these war crimes.  We know that the US military use Shannon as, in the words of Tom Clonan, a \"forward base\" in the prosecution of all these wars.  We know from flight records that military flights from Shannon have gone to a key military airport engaged in the Yemen conflict.  Is our Government, by extension, guilty of war crimes?  I believe this is the case.  There was a commitment in the last programme for Government to enforce a prohibition on the use of Irish airspace, airports and related facilities for purposes not in line with international law.  Why is it not enforcing it?  How can the Government be certain that US planes travelling from Shannon are not being used to aid Saudi Arabia without searching the planes?  What does the Minister have to say about the US role in the slaughter of Yemeni citizens?  Is the Government really going to turn a blind eye again? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#B00500","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, sends his apologies as he cannot be here today.  On 6 July this year, when the Senator raised the issue of the US military aircraft landing at Shannon Airport, the Minister informed this House that the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952 gives the Minister for Foreign Affairs primary responsibility for the regulation of activity by foreign military aircraft in Ireland.  Permission must be sought in advance for landings by all foreign military aircraft, including those from the US.  If granted, permission is subject to strict conditions.  Aircraft must be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and must not engage in intelligence gathering.  Furthermore, the flights in question must not form part of military exercises or operations.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is satisfied that the US is aware of the need to comply with the strict conditions which attach to permission for military aircraft to land at Irish airports.<\/p><p>In July, when Senator Gavan raised the issue of US military aircraft landings at Shannon, he speculated that they were involved in supporting NATO military exercises in the Baltic.  The US has confirmed this was not the case and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, informed the D&aacute;il accordingly.  On this occasion, Senator Gavan is suggesting that US military aircraft that landed at Shannon were transporting munitions to Saudi Arabia and that they were involved in mid-air refuelling of Saudi Arabian aircraft.  I can inform the Senator that so far in 2016, six US military aircraft have sought permission to land in Shannon with Saudi Arabia as either their origin or destination.  In each case, the request stated that the aircraft was unarmed and that it did not carry arms, ammunition or explosives.  None of those six aircraft was capable of delivering mid-air refuelling.  In each case, the purpose of the stop in Shannon was refuelling and the transport of VIP passengers.<\/p><p>I am grateful to the Senator for providing me with an opportunity to also outline the Government&rsquo;s response to the ongoing conflict in Yemen and our continuing work in the area of arms control.  Last Sunday, during his visit to Saudi Arabia, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, raised the situation in Yemen, including Ireland's concern at the civilian casualties, with the Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs.  Ireland has also been active in raising this matter in international fora, including at the United Nations General Assembly where in our statement at the First Committee on Disarmament and International Security we highlighted our grave concerns with regard to indiscriminate explosive weapons use in current conflicts, with particular reference to the use of cluster munitions use in Yemen.<\/p><p>The current situation in Yemen is extremely worrying.  The Government urges all parties to the conflict to respect international law and to return to the political negotiating table.  The only solution to this conflict, and as such the only way to ease the suffering of the Yemeni people, is through political means.  The longer the fighting continues, the worse the impact on the Yemeni people.  Air strikes on civilian targets have been a worrying feature of this conflict.  I was particularly concerned to hear of the recent attack on the funeral in Sana&rsquo;a.  Such attacks are unacceptable and I welcome reports that there will be an investigation into this attack.<\/p><p>For many decades, Ireland has been a leading voice for disarmament, non-proliferation, arms control and respect for international humanitarian law.  The agreement of the Convention on Cluster Munitions in Dublin in May 2008 led to the creation of a new regime outlawing these weapons.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade remains active in its efforts to get all states which have not yet joined the convention to do so, including the United States and Saudi Arabia.  In 2013, the international community agreed the arms trade treaty which prohibits the exportation of arms to countries if the exporting country knows that those weapons will be used in acts of genocide, crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva conventions or other war crimes.  Ireland was among the first states to sign and ratify that treaty and remains active in efforts to ensure universal adherence to the norms that it creates.<\/p><p>At the UN General Assembly&rsquo;s Committee on Disarmament and International Security, which took place in New York last month, Ireland highlighted the urgency of exploring how to raise consciousness and strengthen the application of international humanitarian law in relation to preventing civilian harm from the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas.<\/p><p>I hope this reply clarifies the matter for the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#B00600","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

I am aware that Inland Fisheries Ireland is against my proposition.  I would like to make the case as to why this should not be its call and to ask the Minister of State to accede to my request.  I come from Ballina, County Mayo.  Long before the word \"tourism\" first came into use, angling and salmon fishing have been the heartbeat of tourism in Ballina, Foxford, Swinford and out towards the estuary at Killala Bay.  As things stand, we have the best and most prolific salmon fishing river in the River Moy, where it is estimated that there are between 15,000 and 20,000 fish surplus to conservation requirements in terms of the preservation of salmon stocks.  The areas I have just mentioned are visited annually by international anglers.  Outside of the Arts Festival in Galway, the annual Ballina salmon festival is the biggest festival in the west.  We also have a food festival and a river festival in Foxford.  So much revolves around the River Moy and salmon.  A national salmon life interpretative centre is being developed in Ballina, into which a significant amount of taxpayers' money and a contribution from IFI have been already invested.  Without a doubt, salmon is king in my area.  <\/p> <p>Unfortunately, however, there is no wild salmon on the menus of any of the restaurants or hotels in Ballina or Foxford.  We get a lot of visitors to this region, the draw being the setting, the river and salmon.  At a recently held food festival local chefs from Ballina, in order to be able to serve wild salmon dishes, had to obtain salmon donations from IFI.  Under current legislation, it is not possible to buy a salmon from anglers and although anglers are allowed to catch fish up to certain limits within season, they cannot sell that fish.  There is no commercial wild salmon available to buy.  <\/p> <p>In 2006 an independent salmon group was convened, the report of which I have with me today.  The current situation arises out of the standing scientific committee recommendation that steps be taken in relation to commercial salmon fishing to preserve and conserve salmon stocks.  Arising out of that drift nets were banned.  Some &euro;25 million of taxpayers' money was paid out to ensure the cessation of commercial salmon fishing.  I refer the Minister of State to the 2006 report which sets out what was to happen in regard to any surplus.  It envisions that a model for the allocation of the surplus would be put in place.  This has not been done to date.  This is predicated on the assumption that allocation of the surplus is in the public interest as it is paid for with taxpayers' money.  The current surplus is beyond what is required to conserve salmon stocks.  The report recognises the cases of groups such as processors, restaurateurs, retailers and those who have traditionally accessed wild salmon from the commercial sector for a continued source of supply.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Michelle Mulherin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It accommodates the interests of tourism, given the potential of international angling.  The report calls for a model to be devised.<\/p><p>There are various stakeholders and interests involved, including processors, restaurateurs and retailers, but I am approaching the issue from the point of view of the tourism sector.  Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, has invested significantly in traps, equipment and state-of-the-art technology on the weirs in Ballina.  That equipment is well able to trap salmon.  A certain number of salmon could be sold to designated restaurants and hotels, but not wholesale.  The Moy catchment area would be seen as a pilot project.  There would be implications for other salmon fishing rivers around the country, but given the fact that the River Moy is the most prolific in that regard, it would be a major boost to our tourism industry.  I call on the Minister of State to examine the reason behind the initial banning of commercial fishing and determine a way to ensure that the new surplus is distributed fairly and for the common good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#C01600","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for submitting this Commencement Matter for discussion.  I acknowledge the important role that fishing and angling play in Ballina's tourism.  IFI is the State agency responsible for the protection, management and conservation of Ireland's inland fisheries and sea angling resources.  It manages salmon stocks on an individual river basis, as each of Ireland's salmon rivers has its own genetically unique stock of salmon.  IFI is supported in its management role by a statutorily independent standing scientific committee, SSC, for salmon comprising scientists from IFI, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Loughs Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute of Northern Ireland and other State bodies and third level institutions.<\/p> <p>The SSC estimates the number of salmon likely to return to each river in the next fishing season based on estimates of salmon runs over the most recent five years.  Each river has an individual conservation limit, which is essentially the number of salmon required to spawn to maintain a healthy population.  If the estimate of returning salmon is above this limit, salmon from that individually genetic river population may be harvested commercially or by rod and line.  The SSC's independent advice to lFl underpins the management decisions and advice of IFI as regards all aspects of the angling and commercial season for salmon on an individual river basis.<\/p> <p>In 2006, the Government affirmed its commitment to manage the wild salmon fishery in line with the scientific advice from 2007 onwards in the interests of conservation of stocks.  International best practice for the management of Atlantic salmon requires the adoption of the precautionary approach and the cessation of indiscriminate mixed stock fisheries.  Since 2007, the harvest of salmon by commercial and recreational, that is, angling, means has been restricted to those stocks of rivers that are meeting their conservation limits.<\/p> <p>Fisheries are only considered in rivers where the estimated returns are above the conservation limit for the river.  I am advised by IFI that a risk analysis is undertaken on any estimate of returns expected to be above the conservation limit.  The individual river management strategy is based on the fact that each of Ireland's salmon rivers has its own unique stock of salmon that migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn and create the next generation of fish exclusive to that river.  Fisheries are only considered in rivers where the estimated returns are above the conservation limit for each river.  In that regard, it is not biologically or environmentally sustainable to redistribute genetically distinct surplus stocks outside their native rivers due to the conservation imperative to avoid an impact on or a dilution of existing stocks that are above their conservation limits.<\/p> <p>Stocks within individual rivers that have a surplus are distributed among the established stakeholders.  For rivers on which there is both angling and commercial fisheries, the surplus is distributed via a district committee on which anglers and commercial fishermen are represented.  This distribution only happens where there is a harvestable surplus.<\/p> <p>The model and processes used by the SSC are recognised internationally as best practice.  Delegations from a number of countries have visited IFI and the SSC to examine and seek to learn from the Irish approach to salmon management.  The North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation also recognises Ireland as a leader in this area.<\/p> <p>Wild salmon is a valuable natural resource and the value of rod-caught fish to local and rural communities is substantial in terms of the benefit to the local economy from income associated with anglers staying in the locality, making purchases from tackle shops, dining in restaurants and visiting local public houses.  The high value of tourism angling, highlighted by IFI and Bord F&aacute;ilte, is based primarily on participation in the activity by visiting anglers and the excellence of the local angling resource.  This activity-based value was borne out in the most comprehensive study of recreational angling in Ireland ever undertaken, which was commissioned by lFl.  There is no evidence to suggest that the availability of wild salmon on local menus augments the attractiveness of a local area to potential angler visitors.<\/p> <p>At a time when salmon stocks generally have declined, the River Moy has a surplus available for harvest by rod and line.  No commercial fisheries exist on the river.  The Moy and the hinterland it serves are the envy of many communities whose rivers have no harvestable surplus and where no salmon can be retained by anglers or no fishing is permitted.  There are still a number of commercial salmon fisheries in Ireland, including in Mayo.  These are primarily draft net and snap nets, and each of these legal fisheries provides sustainably harvested wild salmon available for purchase by restaurants and hotels.<\/p> <p>All rod-caught fish are blue tagged so that anglers can retain the fish, but the sale of rod-caught salmon is expressly prohibited by law for good reason.  Salmon are an important wild fish resource.  In this regard, anglers are permitted to retain up to ten salmon personally in a year and pay a fee of up to &euro;100 for the licence and tags.  These fish cannot be sold on the basis that incentivising the sale of rod-caught salmon creates a commercial rod fishery that would be counterproductive to the long-standing conservation imperative supported by all anglers who are involved in the activity for sport and leisure reasons.  Facilitating sale of rod-caught salmon from a specific river could augment the potential for an increase in illegal salmon fishing, putting pressure on rivers that do not have a surplus.<\/p> <p>The State's efforts are concentrated on seeking to recover the stocks.  A return to increasing sales of wild salmon, other than those from fisheries scientifically assessed as commercially sustainable, would unravel much of the State's investment of &euro;30 million in the salmon hardship scheme, which is aimed at conservation of stocks.<\/p> <p>The rod catch on the River Moy has declined in recent years.  In 2016, it was 5,775 salmon compared with 7,075 in 2015.  Having regard to the negative trend generally in the returns of wild salmon to Irish rivers, a precautionary approach is required and, as such, it would be unwise and irresponsible to introduce any measure or derogation that could lead to a significant increase in angler exploitation of the wild salmon resource.<\/p> <p>Salmon angling as an activity is a valuable tourism resource.  Any proposal to transform the activity into a commercial fishing venture and encourage anglers to catch their \"quota\" is not ecologically sound.  Wild Atlantic salmon is listed as endangered and is generally protected by responsible anglers as well as fishery protection staff.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for the sector, I am anxious to ensure that salmon are protected in all rivers and that no measures are put in place that would have a deleterious effect on the salmon stocks in any river, including the Moy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#D00200","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I have given this issue fresh impetus because Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, appeared before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and informed us of the science involved.

The child's right to play is enshrined in Article 31 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which recognises the right of the child to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life and the arts.  Better Outcomes Brighter Futures, the national policy framework for children and young people, 2014-2020, recognises play and recreation as one of the ways in which the aim that all children will be active and healthy, with physical and mental well-being, will be achieved.<\/p> <p>The provision of public play and recreation facilities is primarily the responsibility of local authorities.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs also has a role in this important area.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, is committed to ensuring that children's right to play is promoted and protected.  Since 2013 the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has administered the capital grant scheme for play and recreation.  The scheme provides for new and innovative projects which can include new facilities, equipment, designs.  The utilisation of non-traditional play spaces, or the refurbishment or upgrading of existing play and recreation spaces and facilities, is also provided for and encouraged.  The total amount of funding available under the scheme each year since 2013 is &euro;250,000, with a maximum grant of &euro;20,000 to any local authority.<\/p> <p>Funding criteria for the scheme were developed in conjunction with the local area play and recreation network.  Established in 2012, the network is made up of staff with responsibility for play and recreation in their local authority area.  The purpose of the network was to introduce a more co-ordinated and interagency approach to achieving the main goals of the play and recreation policies, at both national and local level.<\/p> <p>Senator Martin Conway asked if the provision of financial support is conditional on the playground being universally designed to allow children with various disabilities access the equipment.  The Minister has confirmed that one of the key criteria for funding under the capital grant scheme is that all facilities and equipment funded must be accessible to children and young people with special needs.<\/p> <p>Other criteria applied to applications include play and recreation spaces and facilities must be available for use by all children and young people in the locality at times when they are free to use them, namely outside of school hours; all facilities and equipment must be youth-friendly and safe; children and young people must be consulted about the project for which funding is requested; and confirmation that a \"No Smoking\" sign is prominently displayed in the facility for which funding is awarded must be provided.  A further requirement of the scheme is that the local authority in which the playground is situated must provide matched funding for the project.  This can be in the form of land, equipment, staff or additional funding.<\/p> <p>The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has recently commissioned a review of the public provision of play and recreation facilities.  The findings from this research will inform the next steps in developing play and recreation policy.  Future developments in this policy area will involve all key stakeholders, including children and young people, in the deciding the future direction to be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#E01300","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":54,"content":"<p>That is a comprehensive reply.

She further stated that these pregnant women are more likely to be assaulted in their abdomen than in their face.  Furthermore, it is estimated that one in eight pregnant women is the victim of domestic violence.  Dr. Mahony said that domestic violence affects all parts of our society.  Shame and stigma are still felt by the victims.  The victims are not the ones who should be suffering from shame and anxiety.  The man or woman who is the abuser is the person who ought to be ashamed of himself or herself.<\/p> <p>I do not believe enough is being done to raise awareness of domestic violence, and that nobody, male or female, should be abused or assaulted in his or her own home.  In a further worrying report, it appears that battered women are being turned away from shelters outside the area where they normally live.  It is totally unacceptable that women who have been assaulted in their own homes are then subsequently turned away from shelters that are supposed to be there to help and support these vulnerable women.  It has been reported today that the Victims' Rights Alliance believes that Ireland is contravening an EU directive that was supposed to have been transposed into Irish law but which to date has not been.  A representative from the Victims' Rights Alliance has reported that it is aware of circumstances where women are being turned away from shelters because they do not reside in the catchment area.  It is nothing short of appalling that women who are courageous enough to walk out of their homes and brave enough to take that leap away from their abusers should find that the door is then shut in their faces at the place they seek refuge.  Where do the shelters expect those battered and abused women to go to when they turn them away from their doors.  We know the women are likely to end up back in the home of the abuser.  It is like something one would see in a Third World country.  The Government must act urgently on this information and show that it stands with victims of these crimes.

Research was published last week that shows one in six pregnant women is at risk of mental ill health and depression.  The subject of domestic abuse against pregnant women was included in the research, but it did not go in to detail, and the rage that is displayed against them and their unborn child.  I welcome the research.  It is a very worthwhile discussion.  We need to keep it in the headlines.<\/p> <p>I also wish to raise a good news story with regard to mental health.  Yesterday the Housing Agency and the HSE launched a book containing housing design guidelines for providing accommodation for those who live with persistent mental health conditions.  At a time when we seem to be trying to break down walls brick by brick to try to secure more funding for mental health services, especially in the area of 24-7 crisis intervention, this story is uplifting.  I wholeheartedly commend the staff of the HSE and the Housing Agency who were involved inputting together this 121 page booklet which took four years of work.  I believe it is the first of its kind in the world.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What is most pleasing is that the majority of measures outlined in this booklet are not costly.  The authors provide simple solutions for those with severe cognitive impairment and memory loss which will make their lives simpler and enable them to live independently.  The booklet is particularly welcome in the context of the planned large-scale building of social housing which I hope will begin without delay.  A point to note is that the booklet only relates to houses.  The guidelines therein should be adapted for use in hospitals, primary care centres, mental health residential care centres, GP surgeries, schools, colleges and so forth.  I hope this is the start of a process of changing our way of thinking about this issue.  <\/p><p>I cannot conclude without mentioning the urgent need for the full implementation of A Vision for Change and the most pressing need for the provision of 24\/7 crisis intervention services.

I also commend the Safe Ireland summit, a very strong gathering of people who refocused the view of domestic violence as being a women's problem to being a societal problem.  The summit demonstrated that domestic violence is a problem for society as a whole and that it will take an all-of-society approach to tackle it.<\/p> <p>I concur with Senator Ardagh's points on that issue and ask the Leader to schedule a debate on the matter with particular reference to the Istanbul Convention, the Council of Europe convention on preventing and combatting violence against women and domestic violence, its ratification and the provisions and measures to be put in place under the terms of the convention.  I also understand that new domestic violence legislation is in play and it would be useful for this House to have a real and high profile debate on the issue during which we can discuss our concerns more deeply.<\/p> <p>We have had some debate on the recent election in the United States of America which I am not going to reprise now.  However, there are some issues which we may need to tease out, particularly with regard to those who did not vote.  There has been considerable focus on those who voted in different ways in the election but a vast number of people, well over 40% of the electorate, did not vote.  That is where we see disaffection and people pulling away from the political system.  This is a concern for all of us in Europe as well.  We should debate the wider question of encouraging political engagement and rebuilding connections with those who feel that they have no candidate for whom to vote.  <\/p> <p>That said, I want to speak more to policies, which is our focus in this House.  I have deep concerns about racism.  We have seen both misogyny and racism growing across America.  We have seen a rise in racist attacks since the election, much as we saw in the UK following the Brexit referendum.  There is an issue when the political class sends out signals that allow for racial hatred to gain traction.  We have seen the appointment of somebody who has been recognised as a white supremacist, namely, the chief strategist who has been appointed to the President-elect's incoming cabinet.  This is an individual who has a strong record in white nationalism and whose appointment has been described by the Ku Klux Klan as \"amazing\".  Indeed, the Ku Klux Klan is planning to hold an open and celebratory parade to mark the outcome of the election.<\/p> <p>These are issues of concern for us.  In Ireland, nationalism and racism have occasionally reared their heads.  However, I am pleased to say that thanks to the wisdom of the Irish people, they have not gained traction here.  Deep racism has not gained traction in any of the political parties in this country.  We have seen it emerging again this week in yet another attempt to gain political credibility for positions of hatred.  The wisdom of the Irish people has ensured that such views have not gained traction but as parliamentarians we have a role to play in sending out very strong signals of inclusion, equality and anti-racism.  <\/p> <p>Climate change is another area of huge concern.  The President-elect has appointed individuals who do not believe in climate change to US environmental agencies.  One year on from the Paris Agreement, which the world signed together, the nations of the world have gathered again to debate climate change.  There have been very strong signals from China, India and others to the new Administration in the United States of America that there can be no roll back on climate change commitments.  <\/p> <p>I will conclude with a question to the Leader.  I ask him to ensure that the Irish Government also sends a very strong signal that the US election result will not be used as an excuse to allow things to slide but will be taken as a mandate to strengthen our commitments on climate change.  I know that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport will be in the House later to discuss transport related issues but I ask the Leader to invite him to come back to the House at a future date to specifically address the question of sustainable transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#H00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome yesterday's belated visit by Ms Arlene Foster to Government Buildings.  It is very important that engagement takes place between our Government and the Northern Ireland Executive on how to deal with Brexit.  I also welcome the setting up of the all-Ireland forum on the issue, which has already met for its first session.  However, I am very disappointed that local government in this country has been excluded from the forum.  Neither the Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, or the Northern Ireland Local Government Association, NILGA, were invited to take part in the forum.  I mean no disrespect to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, but surely representatives of local government across the island of Ireland are more entitled to be at the forum than the ISPCA, which was given speaking time at the first session.<\/p> <p>I remember the dark days of the Troubles when councillors like myself went North and met DUP, UUP and Sinn F&eacute;in councillors.  We brought them to County Clare to a conference on tourism in an attempt to break down barriers.  We socialised with our Northern Ireland counterparts and realised that we had much in common.  Out of that flowed the peace process in which we played a role.  Now that Ireland is in trouble again, a decision has been taken to exclude councillors from the next challenge facing the island.  The aforementioned cross-Border interaction between councillors led to many cross-Border initiatives, INTERREG initiatives and many successful Border projects.  In that context, I ask the Leader to ask the Taoiseach to include local government representatives in the next round of discussions of the forum.  <\/p> <p>I wish to raise another issue which is directly related to Brexit and which was raised at a meeting I chaired recently on the economic effects of Brexit on the agrifood industry.  Many exporting small and medium enterprises, SMEs, do not understand currency fluctuations or hedging funds and are losing trade because of their lack of knowledge.  In that context I support the call by the Irish Exporters Association for training for SMEs in this area.  Training courses should be rolled out across the country by the IDA, Enterprise Ireland or a similar body so that SMEs can understand the issues and maximise trade.<\/p> <p>Finally, I welcome the bid by the IRFU to host the Rugby World Cup.  However, as a Tipperary man I am puzzled that the second biggest stadium in the country which holds 50,000 people and whose hinterland can cater for 30,000 has been excluded from the list of 12 stadia.  I do not want to mention any other county but the stadium in the nearest county to mine can only hold 22,000.  That stadium cannot even host a Leinster final but it has been included in the IRFU's bid.  The bid is being driven by Mr. Brian O'Driscoll and my former Labour Party colleague, Mr. Dick Spring, and I ask them to reassess the list of stadia and to include the stadium in Thurles on a longer list.  I hope the exclusion of Semple Stadium is by accident rather than design.  I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the IRFU on my behalf.  Perhaps Senator Neale Richmond could also use his influence in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#H00300","speaker":"1387"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the issue of a new library for Mary Immaculate College in Limerick.

In 2012, in the depths of the recession, one quarter of all organisations in the State, ranging from charities and sports clubs to businesses, reported suffering a cyber-attack.  At that time, 31 garda&iacute; were working in the area of cybercrime.  A recent survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that 44% of organisations in Ireland had been the victims of cyber-attacks in the past two years.  Garda numbers decreased by 10% in the same period.  Of those affected, one in five lost between &euro;92,000 and &euro;4.6 million.

When I queried the reason for this failure, I was informed the Garda does not have sufficient resources to deal with this ongoing problem.  <\/p> <p>The Taoiseach speaks about having a smart economy for smart people and I agree that this is the direction we should take.

The purported purpose of the Digital Hub is to support the growth and inclusion of indigenous enterprises.  Russia Today has been sanctioned not less than 15 times by Ofcom for breaches of impartiality and pursuing a political agenda.

Today, we see a report indicating that Irish Rail is facing insolvency and rural routes may be cut if Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann does not receive an additional &euro;103 million per annum over the next five years.  This additional funding would only allow the company to remain solvent and the figure does not take account of the investment needed to address the neglect and failure of successive Governments in respect of our rail links.<\/p> <p>I remember sitting in an economics lecture some years ago when we discussed European investment in various infrastructure projects and examples were cited of such investment in rural and urban areas.  In the case of Dublin, the example given was the port tunnel, whereas the example for rural areas was the Youthreach programme in Kiltimagh, County Mayo.  I am not minimising the great work done by the Youthreach programme but reminding Senators of the inequality in investment in the west and rural areas as opposed to urban areas, particularly Dublin. <\/p> <p>The excuse used to close railway lines outside Dublin will be that they are underused.  How can we expect to increase passenger numbers when the rail links are not tailored to meet the needs of local populations, including the need to ensure connectivity between bus and train timetables?  A fully integrated transport system would result in a significant increase in the numbers using public transport overnight.<\/p> <p>The report also suggests that the Ennis to Athenry line, which was opened in 2010, could be a target for closure.  This section of the western rail corridor carried 102,000 passengers in 2015, more than double the number carried in 2014 and far in excess of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's forecast in the original business case for reopening the Galway to Limerick passenger train service.<\/p> <p>The programme for Government provides for an independent costing and review of phase 2 of the western rail corridor between Athenry and Claremorris for passenger and freight use, and explicitly states that no measures will be taken to prevent the future reactivation of the corridor for rail use, as set out in the McCann report.  The millions of euro spent on advertising the Wild Atlantic Way must be backed up by substantial investment in infrastructure, including rail links.<\/p> <p>I look forward to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport coming to the House to discuss how he intends to fulfil the commitments made in the programme for Government and support infrastructure, including rail infrastructure, in rural areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#J00700","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I am pleased to note that Fitzgerald Stadium in Killarney has been listed as one of the IRFU's proposed stadiums in its 2023 Rugby World Cup bid.

Over six months ago Fine Gael made an election commitment to increase mental health funding to &euro;175 million, to build on A Vision for Change by resourcing adult and child mental health services in the community and to ensure greater access to counselling and psychological services, thereby reducing waiting lists for child and adult mental health services.  I am somewhat disappointed that in County Westmeath only two of five posts of clinical psychologist in child and adult mental health services have been filled.  While I do not know if it is true, I believe the funding to fill the remaining three posts has been withdrawn.  Waiting times for children with serious conditions such as eating disorders and depression in some cases are over 12 months.  As a parent and mindful of the ever-present worry of teenage suicide and the bullying that takes place on Facebook etc., a waiting time of more than four weeks, let alone 12 months, is not acceptable for someone with a serious and escalating condition.  The young adult mental health services in County Westmeath which cater for young people in the critical 16 to 18 years age range have no clinical psychologist.  I appreciate that we have a Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services who does a very god job and ask the Leader to invite her to come to the House to outline her plans for child and adult mental health services, with a particular emphasis, obviously, on County Westmeath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#K01000","speaker":"1375"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I am excited about the IRFU's proposal, into which I will not go, other than to agree with previous speakers.

The former Ministers Ms Mary Harney and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin initiated a number of statutory inquiries but they all came to nothing.  The newspapers yesterday contained a story about mother and baby vaccine trials, with files in Bessborough allegedly being altered in the 1960s.  These are very serious allegations.  I have been deeply involved in a campaign based on my personal experiences over many years.  The Laffoy commission investigated elements of three samples of the alleged drug trials and substantial documentation was secured on court proceedings.  This is a really important case, not only for the Bessborough home in Munster, one of the trial areas looked at by the former Minister Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  The matter needs to be reopened.  I intend to use Private Members' time to raise a number of issues and share them with the House.  I appeal to the Leader to ask the Minister to investigate them.  I have today drafted a letter that I will send to the Minister and copy it to the Leader.

We have since had the statement from the Taoiseach clinging to the fantasy that the agreement can continue to run for another two years.  There have been hints of something different, but the Government seems oblivious to the anger and hurt among public service workers.  To shed some light on the topic, I mention the plight of National Ambulance Service staff.  I am sure everyone here will agree that they do extremely important work which they do very well.  Here is a quote from one of them:<\/p><blockquote>I'm an EMT, and my pay is so bad I have to sometimes take emergency annual leave as I can't afford diesel for my car to get to work - I work an hour from home.<br \/><br \/>I have also had to wait until 12 midnight at a petrol station for my wages to go into my bank, so I have enough to pay for diesel to get home.  I only get to do a week's shopping once a fortnight as I can't afford to do it every week.  I don't know how much more my family and I can take.<\/blockquote> <p>This is a second quote:<\/p><blockquote>My girlfriend and I are really struggling; we have a baby on the way.  The HSE have decided to station me a few hundred kilometres away from home, meaning we have to pay rent at home and where I am stationed.  It's getting to the point where I'll be doing what colleagues are already doing; I'll be sleeping in my car.  There is no rent allowance to assist staff who are based away from home.  It's bad enough that I have to be away from my partner but for the salary and the stress we are under it's just horrific and there is nowhere to turn.  I could be years away from a transfer.  Isn't having kids, buying a home and getting married supposed to be a recipe for a happy life?  We simply can't afford to do any of those things ... I am now looking for alternative work in my home town.<\/blockquote> <p>The people concerned cannot wait for another two years.  We need the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to come to the House as a matter of urgency to debate the issue of public sector pay.

I welcome and commend the national awareness campaign on domestic and sexual violence entitled \"What would you do?\" launched by the T&aacute;naiste today.  Earlier I mentioned empowerment but to me, and I think colleagues will agree, educating young people to have respect for others is important.  This includes respect for males and females because violence is meted out to males in the home as well.  It is important we voice that aspect in the House.  It is essential to support victims so that when they cry out for help they  find support.

It will be another real blow to rural Ireland if we cannot support and maintain the basic rail infrastructure that has been in place since Victorian times.  It looks as if no rail line is making money apart from Dublin to Cork and, possibly, Dublin to Limerick, with all the branch lines in serious trouble.

I call for a debate with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys, on the role theatre and the arts generally can play in cultural revival and the revival of tourism in Ireland.

They went to markets like Holland and Spain and the decision will have a major effect not only on the dairy industry, and those who produce dairy calves, but the beef industry where we will have the possibility of a major flood of undesirable animals into the market.  These animals are more important for the veal trade than the beef trade itself.  How we deal with the surplus is a major question for the industry and it is important that the Minister for Agriculture Food and the Marine comes to the Chamber within the next two weeks to discuss the issue as a matter of urgency.  If we do not take action between now and next February it will be too late, as the knock-on effect in two years' time will leave us with a beef market flooded with underweight carcasses which will be hard to sell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#M00200","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>It might be appropriate for a commencement matter debate next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#M00300","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":138,"content":"<p>The issue of rural rail should not come down to a debate between rural Ireland and urban Ireland.  The reality is that billions have been spent on transportation in Dublin city on the Luas cross-city service, and it is appropriate that this is the case, but people living in rural Ireland have the right to be able to commute from one town to another.  Elderly people living in parts of west Clare have a legitimate expectation of getting a bus into Ennis and onto Limerick, reasonably comfortably.  That is not the case at the moment.  It is good that a public consultation has been announced but we need to realise that we have to invest in public transport, not just in urban Ireland but in rural Ireland too.<\/p> <p>I also wish to raise the issue of the accessibility of our railway stations as many of them across the country are not accessible for people with disabilities.  It would not cost a fortune to make them accessible and I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate on this particular issue of how we make our public railway and bus stations accessible to people who have mobility impairments, such as elderly people.  It is totally unacceptable that the busy railway station at Ennis, the capital town of County Clare, has no lift to take wheelchair passengers from one platform to the other.  In this day and age it is not acceptable and we should not stand by and allow it to continue.. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#M00400","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#M00500","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I thank the 22 Members of the Seanad who raised matters on the Order of Business this morning.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba mhaith liom f&iacute;orfh&aacute;ilte a chuir roimh an gComhairleoir Brendan Thornhill from Wicklow, who is in the Visitors Gallery.  I welcome councillor Brendan Thornhill from Wicklow to the Visitors Gallery.<\/p><p>Senators Ardagh, Devine, Higgins and Coffey raised the issue of domestic violence.  I welcome Maria McDonald to the Visitors Gallery and commend her on the work she is doing.  It is very important that we have a debate on the issue in this Chamber.  Senator Ardagh made reference to Rhona Mahony and to the one in eight women who have to endure domestic violence when pregnant, which is unacceptable.  In the SAFE Ireland summit earlier this week we heard that one in four women experience domestic violence and one in two has to endure sexual harassment so I am pleased that, this morning, the T&aacute;naiste is launching a new awareness campaign aimed at highlighting the importance of taking action and how horrible such violence is.  The website is <i>whatwouldyoudo.ie<\/i>and is costing &euro;950,000 over a six-year period, in which time it will aim to raise awareness and to emphasise that we have to stop this behaviour.  All of us have a role to play, whether elected or non-elected.  It is equally important to put in place extra supports so that women are empowered to come forward to speak of their own experience.  I commend in Edel House in Cork, which does Trojan work helping people and their families to emerge from the shadow and the darkness of domestic violence.<\/p><p>The new domestic violence Bill is at an advanced stage and the Minister is committed to it.  The public consultation period has closed and the Minister spoke at the launch of the campaign this morning of the impact the Bill have in improving access to barring orders.  It will also provide greater support for victims in the courts process in the shape of things such as court accompaniment.  It is important that this House, in tandem with the Minister and those working in the area of sexual and domestic violence, sends a strong message that we will not tolerate it.  We must all work together to promote a proactive campaign which will be of value to women and children who wish to speak out.<\/p><p>I also acknowledge the president of AILG, councillor Pat Daly, and past president John Crowe, who are in the Visitors Gallery.  I commend them on the work they are doing in respect of local councils.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#M00600","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#M00700","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Senator Craughwell raised the Social Welfare Bill.  I am glad he jumped the gun a couple of months ago when he complained that Fine Gael Senators had met the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.  I welcome the engagement of the Minister with the civic engagement group and with Members of the House on the Social Welfare Bill.  It is important that PRSI contributions and classes of pension entitlements for councillors and citizens are taken on board.<\/p> <p>Senator Devine raised the issue of mental health as well as domestic violence.

It obviously needs to be updated, progressed and evolved into a living document in which one can see improvements.  I will be happy to have the Minister come to the House in this regard. <\/p><p>Senators Alice-Mary Higgins and Frank Feighan raised the issue of the election of Mr. Trump to the presidency of the United States.  As Leader of the House, I was present last week in the United States.  It is fair to say that those who know me would say that I would not subscribe to the politics of the President-elect or the Vice President-elect, Mr. Pence.  As a democrat, one lives by the ballot box and accepts the democratic decision of the people.  In the case of America, the people voted and made a decision.  We might not like it and might be disappointed with the result.  I have very strong reservations about some of the policies and statements he espouses but we have a duty to work with the new President to protect and preserve jobs in our country and ensure that those of us of a different viewpoint educate him and highlight the need for work to continue on human and LGBT rights and on employment and the rights of workers, not just in the United States but across the world.<\/p><p>Like Senator Feighan, I believe we should give the man a chance and work with him to ensure he becomes President and has an opportunity to govern.  After that, it is our duty, whether in respect of Syria, relations with Russia or immigrants and immigration, to promulgate our viewpoints.  Those who support boycotting him or protesting should remember that the American people made a democratic decision which we must respect even if we might not like it.  Those of us who stand for election in this country might not like the decision of the electorate, but one has to accept it.  That is what democracy is about, namely, the sovereign will of the people.  The vote of a billionaire is equal to the vote of a person with no money.  That is the way it should be.  Whether the electoral college system in America is changed is a different matter and not one for this Chamber.  I hope that the President-elect is given the opportunity to take office and that those of us who are committed to a fairer and more just world with engage with him, will not be afraid to highlight our views and will not stand idly by if we disagree with some of his decisions or comments.<\/p><p>Senators Higgins and Coffey referred to climate change.  Today, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, is in Marrakesh at the UN Convention.  I am sure he will come to the House.  He spoke about Ireland reducing its carbon footprint and the importance of taking our responsibilities seriously.  Senator Coffey is correct.  Penalties are being imposed on Ireland and we must live up to our responsibilities.  Equally, there are those who oppose everything, whether it is wind farms or solar energy.  We need to have a national conversation on how we can reduce our carbon footprint.  We also need to ensure that renewable energies can be delivered.  There is an economic challenge in that regard.  Building from the Paris Agreement of 12 months ago, it is also important that we take our responsibilities seriously, not just for ourselves but for future generations so they have an environment that is presentable and habitable.  It is a duty to which we have to live up.<\/p><p>Senator Davitt referred to cybercrime, which, as he said, is increasing.  I have been informed that additional staff will be allocated to the computer crime investigation unit under the Garda national fraud bureau.  I accept his point that staff numbers were reduced from 31 to 29.  It is important that the numbers increase.<\/p><p>Senator Landy referred to Brexit, its impact on the agrifood industry and the importance of working with SMEs.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to deal with that issue.<\/p><p>Senators Landy, Coghlan, Wilson, Ned O'Sullivan, Feighan, Richmond, Boyhan and Craughwell referred to the Rugby World Cup.  It is important that we welcome the support of all sporting organisations and sections of Irish industry for the proposal to host the tournament.  As I said yesterday, it is important that we support the 2023 bid.  Great credit is due to Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael, of which I am a member, for having the foresight, under the presidency of Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly, MEP, to change rule 42.  <\/p><p>It is great that we speak of an Ireland where we are rushing to welcome the Rugby World Cup to stadiums like those in Thurles, Breffni Park, P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh, Nowlan Park, Croke Park or whatever.  I was not a party to the decision to exclude Thurles.  All I can say to those who are of the sporting mentality is that it is a fantastic stadium.  I heard some commentary on the radio today about access from the main Cork to Dublin road.  I am very happy to travel to and from Thurles.  It is not that bad of a journey.  Those who said it was a difficulty are misguided.<\/p><p>Senator Coghlan referred to Fitzgerald Stadium.  Having been there on many occasions for the defeat of the team I support, I am not sure whether it should be included.  I am joking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#M00800","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":144,"content":"<p>The Leader is entitled to a joke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#N00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":145,"content":"<p>Fitzgerald Stadium is one of the most scenic and picturesque grounds in the country.

It is important that those who support the bid for the Rugby World Cup get behind it and that those who are in charge of the bid, including the former T&aacute;naiste, Dick Spring, who is the chairman, consider the example of Thurles and Breffni Park and perhaps include them on the list of stadiums.<\/p> <p>Senator Byrne raised the issue of Mary Immaculate College.  I would be happy for the Minister to examine the issue.<\/p> <p>Senator Richmond referred to ongoing Russian activities in Syria and Ukraine.  It is a source of concern and the Senator is right to raise the issue.  Equally worrying are the comments from Syria about working with the President-elect of America.  It is a significant worry for me.  It is important that the Minister, Deputy Naughten, comes to the House to outline the issue regarding the digital hub and to clarify remarks that have been made.<\/p> <p>Senators Wilson, Conway-Walsh, Ned O'Sullivan and Coffey referred to railways.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, will come before the House today.  Public transport is an important issue. We must learn from the past.  Irish Rail is not Dublin-centric rail; it is Irish Rail.  As Mr. Kenny said today on a number of news channels, it is important to recognise that Irish Rail receives its revenue from ticket sales and a subvention from the Government.  In budget 2017, over &euro;50 million was allocated in additional funding, bringing its funding to over &euro;300 million for 2017.  It is important that we increase investment in the maintenance and renewal of the network and rolling stock.  Senator Conway referred to Ennis and I will return to that point.<\/p> <p>It is also important that we consider how we make sure that people use our rail network.  I recall the west Cork to Cork city rail line.  If it was still in place it would be busy, as are the lines from Cork to Cobh and Midleton.  We must not repeat the mistakes of the past.  I wish to stress to Members that the purpose of the review that has been published is to open a public discussion about the role of our railways, their funding and provide factual material to inform the discussion.  No decision has been made.  It is important that the Minister, Deputy Ross, hears what Members have to say today.<\/p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh referred to the west.  As far as I know, no decisions have been made to close any railway lines.  What has been published is simply a discussion document.<\/p> <p>Senator Wilson referred to the Youthreach programme.  It is a major advantage to our education system and community services.  I commend all those who are involved.<\/p> <p>Senator McFadden referred to mental health services for adults and children.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan also raised transport issues.  It is important that we discuss drug trials in residential institutions and homes.  I would be happy to discuss the issue with him and see how we can bring about a unified approach.  People's lives were interfered with and they were not given proper information or due respect.  They were treated very badly by the State and it is important that we continue to raise the issue.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Senator is right, in that these serious allegations require further investigation.<\/p><p>Senators Gavan and Colm Burke referred to the Lansdowne Road agreement.

As Senators will know, my portfolio is large and varied and I look forward to setting out the key issues facing the three sectors under my remit, namely, transport, tourism and sport.  I expect no indulgence, anticipate a lively and interesting exchange of views and look forward to hearing Senators' views and comments.<\/p> <p>As Members will be aware, there have been some recent challenges in all three sectors - industrial unrest in the transport sector, legal investigations in the sports sector, albeit counterbalanced by some wonderful results on the field and in water, and the concerns that Brexit poses for the tourism sector, which has been having one of its best years to date.<\/p> <p>I will address public transport.  All Senators appreciate the importance of our bus, Luas and rail public transport system to our society and our economy.  At its most basic, public transport is about connecting people and places.  It also has an important role to play in making our cities and towns more liveable places through alleviating congestion and improving our quality of life.  Public transport also allows us to make a switch towards a more sustainable transport future and helps to combat environmental pollution.  It can be of great assistance to those with reduced mobility in providing an accessible mode of transport.  It plays a significant role in the economic growth of the nation through facilitating the efficient movement of people and goods to places of employment and the marketplace.<\/p> <p>In order to fulfil these important roles, we need an accessible, integrated, well-funded, high-quality and efficient public transport system, a system that delivers real value for money for the taxpayer and the fare-paying passenger.  In this year's budget, I was delighted to announce an allocation of approximately &euro;625 million for the public transport sector.  This includes an increase of approximately 11% in the amount of taxpayers' money that will be made available next year to fund public and rural transport services across the State as well as an investment of &euro;344 million in capital expenditure.  Collectively, this will facilitate new and improved services and facilities across our publicly-funded bus and rail networks.<\/p> <p>The National Transport Authority, NTA, has an important statutory function in allocating funding to the public transport operators, planning public transport services and monitoring the operators' delivery of services in line with their contractual obligations.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->On a non-statutory basis, the NTA administers the rural transport programme on my Department's behalf.<\/p><p>As Senators will be aware, A Programme for a Partnership Government gives recognition to the value and benefit of rural transport to communities, in particular for older people vulnerable to social isolation.  The allocation for rural transport in 2017 represents an almost 20% increase on the original funding allocation for 2016.  I recently announced additional funding for this year.  This increased funding for rural transport will enable a continuation of the process already under way of making improvements to existing services and developing new routes.<\/p><p>There are many in this House who believe we should increase funding for our transport services.  I, too, believe that increased funding is desirable.  That is why I made a strong submission during this year's budget discussions and why I am pleased with the increase I secured.  Simply increasing funding is not the only answer.  We need to be sure that how we spend existing money is delivering real value for money for the taxpayer.  Since 2008, we have spent around &euro;6 billion on public transport across services and infrastructure.  Even that figure excludes the cost of funding free travel and the tax saver schemes.<\/p><p>Next year, the NTA will announce the winners of the competitions currently under way to provide around 10% of PSO bus services.  These tendering competitions will allow us to capture potential benefits as regards value for money and in respect of how we use taxpayers' money to secure the provision of public transport services.  Services provided under these new contracts will be subject to the same regulation and oversight by the NTA as the services provided today.  I look forward to the NTA's successful progression of the three competitions and the introduction of an interesting new dynamic to public transport services.<\/p><p>In the near future, projects such as the reopening of the Phoenix Park tunnel, the completion of the cross-city Luas project and the ten-minute DART will help to manage the increasing demand on the transport network.  Works have recently been completed on the Phoenix Park tunnel line, which will see several new services operate from Newbridge and Hazelhatch to Grand Canal Dock at peak times on weekdays.  The tunnel will also allow commuter services, such as those for Carlow, Portlaoise, Kildare and Athlone, to connect to the city centre.  The cross-city Luas project will provide for an estimated 10 million additional journeys per annum on the Luas network, and the capacity of the Luas green line is being increased in order to accommodate the continued passenger growth on that line.  The ten-minute DART service will greatly increase the frequency and capacity on DART lines.<\/p><p>The bus service continues to provide the mainstay of our national public transport system.  As such, for 2017 funding has been provided for the purchase of 110 buses for the Dublin regional fleet and over 70 buses for the Bus &Eacute;ireann feet, in addition to the development and upgrading of quality bus corridors in both the greater Dublin area and regional cities.<\/p><p>In addition, nearly &euro;160 million has been allocated for the maintenance and upkeep of the rail network and the funding of ongoing projects, such as the city centre resignalling programme.  The construction of a new central traffic control centre will enable major transport projects, including the expansion of the DART to Balbriggan, to proceed.  It will improve national rail movement.<\/p><p>The Government has committed to ordering a review of the capital plan in 2017.  I am determined to make the case for public transport investment to be increased and accelerated as a result of this review in order to address our growing transport needs.<\/p><p>Yesterday I briefed the Cabinet on the rail review of 2016.  The review was undertaken by the NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and submitted to me at the end of August.  Senators will be aware that I committed to arrange for its publication and the commencement of public consultation.  The NTA has now commenced that consultation with the publication yesterday of the rail review and a public consultation paper on the role of rail in Ireland and funding its delivery.  The review is a strategic examination of the role of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the financial resources required to continue to provide services on a sustainable basis.  The review also provides an analysis of the company's financial position, some possible funding solutions and some proposals for measures to grow passenger numbers.  The purpose of the documents is to open up a public discussion on the role of rail and its funding and to provide factual material to inform the discussion.<\/p><p>Throughout the consultation process, the public and interested parties will have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on the future of rail in this country.  No decisions are being sought or taken at this point.  I have made clear that decisions are not being contemplated until after there is a full process of public consultation.  The NTA's public consultation will run until early in the new year.  The NTA will then prepare a report about the consultation's progress and, at that stage, I intend to bring it to the Government.<\/p><p>Let us consider the recent industrial unrest in the public transport sector and the inconvenience to the travelling public.  I am as relieved as every member of the travelling public to know that the talks have been successful.  I thank the WRC, the trades unions and the management for their commitment to engaging in talks and for the hard work, steely patience and long hours they all put in to resolve most of the issues raised.  I welcome the continued engagement of unions and management in the public transport sector on outstanding issues.<\/p><p>The Government recognises the importance of public transport and is committed to its further development within the context available funding.  That is why A Programme for a Partnership Government commits to full review public transport policy to ensure services are sustainable and meet the needs of a modern economy.  Any revised policy must ensure that the interests of passengers and taxpayers are at the heart of public transport policy.  I am currently considering, with my Department, how we will move forward with a policy review in 2017 but I am sure the process will benefit from the contributions made by Senators during the Oireachtas-level consultations and the public consultation, which will form a key part of that review.<\/p><p>Maritime transport is another key sector in my Department and it is vital to the Irish economy.  Our approach to maritime administration involves an appropriate combination of policy development, statutory regulation, safety awareness promotion, and enforcement.<\/p><p>Safety at sea is vital to this island nation.  While a very good foundation is in place, considerable development continues to be required in the coming years to meet international targets and national obligations.  This constant need for vigilance was brought home to us in a very poignant way this September with the loss of Catr&iacute;ona Lucas in a tragic accident.  She was a coastguard volunteer and a member of that extraordinary group of men and women who dedicate their skills, time and passion so others may be safe on our coastlines.  I commend the Coast Guard, volunteers, the RNLI and all involved in ensuring safety at sea on their bravery, remarkable courage and heroism in the service of others.<\/p><p>With regard to the development of our maritime sector, 2016 marked the start of a prolonged period of very important infrastructural improvements and developments in the ports sector.  All three of our ports of national significance &ndash; Dublin, Cork and Shannon-Foynes - have major infrastructural development plans under way or due to commence, and all have been successful in obtaining some EU funding towards their developments.  Overall, port companies are currently performing well, and in 2016 we have seen a shift from recovery mode to growth mode in the ports sector.  This means we need to ensure that our ports are positioned well to compete and that they can provide the type of port capacity required into the future.  I am confident that national ports policy provides the required policy framework to underpin the necessary investments.  <\/p><p>As Senators will be aware, the enactment of the Harbours Act in December 2015 was an important milestone in national ports policy, providing the necessary primary legislative framework to allow for the transfer of five ports of regional significance - Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Wicklow, New Ross and Galway - to more appropriate local authority-led governance structures and to local authority control.  The local authorities concerned are in the process of conducting a due diligence process with the ports due to be transferred, and my Department continues to liaise with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, local authorities and ports with regard to the transfer process.  The transfer of the ports to local authority control is progressing, and Wicklow Port Company was the first port company to transfer to local authority control, on 30 August 2016.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The transfer of the ports to local authority control is progressing.  Wicklow Port Company was the first port company to transfer to local authority control on 30 August 2016.  <\/p><p>I will now deal with aviation for Ireland given our island status and peripheral location.  The connectivity which airports provide is vital.  Eighty per cent of all passenger movement into and out of Ireland is by air.  We are well served by airports.  The airport network providing scheduled air services is extensive, with three State airports, Dublin, Cork and Shannon, delivering significant connections with Europe, North America and the Middle East, complemented by the four regional airports in Donegal, Ireland West Airport - Knock - Kerry and Waterford, providing a level of international connectivity to support the tourism and business sectors in their regions.  We are currently in the second year of a five-year regional airports programme, covering the period 2015-19 to provide targeted supports towards safety and security-related projects and activities to these four airports.  This programme also supports the two PSO air routes from Donegal and Kerry airports to Dublin.  The funding that is provided by my Department for these safety and security purposes is vital for these smaller airports and it is no exaggeration to say that without this Exchequer support, the airports would almost certainly be unable to continue to facilitate scheduled passenger services.  <\/p><p>Ireland's State-owned airports provide vital international connectivity.  Cork Airport plays a strategic role in serving its hinterland, with over 2 million passengers annually and 39 destinations in ten countries.  Shannon Airport holds a similarly strategically important position as a gateway to the mid-west, with 1.71 million passengers in 2015 travelling to 35 destinations in 11 countries.  Shannon Airport was also the first in Europe to provide full US pre-clearance services.  Last year 25 million passengers flew from Dublin Airport to over 180 destinations in 40 countries using 30 different airlines.  The availability of full US customs and immigration pre-clearance facilities at Dublin Airport has assisted in no small way in making Dublin Airport the fifth biggest for connectivity into North America, behind only Heathrow, Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt and Schiphol.  With growth can come constraints.  It is important that Ireland maximises its existing airport assets while all the time planning for the future.  <\/p><p>Last April, I welcomed the decision taken by the DAA to proceed with the development of a second runway at Dublin Airport.  The project is expected to create thousands of jobs and will allow the airport to grow, which, in turn, allows the Irish economy to grow.  I have encouraged the DAA to continue to engage with local communities on the north runway project.  I have held a number of meetings with representative groups and individuals since the company announced that it was proceeding with the runway project.  I plan to continue to meet with the groups, to hear their views and anything else they wish to contribute.  For its part, the DAA has also stated its willingness - which I support - to meet and engage with residents and to provide briefings to groups or individuals on request.  These initiatives are in addition to DAA's ongoing engagement on mitigation measures, including voluntary home sound insulation and dwelling purchase schemes, which are required as part of the planning permission for runway north.  <\/p><p>Given that current passenger growth trends at Ireland's State airports are anticipated to continue and in light of the decision by DAA to proceed with construction of the north runway project, I have decided to bring forward a review of capacity at Ireland's State airports, originally planned for 2018.  The review is about planning for the long term.  Specifically, it is envisaged that the review will consider the development of the three State airports to 2050, with the identification and prioritisation of new infrastructure development, including modification, if any, to the existing airport infrastructure.  The review will include examination of options for the development of a new terminal capacity at Dublin Airport, Terminal 3.  A request for tender for this work was published last week.  I expect to receive the completed report in the middle of next year.  One of the key issues for that review is whether the new terminal should be operated by the current incumbent, DAA, or by a competitor from the private or public sector.<\/p><p>My work in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport also covers road transport and road safety.  I spoke earlier about maritime safety and of equal importance is road safety.  Last year was the joint safest year on record on our roads.  However, this year there has been a highly disturbing increase in the number of fatalities and serious injuries recorded.  No single factor is being blamed and no one action is likely to turn around this problem.  We must remember that each individual who uses our roads, whether as a motorist, a cyclist or a pedestrian, has a responsibility for road safety both in his or her own interest and in the interests of other road users.  My Department, in conjunction with other key stakeholders, is continuing to pursue the goal of safer roads through actions across a broad range of fronts.  A mid-term review is taking place this month on the Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020, which contains 144 actions intended to make our roads safer for all users.  High-level meetings are being held between me, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, the Attorney General and other stakeholders to review progress on all actions and to give renewed impetus to any actions that might be behind schedule.  <\/p><p>It is only fair to acknowledge that there is a real problem in terms of our road fatalities which must be addressed in a more immediate manner.  The number of fatalities has increased by 23% this year, depending on the events of the past few days.  The situation is critical.  It is not satisfactory to look back and say that the situation has improved since 2002 or before that or to say that 2015 was a good year.  The reality is that 2013 and 2014 were bad years and 2015 now looks as if it was the outlier in that for 2016 thus far, the figures are very bad.  We need to look at this issue in a more concrete way and more seriously.  It must be acknowledged that alcohol has once again become a serious problem in this area.  The figures to 2012 show that alcohol has become a renewed curse, particularly among young drivers.  In cases involving fatalities there was an alcohol link of 38%.  This is not satisfactory.  The anecdotal evidence that I have seen indicates that this trend is continuing.  It is wrong to suggest that we beat the curse of drink-driving some time in the last generation and that there has been a change of attitude in this regard.  If there was a change of attitude it has been reversed.  Anybody who listens to our radio stations on a daily basis will realise this.  We have almost become used to hearing about fatalities several times a week.  That is not acceptable.  We must to look to ourselves in terms of a solution.  We cannot look to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and say they are not doing enough in terms of inspections.  Garda resources have decreased.  All the State agencies, including the Road Safety Authority, and the Government must regard this as a matter of urgency.  If there was complacency last year, that has been shattered.  We can no longer just say that it is up to each individual to look after himself or herself and nor can we dismiss this as something that will go away.  There is a role for Government in this regard.  We have shown in the past that we can address it and do so successfully.  We will have to be more proactive in our attitude to road deaths.  The current statistics are unacceptable to me and they will be reviewed by me aggressively.  I will be meeting key stakeholders on this issue in the next few days.  We hope to be able to report back to the House next year that this trend is being reversed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I brought the Road Traffic Bill 2016 before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann recently and it passed Second Stage on 28 September.  As Senators may know, the Bill was originally passed by the Seanad in January 2016.  The Government took a decision to restore it to the D&aacute;il Order Paper following the general election.  I will be bringing it to Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 30 November.  The Bill contains a series of reforms designed to enhance safety on our roads.  It addresses the growing menace of people driving under the influence of drugs.  It also creates a new special speed limit of 20 km\/h which local authorities will be able to apply in built-up areas.  This is being done, after careful consideration, in response to the Jake's Legacy campaign.  I pay tribute to the work of Jake's mother, Roseann Brennan, and all involved in the campaign.<\/p><p>In addition, the Bill will give legal effect to an agreement on mutual recognition of driver disqualifications between Ireland and the UK.  I plan to bring several amendments on Committee Stage.  While some of these will be of a technical nature, I also intend to include measures to address the problem of written-off vehicles and the dangers they present for the first time in law.<\/p><p>I am conscious of the challenges that lie ahead for the transport sector as it seeks to play its part in addressing the challenge of climate change.  Work at a sectorial level is proceeding well on the development of a strategic approach to both mitigation and adaptation through the national mitigation and adaptation plans.  The mitigation plan will assist Ireland in transitioning to the decarbonisation of the transport sector by 2050.  It is also vital we seek to future-proof the efficient functioning of the system to ensure we can continue to accrue the many benefits of transport to the economy and society in general.  The adaptation plan will play a key role.<\/p><p>It has been an extraordinary year for Irish sport with the UEFA Euro 2016 and the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Brazil.  There was the uplifting success of a certain duo from Cork who rowed their way into the nations' hearts, along with the continued success of the various Irish teams, most recently the soccer and rugby teams.  There have also been some difficult moments, namely, the recent tragic death of Anthony Foley and the ongoing Olympic ticket investigations in Rio.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to continued investment in sport.  The sports capital programme is the Government's primary vehicle to support the development of sports facilities and the purchase of sports equipment.  The most recent rounds of the programme were in 2012, 2014 and 2015.  So far this year, &euro;22.3 million has been paid out under these and previous rounds.  These grants have delivered new and improved facilities, along with increased opportunities to participate in sport.  The programme aims to foster an integrated and planned approach to developing sports and recreation facilities.  It has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland with improvements in the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in virtually every village, town, county and city.  The programme also alms to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports facilities and encourage the sharing of these facilities by clubs, schools, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport.<\/p><p>As was confirmed in the 2017 Estimates, &euro;52 million has been provided for sports capital projects.  This will meet all existing commitments under previous rounds of the sports capital and local authority swimming pool programmes.  It will also allow for a new round of the sports capital programme.  In this regard, several new measures are being introduced to streamline all aspects of the programme from registration to application to grant drawdown.  Planned new measures will include a shortened application form, new guides for completing the form and the organisation of a series of regional workshops to assist applicants who intend to apply for a grant.  The new round will be open for applications by January at the latest.  Based on previous rounds of the programme, the assessment process takes several months to complete.  I expect the actual grant allocations will be made some time during summer 2017.  We will be announcing more comprehensive details of the new round shortly.<\/p><p>The Irish bid for the Rugby World Cup is a real high point for the Irish sporting world.  Senators will be aware the launch of the bid took place yesterday at the Aviva Stadium.  The Government is hopeful that, with only three competitors left in the bid, we will be successful.  Hosting the Rugby World Cup would give a boost not just to sport but to tourism and the whole nation.  The benefits for Ireland would be incalculable.  The support of the Government, which has underwritten the tournament fee of over &euro;120 million, the IRFU, Irish Rugby Football Union, and other sporting organisations, is encouraging.  The fact this is a united Ireland bid for a sporting occasion should not be underestimated.  There were people from both parts of Ireland in full support on the platform and in the audience yesterday when the bid was launched.  The fact sport unites people is a message that should not be lost.<\/p><p>I call on all Senators to give any support they can to support our bid for this world cup.  There is going to be a somewhat complicated voting system, which will not puzzle anyone who has had to stand for election to this House.  If any Member can lobby anyone involved in the rugby nations, then the Government and the nation would be grateful.  We have a really good chance of a landing an extraordinarily prestigious tournament.  We have got the stadia.  Anyone who was in Chicago last week when we beat the All Blacks, as were some who are in this Chamber today, will know Irish rugby is at an absolute peak.  There was a full house at the game against Canada last Saturday and we will meet the All Blacks on Saturday again.  This underlines the fact that we are in an extraordinarily strong position as a rugby nation and on top of the world.  It should be recognised that Irish sport is in a very good place.  We also did well in the UEFA Euro 2016 championship.  Despite not taking as many medals as were expected in the Rio Olympic Games, there were some tremendously unexpected best performances.  We did well in the top 10 and top 20.<\/p><p>A total of &euro;52 million is being provided in capital funding for sport in 2017.  The reduction from the 2016 capital allocation of &euro;73.5 million is the result of the on-time completion of phase 1 of the National Indoor Arena, due for December 2016.  This capital funding will meet existing commitments under previous rounds of the sports capital programme, including P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh and the Kerry Sports Academy at IT Tralee, as well as existing commitments relating to the development of the National Sports Campus and under the local authority swimming pools programme.  As was confirmed in the 2017 Estimates statement, it will also allow for a new round of the sports capital programme to be opened for applications shortly, with the announcement of allocations expected in 2017.<\/p><p>While I have been proud to attend several Irish sporting fixtures lately, I was especially delighted to be able to attend the Olympic Games in Rio in August.  I was proud of the accomplishments of our athletes there.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In addition to Annalise Murphy and Paul and Gary O'Donovan winning silver medals, Irish Olympians achieved 16 top-ten and 14 top-20 finishes, which is a marked improvement on the 14 top-ten and six top-20 finishes achieved in London in 2012.  Our Paralympians also performed fantastically, winning 11 medals and with 22 top-18 finishes.  The Olympians and Paralympians are an inspiration to us all and I hope they will be seen as role models for young people entering the world of competitive sport with a view to reaching elite level in the future.<\/p><p>In mentioning the Olympic Games, I must refer to the non-statutory inquiry established to investigate the matter of ticketing.  It is being led by Mr. Justice Carroll Moran and began its investigation on 19 September.  The Moran inquiry has scope under its terms of reference to inquire into the policies, procedures, processes and practices of the Olympic Council of Ireland in the distribution and sale of tickets and accreditations at Rio 2016 and any previous summer or winter Olympic Games.  Mr. Justice Moran was asked to present a report within 12 weeks of the inquiry's commencement, but he has indicated that this timeline may be ambitious and some delay is anticipated.  As the inquiry is under way, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further until it has completed its work.<\/p><p>I am delighted to advise the House that I will be launching a national sports policy consultation document, together with the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, tomorrow, 17 November.  It is a very important document as it will give all relevant stakeholders an opportunity to make a real contribution to the new national sports policy framework which will be drafted following the consultation process and provide a framework for the development of Irish sport in the next ten years.  The consultation document raises questions on a wide range of issues pertinent to sport in Ireland, including governance, volunteering and sports tourism, in addition to high performance and participation.  I look forward to receiving the views of the sports sector and all interested stakeholders on these issues and all topics related to sport.<\/p><p>Tourism is an enormously important industry for Ireland and an important driver of its strengthening economic recovery.  Overseas visitors contribute &euro;4.2 billion to the economy, excluding carrier receipts, air fares and ferry charges, and help to sustain over 220,000 jobs in communities across Ireland.  In fact, 2013 was the fifth consecutive year of growth in overseas visitor numbers, with Ireland outperforming many of its competitor destinations, while 2015 was a record year, with over 8.6 million visits.  That growth has continued into 2016, with the latest official figures showing growth of over 12% so far this year.  As an island destination, direct, convenient and competitive flights are critical to achieving and sustaining growth in inbound tourist numbers.  We have seen significant expansion in the range of air services available to Ireland in recent years and anticipate that there are further route announcements yet to come.<\/p><p>The Government's decision to introduce and maintain a 9% VAT rate for the tourism industry has been an important factor in increasing employment in the sector and, importantly, helped to improve the value on offer for visitors.  The Government's tourism policy statement, People, Place and Policy - Growing Tourism to 2025, acknowledges the importance of tourism as a driver of economic and social development in rural areas.  The tourism action plan 2016 to 2018 identifies the key actions required in the period to 2018 to ensure the longer term tourism policy objectives will be achieved.  They include actions that will strengthen the capacity of local authorities to support tourism in a way that is closely integrated with national level tourism brand experiences, for example, Ireland's Ancient East.  My Department is engaging with the local authority sector on these actions, with the support of the Local Government Management Agency.<\/p><p>Tourism experience brands such as the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East have resulted in a massive boost to rural tourism and it is important that the potential benefits of the State's investments in these projects be fully realised.  To this end, the regional co-operative market access scheme which promotes direct air and sea access to the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East via points of entry outside Dublin has been extended to 2018.  The scheme which is administered by Tourism Ireland involves a core Exchequer contribution of &euro;1 million, with additional contributions by regional tourism stakeholders, including local authorities, the total of which is then matched by carriers to fund strong and effective overseas marketing campaigns.  My Department is also working with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on the action plan for rural Ireland which will also include a focus on the capacity of tourism to act as an agent of growth in the rural economy.<\/p><p>As we are all aware, the United Kingdom decided, in a referendum held earlier this year, to leave the European Union.  The UK electorate has made its decision and we must respect the voters' choice.  The process of the United Kingdom disengaging from the European Union and subsequently negotiating a new relationship with it will take several years.  In the meantime, Ireland remains a committed member of the European Union and we want as close a relationship as possible between the United Kingdom and the European Union in the future.  In particular, we want to safeguard the gains of the Northern Ireland peace process.<\/p><p>We are conducting analysis across government to identify in detail the impact of Brexit and develop possible solutions.  This includes the impact on transport and tourism.  Many factors will influence the impact Brexit will have on Ireland's tourism performance in the coming years, much of which is out of our control.  This has been a record year for tourism in Ireland and there has been no immediate impact on tourism performance since the referendum in the United Kingdom in June.  At over 7.445 million visits, the number of overall trips to Ireland was up by 12% in the first nine months of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015.  The tourism sector is actively considering how it will respond to Brexit and the ways in which it can build on the success achieved this year.<\/p><p>That concludes my overview of the portfolio.  I thank Senators for their time and patience and look forward to hearing their contributions.  I will be very happy to listen and respond to the contributions made.  Many of the items in my portfolio are non-political and cover areas on which most people appear to agree.  The only point on which they do not agree is where the funding should go.  We all seem to share the view that it should go to our own area.  Within these confines, I would like to respond as positively as I can to suggestions Senators may make.  On two of the topics I have addressed, we are actually making policy.  If the consultation process is to be meaningful, it should be informed not only by the views of stakeholders outside the Houses but also those inside them.  I am referring specifically to the rail review which we published yesterday.  No decision has yet been made in that regard as it is subject to a consultation process and input both by the Government and the Opposition.  We are launching the sports consultation process tomorrow.  In that regard, we are as open to suggestions as is politically feasible.  I will be particularly delighted to receive ideas that will not cost enormous sums of money to implement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#O07400","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.

There is a sense around the country that the issue will be quietly swept under the carpet.<\/p> <p>Clearly, tourism is a success story.  Since the Seanad had a good debate with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, last week, I will not rehash much of that discussion, but we must nourish and invest in tourism.  There is no point in standing back and admiring ourselves.  We must continually work on it.  I am concerned by the figures.  The 2017 capital programme is down by 4%.  Since 2012, it has decreased by 17%.  The Minister knows that when investment drops in any walk of life, performance also drops.  He will need to examine and address this issue, particularly in the context of Brexit.  As he stated, 40% of our tourism revenue comes from Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  They are big spenders, as we in Kerry know well, and they are always welcome visitors, but people are concerned.  At a recent Oireachtas committee meeting, the head of F&aacute;ilte Ireland indicated that Brexit had already impacted on the sector.  Perhaps we should have a more forceful tourism Brexit statement.  There has been an interdepartmental one, but the impact on tourism will hit my county first and I would like to see a more hands-on approach to the situation.<\/p> <p>As the Minister knows, the Asian market is growing and has considerable potential.  I would welcome further studies in this regard.  People coming from Asia travel for longer to get here, spend more time in our country and visit more parts of it.  Their needs, what they are visiting for and how we can attract more of them should be analysed.<\/p> <p>Turning to the old bug bears in tourism, hotel pricing, particularly in our capital city, is a disgrace.  It will be an issue this coming weekend with the Rod Stewart concert.  Another bug bear is the shortage of skills, particularly in the culinary field.  There is a shortfall of up to 5,000 chefs.  As to kitchen skills training, we are far behind where we used to be in the days of CERT.  As a Kerryman, I am involved in tourism and know all about it, and the Minister will be conscious of its importance.<\/p> <p>While the Wild Atlantic Way has been a success, there has been little in the way of real funding for some projects, for example, the new visual viewing platforms that all of the counties are anxious to get.  Will the Minister provide some details on capital funding in that respect?<\/p> <p>Regarding transport, I should start with the most important issue, which is road safety.  The Minister is dead on in this regard and we will support everything and anything he can do on that front.  Senators were glad to initiate the Road Traffic Bill, which is now before the D&aacute;il.  The level of competence required to get a full driving licence needs to be examined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#T01100","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":241,"content":"<p>The Senator has two minutes remaining.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#T01200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I will not be sharing, so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#T01300","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>The Chair is just trying to be helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#T01400","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":244,"content":"<p>There is significant pressure on the licensing authority to qualify drivers with L plates.

One can be a prudent, careful and experienced driver, but one cannot legislate for the idiot who will come flying around the corner at 100 mph in a 30 mph zone.  We cannot idiot-proof legislation and I hope that I will not be accused of Nazism, but there should be some form of driving intelligence test as part of the licensing procedure.

I thank the Minister.  To be fair to him, he has provided a comprehensive paper and has set out his stall in print clearly.  That is important, because I intend to circulate this to people.  People are interested in these issues.  I was somewhat surprised by the Minister's statement about some aspects of his Department not being political.  All politics is political.  The Minister is political.  His job is political.  This is all political.<\/p> <p>I will take the Minister through a few points and question him on five or six key issues: the national ports policy; the sports capital programme, which he has discussed; concerns about Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann facing insolvency, as published in the media; the appointment of directors to organisations under his remit and for which he alone has responsibility; and school transport.  Although that last does not fall under his Department completely, he is the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I would like to know the level of synergy in that regard.<\/p> <p>I will start with the national ports policy and, without wanting to appear too parochial, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour.  Wicklow is now out of the scene, but D&uacute;n Laoghaire was one of a number of ports, including Galway, New Ross and Drogheda, that were affected by the Harbours Act 2015, which originated from the 2013 national ports policy.  We are approaching 2017.  For some reason best known to themselves, the previous two Administrations decided to remove local elected representatives from all of the port harbour companies.  That decision was taken and I am not trying to revisit or change it, but it was a bad move.  Local government keeps being eroded in terms of housing, water services, planning and so on.  The decision some years ago to remove councillors was not taken on the Minister's watch, but I just wanted to make a point.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Act provides only for two transfer options relating to ports of regional significance.  The first is the ministerial power to transfer the share holding of the companies to a relevant local authority and provide for certain matters relating to the future administration of any such company.  The second is the ministerial power to dissolve the company and transfer all of its assets, liabilities and employees to a relevant local authority.  They are the only two options available.  Clearly the pace is very slow.  The Minister has spoken before about due diligence but in the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which seems to be the one that is holding things up, the due diligence process has been going on for a very long time.  In the meantime, the port is falling asunder.  The whole place is virtually closed up.  Last week <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reported that the ferry terminal building is available to lease for ten years.  A purpose built multi-million euro ferry terminal for transporting people in and out of the country is now available to rent.  It has been suggested that it might become a shopping centre.  This is a State asset and for some reason, consecutive Ministers have said that the State has no involvement and that they cannot interfere.  This is a State asset and indeed, all harbour companies are State assets.  I asked the Minister previously what dividends each State company pays to the State.  He was not able to answer me at that time and he may not be able to answer me today but I ask him to revert to me on that matter.  I do know that in the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, it has never paid a dividend to the State.  <br\/><br\/>Are these harbour companies viable?  Do local authorities really have the capacity, in terms of maritime law and expertise, to deal with them?  I believe they do not.  The Minister must make a decision.  In the event of a dispute, the Act provides the Minister with the power to make a decision.  Communication is important.  I know there are sensitive issues involved but I ask the Minister to outline the timeframe if he can.  When is he going to exercise his power to make a decision one way or the other, if there is a disagreement between D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour company and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council?  Employment is at stake here and there are also serious pension concerns.  A number of cases related to this company are before the High Court about which I gave details to the Minister previously.  This is a company in crisis and it needs serious intervention.  The Minister cannot walk away and say that he has no responsibility.  This is an asset which is vested in the Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Finance.  That is enough on that issue.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the Minister's comments on the railway review.  I particularly welcome his statement that no rail line service is to be cut at this point in time.  However, as someone who represents agricultural interests in the Seanad I am conscious of the importance of balanced rural development.  In that context, it is important that we maintain, support and if necessary, subsidise good public transport across the country.  Public transport comes at a cost to the taxpayer but if we are serious about spatial and regional development we must support towns and communities all over the country.  I welcome what the Minister has said in that regard.  <br\/><br\/>I fully agree with everything the Minister said about road safety.  I ask the Minister to assure the House that the Road Safety Authority has the necessary resources and finances to do its job.  Does it have a full complement of directors or are there vacancies at the authority at the moment?  Has the authority made any request for additional resources or for more directors?  I ask the Minister to give us the details in that regard.  The Minister spoke about his commitment to road safety and I want to be assured that he is fully behind the Road Safety Authority and will respond to any requests for additional resources or manpower to enable the authority to do the job with which it is tasked.  <br\/><br\/>I am not sure if school transport is within the Minister's remit.  If so, I ask him to comment on it because there is a major crisis in the provision of school transport.  I have been contacted by people from Donegal to Cork who have been unable to secure school transport because of the complexity of the rules regarding distance from schools.  A fundamental review of school transport provision is needed.<br\/><br\/>On the sports capital programme, I note that the Minister intends to streamline the application process and that is to be welcomed.  It is important to have early dialogue with the local authorities on encouraging people to apply for funding.  I also welcome the Minister's commitments with regard to swimming pools.  I will not be specific but will simply say that we need swimming pools and sports facilities across the country.  It is important that local authorities are kept informed of the new, streamlining policies so that they can help applicants to access the programme.<br\/><br\/>I raised the matter of the Irish Rugby Football Union, IRFU and the Rugby World Cup bid in the House yesterday and I echo the Minister's enthusiasm for that bid.  I also want to acknowledge the role played by the GAA, which the Minister did not mention.  The GAA has co-operated with the IRFU and has offered synergy to the bid process.  France and South Africa are also in the mix and it will be a tough battle to secure the event but it is a very positive development.<br\/><br\/>I have covered Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the national ports policy.  On the latter, there is a crisis with the local authorities, except in the case of Wicklow Port Company which has been transferred.  We must push that along.  <br\/><br\/>Finally, Senator Craughwell raised the issue of scrambler quad bikes with the Minister earlier this week.  I read the Minister's response today but I still have concerns.  Many public representatives have been contacted with regard to the need for additional legislation in this area.  The Minister, in his written response, said that he was satisfied that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity and resources to deal with this matter but I suggest that a review be undertaken to determine if new legislation is required in this area.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#T03200","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Senator O'Mahony is next and he has eight minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#U00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I understand this is his first visit as a Minister, having served here as a Senator for many years.<\/p> <p>The Minister's comprehensive overview shows clearly that he has a very wide brief.  There are many challenges ahead but there are opportunities as well.  I attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport this morning at which departmental officials, together with representatives from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, outlined in stark terms the cuts in funding for our roads since the economic crash in 2008.  I welcome the Minister's determination, as expressed in his statement here, to review and restore that funding because the longer it goes on, the more costly it will become.  <\/p> <p>I can only scratch the surface in the time allowed today but on aviation traffic, the growth has been phenomenal, as the Minister pointed out.  I am glad that the continuation of that growth is being planned for in the context of the extra runway at Dublin Airport and developments at the other State airports at Shannon and Cork.  The Minister made reference to the possibility of a third terminal, which is interesting given that only a few years ago the suggestion was made that terminal 2 was a waste of money.  <\/p> <p>For those of us who live in regional and rural Ireland connectivity is crucial.  Our regional airports in Kerry, Donegal, Waterford and in my own area of Knock are very important in that regard.  In the last few days Ireland West Airport, Knock, announced record numbers of passengers for 2016.  It had a greater number of passengers than all of the other regional airports put together.  The airport is vital for those in County Donegal, the midlands and the west.  The Minister made reference in his statement to Public Service Obligation, PSO, routes.  Knock had a PSO route which it lost a number of years ago because it was not being used.  The Minister mentioned the two PSO routes in Donegal and Kerry and I hope they are being well used.  Are those routes being kept under review in terms of their use?  If they are being used, they must be kept but if they are not being used, they must be considered carefully.  It is as simple and straightforward as that because there is limited funding available for regional airports.<\/p> <p>The Minister mentioned the regional airports funding programme for 2015 to 2019 which facilitates State funding for capital spending on security and safety measures.  Under the new scheme the State only provides for 75% of the costs whereas under the old scheme it provided 90%.  It is my understanding that the previous Government submitted a request to the European Commission to allow for exceptional cases to be made in certain circumstances.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, some of these airports do not have the capacity to raise the 25% funding shortfall.  I understand the Government argued for the provision of 90% funding for Ireland West Airport, Knock because of the urgent need for a new apron given the increased number of flights at the airport.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John O'Mahony:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2202\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2202&amp;amp;pid=JohnOMahony&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I would welcome any information the Minister has on that.<\/p><p>The regional airports have the ability to get tourists directly to the regions, which is crucial.  Tourism has been a good-news story in recent years but it is important that we do not lose our competitive advantage and the good value for money that was there.  There is huge value for money particularly in the regions.  Senator Ned O'Sullivan pointed out the issues in Dublin and large urban areas where there is a shortage of hotel accommodation and the rates have increased.  The regions can continue to provide value for money and the regional airports are vital for that.<\/p><p>I compliment the State agencies on their targeted marketing, including The Gathering, the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and many others.<\/p><p>Sport is also within the Minister's remit.  I join other Senators in welcoming yesterday's launch of Ireland's Rugby World Cup bid.  Sport is able to unite people more than politics can.  Hopefully the Government, the Northern Administration, the GAA and rugby coming together can provide a huge boost to the economy in 2023 if we can land it.<\/p><p>As the Minister has said, there have been many good stories in sport.  I think we are going through a golden era at the moment.  He mentioned the recent rugby win against the All Blacks and the upcoming game.  I better not mention that he might be able to make tickets available to Senators because we had enough controversy about that in recent times.  It certainly is a golden era as we saw in the Olympic Games and the Paralympics, but there are also problems in sport.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned governance in sport and I welcome the consultation process he has announced.  He mentioned the ticketing scandal and the investigations will report on what happened there.  He was in the middle of that controversy during the summer.  On top of that issue, there are other issues with governance in sport.  For instance boxing was the leading light in previous Olympic Games; it really fell through the floor in this one.  There was also controversy at world level over the judging system and all that.  I know the reviews will come out and we will have an opportunity to discuss them at the committee.  I would be interested in the Minister's comments on that.  We want to support the positive effects of sport and eradicate the negative and bad administration wherever it exists.<\/p><p>I finish on a housekeeping matter.  In the previous Government, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, was responsible for sport.  I ask the Minister to clarify to whom we should make representations and the various areas covered by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan.  I presume he has responsibility for the sporting area.  Obviously, the Minister has overall responsibility, but I ask him to clarify the different roles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#U00300","speaker":"1426","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming here today to hear our concerns on a number of issues for which he has responsibility.  The people in my county, Donegal, heard yesterday's radio debates involving Deputy Alan Kelly and others with some raised eyes because it is decades since Donegal had its rail tracks torn up; we have no rail in the entire county.  Worse than that, in the counties of Derry and Donegal with a population of almost 500,000 there is no rail connection, no motorway or dual-carriageway connection and no air link to our capital city.  That historical neglect is indefensible.<\/p> <p>I am sure the Minister has seen the report entitled Connected by IBEC and CBI.  The report sets out a vision for an all-Ireland transport infrastructure as we head to a population of 10 million by 2050.  Page 5 has a map of motorway and dual-carriageway on the islands with a complete blank spot in the north west, which has been that way for many a year.  Page 9 of the report shows the rail network which is also a complete blank spot for the people of the north west.  While I appreciate the Minister's earlier point that all Senators and Deputies will understandably raise the concerns of the places they are from and the people they represent, I put it to him that the case for the people of the north west is obvious and needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>It has only worsened in the advent of the Brexit vote in June.  In his speech the Minister outlined how his Department will be addressing that.  One key way to do so is to address that regional imbalance and the denial of equality of access to the people of the region in which I live.<\/p> <p>The St. Andrews Agreement followed on from the Good Friday Agreement and stabilised the institutions in the North.  It reinforced the Good Friday Agreement, which had been voted on by the people.  The Irish Government subsequently committed to &pound;400 million in co-funding for the A5, that is, the dual carriageway from Donegal and Derry leading into Dublin.  Today that has now been reduced to &euro;75 million.  Sadly that project was delayed by a High Court decision.  I understand that the issues leading to that High Court decision have been addressed and the project is now shovel-ready to commence in 2017.  I ask the Minister and his Government colleagues to work with his colleagues in the North and in the North-South Ministerial Council to address the shortfall in funding and to adequately support this vital project on the basis of the arguments I have made at the outset.<\/p> <p>The people of Donegal need to benefit from the A5.  Letterkenny is the main population base and the key point in terms of public services, hospitals, institutes of technology, industry and so on.  We need to build the Letterkenny relief road, which is not contained in the capital plan for this period.  I ask the Minister to review that at the earliest opportunity.  In addition, the N14 links most of Donegal into Lifford-Strabane at which point it joins up with the A5.  It is an all-round vision and I ask the Minister to look at that.<\/p> <p>Obviously, I welcome the announcement of the bid to host the Rugby World Cup.  It was good to see our political leaders across the island united together along with our rugby stars.  I welcome that one of the locations in that bid is Celtic Park in Derry.  If we can bring the Rugby World Cup to Ireland it is vital that is played in all corners of the island.  However, the lack of an air link between Dublin and Derry will undermine the project.  The City of Derry Airport is at the economic and tourism heart of our region with 40% of the passengers using the airport being from Donegal - over 150,000 a year.  However, since 2011 the Government here has not invested one cent in that airport, which needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>The Wild Atlantic Way has been a success.  I talked to tourism promoters who universally praised the initiative.  If we can join the dots together as far as the causeway coast, we would have a great product to offer people.  Most tourists coming into Ireland from North America and Europe fly into Dublin; we need a connecting flight from Dublin to Derry if we are to get the region moving.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2321\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I ask the Minister to consider, at the earliest opportunity, meeting the board of the City of Derry airport. <\/p><p>We recently received some exciting news, namely, the public service obligation connecting London and another airport to Derry.  Ryanair flights were removed, which created a real panic in the region.  Since then there has been really good news.  There will be substantial investment in the airport.  Things are moving in the right direction.  I visited the area on Friday and the potential of the airport is really exciting.  It has the capacity to provide for 650,000 passengers, which is almost double the current number.  A lot of good work has been done.  I ask the Minister to meet the representatives. They are intelligent, positive and can-do people.  I am sure when he meets them he will get that sense.<\/p><p>If a public service obligation is not possible, I ask the Minister to consider a partnership arrangement with the Northern Executive.  Could route development funds be contributed?  There should be some contributions made to the airport, in particular to put in place a link between Dublin and Derry.<\/p><p>My final comments relate to the Irish Coast Guard.  The Minister correctly referred to it in glowing terms in his comments.  He knows the service is one of four core primary emergency response services in the State, the others being the Garda, the fire service and the ambulance service.  It is asking to be placed on a statutory footing and for legislation to be put in place to ensure it has the same status, resources and structures as other emergency services.  I ask the Minister to consider meeting its personnel to determine how he can put legislation together.  I am sure it is something he would want to do in order to reassure the service.  It is concerned about its future and it would be important to provide it with reassurance.  <\/p><p>I thank the Minister for his attention.  I appreciate that much of what I have said are issues he has inherited.  As has been proven in his contributions in the Chamber over the years, he has proven to be somebody of considerable ability.  I hope he can work in partnership with the people of our region to turn things around.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#V00200","speaker":"1400","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Senator Dolan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#W00200","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":269,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

He has a wide-ranging portfolio.  The area of greatest interest to me will always be road safety.  As the Minister indicated, his Department covers road transport and safety.<\/p> <p>With that in mind, last week we had a debate on Committee Stage of the Heritage Bill.  The first amendment that was discussed concerned road safety and the management of our hedgerows.  A number of amendments seeking to provide clarity and ensure public safety with regard to road safety were put forward by a number of Senators.  They are relatively simple and effective amendments that would clarify matters.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, was in the House and indicated she has difficulty in addressing these amendments as they fall under the remit of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, as he indicated.<\/p> <p>Would the Minister agree that the road safety aspects of the Heritage Bill are best handled by his Department under improvements to section 70 of the Roads Act?  I ask the Minister to liaise with his colleague, Deputy Humphreys, on this matter.  That would be very helpful.  The next debate is on Thursday from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.  Committee Stage has been adjourned.  It would be good if we could get clarification on road safety, section 70 and the hedgerow system.<\/p> <p>The Minister referred to road safety and speed limits around housing estates.  He has been in contact with the Jake's Legacy campaign and Jake's mother.  I welcome this development.  The Minister indicated the Bill he wishes to bring forward will create a new special speed limit of 20 km\/h which local authorities will be able to apply in built-up areas.  This will apply to areas where there are housing estates, communities and families.  I welcome the development and hope the Bill is brought before the House as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>I refer to tourism.  Another Senator referred to Donegal and the north west.  I am here to represent my area, the south east.  In a way, I am jealous because the Wild Atlantic Way has been branded and funded, and is delivering for the economy of Ireland, in particular the west coast.  The south east is part of Ireland's Ancient East, which so far has just been a brand.  We have not yet seen financial returns.  There is a correlation between employment and successful tourism.  There was an increase of &euro;150 million in the budget for the National Tourism Development Authority.  I ask the Minister to examine the south east specifically because we have a problem with job recovery.  A portion of the money could go to funding tourism in Waterford, developing the Viking triangle area and funding initiatives in the south east.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#W00400","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":271,"content":"<p>The Minister is very welcome.  My constituency comprises over 600,000 people but they are not able to go anywhere with ease or comfort.  I am sorry to say the Minister's statement gives very little, if any, comfort.<\/p> <p>He commenced by saying that public transport can be of great assistance to those with reduced mobility to provide an accessible mode of transport.  Page 3 of his statement refers to the objective of the review which is twofold, namely, sustainable public transport and meeting the needs of a modern economy.  There is more to this than the economy.  There is nothing in between in the statement.  There is a nod to people with disabilities and then the statement moves on.<\/p> <p>The Taoiseach and, more recently, the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, gave commitments in the House that the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities would be ratified by the end of this year.  Ratification means one thing, namely, implementation.  In the year ahead will the Minister bring about changes?  There are major deficiencies in public transport services within his area.<\/p> <p>I will name just three areas.  For DART, rail and Bus &Eacute;ireann, 24 hours notice is required if one wishes to travel.  There are still incidents where people are unable to travel or make a return journey.  Why is it that only Dublin Bus has integrated assistive technology throughout its fleet for those who are visually or hearing impaired?  Some of the new vehicles in the Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet have information displayed on screens, but no audio announcements.  Why is there a specification for the Pale and a non-standard specification for the rest of the country?<\/p> <p>A significant proportion of the Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet has nothing to aid passengers who are visually or hearing impaired having an independent bus journey experience.  That disparity needs to be dealt with by the Minister.<\/p> <p>Wheelchair spaces should be mandatory on Dublin buses, regional bus services and Irish Rail.  The spaces were hard fought for and put there for a reason.  They are not spaces for a buggy.  Rather, they are spaces for people with disabilities.  Why does the Minister continue to resist the protection of these spaces for wheelchair users?  It should be made an offence to abuse the spaces.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Dolan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2479\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2479&amp;amp;pid=JohnDolan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Currently, a driver or an official can only request someone else to vacate the space.

A second letter which I issued in that regard in October received an acknowledgement.  The Minister might take the opportunity to confirm today the disability inclusion intentions of his Department's strategy statement.<\/p><p>I request that the Minister return to this House to set out the advances that disabled passengers will experience by this time next year and throughout the next number of years, which advances should resonate with the ambition of the statement in the charter for change signed by him last January, including that discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated.  We are still tolerating discrimination.  The charter also commits to equal access for all but this is not being delivered on for people with disabilities at this time.  It further states that Ireland's most vulnerable people must be protected but this is not happening for disabled people.  In regard to the statement that the Government should ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities without delay, there are six weeks remaining of this year within which to do so.

I join with colleagues in welcoming the Minister to the House and I thank him for his remarks on the wide range of areas covered by his portfolio.<\/p> <p>Ireland's staging of the 2023 World Cup would offer a huge opportunity to, among other things, encourage increased participation in sport in this country.  I would like to focus my remarks today on adult participation in sports.  A recent report from the Irish Sports Monitor shows that the number of adults regularly participating in sport has dropped to its lowest level since reporting began in 2007.  Currently, 45% of adults participate in sport, which is a decrease of 2% since 2011.  This decline is largest among men and is strongest felt in the area of team sports.  In my own sport of rugby the fall-off rate in players once they reach 18 years of age is staggering.  Where once we saw clubs fielding seven or eight adult teams they are now lucky to field three teams.  There has been an understandable and worthwhile focus in recent years on increasing levels of activity and participation among children.  There must now be a similar push for increased adult involvement in organised sport.  The option of being an armchair sports fan is easier now than it has ever been, with 24-hour sports coverage from around the world on television and online.  This is robbing grassroots clubs of adult players, as well as the coaches and volunteers so vital to supporting younger generations.  Beyond the physical well-being of our adult population, the societal and mental health benefits of participating in organised sport, particularly team sports, is well documented.  Many of our leading sport organisations and elite athletes, such as Jack McGrath and Ashling Thompson, have been to the fore in recent mental health awareness campaigns.<\/p> <p>I call on the Minister to prioritise adult participation in organised sport, to engage with sporting bodies to address the obstacles to such participation and to, perhaps, use the next round of sports capital grants to help overcome these obstacles, be that the provision of modernised facilities, more artificial pitches or more floodlights.  I would also like to inquire about the status of the swimming pool fund and whether it will be reintroduced in the lifetime of this Government.  This is of particular interest to many adults and children in the Ballyogan area in particular, with which I know the Minister is familiar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#X00300","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome the Minister to the House.  Following publication yesterday of the rail report, the sub-plot and conversation in the media was around Dublin versus rural Ireland rather than the best use of scarce resources.  I will speak later about the DART underground.<\/p> <p>Within the Dublin region, tens of millions of euro accrued from the property tax are transferred into a central fund which also supports rural Ireland.  I have always supported that.  Almost 70% of all taxation is raised in the eastern region.  The DART system within the Dublin region is subvented to the tune of approximately 90 cent per journey.  When arguing for investment into a region or for development of road, rail or airport infrastructure, the generation of revenue to the State must be taken into consideration.  One rarely hears an argument against this type of investment from the citizens or politicians of a particular region.  We are obliged to ensure investment across the nation.  We have heard many arguments in this House for investment in particular regions and motorways.  I believe Galway airport closed because it became quicker to get to Galway via the new motorway, which rendered the airport economically unviable.  Similarly, Cork Airport is suffering because it now is easy to drive from the outskirts of Cork to Dublin Airport because of the investment in that motorway.  I often flew to Farranfore from Dublin Airport but because of the investment in the motorway network it is now far quicker for me to travel there by road.  It must be remembered that investment in roads and motorways can result in the closure of rural airports.  That is the reality.  In regard to Senator Mac Lochlainn's argument regarding investment in motorways, I spoke to a colleague of his who represents Donegal and he was of the view that it was important to get investment into the airport in Donegal before the motorway is built because the airport would not economically stack up if the motorway was built first.  We have to be very realistic.<\/p> <p>The Minister will be aware that in terms of capacity, the DART currently transports 23,700 passengers per hour in or around the Dublin region.  If the underground system was invested in capacity would increase to 73,300 passengers per hour.  It would also result in expanded use of the rail network within the Dublin region and thus reduced journey times to Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  It would also mean that the travel time to Galway in less than two hours and from Dublin to Cork within three hours would be achievable.  All of these things are important.  For what in my opinion is a small investment in comparison with the likely increase in passenger numbers this investment would be worthwhile.  When the Minister was a backbencher, he ran a huge campaign in relation to the tolling of the M50.  There is now a campaign to enlarge the M50.  The DART underground has the potential to eliminate all peak hour traffic journeys within the city.  In terms of investment, investment in the DART underground stacks up, as does metro north in the context of the expansion of Dublin Airport and a new terminal 3.  All of these projects are key infrastructural elements that will increase visitor numbers into Ireland.<\/p> <p>The Minister referred in his opening statement to the ten-minute DART.  I presume he was referring in that regard to an increased number of journeys under the current infrastructure such that there would be a DART every ten minutes on a regular basis.  The funding to improve the signalling to allow for a DART every ten minutes on the current infrastructure was withdrawn last year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Is the Minister saying that the funding to allow the upgrading of the signalling at all junctions along the DART line is being reinstated?<\/p><p>If we are really serious about public transport, why is there such a delay in replacing the three members to the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann board?  The Minister has been in place since May and has appointed nobody, while he has reappointed 16 people.<\/p><p>I totally agree that the road safety figures are going the wrong way and it is a serious concern.  When is the Minister going to make the appointments to the vacant positions in the Road Safety Authority?  These vacancies were shown on the Department's website at the beginning of this month.  When are the four members of the taxi advisory committee, which was in the news last week, going to be replaced?  The Minister mentioned his commitment to climate change.  Under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, from 13 December he will have a responsibility to report to this House and to the D&aacute;il on his adaptation plans in that regard.  While the 130 new buses are welcome, it also would be welcome if consideration was given to what fuel will be driving them.<\/p><p>The 9% VAT rate has been a huge success and the Minister supported it when it was introduced by the previous Government.  We need to look at how we adapt that.  We cannot set different VAT rates for different parts of the country but there is now certainly a shortage of hotel bedrooms in the Dublin area.  A gouging of prices is probably taking place, along with an exploitation of people who come to stay in Dublin, but the 9% VAT rate stays in place.  I ask the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues to look at a change in legislation to allow a bed tax to be introduced by local authorities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#X00400","speaker":"1417","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I ask the Senator to conclude as we are under pressure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#Y00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":278,"content":"<p>Each local authority around the country would have the option to introduce a bed tax to reinvest into our arts and cultural products that attract people.

I am one of the 50,000 residents whom the development will impact so it is an issue close to my own heart.  He said he was encouraging the DAA to continue to engage with local communities.  As he knows from several meetings that I and other public representatives have attended with him, the engagement has been nothing more than a box-ticking exercise and, in the future, engagement has to be meaningful.  Residents are starved of information and learn about the development through the media.  This has to change.<\/p> <p>We do not oppose the development of the runway and accept that it is going ahead but the third and fifth conditions set down by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which specifically refer to night-time flights, must be adhered to.  We need a commitment from the Government that it will not ignore, or allow the DAA to ignore, those conditions.  The impact of noise pollution on the communities around the airport cannot be underestimated.  Health implications such as depression, heart disease and obesity have been linked with noise pollution and a lack of sleep or broken sleep.  The people around the airport are experiencing these things at present.<\/p> <p>The development of the northern runway will have a devastating impact on regional airports, as outlined by Senator Humphreys.  The increase in air traffic at Dublin Airport in recent months and years is directly linked with a decrease in traffic in Cork and Shannon.  Senator O'Mahony spoke of the commitment to regional development and I ask the Senator to speak to his colleague and friend, the Taoiseach, about it to ensure the Government stands firm with the DAA and does not allow the third and fifth conditions of the grant of planning permission for the northern runway to be overruled, thereby increasing the traffic exponentially at Dublin Airport to the detriment of the regional airports.<\/p> <p>The infrastructure around the airport is very important and the M50 is at capacity.  The country roads around the airport are not suitable to cope with the impact the new runway will have.  Metro north needs to be looked at again and, while we have a commitment on a scaled-back version, we need to increase it considering that Fingal is the fastest-growing county in Ireland and on account of the traffic which will go through the airport as a result of the development of the northern runway.<\/p> <p>A small group of families are being bought out by the DAA in the development of the runway.  The Minister met them earlier this week, along with myself and other colleagues.  They need a fair price as they are losing their farms and their way of life.  Generations have grown up on the lands around the airport and they need meaningful engagement at this point.  Their community is being destroyed and generations of farming families are going to see a massive change in their way of life so the Minister should ensure they are looked after adequately. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#Y00600","speaker":"1376"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":282,"content":"<p>In regard to State airports, the Minister has spoken about a capacity review and the possibility of a third terminal at Dublin Airport.  Shannon Airport is operating under capacity.  In terms of balanced regional development, it would make more efficient use of natural resources to see how we could use Shannon Airport, which has the largest runway in Europe, pre-clearance and a good road network.  There is no reason people could not come to Shannon rather than Dublin.<\/p> <p>On the rail network review, I had a cursory look at the document.  I travel the Limerick to Dublin rail route quite often, which is also the Cork to Dublin line.  Some 35% of passengers go by that line but the mobile and broadband coverage are dire, something I did not see in the report.  If we are to encourage people to travel by rail in the modern world their phones cannot be dropping every two minutes but one cannot have a normal conversation by mobile phone on a train.  Broadband coverage is hit and miss - some days it works and some days it does not.  If those two issues were corrected it would encourage a lot more people to travel by rail and maybe the financial deficiencies which Irish Rail has would be significantly ameliorated.<\/p> <p>I was enthusiastic about the reopening of the initial planning process for the M20 motorway from Limerick to Cork and I welcome and give thanks for the fact that it is happening.  I understand that it is a leap of faith and will involve &euro;1 million, in conjunction with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, which briefed the transport committee this morning.  It will allow us, prior to the mid-term capital review, to look again at the work that was done when the project was suspended back in November 2011 and to look at the planning that was done in respect of the existing route.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We must use the nine months up to the mid-term capital review in an efficient manner.

It would be wonderful to have a proper road network to link all of these areas instead of bottlenecks.  Not all elements of the route are poor.  Everyone knows that the route to Buttevant is dire.  Many of my constituents in Limerick commute daily to Cork and there have been many fatalities on the existing N20 route.  I thank the Minister and commend him on granting approval to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to proceed with inhouse work on the initial planning phase to prepare a brief for consultants.  While approval has not been granted to the consultants as yet, efficient use will be made of the time available between now and the mid-term capital review.  The initiative will enable the Minister to make an informed decision on putting the route in place.  I feel strongly about this matter.  The initiative has been welcomed by people who live in the region.  I understand that the initiative does not grant approval for the route to go ahead but it allows due diligence to recommence.  In November 2011 the route had reached An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which was the penultimate or final stage.  A lot of that work can be used again and, thus, the cost of &euro;1 million will prove to be an efficient use of taxpayers' money.  I sincerely thank the Minister for allowing the TII, formerly known as the National Roads Authority, to proceed with inhouse work in advance of the mid-term capital review that is due to take place in 2017.     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#Y00700","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Before the Minister responds, I call on Senator Higgins and she has three minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#Z00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman and promise to be brisk.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

While value for money is an important part of the discussion on public transport, I urge the Minister to not allow value for money to cloud the fact that public transport is primarily an essential public service.  It is important that the public service subvention is not framed during the discussion as a subsidy to semi-State companies.  It should be framed as public investment in essential public infrastructure.  There must be wide recognition and monitoring of the benefits that may not appear on the balance books of those companies but in the participation and connectivity that they make possible.  It is vital that we highlight these aspects.  <\/p> <p>We need to consider the cost of non-investment in public transport.

In such cases we know that the cost is carried by individuals and communities.  There are also costs in terms of Ireland's likely failure to meet its climate change obligations with a real and concrete fine of an estimated &euro;6 billion reported in newspapers today.  I welcome the Minister's recognition of climate change mitigation.  I would like to know more about how he plans to engage with the national mitigation plan.  <\/p> <p>We must not simply monitor the take-up of various public transport services be they bus, rail or other means.  We must consider creative ways to promote the use of these services.  We must move beyond a simple business frame into a wider societal transformation plane that we need for public transport.  The rail review must have an ambitious scope.  It should not simply identify gaps or potential savings.  It must come up with ambitious proposals to expand rail and bus services.  In that regard, I encourage the Minister to ensure that we do not ever again make the kinds of mistakes that were made with the private contract that was issued for toll roads, which tied us into a countervening tendency.  <\/p> <p>My focus is on a key area that the Minister has not made a strong statement on and I urge him to do so today.  He has held consultations in various areas.  We have already had consultation on the national cycle policy framework of 2009.  What are the plans for the delivery and implementation of the framework?  Is it planned to appoint a national cycling officer?  How does the Minister propose to achieve the target of having 10% of all journeys to be on a bicycle in both urban and rural areas versus the fewer than 2% at the moment?  Will he set a spending target for cycling infrastructure for the National Transport Authority?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#Z00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I ask the Senator to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#Z00400","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":287,"content":"<p>We need infrastructure.

There are at least 40 vacancies in boards under the remit of my Department.  I have made reappointments, as referred to by Senator Boyhan, in the case of the RSA and in other boards where they are important such as, for example, in situations where someone is needed on an audit committee or somewhere like that.  I shall continue making such appointments.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->On State boards such as the Road Safety Authority and Irish Sports Council, I do not find the Public Appointments Service, PAS, system, as it currently operates, satisfactory.  That is the reason the appointments in question have not been made.  I will give a couple of examples which I also referred to at a committee meeting.  While it is fashionable to blame one's predecessor for everything, some of these vacancies were left by my predecessor.  I refer specifically to vacancies in the RSA, the Irish Sports Council and CIE.  I will explain how this was done to help Senators understand the reason I have not filled the relevant vacancies.<br\/><br\/>The relevant Department gives the Public Appointments Service a set a criteria for appointments to State boards.  The PAS meets and a committee is established consisting primarily of departmental officials.  This committee collects all the curricula vitae submitted in response to the position being advertised on the <i>publicjobs.ie<\/i>website.  It then selects from this group of applicants those individuals whose qualifications meet the criteria set down and submits these names to the Minister.<br\/><br\/>In the cases I have come across, not a single interview has been done.  Criteria were set out in the cases of the RSA and Irish Sports Council and in the latter case, they were so broad that virtually anyone in the country with an interest in sport would have qualified for the position.  The committee assesses the curricula vitae it receives for perhaps one day before submitting the names to the Minister.  Senator O'Mahony should forgive me if any of the figures I provide are wrong but in the case of the Irish Sports Council, there were two vacancies to be filled, the PAS committee submitted 34 names to the Minister and no interviews were conducted.  That is not a proper selection process.  This Irish Sports Council case was one of those I inherited.  As Minister, having looked through 34 names, how in the name of God am I meant to make a selection unless I interview all of the candidates, which I clearly cannot do?  The system is inadequate. <br\/><br\/>In the case of the RSA, to which the Senator referred, 21 names were submitted to the Minister for three vacancies.  The same principle applies.  I have made inquiries about this and as far as I know, not a single interview was held in that case.  In all cases in which the PAS makes selections for my Department - I believe this is also true of other Departments - the committee refuses to rank candidates and sends the applications to the Minister in paper format only.  I am not sure if the qualifications cited by candidates are verified before the Minister makes a choice.  The PAS replaced a system that may have been worse and basically involved the Minister appointing people without any form of siphoning or selection process.  It is absolutely wrong that I should take 34 names and select so-and-so and so-and-so on the basis of their curricula vitae.  There must be a more satisfactory way of doing these things and I am trying to devise one.  The reason is I realise there is a necessity in the case of semi-State and State agencies to have a variety of people with a variety of qualifications. <br\/><br\/>Incidentally, I do not believe that big boards make better boards.  The Road Safety Authority sought to increase the size of its board such that it would be larger than the board of AIB.  I do not see the point of a State agency having more people on its board than are on the board of one of the largest companies in the country. <br\/><br\/>We must not assume that boards need to have experts or persons with qualifications in every single aspect of the role of the company or agency in question in order that it can shadow executives.  That is the purpose of executives.  The board needs people with other qualifications as well, which is the reason the vacancies to which the Senator refers have not been filled.  <br\/><br\/>I have not left any agency or body with an inquorate board at any stage.  I have made reappointments to boards when recommendations have been made to keep them quorate.  However, there must be a better and more efficient way of doing this, one which does not result in a very cursory system of appointments.  <br\/><br\/>I will start by responding to Senator Ned O'Sullivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#Z02000","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I was about to ask the Minister to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#AA00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Some Senators have waited patiently for two hours to hear a response from the Minister.

Nobody has taken a less laid back attitude to sports capital grants than I have.  When I came into office it was highly doubtful that any sports capital grants would be allocated and none had been awarded the previous year.  As announced in the House and endorsed by me today, sports capital grants will be available and terms will be issued shortly.  The allocation will be open and generous because sports capital grants are a priority and I am aware of their value.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Sullivan also asked me to comment on hotel pricing in Dublin.  I agree that prices are too high.  I made a speech to one of the hotel groups recently in which I put them on notice that they are too high and that Dublin hotels were killing the goose that laid the golden egg.  The Senator is correct and I agree with him that Dublin hotels will have to watch out.<\/p> <p>On the issue of roads, a mid-term capital review has been launched and will be completed next year.  I hope many of the roads issues raised by Senators will be addressed in the review.  The sum of money provided for roads this year was not great.  As Senators are aware, it is difficult enough to maintain roads in a steady state, as it is known, and there is very little money available for this purpose.  Funding will accelerate in the coming years and I hope we will be able to produce some fairly good news for Senators in various places, as we have already done.  <\/p> <p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell raised the issue of the N20.  He has been annoyingly persistent on that issue and we have been able, eventually, to provide him with some comfort that the issue is being addressed.  The design and other preparatory work for the project are due to be done shortly.  The Senator got hold of that information either before I did or almost simultaneously and managed to spread the news all over Limerick yesterday.  That was not bad because it was certainly good news for him.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Senator Victor Boyhan referred to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the RSA.  I have answered that question.<\/p><p>On the national ports policy, I will not be frightened to make any decision.  If the relevant parties do not reach an agreement, I will be happy to make a decision.  That is a given; it is included in the legislation and I will do it, but it would be wrong for me to trample on the process since there is due diligence and negotiations are taking place.<\/p><p>On the rail review, there are absolutely no closures planned.  Even subject to political provocation from County Tipperary, I have no intention of closing any railway.  That is a matter that is being addressed through public consultation.  When those concerned return to me, decisions will have to be made, but the Government has absolutely issued no direction in that regard.  It has made no decisions whatsoever and I have no intention of engaging in any closure, certainly at the moment.  Let us see what comes from the consultation process.<\/p><p>A good point was made about the GAA and the Rugby World Cup.  We should all pay tribute to the GAA for what it has done and the contribution it has made.  I do not know the financial implications for it, but the historical significance to me of the fact that the GAA and the IRFU can work in tandem to this extent is fantastic.  It is a great tribute to the GAA that it is co-operating in this way.<\/p><p>I have nothing to add on the issue of scrambling bikes.  The Senator concerned will be familiar with what I said in the last Commencement debate on this issue during which I believe I indicated I would be willing to examine it in a new light.<\/p><p>I thank Senator John O'Mahony for acknowledging the difficulties in even keeping up with what was happening on the roads, particularly in his area.  With regard to aviation, he should note that Knock airport is in no particular danger.  It is very lucky in some ways because it has Ryanair operating from it.  The commitment of Ryanair, although sometimes doubted, means that the airport is used much more.  It deals with a fantastic number of passengers.  Neither my Department nor I have any intention of threatening the airports in counties Donegal and Kerry.  The Senator will be familiar with the fact that Waterford Airport is aggressively looking for a carrier so as to keep operating.  The suggestion there is an agenda to do something with the regional airports that would be difficult for the associated communities does not arise.<\/p><p>The Senator addressed the issue of ticketing governance and the Olympic Council of Ireland, OCI.  The public consultation process is starting tomorrow and governance is very high on the list in that regard and something in which many vested interests will have an interest.  On the OCI issue which was raised by several Members, I do not want to say very much.  I would love to say a lot about it, but, as everybody knows, I am constrained by the Moran inquiry.<\/p><p>I do not know whether someone is allowed to use props or visuals in this House, but Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn did so very well in pointing to the empty landscape.  It would not be right for me to hold out too much hope for the provision of a railway line to County Donegal.  That would be wrong.  However, I understand the issue the Senator has with roads, particularly the A5.  It is a very important issue.  County Donegal is a black spot and the A5 project has been delayed because of funding problems, but it will be the first item on my agenda at the meeting of the North&ndash;South Ministerial Council in Armagh on Friday.  I do not know whether that is any comfort to the Senator, but it was the first item on my agenda at the Cabinet meeting this morning.  I am to meet my ministerial counterpart at the North&ndash;South Ministerial Council meeting.  That Minister is, I believe, a member of the Senator's party.  The delay in advancing some of the North&ndash;South projects, particularly the A5 project, gives cause for concern.  I recognise what the Senator says about it and will do what I can at the meeting to accelerate progress.<\/p><p>It is welcome that Celtic Park is to be part of the bid for the Rugby World Cup.  Let me remind Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn of a couple of matters.  He said there was no air link between Dublin and Derry and that it would be wonderful if there were a better connection by the time the Rugby World Cup was held, especially if we were to win it in 2023.  I point out to the many people who are asking how we will do various things in the timeframe outlined that 2023 is seven years away.  There really is a tremendous opportunity, particularly with the mid-term capital review, to develop the infrastructure required if there are gaps, but there are far fewer than there were.  The Taoiseach says he will have a reshuffle which I suspect will take place before 2023.  As far as I am concerned, the infrastructure will be in place by the time in question.  I will do everything possible to make realistic commitments, if necessary, before the bid for the Rugby World Cup is finalised in November next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#AA02000","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":323,"content":"<p>We are approximately 13 minutes over time and the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, is waiting in the anteroom.

I thank Members for facilitating the debate on this important Bill and the commitment I understand they have made to try to take Committee and Report Stages next week.  The timeline for the legislation is important as we are anxious to complete it before the end of the year.  I really appreciate the facilitation and hope we can work through some of the issues that will be raised.<\/p> <p>As I think we can all agree, the current housing supply shortage is one of the most urgent and pressing challenges faced by the Government and the country as a whole.  It has an impact on all forms of housing tenure, be it social, private or private rental.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This housing supply shortage has consequential knock-on impacts for house prices and rents, affecting thousands of individuals and households throughout the country who are in rented accommodation or who are trying to purchase homes, with knock-on impacts on their cost of living and further impacts on wage increase demands.  The housing shortage also impacts on our ability to attract inward investment for the purpose of expanding our economy, so overall it has very real and significant impacts for society and individual families with which everybody in this Chamber is familiar, as well as our economy in general.<\/p><p>To put this in context, we are at present only building between 12,000 and 13,000 new housing units per year when we should be building upwards of 25,000 units to meet the demand that prevails.  It is not an overstatement to say that this level of under-supply is a crisis situation which, as I have stated, has significant impacts on people in all walks of life.  Accordingly, it is imperative that every possible effort is made to address it as urgently as we can to help better control house prices and rental cost increases.  The Government's commitment to ending the housing shortage and tackling homelessness is clearly evidenced and underpinned in the Government's strategy, Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, two pillars of which are about building more homes and making our permitting and approvals systems more efficient and improving the rental sector.  In this regard, the action plan includes a number of innovative legislative measures to rapidly increase housing supply and reinforce the rental sector.  The main purpose of the Bill which we are discussing today is to give early effect to and underpin these measures, which include: the introduction of temporary fast-track planning arrangements in respect of large-scale housing developments; streamlining the timelines for presenting and considering local authority own development proposals through the Part 8 processes, including social housing proposals; providing for further limited extensions of duration of planning permissions for specified housing proposals; introducing certain legislative amendments to enhance the functioning of the private rented sector; and facilitating higher education institutes to borrow moneys from the Housing Finance Agency for the purposes of financing student accommodation provision.<\/p><p>The Bill also proposes to address a number of other urgent measures which are unrelated to the Rebuilding Ireland action plan and housing supply, namely, the introduction of new environmental impact assessment screening arrangements in respect of certain development works, including flood-related works, and enabling the transfer of moneys from the local government fund to the Exchequer in 2016, as envisaged in the recently-published Estimates.  A legislative provision is required to allow this transfer arrangement each year.  The environmental impact assessment element of this legislation followed a conversation with the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney, on ensuring we could progress flood relief programmes in a more timely manner than we have been able to do in the past.  This maintains the integrity of the system but streamlines the decision-making process, which is what we are trying to do in respect of planning too.<\/p><p>Moving on to the contents and structure of the Bill, it contains 39 sections over five parts, to which I will now turn in more detail.  Part 1, covering sections 1 and 2, contains the normal standard provisions dealing with the Title, collective citations, definitions and commencement.  Part 2 comprises three chapters relating to amendments to the Planning and Development Act 2000 and is a substantial element of the Bill.  Chapter 1, covering sections 3 to 19, deals with strategic housing developments and proposes the introduction, for a limited time period, of new streamlined planning processes in respect of large-scale housing developments, defined as those comprising 100 housing units or more or 200 or more student accommodation bed spaces, allowing the making of planning applications for such developments directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The primary provisions are contained in sections 3 to 12, with the supporting provisions for this temporary measure contained in sections 13 to 19.<\/p><p>Rather than go through each section individually, I will instead outline the key elements of the provisions.  The new fast-track planning procedures will apply for an initial period of three years - until the end of 2019 - with the possibility to extend that period by a further two years to coincide with the timeframe of Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p><p>Under the new procedures, An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be required to complete pre-planning application consultations regarding proposed developments with the concerned developers and the relevant local authority within a maximum period of nine weeks.  It subsequently will be required to make a final determination in respect of planning applications for concerned developments within 16 weeks of receipt of the planning application.  This will potentially result in planning decisions for concerned large developments within 25 weeks of commencement of the pre-application consultation process, as against the current two-stage planning process which can, in certain circumstances, take up to 18 to 24 months from initial design stage to securing ultimate approval.<\/p><p>I will give a practical example of why this is necessary.  There have been 15 applications for housing developments of more than 100 units submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la this year and the average length of time it has taken, from pre-planning consultation through to getting a decision for those 15 applications, is 78 weeks.  We are proposing to change that but also to involve local authorities and councillors in the pre-planning consultation.  Perhaps we can tease the issues out here today because I know there are some concerns over how we can maintain a strong role for local authorities.  I stress that this will be on land that has been zoned for housing and An Bord Plean&aacute;la is required to ensure that its decisions are consistent with that.  For the first time, statutory timelines will be in place to ensure that developers and providers of finance will have some certainty, as will local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, with a nine-week pre-planning consultation process and a 16-week assessment and potential approval process for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The big change is for developers rather than anybody else because the quality of their applications and of the work that will be required by them before they enter the formal pre-planning consultation will be a lot higher than it is at the moment.  Those Members who have been in local authorities and who have worked with them know that poor applications often come in, followed by a long drawn-out process in preparation for a formal planning application with county council engineers, architects and designers to bang the application into shape before it goes to a formal application process with the local authority.  This can take months and months.  A lot of that early work needs to be done in a much more professional way and this will mean that the best developers will have a system that supports them.<\/p><p>To ensure that the board has capacity to manage the flow of proposals, a dedicated strategic housing division will be established in the board with additional dedicated technical and administrative support resources to conduct the pre-planning consultation arrangements and make determinations on planning applications in respect of such strategic housing developments.  I had quite a long meeting with An Bord Plean&aacute;la yesterday to understand what it needs.<\/p><p>I also make the following points on the proposed new fast-track planning procedures.  First, the vast majority of large housing development proposals currently end up being appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la resulting, as I have indicated, in decision timelines of up to two years before the granting of final planning permission.  This, in my view, is much too long in the current climate when large volumes of housing supply are urgently required to address the shortage situation in the right areas.  This is the key thing - we are not going to promote large-scale housing development in parts of the country where it is not viable, which was the mistake that was made in the past.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The reality is house prices will not allow it.<br\/><br\/>Planning applications to the board in respect of these housing developments will be confined to lands already zoned for residential purposes by the local elected members in local development plans.  In addition, public participation will remain a fundamental part of the process.  In this regard, my Department has obtained legal advice from the Attorney General that the proposed arrangements are fully compliant with the requirements of the Aarhus Convention, the EU directive on public participation in environmental decision-making, and the environmental impact assessment directive.<br\/><br\/>The procedures for a new direct application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in respect of large housing developments are not entirely new.  They are modelled on the existing arrangements which have operated in respect of strategic infrastructure developments since 2006.  Accordingly, they are well tested.  Ultimately, as I have indicated, the new streamlining procedures are intended to provide greater certainty for developers for the timelines for decision making, while also facilitating the earlier provision of much needed housing supply and helping to address the current housing supply shortage situation.<br\/><br\/>Chapter 2 of Part 2, covering sections 20 and 21, proposes to introduce new screening arrangements for the conducting of environmental impact assessments, EIAs, in respect of certain types of works, including emergency flood relief works with the aim of further streamlining the process for the undertaking of such types of works.  Some Members come from towns which have been waiting for the necessary flood protections and relief works to be put in place.  Significant delays can be encountered in the undertaking of flood-related works having regard to the EIA requirements in the planning system.  In this regard, flood-related works have a relatively low threshold for EIA purposes and for planning permission purposes.  EIAs are required for most flood-related works, even though many of the proposed works do not have any environmental impacts.<br\/><br\/>The introduction of the new EIA screening arrangements will enable planning authorities to determine if an EIA is required for specific proposed works with the screening decision having to be made within a maximum of four weeks.  If an EIA is screened in, a full EIA will be required in respect of the proposed works, while planning permission will also be required.  However, if an EIA is screened out by virtue of no significant environmental impacts being anticipated arising from the undertaking of the proposed works, no EIA will be required.  Planning permission will also not be required if the proposed works are below the exempted development thresholds.  These new provisions should ultimately reduce the number of EIAs having to be undertaken in respect of flood works, thereby generally speeding up the process.<br\/><br\/>Chapter 3, covering sections 22 and 23, relates to two further amendments to the Planning and Development Act.  Section 22 provides that a further extension of duration of permission may be granted by a planning authority in case of a housing development comprising 20 houses or more, where the authority considers that a further extension is necessary to enable the development to be completed.  This will remove the requirement to go through the planning process again and expedite the completion of the housing developments in question.  Many medium-sized housing developments did not move ahead because house prices collapsed and the viability of building was not there for the past nine years.  As a result of that freeze period, planning permissions are now running out.  Rather than having to go through a long application process again, if it is consistent with the local area plan, then those zoned lands would progress.  If a chief executive of a local authority is happy with that, there is a facility now to automatically provide for a second renewal, a provision not currently provided for in law.<br\/><br\/>Section 23 relates to new streamlined procedures to be followed by local authorities under section 179 of the Planning and Development Act and Part 8 of the planning regulations under the Part 8 process relating to the bringing forward of local authority own development proposals, including social housing, local roads, fire stations, libraries, etc.  Most local authority own development proposals are generally approved by the elected members fairly quickly.  However, on occasion some delays can be encountered with social housing projects arising from local opposition.  Under the current provisions, no maximum timeframe is set for deciding on local authority own development proposals under the Part 8 process.  This is a major cause of the delays encountered in some, but not all, circumstances.<br\/><br\/>Consequently, the Bill proposes several amendments to the existing section 179 provisions, including the setting of a maximum timeframe of 20 weeks for the determination of local authority own development proposals by the elected members, thereby providing greater certainty in the progression of such development proposals, including the easier delivery of social housing, in particular.  There was much discussion before this section was put together.  Local authority members were concerned that there was a danger that they might be taken out of the process.  We have ensured they are the ones who vote this through.  We have introduced a timeline by which the process has to happen.  Essentially, this puts some pressure on a chief executive of a local authority and his or her team to be able to put the proposals, along with any amendments, to councillors in a timely manner.  Again, it is about having certainty around timescale.  When there is an awkward planning application through a Part 8 process and because of local political considerations, the matter gets put off.  We have to find a way to make decisions and move on with projects which we need to make happen.<br\/><br\/>Part 3, covering sections 24 to 37, inclusive, and the associated Schedule, relates to the rental sector and provides for amendments to the Residential Tenancies Acts.  We are all aware of the acute pressures in the rental market.  We had a useful and informative debate in this House last month on the pressures on rents in particular.  These pressures are driven by several factors, including rising demand, a lack of supply and the high costs that indebted landlords face in servicing their loans.  The problems in the rental sector are one of the most significant issues facing us today and an absolute priority for me.  That being said, there is no doubt that the problems in the rental sector are part of a larger problem.<br\/><br\/>Ireland is in the midst of a housing crisis.  The problems caused by high rents reflect, and are reflected in, the other issues facing the housing market.  There are not enough homes for first-time buyers, increased demand for social housing and unacceptable levels of homelessness.  While many factors contribute to these problems, the one factor common to all of them is the prolonged and chronic lack of supply of new houses.<br\/><br\/>The Bill implements the commitment in pillar 4 of Rebuilding Ireland to bring forward legislation to amend the Residential Tenancies Acts for early enactment.  One of the most significant proposals to be introduced in the Bill is to be found in section 30.  It provides that where a landlord proposes to sell 20 or more units within a single multi-unit development at the same time, the sale will be subject to the existing tenants remaining <i>in situ<\/i>.  The purpose of this amendment is to prevent a future recurrence of situations where large numbers of residents in a single development have had their tenancies terminated simultaneously.<br\/><br\/>Section 31 further improves security of tenure for tenants by providing for the abolition of a landlord's right during the first six months of a further Part 4 tenancy to terminate that tenancy for no stated ground.  This is an important amendment and one that has been welcomed both by those working with tenants and those working to prevent homelessness.<br\/><br\/>Sections 33 to 37, inclusive, provide for several other early actions which will enhance the Residential Tenancies Board's enforcement and dispute resolution powers, including accelerated dispute resolution timeframes.  We cannot have a situation where we have a falling out between a landlord and a tenant, whether it is non-payment of rent or some other issue, that goes on for months.  The powers and mechanisms have to be available to the Residential Tenancies Board to be able to act on that, to get to the bottom of the issue and to make a determination consistent with law.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is what we are doing here.  The provision of the Bill, as committed to in Rebuilding Ireland, will be supplemented by a new rental strategy which I intend to launch next month with a view to delivering a mature and stable rental sector, providing a balance between the rights and responsibilities of both landlords and tenants.  I know both are under pressure in many cases at present.  Many families who find themselves homeless have been pushed out of the market because of those pressures.  The provision in the Bill is a fundamental part of this process but it is only a part of the process.  I hope I will be returning to the Seanad to debate that rental strategy before the end of the year.<br\/><br\/>Part 4 of the Bill, covering section 38, gives effect to action 4.9 of Rebuilding Ireland, to amend the Housing Finance Agency Act 1981 to enable the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, to provide low-cost finance to higher education institutes for the purpose of providing student accommodation.  <br\/><br\/>In addition, and as the new initiative identified in Rebuilding Ireland, the Housing Agency is to be provided with capital funding of &euro;70 million with the specific focus of acquiring properties from financial institutions for social housing nationally, thereby increasing social housing provision.  At present the Housing Agency is talking to banks primarily with a view to acquiring properties that are vacant so that they can get them into the market faster in order to alleviate some of the pressures on the social housing provision and supply.  That &euro;70 million is effectively seed capital and the agency should be able to acquire over time about 1,200 homes in this category.  We may go beyond that, but that is the target initially.  As a support mechanism towards giving effect to action 2.9 of Rebuilding Ireland, provision is being made for the HFA to lend to the Housing Agency for this purpose, subject to obtaining the relevant ministerial consent and compliance with the prevailing fiscal rules.  In other words, we cannot simply spend money and ignore it in the context of our overall expenditure ceilings.  We must talk to the Department of Finance in that regard.<br\/><br\/>Part 5 of the Bill, comprising section 39, is aimed at enabling me, as Minister<b><\/b>for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to make the required payment to a maximum amount of &euro;420 million from the local government fund to the Exchequer, as envisaged in the Revised Estimates volume in 2016.  It is necessary to provide for the legislative underpinning of this proposed transfer of funding to the Exchequer by amending section 6 of the Local Government Act 1998.<br\/><br\/>I think Members will agree that this Bill contains a number of fundamental and important legislative measures emanating from the Government's Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness.  We have a great deal of debate on that, both in committee and outside it.  Specifically the two pillars relating to building more homes and making our permitting and approval systems more efficient and improving the private rental sector.  As I have already outlined, these are priority matters for Government and indeed for all of us.<br\/><br\/>I look forward to the contributions from Senators in debating the detail of this Bill.  I look forward to continuing the debate into next week so that we can bring it to the D&aacute;il and enact it very early in the new year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#BB01200","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I call Senator Murnane O'Connor, who has eight minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#EE00200","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for introducing a good Bill.  All Members recognise the need for change.  The provision of the fast-track planning for developments of more than 100 housing units in which the application will be made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la will boost supply.  In the long term it will create jobs for builders, who did not have that much work in the past few years.  However, in the past when large housing developments were appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la it took up to two years for a decision.  The decision time definitely needs to be addressed.  It is important that the proposed changes in the legislation do not impact on the democratic role of councillors in preparing area development plans and county development plans.<\/p><p>I went to a meeting of my local authority on Monday.  The issue of fast-track planning for developments of 100 houses was raised, but councillors were not aware that this provision is for a two-year period up to 31 December 2019.  The Carlow councillors were not aware of the provisions and required further information.  I think the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government should have contacted every local authority.  It is more than ten years since Carlow County Council had a builder build more than 100 houses.  This provision is welcome, especially in the bigger cities such as Dublin, but the small rural counties, such as Carlow and its neighbouring counties, we would seldom have a developer building 100 houses in the county.  Has the Minister considered making provision for the smaller counties?  I would love it if a developer proposed to build more than 100 houses and I know that Carlow County Council would be delighted also, but it is more than ten years since we have had building on this scale.  However, I request the Minister to look again at this provision as it needs to be tailored for small counties.<\/p><p>In my view the main reason for the hold up in the supply of social housing is with the Department.  The Department is not approving social housing projects, voluntary housing projects or local authority housing.  I remember the directive from the Department to dezone lands which had been zoned for housing.  That was fine at the time eight years ago as there was a great deal of land zoned for housing, but again we are in a crisis and I believe part of the plan should be to allow local authorities to take the initiative on rezoning the land that was dezoned.  Some of this dezoned land belongs to the local authorities.  The Minister needs to look at these issues in his plan.<\/p><p>The Minister referred to environmental impact assessment, EIA, screening arrangements in respect of certain development works, including flood related works.  As someone who has lived in an area prone to flooding for years, I know this is very important.  Approximately eight years ago, the Department provided &euro;22 million for the Carlow flood relief scheme.  People have had a whole new life since the work was done as previously we had massive flooding in Carlow every year.  This provision in the Bill is a must for anybody affected by flooding.  I have seen elderly people cry because every year their house had been flooded from the River Barrow.  This provision in the Bill is welcome and is a very good initiative.<\/p><p>The Bill proposed to amend a section of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  I understand that in cases where a landlord proposes to sell 20 or more units within a single multi-unit development at the same time, the sale will be subject to the existing tenants remaining <i>in situ<\/i>.  However, this will not apply if the landlord can show that the market price of the dwelling, subject to the tenant remaining, is more than 20% below the price that he or she would receive if the dwelling was vacant.  One can see this provision is based on the pattern in Dublin.  If one looks at multi-unit developments in Carlow, one does not have development of 20 plus units.  The provisions of the section need to take account of the developments in the smaller counties.  I believe that the provision should refer to five units and not 20 or more units.<\/p><p>Like all councillors and Senators, I would have dealings with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  The enforcement of housing standards in rented accommodation is an issue.  The local authorities do not have the staff to cover enforcement any more.  Unless the Minister puts something in place so that enforcement officers can assess properties every six months or every year, it will not work.  Some of the rented accommodation that people have to live in is not fit for humans.  I have visited these properties, so I highlight this as an issue the Minister will have to look at. <\/p><p>A tenancy is a four-year phase, but I think the Minister needs to be lenient.  If people got some leeway on that they would stay longer.  I definitely agree with the Minister's point that the landlords and local authorities must work together to ensure that the tenant has the proper standard of accommodation and has rights, like the landlord.  It is most important that everybody works together. <\/p><p>I believe the Government should develop a new borrowing framework for the institutes of technology to fund infrastructural development, including student accommodation and campus facilities.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The University Act 1997 contains a provision for universities to borrow within a framework agreed with the Higher Education Authority.<\/p><p>I have a love of local authorities.  There are two great colleges in Carlow, Carlow Institute of technology and St. Patrick's.  People cannot find rental accommodation because everything is gone.  Once there are third level institutes and colleges, naturally landlords will get a better price.  Students are inclined to get first leniency.  There is now a crisis and many people attend a homeless clinic every Wednesday but we cannot find accommodation for them.<\/p><p>I am glad the Minister referred to HAP.  It is a good scheme, but until the rental market is sorted out in terms of how much people can pay or what caps will be in place, it will not work.  He referred to extra staffing.  In the local authority in Carlow, 120 staff have been lost.  The Minister has provided five extra staff.  There are two new engineers, a new technician and two administrative staff.  However, we are down over 100 staff.  I ask the Minister to try to provide extra staff to local authorities.  It is a must.  The morale of staff is being affected.  Everybody is doing his or her best and I have to compliment all local authority staff.  At the end of the day, when one is under pressure it is hard work.<\/p><p>I refer to the housing purchase loan scheme.  It has not been discussed, but it is a major issue.  Most people who come to my clinics are falling between the nets.  They are not eligible for local authority housing lists because there are only 27,500, something which needs to be addressed, but also cannot get a mortgage.  They are coming to local authorities in Carlow for mortgages.  Those affected include prison officers and teachers.  Can the Minister promote mortgages from local authorities and once again give people the chance to buy a house so that if they do not get a loan from a bank or building society, they will qualify for local authority loans?<\/p><p>Will the Minister put a scheme in place to address people who are falling through the net, cannot get onto local authority housing lists and are paying rent of &euro;800 or &euro;1,000 a month?  They are asking me whether they can get local authority loans in order to buy houses.  I know the Minister will address these issues and I thank him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#EE00300","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and genuinely wish him well with the Bill to which I want to confine my remarks.

I have spoken to approximately 45 councillors around the country, so I know the level of engagement the Minister has had.  He has heard the concerns and reservations of representatives.  The Minister's Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness: Rebuilding Ireland is a very comprehensive document.  He has a target of 47,000 houses and has set his own timelines and dates.  There are five pillars and 84 key objectives.  The committee, which is working well, examined the document, and I want to salute Senator Maria Bailey, the team and all the support staff.  It is a positive forum.  I am very much behind the Minister and his policies, and I am happy to play my part.<\/p> <p>We also have to deal with some realities.  It has been confirmed by the Minister's officials that there are over 27,000 live planning applications in Dublin alone.  We need to remember that the Minister's objective is 47,000 within the lifetime of the plan.

I am delighted he will confirm that today because one of my key objectives was to elicit from him whether people can transfer from a strategic development zone to the fast-tracking process.<\/p> <p>There are 31 local authorities.  I am sympathetic to the argument that this is anti-democratic, in breach of the Aarhus Convention in terms of public engagement and has various constitutional concerns.  Local government is enshrined in the Constitution.  The Minister is Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, and I would expect him to strengthen the role of local government, devolve more power from central government to local government and support councillors and the executive, which is one arm of local government.  Councillors have an elected mandate and are another arm of local government.  Councillors have told me that more power has been taken away from them.<\/p> <p>The Minister will correctly argue that councillors do not have many planning functions, but they do.  They have more than one would think.  They are involved in the county development plan process, local area plans and strategic development zones.<\/p> <p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la is contravening development.  I will not cite a particular case, but in south county Dublin two weeks ago it overturned the key objectives of an area plan.  It has the right to do so, which the Minister's officials will confirm.  Council officials can, in certain circumstances, contravene a county development plan.  The Minister needs to strengthen the rules.  No board should be able to contravene a county development plan.  I want the Minister to bring forward legislation on that.<\/p> <p>I will table a number of amendments next week.  I have prepared them and to be helpful, I will try to send them to the Minister's office as quickly as possible.  They include strengthening democracy for councillors.  There is no reference to statutory engagement with councillors or a statutory process in the Bill.<\/p> <p>The Minister proposed that there would be a fast-track process to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There will be no appeal system.  The citizen is being cut out of the process.  At least in the current system, one can pay a &euro;20 fee - we might discuss fees later - and have a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Third party appeals are being dropped.  No doubt the Minister will tell me there can be a judicial review of matters, but that costs a lot of money.  We are talking about engagement.<\/p> <p>A very substantial judgement from Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness refers to the role of the county development plan as a contract with the people.  This ruling has never been undermined or challenged - it is case law.  It refers to a contract with the people in regard to county development plans.  I printed off 35 cases on challenges to county development yesterday, all of which referred to the same principle, namely, that the county development plan is a very powerful instrument.  People have a legitimate expectation and right to know how their communities are being planned and developed.  I do not know whether the Minister's officials will address my concern.<\/p> <p>We know there are over 4,000 people in emergency accommodation in the State.  It is not something of which we should be proud and we need to address the problem.  Winter is upon us.  We have had a very mild winter this year.  I do not want to be Dublin-centric, but Dublin is a key problem.  Dublin City Council, according to the Minister when I last spoke to him at a meeting, is supposed to deliver three new projects before Christmas, comprising 200 units.  The Minister might share progress on that.  There is one month to go.<\/p> <p>We want transparency and to open up government.  The Minister, through the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, launched an open up government dialogue, which is on the Government's website.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am not sure if this is the answer.<\/p><p>The Minister spoke about a sunset clause of three or five years at most.  Is he serious about this?  Is he prepared, for example, to give an undertaking that it will be set at three years rather than five, given that it is a temporary measure?  If 47,000 housing units are built within three years, will he wind down the measure or continue to crank it up?  While I fully respect that he is entitled to maintain the measure, we must keep decisions in local communities.<\/p><p>Planners in local authorities are asking whether staff will be seconded to the board.  Will the Minister address that issue?  The public service recruitment embargo has caused a decline in the number of local authority staff and some councils no longer deal with pre-planning applications.  I have received tonnes of mail from developers who cannot secure pre-planning meetings with local authorities.  The Minister knows that the issue is one of resources because his Department has written to the chief executives of local authorities asking them to address the problem and speed up the process, but local authorities need money to recruit staff.<\/p><p>While it is great that the Minister proposes to fast-track housing construction, my concern is that the process appears to lack transparency and is anti-democratic and that the legislation does not enshrine statutory rights for members of local authorities who are elected by communities to run local authorities in conjunction with the executive.  Will the Minister meet us halfway by setting out how he proposes to strengthen the role of local authority members?  That is the weakness of the legislation.  It is easy for me to speak about anti-democratic decisions, a lack of engagement, breaches of the Aarhus Convention and the famous High Court case.  While I like the Minister which helps in politics, support him in principle and do not doubt his integrity or commitment, he has been a member of the Government for the past five years.  As such, none of this is new and the problem did not fall from the sky.  Will he meet us halfway by addressing the democratic deficit that is of concern to local councillors?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#FF00600","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I am sure the Minister appreciates the Senator's endorsement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#GG00200","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":348,"content":"<p>We also like Senator Victor Boyhan and enjoy his contributions which are positive and proactive, as are those of many other Senators.<\/p><p>It is important that we continue the debate on housing because it is the number one issue in the country.  I acknowledge the presence of the Minister in the Seanad.  He has come to the House on a number of occasions and is here again to afford the Seanad the privilege of commencing this important legislation.  This debate gives us all an opportunity to express our views on behalf of those we represent, whether we agree or disagree with the Bill.  I look forward to further engagement with colleagues and the contributions of other speakers.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that the Minister has made housing a priority.  This is reflected not only in words, as set out in the Rebuilding Ireland programme the Minister announced and published, but also in the budget allocation provided for the various housing initiatives to motivate and kick-start social and private housing nationwide.  We all agree that there is a housing crisis which has not come as a surprise, given the economic crash of unprecedented proportions we experienced.  It also requires unprecedented responses and emergency interventions and legislation is sometimes required to make such interventions effective.  <\/p><p>The Bill is timely.  I note the Minister's comment that the time required to pass it will impact on many of the large-scale housing schemes we badly need in larger urban areas.  The programme sets high targets for increasing the number of housing units.  The Government wants to double housing construction and achieve a target of at least 25,000 new housing units per annum by 2020.  For want of a better expression, we cannot allow the grass to grow under our feet.  We all know what the problems are and are all good at advising others on them.  They came about because we have a dysfunctional housing market, builders went bust and barriers were erected to prevent access to credit.  An urgent and quick response is needed.  I acknowledge that the legislation is an urgent response to fast-track large-scale housing in areas where it is most urgently needed, namely, the larger cities, primarily Dublin and Cork, as well as some other larger urban centres.  Having listened to Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor, as a Senator from Waterford, I sympathise with much of what she said.  Nevertheless, the current planning process is sufficient to deal with housing provision in rural areas and smaller urban centres.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand the legislation is focused on areas where there is significant pressure and high demand for housing.  While I do not doubt that there is demand for housing in Carlow, Waterford and other areas, the focus of the Bill is on areas where the pressure on housing is intense and affects not only those who do not have a house and those on the housing list but also the wider economy.  I refer, for example, to the need to provide student accommodation, family homes and apartments for people who work in the cities.  <\/p><p>The viability and cost of housing, from concept through design to construction, are also issues that need to be addressed.  The Housing Agency is working on a programme to make comparisons and identify where efficiencies can be built into the process.  <\/p><p>The Bill impinges on a number of important areas, the most notable of which is, as Senator Victor Boyhan noted, the streamlining of large-scale housing.  The Minister has noted that the Bill makes an amendment to the Residential Tenancies Act to provide that the sale of estates of more than 20 units will be made conditional on tenants remaining <i>in situ<\/i>following purchase.  This is an important change which will help to alleviate some of the pressures in the housing market. <\/p><p>I also welcome some of the measures on the Housing Finance Agency which will be allowed to provide loans for higher education institutions, subject to scrutiny.  This is providing another leg of the stool, one which will enable the institutions in question which know best what the accommodation needs of students are to put in place plans and programmes to construct student accommodation.  This measure will also help to alleviate the problem.  <\/p><p>Local authority members are close to people on the ground because they deal daily with issues raised by constituents related to housing and other matters.  I acknowledge the primacy of the local area and county development plans which are the blueprint for all developments.  Local authority members have a reserved function in this area which will not change under the legislation.  As the Minister indicated, it is unlikely that any application will be considered unless it applies to zoned lands.  By adopting a local area plan or a country development plan, local authority members are making their intentions clear in respect of housing developments in their respective local areas. <\/p><p>The legislation provides that local authorities are required to give an opinion to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on applications.  I ask the Minister to give some assurance that local authority members will be involved in this process, either by receiving a report on the opinion from the chief executive or director of planning or by having an opportunity to express a view on it.  This would alleviate some of the concerns expressed by councillors.  The Minister has met many councillors and representatives of the Association of Irish Local Government to discuss the legislation and other housing matters.  I ask that some linkage be made between local councillors and the opinion submitted by the executive of the local authority to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is important to keep the democratically elected members of local authorities in the loop.<\/p><p>If passed, the Bill will assist developers in fast-tracking large-scale housing projects.  On the other side of the coin, if developers secure permission through this process, they should be required to commence construction within a specified period.  I am aware that interventions such as the imposition of a vacant sites levy are being made to prevent land hoarding and stop people from sitting on planning permissions in the hope prices will rise.  There is a legitimate concern that if developers take advantage of the fast-tracking process, the purpose of which is to benefit society through the provision of housing, they should be required to commence the relevant schemes within a certain timeframe.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paudie Coffey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It will give further reassurance in the best interests of society rather than in the best interests of the developer.<\/p><p>Concerns have been expressed to me over the review process.  If somebody objects to a development obviously they go through the normal channels and object to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but if a decision is to be appealed it is by judicial review.  A simple layman's guide should be provided for any member of the public who may want to proceed to judicial review so that they do not feel that just because it has to go through the courts process they are being excluded from bringing what they might feel is a genuine appeal to a further hearing.  Some assistance is required to show the way for people who may wish to bring a legitimate appeal through the court.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill, which contains a sunset clause limiting the time.  It is an emergency period of time and we need emergency responses.<\/p><p>I was involved in this when I was a Minister of State in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I welcome the consent process around the EIA screening where floods happen.  When flooding happens on a person's property, the amount of bureaucracy in terms of permits, waste licences and planning permission before they can actually repair a riverbank excludes people from carrying out essential works.  This process will fast-track a consent process that has buy-in from all the stakeholders and give people permission to put those banks back in place to protect their properties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#GG00300","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Cuirim c&eacute;ad f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  Nuair a buna&iacute;odh an Rialtas seo, gheall s&eacute; go nd&iacute;reodh s&eacute; ar gh&eacute;arch&eacute;im na tith&iacute;ochta a r&eacute;iteach.

Despite the Bill's laudable aims we believe that it represents a missed opportunity.  To fix a broken housing sector we need to be bold.  Increasing the supply of housing by tampering with the planning system and enhancing the functioning of the private rented sector, by providing a solution for 0.56% of landlords and an even smaller amount of tenants, will not do the trick.<\/p><p>Some of the smaller provisions are welcome.  For example, Part 4 which allows universities to access Housing Finance Agency funds for student accommodation is a sensible development.  Student accommodation is sorely needed in places like Galway and hopefully this measure will lead to more purpose-built student accommodation in the county.  However, I hope that will be in mixed developments within the fabric of the city rather than in ghettoised areas.  We also welcome the measures contained in Part 2, Chapter 3, which streamline the timelines for presenting and considering local authority development proposals through the Part 8 processes.<\/p><p>I am concerned about the provision on strategic housing developments in Part 2.  The Bill proposes to introduce a fast-track planning procedure for residential developments of 100 units or more and large-scale student accommodation projects with 200 or more bed spaces.  The Bill also places a statutory requirement on An Bord Plean&aacute;la to report back in 16 weeks.<\/p><p>One of the Minister's major urban housing delivery sites announced last Friday is in Ardaun in Galway city.  While I welcome the announcement, at present it is just an announcement.  C&eacute; gur gcuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an fh&oacute;gra seo, n&iacute;l ann ach f&oacute;gra go dt&iacute; seo.  An rud is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; faoi gh&eacute;archeim na tith&iacute;ochta n&aacute; nach mbeidh f&oacute;gra&iacute; agus pleananna ann ach ruda&iacute; a dh&eacute;anfaidh an gh&eacute;arch&eacute;im a leigheas.  We need to move forward from the announcement stage to actual bricks and mortar.<\/p><p>The problem with this provision is that the Government appears to be tampering with planning law in order to facilitate a few developments.  The Minister has not provided a sufficient evidence base for this proposal, nor has he demonstrated that the move will not undermine good planning and further alienate communities from the planning process.  Sinn F&eacute;in is not convinced that better solutions were not considered, such as facilitating greater use of pre-planning engagement with local communities.  I am not convinced that planning delays are the main reason for housing projects being held up.<\/p><p>My main criticism of the Bill is saved for the lacklustre amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, contained in Part 3.  We believe the measures in this section do not go far enough and we have stated categorically many times that the Minister missed an opportunity to amend the Bill and insert rent certainty provisions.  The provisions that are contained in the Bill are weak.<\/p><p>The Tyrellstown amendment, a proposal to strengthen tenants' rights in developments of more than 20 units, is weak.  The measure only covers 0.56% of landlords and a tiny percentage of rental tenants.  The overwhelming majority of those living in the private rented sector will not benefit from this change.  This means that those families at risk of homelessness because of buy-to-let properties being repossessed by the banks will continue to be at risk of homelessness.  The sale of any rented property should not lead to the termination of a tenancy.  Section 34 of the Residential Tenancies Act should be reviewed to remove sale as a justification for the termination of a tenancy in any case where the property is in the ownership of an institutional landlord or where the landlord in question works as a property professional.<\/p><p>The strengthening of the powers of the RTB is welcome as long as it is properly resourced to carry out the additional functions as required.  The Minister's ongoing refusal to entertain the concept of rent certainty is incredible considering the impact of the rental crisis on all of society.  Students, tenants on social housing supports, such as HAP, working families and young professionals are all being squeezed by rising rents.  I note with some irony the Fianna F&aacute;il conversion on the road to Damascus on this issue in recent days, even though it did not support our Rent Certainty Bill earlier in the year.<\/p><p>Let me provide some facts that highlight the severity of the crisis we are facing.  The Government is failing the 705,000 people currently living in the private rented sector.  This is evidenced by the data contained in successive <i>daft.ie<\/i>rental reports.  The most recent report on the market for the third quarter of 2016 is hugely concerning.  The average monthly rent is now &euro;1,077.  This is an increase of almost 4% on the second quarter of 2016.  The annual rate of rental inflation in the State is now 11.7%, which, according to <i>daft.ie<\/i>, is the highest recorded by it since its records began in 2002.<\/p><p>Rents in Galway city have increased by 10.9% in a year and in the county by nearly 8%.  Compared with eight years ago rents are up in Galway city by 14%.  That is a massive rise for people who are already struggling with stagnant wages and other high living costs.  It means at best that people have had to move out from the city and at worst rent hikes such as this have resulted in people becoming homeless.<\/p><p>The rising cost of rents is unsustainable and is pushing more and more families into emergency accommodation.  The recently released homeless figures for September 2016 reflected this.  There were 4,283 adults, 1,173 families and 2,426 children sleeping in emergency accommodation in September.  That represents a significant increase on the previous month.  These figures do not include those who are sofa surfing or those refused access to emergency accommodation despite having no home of their own.<\/p><p>The tenants who are managing to pay the exorbitant rent prices have little or no security of tenure.  As it stands, the property can be sold from under them at the whim of the landlord.  As a report by National Oversight &amp;amp; Audit Commission on local authority inspections of rented accommodation shows that 55% of properties inspected were substandard.  Rent certainty would have put a break on rising rents.  If Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il had supported our Rent Certainty Bill back in June, hard-pressed renters could have saved up to &euro;2,000 per year.  Fine Gael opposed it again in this Chamber a couple of months ago, again aided and abetted by its partners in government, Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p><p>If the Minster really wanted to enhance the functioning of the private rented sector, he would have tabled a rent certainty amendment and he could have given tenants real security of tenure by amending the Residential Tenancies Act to remove the criteria for serving notices to quit relating to sale of property, own use or use of family member, and change of use.<\/p><p>Is l&eacute;ir &oacute;n m&eacute;id a chloisim &oacute;n bpobal go bhfuil taca&iacute;ocht ann d&aacute; leith&eacute;id de reachta&iacute;ocht.  B&iacute;onn eagla agus &eacute;ad&oacute;chas ar dhaoine nuair nach f&eacute;idir leo bheith cinnte faoin todhcha&iacute;.  Mar shampla, i gcathair na Gaillimhe, c&eacute;n cinnteacht ata ann do dhaoine nach mbeidh na c&iacute;osanna ag ard&uacute; 14% mar at&aacute; ag tarl&uacute; le hocht mbliain anuas?

It is ambitious to think we will finish Committee Stage next week because I think there will be many amendments from across the House.  I appreciate what the Minister has said, but it is important to get the legislation right.  He said that he was open to constructive proposals for improving the Bill and they need to be fully debated.  Sinn F&eacute;in will be tabling amendments designed to improve the legislation and we hope the Minister will give them serious consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#HH00200","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I call on Senator Kelleher who proposes to share her time with Senator Grace O'Sullivan.

I welcome the measures to close the loopholes in the Residential Tenancies Act 2014.<\/p><p>I welcome the measures outlined in Part 4 that provide for lending by the Housing Finance Agency to certain bodies for specified purposes, including the purchase of vacant properties for social housing.

Let us be in no doubt that rising rents and a lack of rental security drive people into homelessness.  This morning Focus Ireland provided a briefing.  It highlighted that in the past two years a growing number of families have cited landlords selling up as the primary reason for them experiencing homelessness.  All of the good work that has been done to address the homelessness problem is being undone by people falling into homelessness due to properties being sold.  Legislation needs to protect families when this happens and new measures are needed.<\/p><p>People have suffered and continue to suffer the impact of an under regulated rental market.  The market is broken and dysfunctional so needs to be fixed.  We need to make the market operate in the best way possible.  Rent stability measures were introduced in 2015 but they have not had the desired effect of slowing down the market and off-setting rising rents.  Last month the Simon Communities of Ireland published a report entitled Locked Out of the Market.  I draw the attention of the Minister to the following figures contained in the report and I quote:<\/p><blockquote>Rents increased in Cork City by an average 18.2% in the year to Q2 2016;<br \/><br \/>rents increased in Dublin City Centre by an average of 10% in the year to Q2 2016; and <br \/><br \/>rents increased in County Louth by an average of 14.6% in the year to Q2 2016.<\/blockquote> <p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh mentioned Galway city and I can inform him about rent increase because the report continued as follows:<\/p><blockquote>Rents increased in Galway city by an average of 13.9% in the year to Q2 2016;<br \/><br \/>rents increased in County Kildare by an average of 12.5% in the year to Q2 2016; <br \/><br \/>rents increased in County Leitrim by an average of 7.5% in the year to Q2 2016;<br \/><br \/>rents increased in Limerick city by an average of 15.5% in the year to Q2 2016;<br \/><br \/>rents increased in County Laois by an average of 12% in the year to Q2 2016; and <br \/><br \/>rents increased in County Sligo by an average of 3.8% in the year to Q2 2016.<\/blockquote> <p>The report shows rising rents are a problem for people nationwide and it is not just a problem for people who live in the cities of Dublin and Cork.<\/p><p>The commendable and ambitious Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness - Rebuilding Ireland commits to creating a sustainable, secure and affordable rental sector.  The action plan contains a commitment that reads, &quot;Security - bringing greater certainty to tenants and landlords&quot;.  Unfortunately, this Bill does not fully provide any of that and I agree that it is a missed opportunity.  <\/p><p>I welcome the fact that the Bill will be supplemented by a new rental strategy that will be launched next month.  It is kind of the Minister to offer to bring it to the House in order to give us an opportunity to debate the legislation.  I acknowledge that the Bill is a welcome step in the right direction but we need more action sooner rather than later for the thousands of children, families, men and women who are homeless around Ireland tonight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#JJ00400","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":355,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#JJ00500","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":356,"content":"<p>It is great to see the Minister in the House again.  Unlike my colleague, Senator Coffey, I believe we need to  build units urgently in the right way and not at any cost.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill but we need to be careful to make the planning system work better.  Making it work efficiently and effectively is a priority.  We have a huge backlog of permitted housing units that have not been brought to the market.  As Senator Boyhan has said, we have planning permission for 27,000 units in Dublin but most of them have not been acted upon.  If unreasonable delays in the planning system exist then they should be addressed.  It is incorrect to suggest that it is the planning system alone that has caused delays in the supply of housing.  <\/p><p>The changes proposed in this legislation reduces public participation in the planning process.  They completely remove the participation of local councillors through the area committee.  There is no provision for an appeals mechanism for some of the most planning decisions affecting an area.  These provisions are in breach of Ireland's obligation under the Aarhus Convention and are contrary to the Maastricht Recommendations on public participation.  We need more planning scrutiny and more public participation, not less.<\/p><p>Chapter 2 of Part 2 dwells on the screening of an environment impact assessment.  I am concerned about the proposed changes to the EIA regime.  I should be grateful if the Minister would address some aspects of the chapter.  First, what is the provision for public participation in the EIA screening process?<\/p><p>Second, there is a particular focus on flood alleviation projects in the section.  As the Minister will be aware, Ireland is required under the Water Framework Directive to achieve good status in all of its water bodies.  Recently the EPA published its State of the Environment report and it demonstrates just how badly Ireland is failing in that regard.  The European Court of Justice in the Weser case made it clear that member states must refuse consent for projects that could cause a deterioration in water status.  How will the Minister ensure that this approach gives effect to the ruling by the European Court of Justice and enables Ireland to comply with the Water Framework Directive?<\/p><p>My third question is on Chapter 3 of Part 2, section 22 dealing with extension of permissions.  How many housing units does the provision apply to?  Section 23 of Chapter 3 of Part 2 refers to a Part VIII procedure.  I welcome the chief executive's timely report as I understand that reports did not come to the fore in the past.  However, there is no justification to reduce the public consultation period.  <\/p><p>The Bill addresses aspects of Part VIII procedures that badly need reform.  I want to refer to the adequacy of the information that is put on public display.  The information required for a Part VIII application is minimal.  If a normal planning application was submitted with the information acceptable for Part VIII approval it would be immediately rejected as invalid.  I ask the Minister to table a simple amendment requesting that the information supplied in a Part VIII application is the same as that specified in the regulations for a standard planning application.<\/p><p>In terms of tenant protections in Part 3 of the Bill, it is incredible that the protection of tenants shall apply only where a landlord proposes to sell 20 or more units.  Sales of investment properties by professional landlords should provide for the existing tenants remaining <i>in situ<\/i>whether the properties are sold singularly or in groups of any size.  We have repeatedly heard about people being evicted in order for the properties in which they live can be sold.  This is an unacceptable situation.  Often the initiative is driven by a bank recovering on its mortgage that makes no difference.  Where a property was bought as an investment and the bank lent money as an investment then the property should be sold as an investment.  What on earth suggests that it is acceptable to evict people when they live in a group of fewer than 20 properties?  <\/p><p>Finally, the Minister has said this legislation is only the first part of provisions to provide better protection for tenants.  If this is how he intends to continue the current provisions will make no difference to the lives of tenants.  Also, he will fail to make renting any more secure, affordable or attractive.  We all know what the FFF stands for - fair rent, fixity of tenure and free sale.  Surely in the 21st century we can offer tenants the right that Michael Davitt and the Land League won in the 19th century.  I ask the Minister to bring forward an amendment to Part 3 that will protect all tenants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#JJ00600","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":357,"content":"<p>Before I call Senator Lombard I would like to welcome Deputy Tony McLoughlin and his guests to the Visitors Gallery.

He is no stranger to the Seanad.  Out of all of the Ministers he has been the most active in attending here over the past few months.<\/p> <p>This Bill is important and forms part of the Rebuilding Ireland document that the Minister proudly announced earlier in the year.  It is a framework that will help us work towards sorting out an important issue for the State.  Housing is a primary and basic commodity that should be open to anybody.  This Bill goes a long way to ensure that everybody in this State can be housed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Tim Lombard:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We are in unusual circumstances in that our housing market and building sector collapsed over the past decade.  This legislation is a start to rebuild that market and get it going again.  There are many issues in the market from financial issues, planning and the affordability factor.  This Bill deals with the planning process and getting the development of housing units through it.  Between 12,000 and 13,000 housing units were built last year.  This will be doubled over the next several years.  Due to the dramatic change in the housing sector, it will need dramatic measures to deal with it.  This fast-track process for planning permission for three years, with the possibility of extending it after the next two years, for larger developments of over 100 units is positive.  It is what we need.  Can we afford to spend 24 months in a planning process?  We cannot if we have people who need to be housed.  This process will bring it down to, hopefully, 25 weeks.  That is an appropriate step.<\/p><p>In some ways, the Bill's measures are nothing new when one looks at the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.  That was a precursor which gave the approval process for major strategic projects to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and bypassed local government to a degree.  There were mistakes made in that legislation, however.  One was that there was no timeline put on the process.  We saw that in Cork with a decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la regarding an incinerator which was extended.  This Bill contains a timeline which is an important element.<\/p><p>One key element of the 2006 Act was that a local authority chief executive officer could bring a report before local authority members who could then make an addition to it.  That was positive in the way the chief executive officer and the members could all get their views out there.  What worked with that Act and its good elements should be incorporated in this Bill.<\/p><p>We have worked on the extension of duration, as outlined in Chapter 3, before.  Will the Minister clarify where we are going with this measure?  We have seen developments where it has been extended for five years but cannot be extended again.  If a development's permission has been extended, do we have the opportunity to extend it again?  Previously, these extension durations applied to one-off housing all the way up to large developments.  Will this Bill's provisions apply to the 20-house model or one-off housing?<\/p><p>As a member of a local authority for 13 years, I know the changes to the Part 8 process are badly needed.  This measure has failed us in so many ways.  Local authority chief executives have made Part 8 proposals with no timelines or no reports brought before members.  This area needs to be tidied up.  I have an issue in my part of the world where a Part 8 development issue has been running for 18 months and it still has not been brought forward.  The timeline in this regard is exceptionally important because it has been one of the key mistakes in the process so far.<\/p><p>There are four elements of approval in the planning process involving the Department.  It has to preapprove the idea, the design, the planning and the tender.  We have to streamline the Department's process too and reduce its elements to two.  Essentially, the idea should be approved and then the tenders approved.  Predesigned and actual planning really drags out the process.  It is about keeping it tight.<\/p><p>One cynical issue which has popped up in my part of Cork involves the thresholds for building Part 8 housing.  A developer building for Cork County Council will get &euro;40,000 less than the developer for Cork City Council, even though there might be less than a mile between the developments.  The same developer might even be doing both developments.  We need to examine the thresholds in the Department and how we are going to deal with those.<\/p><p>This Bill is important and the Minister has done a significant amount of work to ensure it was brought before us today.  It is up to us to approve this Bill over the next two weeks.  The last thing the Seanad wants to do is to slow this up and delay ensuring people have housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#JJ00800","speaker":"1386","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  There are many positive proposals in this Bill.  I welcome the proposal on the fast-tracking of environmental impact assessments for alleviation works in flood-risk areas.  In his speech, I noted the Minister emphasised three times that a planning application for a major housing project can take 24 months.  Before I conclude, I will give an example of one local authority which turns that on its head.  Will the Minister provide some evidence that it takes 24 months for planning applications to go through?<\/p> <p>The Minister specifically mentioned the advice he got from the Attorney General on the Aarhus Convention.  Will he clarify this?<\/p> <p>I agree with the Minister that there is no point in developers going ahead with developments when they will not sell houses.  How does he see developers getting their act together at preplanning stage before they ever approach a local authority?  Most problems occur in planning applications because the developer has not done his or her homework before the preplanning stage.  The number of times further information is sought in planning applications is spellbinding.  It is not the fault of the planner but of the person applying.<\/p> <p>I welcome the section regarding Part 8 developments.  That makes common sense, provided local councillors have an input into it and can vote on it.  The time commitment in that area is necessary because, for some strange reason, officials in local authorities, as it involves their own developments, do not push the issues and let it lag.<\/p> <p>I welcome the provision which will protect tenants during the sale of houses.  Why was the figure of 20 and upwards selected?  I welcome the proposal regarding the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  I dealt with a specific incident with the RTB which took 11 weeks to resolve.  This is an improvement from two years ago when it took two years to resolve disputes.  However, it is still a long time if a tenant, who is threatened with being turfed out on the street, has to wait for a decision for 11 weeks.<\/p> <p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la is already failing to meet the statutory 18-week rule on most of its decisions.  In the Dublin area, there is the potential to deliver 46,000 homes on zoned lands with essential services already in place, 33,000 units have permission and another 7,000 are in the planning process.  There are many houses in the system.  It is trying to get those who have got the planning permissions to move and stop them sitting on sites waiting for the value to go up.<\/p> <p>In 2015 in Dublin City Council, permission was granted to 11 applications for developments of over 100 houses out of 4,000 applications.  While there was no issue with the granting of permission, the problem was the lack of activation of the planning permissions and the need for developers to provide further information, as I have already pointed out.<\/p> <p>Regarding fast-tracking, with respect, the Minister, is trying to solve a problem which does not exist.  Instead, he is turning this towards the courts.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Denis Landy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2349\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2349&amp;amp;pid=DenisLandy&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There will be more judicial reviews because councillors and other citizens will only be able to partake in the planning process at the An Bord Plean&aacute;la stage instead of <i>en route<\/i>to it.

According to figures from a recent survey undertaken by Fingal County Council, there was no lack of applications or delay in issuing decisions.  From January to August of 2016, there was a 16.6% increase in the volume of planning applications compared with 2015.  The council received 822 planning applications, of which 758 were deemed valid, and made 850 planning decisions on applications to the end of August, of which 739 were valid and 91% were granted permission.  The breakdown of the permissions shows that 83 were for single house construction, 326 were for domestic extensions, 202 were for commercial or retail properties and 40 were for housing developments.  Of those 40, seven related to developments in excess of 100 housing units and 24 related to developments of fewer than 20 units.

My colleague, Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, has welcomed some of the smaller provisions, such as access to Housing Finance Agency funds for third level institutions in order to construct purpose-built student accommodation.  The focus of the Bill is on fixing the supply side of the problem.  While positive, this is at best a medium-term solution to a problem that needs solutions now.<\/p><p>The rental sector is broken.  The Bill provided the Government with an opportunity to introduce meaningful provisions to safeguard tenants' rights and to provide landlords and tenants with some certainty regarding rental prices.  The weak amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 contained in Part 3 of the Bill do not go far enough and the Bill should have been amended to include rent certainty.  We will table an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage next week.<\/p><p>The so-called Tyrrelstown amendment, a proposal to strengthen tenants' rights in developments of more than 20 units, is not helpful to the overwhelming majority of tenants whose landlords each own 19 or fewer properties.  According to RTB figures, 65% of landlords own just one property each and just 10% have more than three properties.  How many tenants will be protected under this amendment?  Sinn F&eacute;in would like to see real tenant protection measures inserted into the Residential Tenancies Act and section 34 of that Act to be amended so as to remove sale as a justification for the termination of a tenancy in any case where the property is in the ownership of an institutional landlord or the landlord is a property professional.<\/p><p>Fine Gael's refusal to introduce rent certainty is disappointing.  A few months ago, Fine Gael Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; voted down our Rent Certainty (No. 2) Bill 2016, which could have saved renters up to &euro;2,000 per year.  It could also have saved additional families needing emergency accommodation due to unaffordable rental costs.  These are working families.  On the Minister's watch, nearly 2,500 children will be in emergency accommodation this Christmas.  A litany of reports by Savills and <i>Daft.ie<\/i>have shown that unsustainable rent increases are not confined to Dublin.  The most recent <i>Daft.ie <\/i>report shows that average monthly rent is &euro;1,077 and that the annual rate of rental inflation is 11.7%, which <i>Daft.ie<\/i>states is the highest recorded by it since its records began in 2002.  Rents in Mayo have increased by 5.1% in a year and tenants who are struggling to afford these increases have little security of tenure.  The Residential Tenancies Act must be amended to remove the sale of property, own use, use by a family member and change of use criteria for serving notices to quit.<\/p><p>There is a misconception that the rental crisis only applies to Dublin and other urban centres.  However, it can be even more difficult for people in rural areas to move from locations of high rent than it is for people in cities.  High rents and the fact that people often have no choice but to pay them can lead to a host of other problems.  Fuel poverty and food poverty often come about due to money being diverted into ever spiralling rent and mortgage costs.  The fact that rent certainty was voted down twice in the Oireachtas has added to the sense of hopelessness of those people who have been facing increases, in some cases for the past eight years.<\/p><p>The programme for Government commits to having up to 175,000 of the 200,000 new jobs outside Dublin.  If people cannot afford to live in rural areas where these new jobs will be supplied, there will be no uptake and no subsequent regeneration.  Rent certainty is needed for economic growth outside Dublin.  Rural Members who voted against Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill know this, as do the people of rural Ireland.  Rent certainty would have put a pause to rising rents.  We will table an amendment to this effect.  I hope that Fianna F&aacute;il will support it.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh addressed some of our concerns regarding the planning elements of the Bill.  Amending our planning laws to facilitate a few developments is not the best way to solve the problem.  This amendment will only serve to remove local communities from the planning process further and will potentially undermine good planning policy.<\/p><p>We will submit amendments to the Bill next week on Committee Stage.  We are not going out of our way to be awkward or to put a stop to the Minister's plans.  However, the legislation could be strengthened considerably.

They are made homeless through a failure of Government policy to protect them and a failure to recognise that a home is a basic human right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#LL00800","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":369,"content":"<p>We are keen to hear from the Minister, so I will not take long.

This issue does not affect Trim alone; I could bring the Minister to several villages and towns in south County Meath where there are serious sewage and water problems.  Last week, the main pipe in the centre of the town burst, leaving parts of south Meath, including surrounding villages, without water for 24 hours.  The story made the front page of the local newspaper because there was a lake in the middle of the town. <\/p> <p>Parts of the Bill are welcome but I firmly believe that local authorities and planning offices are not building infrastructure before making planning decisions.  During the Celtic tiger, major mistakes were made.  No schools were built, water services installed or facilities provided for the youth who came to live in the new houses.  To this day, the decisions that were made have been catastrophic in the greater suburbs of Dublin in County Meath where there was major population growth.<\/p> <p>I would like a strategic infrastructure department to be established in local authorities.  When infrastructure is put in place, we can move forward with proper planning.  I would like the Minister to clarify how infrastructure can be improved for large-scale developments and what measures he will put in place to address this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#MM00200","speaker":"1423"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I was fortunate to be in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown on Monday when the Minister launched a new housing scheme in Kilternan.  As a councillor, I voted on the matter in a Part 8 decision in 2007.  That shows that the development and delivery of Part 8 projects does not happen immediately.<\/p> <p>I want to put on the record that everything the Minister is doing is well-intentioned.  He does not have a hidden agenda and he is doing his very best.  I listened to him very carefully when he spoke in Kilternan on Monday. <\/p> <p>I have concerns about the fast-track planning process for developments comprising more than 100 units that is being introduced as part of the Bill.  I accept it is an interim measure for a limited period but I have concerns.  From 2002 to 2015, there were 87 different applications for developments of over 100 units in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, none of which were delayed at the council stage.  The Bill is fast-tracking the process, but it is doing so by eliminating the appeals processes - effectively, there will be no appeals process.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will make the decision.  I admit there is preplanning and so on, but seems to me that An Bord Plean&aacute;la will make up its mind and that will be it.

I am concerned, as somebody who lives in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, an area that is 5 miles wide and 8 miles long and where, as the Minister pointed out, the average house price is &euro;200,000 more than the next highest average house price of any of the other 30 local authorities in Ireland.<\/p> <p>I am not sure that if there is a problem in local authorities that An Bord Plean&aacute;la is the answer.  The Association of Irish Local Government, AILG,  has made some points on the same proposal.  I welcome many other aspects of the Bill, such as student accommodation, which is a very useful and helpful provision.  Other issues to do with landlords, tenants and vacant or non-vacant possession are good ideas.  I wonder whether councils are the problem.  <\/p> <p>I accept An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be ramped up and additional staff will be brought in.  In the short time between 2017 and 2019 for the fast-track process, it will be very difficult for it to ramp up and gain the experience of 31 different local authorities.  I equally accept and acknowledge that not many local authorities will be dealing with developments comprising over 100 units.  I would imagine the four Dublin local authorities, and probably those in Meath, Kildare, Wicklow, Cork, Galway, Waterford and perhaps Limerick would be affected.  I see other Senators are nodding, so I think I may be correct in thinking that.  I acknowledge there are some very good officials in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.<\/p> <p>While we talk about empowering local government, planning has always been an executive function and should remain so.  The last thing any councillor wants to be doing is granting planning permission for attic conversions, gate widenings, garage conversions, extensions and so on.  However, the AILG has made five points.  The general local authority planning function involves local authorities dealing with planning applications and An Bord Plean&aacute;la is the appeals process.  The centralisation of the planning function to one body goes contrary to the view that we devolve power to local government.  Instead, we are centralising applications to one body based in Marlborough Street.  I am not sure how the process of being able to view plans will play out.  Will they be available to view in local authority offices?  Will they still come to area committees or municipal districts for planning, discussion and consultation so that members can have an input?   While members do not make decisions, they have an in-depth knowledge of the process.  They were elected by the people of their area, for all parties and none, and have a great knowledge of their local areas.  I would be concerned that their knowledge would not be used.  I understand planning permission was refused in 2005 for a building in Sandyford.  The application sat with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for about four years and it kept deferring the application.  I wonder how fast we can get enough extra planning staff to deal with the work of 31 local authorities in a planning facility within An Bord Plean&aacute;la, presumably in Marlborough Street or the general area.  I acknowledge not all planning will involve 100 units.  Would it be better to ramp up the appeals process or shorten the time period for dealing with planning applications?<\/p> <p>I refer to public engagement.  It is relatively easy for people to visit local authorities, deal with them, make submissions and so on.  I am concerned that it will be much harder for people to deal with the planning process if it moves to a centralised location in Dublin.<\/p> <p>Our party will support the Bill, as will I because that is our party position.  I have concerns about the proposal regarding plans for developments of the 100 units or more, which I would like the Minister to bear in mind. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#MM00500","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to outline his proposals.  The plan is a very positive one.  I was a member of a local authority which was fortunate enough to be in a position to build public housing in recent years when other local authorities were not.  The benefit of the housing plan can also be viewed from the perspective of job creation.  There have been a number of welcome jobs announcements in Limerick recently but one of the factors affecting job applications was the housing shortage in the county.<\/p> <p>The plan is very positive in lots of ways.  Previous speakers referred to the Part 8 process and I voted on many Part 8 proposals during the 17 years that I spent on my local authority.  The Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, visited Limerick recently for the launch of the hydro development which was closed down as a local authority development in 2002 and is only now being rebuilt.  It is positive to see these units coming back on stream.  The more investment in vacant units we see, the better and I know that is one element of the Minister's plan.<\/p> <p>Up to now, local authorities have been very engaged and involved in the planning process.  When I was in Australia I noted that the oral hearing system there was very effective.  There are references to such hearings in the Bill in the context of exceptional circumstances.  That might be one way of including members of local authorities, especially with regard to some of the bigger schemes.  In the Australian system, the proposers of schemes are given a hearing, as are those who are opposed to them.  Perhaps that system could be used more frequently rather than only being used in exceptional circumstances.  <\/p> <p>I am glad to see that the Bill will strengthen the powers of the Private Residential Tenancies Board because many tenants have been treated very badly by landlords.  Landlords have been getting away with an awful lot.  While some are very nice to their tenants, many treat them very badly.  I was made aware of a case recently where the conduct of a landlord was simply deplorable.  The tenant was bullied to such an extent that he was afraid to report the landlord.  I hope we will see an end to that type of behaviour.  <\/p> <p>I would like to see a greater focus on unfinished estates.  There is an unfinished retirement village in my electoral area comprised of 15 to 20 units.  A developer has taken the estate over with the intention of finishing it but is being put through an enormous number of hoops.  He is currently on his fourth or fifth planning application.  People would be queuing up to get into the village because it comprises very nice bungalows in a very good location on the outskirts of the city.  There is high demand but the developer is tearing his hair out with frustration.  He is trying to get the project over the line.  People are approaching him and telling him that they would like to buy one of the units but he is still awaiting final planning permission.  I would urge the Department to focus on unfinished estates which are crucial to the development of villages, towns and cities.<\/p> <p>The target in the plan is 47,000 social housing units per year and an increase of 25,000 in private units per year.  Companies that are considering locating in Ireland take housing availability into account alongside issues such as the availability of a skilled workforce and access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#NN00100","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment him on his vigour and determination in addressing the problem of housing and homelessness in this country, as evidenced by the launch of Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  I wish to focus on pillars 2 and 5, particularly in the context of existing housing stock.  Pillar 2 focuses on the accelerated social housing objective and pillar 5 on the utilisation of existing housing.<\/p> <p>I am very familiar with the housing issues in my own county of Mayo.  The latest available figures show that 24% of the 65,000 units in the county are empty.  At the same time, Mayo County Council has a housing list of 1,600.  A survey was conducted by the Department in 2010.  Inspectors who had previously been involved in inspections related to the first time buyer's grant went from house to house in Mayo and found that one quarter of the units were empty.  We are in the same place right now.  Recent census figures show that little has changed in six years.  There is a fundamental problem there that the market is not addressing.<\/p> <p>The empty housing stock in Mayo comprises both empty and half finished units.  Approximately 1,500 of the empty units are at various stages of construction.  Clearly these units need to be completed and occupied.  There are 1,600 people on the housing list in Mayo and 1,500 semi-complete units.  A focus on getting the existing housing stock occupied will go a long way towards addressing the housing needs of people in the county.  Such a focus will also address the problem of dereliction and unfinished houses and estates.  This should be done alongside the planned investment in new social housing.  <\/p> <p>The big questions are why these units have remained empty for the past six years or more and what can be done about it.  Ordinary market forces are not addressing this issue.  While I welcome the two new schemes announced by the Minister recently, namely, the repair and lease scheme and the buy and renew scheme, I am not sure how they will work.  We need to get more houses in public ownership, that is, in the ownership of the local authority rather than approved housing bodies.  It is not very attractive at the moment to be a landlord.  It is very onerous, involving a lot of red tape, the payment of PRSI and so forth.  The tax treatment of landlords is very different to PAYE workers, for example, and a lot of people, quite simply, do not want the bother.  We know that there are ceilings on rent and we know the reasons for that but it is not attractive to be a landlord.  The Minister has set aside more funding for the repair and lease scheme than for the buy and renew scheme.  However, in Mayo, the buy and renew scheme is more appropriate and sensible.  <\/p> <p>We need to work out how we are going to get these empty units occupied, either by buying them or giving people grants to renovate them.  We need to go about this in a systematic way, as was done in 2010.  Inspectors must go around the county, door to door.  In many cases, people do not know why units are empty.  It might be that an older person has died and the house has been left empty because of issues relating to the deceased person's estate.  It might be the case that builders have problems with banks or with NAMA and do not know where things stand.  We must get to the bottom of this so that we can find the people with the decision making power.  It is surely the case that people do not want to have properties empty when we have a homelessness and housing shortage problem.<\/p> <p>The banks are very quick to sell houses and mortgages to vulture funds.  Why are they not being required to approach local authorities first to offer them empty units?  The banks should be forced to approach local authorities, tell them what units are available, what the situation is with regard to the debt and to sort things out.  There are issues with regard to title in many cases, particularly with older houses.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michelle Mulherin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Traditionally, local authorities had the power to correct difficulties with the legal title to a property.  All these issues need to be examined.

Resource the local authorities to do it.  Then we would really get to grips with the empty houses.  Will the Minister take this on board?  These are very real experiences in Mayo.  It would make a world of difference to the 1,600 people and families on the housing list.  It would go a major way towards sorting out our problem with dealing with existing housing stock in a very practical way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#NN00200","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Many questions have been asked and I will try to deal with as many as I can.  If I miss any please feel free to contact me before next week.<\/p> <p>A number of themes came through.  I am a little uncomfortable with the terminology \"fast track planning\" because it suggests it is being rushed and it is not.  We are speaking about putting in place a properly resourced process whereby there is preplanning consultation which involves proper and significant engagement with local authorities and developers.  Developers will have to prepare a much higher quality application, otherwise the timeline simply will not be sufficient to deal with the application and it will get thrown out.  It will be deemed not to be ready for an application after nine weeks and the recommendation will probably be not to apply to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p> <p>The idea that local councillors have no role is not the case.  There is no reason the procedure that exists in local authorities, whereby controversial planning applications are referred to a committee for discussion and planners get feedback from democratically elected councillors on how they look at planning applications, cannot happen during the preplanning consultation process.  Ultimately, planners make the recommendations on planning issues.  Of course councillors make decisions and recommendations on zoning issues, local area plans, policy considerations and a series of other things that contribute to county development plans, city development plans and local area plans, and this will remain unaffected.  The preplanning consultation process is about ensuring that on zoned land which has already been earmarked by councillors for houses, issues regarding quality, design, density, amenities and other facilities linked to large-scale development are provided for in the planning application.  It will be a pretty robust exchange.  There will be pressure on the developers in particular, knowing there is a nine week timeline and that is it, to get their ducks in a row and ensure they are consistent with local area plans to make the formal application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p> <p>The reason An Bord Plean&aacute;la is involved in the preplanning consultation with local authorities is so there is local knowledge when the application formally goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and somebody, or a team, from An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been involved or is receiving reports from the preplanning consultation process that happened over the previous nine week period.  A good point was made that local authorities have local knowledge.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la cannot be expected to have this level of local knowledge.  The point of having it involved in the pre-application process is to ensure local knowledge is part of the consideration when it comes to the board.<\/p> <p>I assure the House this is not a rush job.  It is trying to ensure we have a statutory time limit in place so we have some certainty over decision-making which, from a minimum point of view, could be about 25 weeks of pretty rigorous assessment after which there will be another rigorous assessment of the formal application.<\/p> <p>It would not be true to say the only appeal mechanism is a judicial review.  A judicial review reviews the process by which the consideration took place and consistency with legality.  It does not review the planning decision because no judge is a qualified planner.  Perhaps one might happen to be, but it is not the connection that is relevant.<\/p> <p>What is happening is the vast majority of large planning applications for residential developments end up with An Bord Plean&aacute;la anyway.  We are including An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the pre-application stage so it understands local issues and can factor them into making a good decision over a 16-week period where councillors, members of the public or anybody else for that matter can object and make observations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#OO00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":379,"content":"<p>They do not all listen.

We can tease through these issues again.  I take the Senator's concern and I have not done this lightly.<\/p> <p>The vast majority of houses which obtain planning permission next year will go through the normal process.  This is just for the big applications to try to encourage people back to looking at large-scale housing developments and building communities.  It is also about encouraging higher density in cities such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford to a certain extent.  We are trying to encourage higher density high quality apartment complexes and student complexes so we get people living in urban communities and urban environments.<\/p> <p>My understanding is, and I will clarify this, developers may well use the process in a strategic development zone if they want.  As long as the outcome is consistent with the local area plan or the city development plan it is covered in the legislation.  If I am wrong on this I will clarify it next week.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the concerns of the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG.  I have not seen the document but I am aware of it.  We will certainly look at it in the context of seeing what we might be able to do to alleviate some of these concerns.  There is no effort to bypass local government I can assure the House.  In the vast majority of councils, as I stated, there will be very few such applications.  This year, 15 applications were made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Next year it expects perhaps 50.  This is what it is gearing up to deal with.  Thousands of planning applications will be made throughout the country.  The House will be glad to hear the number of planning applications has increased on this time last year by approximately 40%.  What we are doing is working and we are seeing increased activity.  People see the State is now looking to support and gear up a construction industry to be able to build homes for people.<\/p> <p>The comments on Part VIII were reasonably complimentary.  Again, we ensure councillors are the key decision makers and there is an onus on senior management to get reports done in a timely manner.<\/p> <p>A number comments were made on the so-called Tyrrelstown amendment.  On rent generally, and please work with me on this, this is not the complete story.  A number of Senators in their contributions stated they would do more and would introduce an amendment to make it happen.  We will launch a pretty significant rental strategy in approximately one month which will deal with some of the issues raised today.  We are not ready to put an amendment into this legislation consistent with the policy because it is not yet finalised.  Every political party, member of the public and stakeholder has had an opportunity to contribute in writing to a consultation process on the rental strategy.  It is only three or four weeks away.  As part of this, I may well introduce a significant Committee Stage amendment in the D&aacute;il on some of the issues raised today.  We need to ensure any amendment on rent predictability, rent certainty, balancing the concerns and rights of tenants and landlords has a proper balance.  When we introduce something it needs to be comprehensive as opposed to having an unintended consequence, such as, perhaps shutting off supply or frightening investment out of the market, which is the last thing we need.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am the first to accept that what we are doing on rental supports is only a small part of what will be announced in about a month's time; therefore, Members should not judge it as being the complete picture because it is not.  <\/p><p>I will take on board the issues that have been raised.  Concerning the figure of 20 units, we wanted to take early action before the rental strategy was complete.  We wanted to be able to say to institutional investors who were buying up large-scale developments in cities such as Dublin that when these properties were being sold, the active tenancies within them would be protected.  We picked a figure of 20 units because anything above it represented a medium-sized development.  We want to make sure that when medium-sized and large-scale developments which, by and large, are managed by professionally managed funds, professional landlords and so-called vulture funds are bought by and sold to each other, tenants will be protected throughout the process in order that we will not have a repeat of what in Tyrelstown.  We have a very unusual rental market in Ireland in which nearly 90% of rental properties are owned by landlords who only own one property.  Yes, of course, there is another discussion and debate we need to have about issues such as security of tenure and so on, but we should not put a landlord who owns one property and who may be an accidental landlord in the same category as professional investors.  There are complexities in that regard.<\/p><p>We will tease out all of these issues and all of the questions raised by Members as we proceed through the various Stages and amendments next week.  We hope to launch our rental strategy early next month.  I signal that I hope we will be able to use the opportunity presented by this legislation to bring forward a comprehensive amendment on the strategy at a later stage.  If we make a substantial amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, we will have to come back to the Seanad.  That is my understanding.  As I will not be ready or able to do so next week, I appeal to parties to wait and see what our response will be, taking account of the submissions made by many parties in that process.  If we make amendments on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, there will be an opportunity to debate them in this House.  I look forward to the discussion next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#OO00800","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1479292200,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":387,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#PP00300","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#PP00400","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Non-standard terms and conditions can be imposed on the vulnerable, the low paid and those with little social protection.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerald Nash:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2281\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->When these conditions become a fixed feature of the employment landscape we must sit up, take notice and act.  Women, young people and migrant workers are over-represented in non-standard employment sectors, including the retail, hospitality and community care sectors, that pay poorly and encourage practices that are at the outside or at the very least on the extreme edge of our employment protection laws.  We all accept that employment policy must strike a fair balance between an enterprise's need for flexibility and the employee's need for a level of predictability in terms of his or her working life.  <br\/><br\/>Section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 deals with workers who have a contract requiring them to make themselves available for work.  The section sets out a floor of minimum pay entitlements for a person whose actual hours do not match up to his or her hours on call but what the Act does not deal with is a contract with either very few or no guaranteed hours of work and no requirement, on paper at least, for employees to make themselves available outside of those guaranteed contractual hours.  Many workers are now encountering new terms and conditions - the so-called &quot;if-and-when&quot; contract - under which employers are under no obligation to provide work of any description.  This has become the arrangement of choice for some large retailers and many employers in the hospitality and community care sectors.  For example, a typical contract might state: &quot;The company is under no obligation to provide work to you at any time and you are under no obligation to accept any work offered by the company at any time.&quot;  It seems to me that these &quot;if-and-when&quot; contracts are not covered by section 18 of the 1997 Act and as such it may be that these workers are completely outside our entire system of employment protection law.  This is because, under this kind of arrangement, there is no obligation whatsoever on the employer to provide work and no obligation on the worker to do any work that is offered.<br\/><br\/>A court requires mutuality of obligations before it can establish whether or not a contract exists such that if there are not any enduring mutual obligations there may not be an enduring contract.  If so, then people working under arrangements like these are being told that they are, in effect, casual day workers.  These are perverse arrangements aimed at downgrading the status of employment.  Imposing such terms and conditions on the vulnerable, the low-paid and those with little social protection is unacceptable to me and my party.I hope that the Government and Members of this House will agree.  Workers in these situations are put at risk of job insecurity.  From the perspective of the enterprise, there is limited integration into the business, low motivation, low productivity, low job satisfaction and for workers there is entrapment in a succession of short-term, low-quality jobs with little or no social protection and little or no legal protection.  The social and economic consequences of failing to act<i><\/i>to provide a growing army of precarious workers with greater protections, a basic level of certainty, predictability and income security is incalculable.  In allowing the <i>status quo <\/i>to continue, nobody wins. <br\/><br\/>I will now speak in more detail to some important provisions of the Bill.  Section 4 amends section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  The purpose of that section was to provide a minimum entitlement to payment for employees who are contractually required to make themselves available for work, even when no work is provided.  The section is stated to apply where a contract requires employees to make themselves available to work in a week, a particular number of hours or as and when the employer requires them to do so or both a certain number of hours and as and when the employer requires them to do so.  However, section 18 further states that a requirement to be available is not held to arise by virtue only of the fact that the employer engaged the employee to do work of a casual nature previously, regardless of the number of previous occasions and of any other circumstances that would give rise to a reasonable expectation of further work.  The amendment being made to section 18 by way of this Bill deletes this qualification so that the section in future applies to and, importantly, protects employees who were initially engaged to do work of a casual nature.<br\/><br\/>Section 5 amends the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003.  That Act confers entitlements of fixed-term employees who have completed their third year of continuous employment with an employer.  It can be difficult for an employee to prove continuous employment and so section 5 introduces two important new rules to assist them, dealing in the first instance with continuity of service and the use of PAYE information held by the Revenue Commissioners to determine the reality of the contracted working arrangement with the employer.  This is an important new innovation.<br\/><br\/>Section 6 deals with continuity of employment for employees who may otherwise be deemed casual.  Section 7 concerns provision for a corrected written statement of hours of work.  An employee who has benefitted from these provisions will be entitled to request the employer in writing to correct the employment contract so that particulars of the weekly hours of work reflect the pattern of work actually done per week in the previous six months.  An employer may refuse to do so if there was a particular pattern or system to the hours in the previous six months that was due to the seasonal nature of the work or to an emergency or other exceptional circumstances.<br\/><br\/>Section 8 includes an important anti-victimisation provision which states that an employer shall not penalise or threaten penalisation of an employee for invoking rights or procedures under this Bill.  This particular section is very similar to a section I included in the Industrials Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 around collective bargaining.  <br\/><br\/>Sections 9 and 10 provide for complaints to adjudication officers of the Workplace Relations Commission.  Section 11 invalidates any provision in an agreement, whether a contract of employment or not and whether made before or after the passing of this Bill, that purports to exclude or limit the application of, or is inconsistent with, any provision of this Bill.  However - this is an important point to make - the Bill allows for a registered employment agreement, an employment regulation order or a sectoral employment order to provide that provisions of the Bill do not apply with regard to the employees to whom the agreement or order has effect or to a specified class of those employees.  In other words, there are alternatives.  We are always seeking to encourage trade unions and employers to engage under the provisions of the 2015 Act and to ensure that they use that Act to create better sectoral terms and conditions and better enterprise-level conditions by way of registered employment agreements and sectoral employment orders because there is no substitute in the workplace for collective bargaining and all it involves in terms of improving the living standards of employees and giving certainty to the enterprise for entrepreneurs and business owners.<br\/><br\/>I remind the Minister that the programme for Government commits to addressing growing casualisation of the workforce.  On this basis, I am hopeful that the Government can and will support this legislation.  This legislation can and will prove to have a transformational effect on the lives of working people in this country, particularly those who are caught in perverse if-and-when contract arrangements that are, as I said earlier in my contribution, outside of or at the very edge of the current suite of employment legislation and regulations in place in this country.  It is high time that we addressed this issue and that our employment laws and regulations finally catch up with these phenomena that would not have been anticipated, for example, when section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 was being drafted by the then Minister of State, Ms Eithne FitzGerald.  Nobody could have anticipated the way the world of work would evolve and how these phenomena would develop in subsequent years.  It is important to point out that where these phenomena catch hold, people become disconnected and alienated from society.  We do not ever want to see a large cohort of workers - people who work extremely hard to provide for their families - being disengaged from the enterprise in which they work and disconnected from society because dignity for them in the workplace is not respected and they do not feel that they have the respect to which their work entitles them.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerald Nash:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2281\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It should not be beyond us to provide a basic level of predictability in the workforce.

I also welcome this opportunity to discuss this important Bill on Second Stage and commend my colleague, Senator Ged Nash, on proposing it.  It gives me great pleasure to second the Bill on behalf of the group of Labour Party Senators.  I welcome the representatives of the Mandate trade union in the Gallery.  In a previous life as a barrister in employment law, I used to give briefings and training to Mandate shop stewards on employment law provisions and I always had great respect for the way in which Mandate worked to represent low-paid and vulnerable workers in the retail sector.  I am pleased, therefore, that representatives of the trade union have come to the House to support the legislation.<\/p> <p>As Senator Nash stated, the Bill stems from a long-standing Labour Party commitment to the protection of workers, particularly vulnerable workers.  It forms part of a commitment the party made in a document published earlier this year, Standing Up for Working People, and demonstrates the seriousness of our intent to proceed with reform.  It is another step in a package of measures we hope will be introduced in the lifetime of the Seanad.  A second Labour Party Bill, the Competition (Amendment) Bill, completed Report Stage in the House last Thursday with cross-party support.  That Bill proposes to give freelance workers the right to be represented by a trade union in collective bargaining negotiations.  I am grateful to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, for accepting the Bill, which will now proceed to the D&aacute;il.  The proposed legislation will change the interpretation previously made by the Competition Authority, whereby freelance journalists in a newsroom, for example, were prohibited under the Competition Act from negotiating with their employer on minimum rates of pay.  This interpretation had a detrimental and chilling effect on many groups of freelance workers, notably voice-over actors and session musicians.  We are pleased the Bill, as amended by the Government through amendments supported by the Labour Party, will change the current interpretation and ensure collective rights for freelance workers.<\/p> <p>The passage of the Competition (Amendment) Bill was strongly welcomed by all Senators and the relevant trade unions, specifically SIPTU, the National Union of Journalists and Equity.  Just as that Bill constitutes an important component in a necessary package of measures to protect the rights of vulnerable workers, so too will the Protection of Employment (Uncertain Hours) Bill address a particular category of workers.  As Senator Nash explained, the Bill deals with people who are on the extreme edge of our employment laws, many of whom work in retail, catering and tourism.  These workers are employed on so-called \"if-and-when\" contracts under which employers are under no obligation to provide them with any work from week to week or sometimes even from day to day and they must be available for work without having an expectation of working particular hours.  Workers employed on these contracts have tended to fall outside many of the legislative protections provided to workers generally.<\/p> <p>As Senator Nash outlined, section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act introduced by the former Minister of State, Ms Eithne FitzGerald, deals with protections for employees working on zero-hours contracts and requires that an employee on a zero-hours contract who works less than 25% of his or her hours in any week be compensated.  If the employee is not offered any work, the compensation should be either for 25% of the possible available hours or for 15 hours, whichever is less.  This provision provides important protections for employees on so-called zero-hours contracts.<\/p> <p>However, the proviso to section 18, as currently constructed, specifically excludes workers who are engaged to work of a casual nature.  This proviso is the problem the Bill seeks to address because the current legislation does not provide a definition of the term \"casual\".  We can assume, however, that where the worker is described as \"casual\", it is likely to mean working under the type of contract I have described, which apparently does not oblige the employer to provide the employee with any work.  As Senator Nash stated, in such cases, there may even be a question as to whether a contract of employment could be said to exist.  Workers who are in this position lack any kind of job security, protection or pay certainty and are extremely vulnerable.  The explanatory memorandum outlines the types of impacts this kind of employment have on individuals.  It is appropriate to describe this employment as a perverse arrangement which downgrades any sense of dignity at work.<\/p> <p>In modern times, we use the word \"precariat\" to describe workers who are engaged in atypical work where terms of employment have been so severely casualised as to render the employees extremely vulnerable.  While this is a modern phenomenon, it should be recalled that this type of arrangement harks back to an earlier time when employees were employed in a highly casualised manner.  At the turn of the 20th century, for example, vast numbers of people in Dublin worked as casual labourers, messengers and domestic workers who were employed on a daily basis at the whim of an employer in what would be currently regarded as a semi-feudal relationship.  It was largely in response to this deeply precarious state of affairs that we saw the growth of the trade union movement in Ireland.<\/p> <p>While employment conditions today are fortunately much different from those that prevailed in the early 20th century, none the less, it is a cause of great concern to see the rise of precarious employment again in the 21st century.  Women are particularly affected by this phenomenon and over-represented in non-standard and low paid employment sectors.<\/p> <p>As Ms Esther Lynch of ICTU noted in a paper she gave in 2014 at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, the modern growth of zero-hours and if-and-when contracts has fundamentally undermined the principle of decent work and dignity in the workplace.  Not only is this development damaging for employees in terms of job security and ability to plan for the future of their families, but it is also damaging for employers as it becomes difficult for employers who are known for using these types of contracts to attract and retain high quality staff, which affects productivity levels in the workplace.  <\/p> <p>Zero-hours and if-and-when contracts have a clear detrimental effect on society in general.  Research carried out by the Mandate trade union found many of those on the poverty line are in precarious jobs with zero-hours contracts.  While the prevalence of zero-hours contracts in Ireland is not clear, research in Britain shows that more than 1 million employees are on zero-hours contracts, mainly concentrated in specific low-paid sectors.  We can assume large numbers of employees in these sectors in Ireland are also on such contracts.  Trade unions such as SIPTU and Mandate have engaged in collective bargaining to try to protect the workers affected.  Legislation such as this can also offer important protections to workers who are outside current legislation.<\/p> <p>Section 4 proposes to amend section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 to delete the proviso to which I referred, thereby ensuring that casual workers are brought within its protections.  It is also important to note the wording in section 6, which will provide for continuity of employment for casual workers.  Section 7 will create an entitlement to a corrected written statement of hours of work for employees.<\/p> <p>We accept the Minister may table amendments to the Bill at later Stages and we look forward to engaging constructively with her and her officials.  We very much hope and expect that the Bill will receive cross-party support from the Government and Senators from all parties and none, given the importance of its objectives.  I commend Senator Nash again on the initiative he has shown in introducing the Bill on behalf of the Labour Party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#RR00200","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill in so far as it raises an important issue, namely, the unscrupulous exploitation by some employers of workers who are clearly employees rather than independent contractors.  In some instances, a variety of methods are used to bully employees into such scenarios and this is a matter of grave concern.  People are very concerned about the use of if-and-when contracts which give rise to unpredictability of hours, difficulties in managing work and family life, unstable income, difficulties accessing credit, which is a major problem for those applying for loans or mortgages as they cannot show consistent income, contracts that do not reflect the real numbers of hours worked, insufficient notice being given when being called to work, and a belief that employees will be penalised for not accepting work offered.  This is a real threat to a person who cannot be assured of hours on an ongoing basis.  Difficulties also arise in accessing social welfare benefits.<\/p> <p>Notwithstanding these issues, the Bill presents problems as it is a blunt instrument for dealing with the complexities inherent in this issue.  Having said that, I will not oppose the legislation because we all agree with the principle of ensuring workers are protected.  We must, in law, protect workers from the unscrupulous practices of certain employers.  Under existing legislation, the security and protection available to workers can be undermined through being forced into contracts which ostensibly make workers self-employed but in reality mean they are employees without the protections afforded by legislation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The programme for Government contains a commitment to tackle the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work and to strengthen regulation of precarious work.  To this end the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is committed to bringing forward for consideration by Government an appropriate policy response to the report by the University of Limerick, UL, on zero and low-hour contracts.  This policy response will take account of the large number of submissions received in response to the public consultation on the study.  Those responses reflect a broad range of views, some of which are diametrically opposed.  A considerable amount of work has been carried out by the Department in assessing those submissions and in developing proposals that aim to provide balanced and workable solutions to the recommendations in the study.  The Minister's proposals will address the issues of insecure low-hours work in a more comprehensive and balanced manner than the approach taken in the Bill.  The Minister's proposals will address the concerns expressed in the UL study and in the public consultation about the need to improve the predictability of working hours for workers on insecure low-hour contracts.  The issue of contracts indicating low-hour requirements and not reflecting those much higher hours worked over significant periods will be dealt with.  The proposals will also seek to ensure that workers are better informed at an early stage in their employment about the nature of their employment arrangements and their core terms and conditions.  Currently a contract does not have to issue for up to two months after a person starts working, but the Minister will greatly shorten this to a day or a week.  Furthermore, the Minister's proposals will include provisions aimed particularly at the low-paid more vulnerable workers with regard to the minimum compensation for being called in to work and then being sent home again.  The Minister does not propose to effectively eliminate casual working as it does suit employees and employers in certain circumstances.  The Labour Party Bill, however, would effectively end arrangements in all circumstances, with negative impacts on employment levels and service delivery in sectors such as hospitality, education, health care, elder care and social care, which rely on the flexibility provided by genuine if-and-when contracts and casual employment to meet peaks in demand, customer needs and regulatory requirements.<br\/><br\/>The Bill is a limited response to the UL study.  It does not address a number of recommendations in the report, in particular the recommendation to amend the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994, to require employers to provide the written statement of the terms of employment at commencement of employment so that employees are better informed of their terms and conditions of employment at the outset and the UL recommendation to provide for a minimum period of working hours where an employee is required to report for work.  The Bill attempts to address an issue raised in the UL report about the employment status of individuals on if-and-when contracts.  The UL report, however, was inconclusive on this issue and acknowledged that it was a complex matter that required further consideration.  It did not make any recommendations for legislative changes in this regard.  The report also found that there was a lack of clarity around the employment status of those who work only on an if-and-when basis because of the lack of mutuality of obligation, that is, if the employer is not obliged to offer any work and the employee is not obliged to accept any work offered.  This lack of mutuality of obligation raises questions as to whether individuals on if-and-when contracts would be deemed to be employees for the purpose of employment rights.  This has potentially adverse implications for those individuals in their entitlement to protection under various items of employment rights legislation.  A number of important points need to be made on this issue.  The UL report acknowledges that the employment status of individuals on if-and-when contracts has not been tested to any great extent in Ireland.  However it is well established in the jurisprudence of the constitutional courts and of the Labour Court and employment rights bodies, that they would look behind the written terms of a contract to establish the true nature of the arrangement.  In the case of Ticketline trading as Ticketmaster <i>v. <\/i>Sarah Mullen, the court accepted, on the evidence, that while the written contact of employment was on the if-and-when type with no mutuality of obligation, the contract was operated on the basis that the employee was required to be available for work at all times and was thus entitled to the protections of section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act.<br\/><br\/>UL acknowledges that the issue of employment status for those on if-and-when hours only is a complex matter that requires further examination.  The employment status issue did not feature prominently among the submissions made in response to the public consultation.  Similarly, it is not raised as an issue in the ongoing dialogue process with ICTU and IBEC with regard to the proposals to be brought forward by the Minister.<br\/><br\/>The Bill contains a number of provisions which, taken together, would make it virtually impossible for genuine casual employment arrangements or genuine if-and-when contracts to operate in the labour market.  This would, in our view, be an inappropriate and disproportionate response to the questions raised by the UL report about the use of if-and-when arrangements.  The UL study acknowledged that the flexibility offered by genuine if-and-when contracts can be mutually beneficial for employers and employees.  In certain sectors these contracts can provide the flexibility needed to run businesses such as in the hospitality and hotel sector where the employer can call in additional staff to service weddings and functions etc., and in the health sector these arrangements can help employers satisfy peak demand and to fill staffing gaps on a short-term basis.  The Bill also has universal application and does not focus on low-paid workers.  This is problematic for the highly-skilled and highly-paid individuals who would like to benefit from these arrangements.  I welcome the issue being raised and I do not propose that Fine Gael will oppose the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#RR00300","speaker":"1421","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Senator Davitt has eight minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#SS00200","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman.

Following clarification from the Oireachtas services, we have decided to not move our amendment, which had been placed on the Order Paper for today.  This is due to the Standing Orders whereby any Private Members' Bill that passes its Second Reading shall be referred to the relevant select committee to undertake detailed legislative scrutiny of provisions contained.   While protecting workers from zero-hour contracts is paramount, it is also our interest to minimise the burden on small businesses so that jobs are protected, which is fundamental.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is currently engaged in a dialogue process with ICTU and IBEC to secure broad agreement on legislative proposals to deal with the issues of low-hour contracts and vulnerable workers, and the recommendations should be included in any future Bill.  We will support this Bill going to the next Stage and we will call for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to honour her commitment in the confidence and supply arrangement and to accelerate the work of the Department with regard to these proposals in order that the committee can scrutinise the finalised provisions while taking on board the main principles of both the Protection of Employment (Uncertain Hours) Bill 2016 and the Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016.  While we support the Bill in general with respect to improving job security of workers on low-hour contracts, considerable amendments need to be made to make it fit for purpose.  It is fundamental that we protect the employer as well as the employee.

It seems to be a certain demographic that, unfortunately, is mostly working under these contracts and that seems unfair.  We all need to move towards the idea of a living wage so that people have some sort of ability to plan for their futures and are not taken advantage of.  Obviously, we have to be cognisant of small businesses.  I have a small business and the needs of small businesses must be considered so that the burden on them is balanced somewhat.  Some burden will have to be inflicted on businesses big and small and the goal of banning zero-hours contracts must be met, but there has to be some sort of balance in the equation while taking into the consideration that people need a living wage which lets them plan for the future.  It is about a mindset for employers.  There will have to be a social shift.  It is a massive responsibility taking on a staff member even as a one-man band and a great deal more responsibility is going to have to be imposed where people employ staff members.  It is a big duty and, as such, more has to be given back to small businesses where they take on employees on more secure contracts because that is ultimately a risk.

He was a very good Minister of State and I commend him for that.  I acknowledge that the last Government increased the minimum wage and restored it, unlike its predecessor.  We did so twice in fact.  The living wage is something we all want to embrace and to see if we can bring it to fruition.  I notice that Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in is here.  He made remarks on the US election last week.  I hope he can use his influence across the Atlantic with the new Administration regarding the protection of workers and their rights in the USA.<\/p> <p>Coming back to home, the Bill has some issues which need to be teased out.  The last thing we need to do is get into a quagmire around the casualisation of work.  Many of us benefitted from that casual relationship when we were in college or moving towards different careers.  Equally, however, it is a source of concern in terms of the way in which the casualisation of the labour force is increasing in certain industries.  It is important to note that the last Government reduced the VAT rate for the hotel sector.  Senator Gavan raised a number of times on the Order of Business the terms and conditions of those who work in hotels and the catering industry.  It is important in the context of this debate that we challenge those in the hotels federation and the industry generally along with others to get the balance right.  The last thing we want to do is send up a flare which tells employers they cannot employ people.  It is equally important to protect those on low pay or in casual labour situations and those who are most vulnerable in the workforce.<\/p> <p>Senator Bacik used the phrase \"whim of an employer\" and that is something we need to look at in order to eliminate it from the lexicon.  It is not good enough.  Equally, the debate today is about ensuring that we can protect workers and give them certainty and a sense of belonging and a future in terms of their lives and livelihood.  Senator Reilly referenced the issue of hours being uncertain or inflexible.  I had a conversation with a friend who works full-time in an industry I will not name in order to protect him.  He got a phone call from his employer on a Sunday night at 10 p.m. asking him to come in on Monday morning.  He gets a phone call on a Wednesday asking him to come in at short notice.  He feels vulnerable because if he says \"no\", there is the potential that he will be out of a job.  It is important that we understand that it is about managing life in terms of work and employment and getting the balance right for the person who is employed.  Equally, it is about allowing people to have a steady income and steady hours while at the same time being flexible.<\/p> <p>Many of us are concerned about the zero-hours contract.  In some cases, there are contracts which last for a certain period.  When, for example, six months expires, one is put on a new contract or is gone altogether.  I am concerned about that.  Some of the industries I deal with engage in that kind of practice.  It may suit some people.  Senator Ardagh referred to demographics in her address.  However, there are others whom it does not suit.  Some of the big firms that employ people in a variety of sectors should look at how they can allow for people to have continuity and security of tenure.  It is a worry that some people have expressed to me not only in clinics but when I have met them out canvassing.  I have friends who see their whole work life changing overnight.  We see the merger of Dell and EMC in Cork where I hope there will be no job losses or, as could happen, changes in the tenure of employment.<\/p> <p>The important point made by Senator Reilly is that the programme for Government contains a commitment to address the issue, which is complex and not black and white.  At the risk of upsetting my friends from Sinn F&eacute;in as I did this morning, it is not as simple as they say.  We must get the balance right.  The principle informing the Bill is a good one.  The fundamentals are right.  The protection of workers is important.  I say that as someone who, like the Acting Chairman, was in the classroom.  I spent a number of years on a temporary whole-time contract not knowing whether I was back after the summer holidays.  Thankfully, there was no issue in the years when I was teaching, but when the end of the year came, I often wondered if I would have the same hours the next year.  That is a source of worry we still have in some parts of the education sector, albeit we have changed the contracts and terms there.  I welcome the move, hopefully, to pay restoration in 2017 and of people not being in different tiers.  It is demoralising for members of staff in all sectors.<\/p> <p>It is important to accept that the principles of the Bill are what we are looking at today.  We can go down the avenue of teasing out the different parts but what we must try to do is get that balance right.  I was struck by Senator Ardagh's remarks on demographics.  We cannot overlook or sidestep what she is saying because it is an important issue.  There is a section of people in society who are affected by the lack of equity and fairness in their working hours.  We should never allow a situation to happen, however, where employers will not employ.  We must get that right as well.  We must allow people who are on minimal wages to access social welfare and to have child care issues addressed.  That is because it is about ensuring that people can be employed.  I always go back to Maslow's hierarchy of needs and self-actualisation.  We should never prevent people from attaining their highest potential.  I hope the workplace is not somewhere we will see that happen.<\/p> <p>The Minister is committed to addressing the issues around casual work.  It is important that we build on what the Bill provides and what the Department is doing.  I am not against the important idea of having a wider conversation, albeit I do not want to delay matters.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That means that we must park our vested interests and all come together for the common good.

I have had the pleasure of working alongside them.  Mandate represents the very best of the trade union movement.  It is a fighting and campaigning union and we are proud to have its representatives here.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the Bill.  I am pleased that we are again being presented with an opportunity to address the issue of precarious work which has practically become the norm for hundreds of thousands of people.  We believe that, at its core, the Bill is attempting to identify and resolve the issue of precarious work.  It goes some of the way towards resolving it and for that reason, we will be supporting it.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in has long recognised the urgent need to address the exploitation of workers on low-hour, zero-hour and if-and-when contracts.  These contracts are wrong and there needs to be legislation enacted to deal with such exploitation.  Only last week a Senator suggested at the jobs committee that there was an awful lot less of this kind of thing occurring than some people claimed.  Actually, the opposite is the case.  The entire hotel and catering sector now operates on this basis.  For 137,000 workers in the accommodation and food services sector, the average wage is just &euro;325, which is less than half the average wage in the United States.  Precarious contracts are now commonplace in the retail sector.  They have even got a hold in manufacturing plants.  I know this because, during my time as a union official earlier this year, I came across these contracts increasingly, to the point where it became a daily occurrence.<\/p> <p>I echo what Senator Catherine Ardagh and my colleagues in the Labour Party have said.  Women are particularly affected.  For the most part, I was working earlier this year with women in the contract catering industry.  Each week they had to wait to find out how many hours of work they would be given.  They had no rights.  This is appalling.  I give full credit to my colleagues in the Labour Party for introducing the Bill.<\/p> <p>One does not have to take my word for what I am saying.  The University of Limerick report on the prevalence of zero-hour contracts states, \"If and When hours and low working hours are prevalent in the accommodation\/food and retail sectors and in certain occupations in education and health: community care work, so-called 'bank' nursing, general practice nursing, university\/institute of technology lecturing, adult education tutoring, school substitution, caretaking, and secretarial and cleaning work\".<\/p> <p>As Senators know, Sinn F&eacute;in previously brought forward its own Bill in the D&aacute;il to deal with this issue, the Banded Hours Contract Bill.  If passed, it would allow workers to have the ability to plan their daily and weekly lives with some structure.  They would have some idea of how much money would be coming through the door every week and they would be able to plan for rent and food bills and everything else people need in order to live a modest life.  The reality is that some workers are on 15-hour contracts, but they are actually working 30 hours a week.  When they try to apply for a mortgage, they are denied because according to their contract of employment they are guaranteed only 15 hours work.  How exactly are parents supposed to plan for child care when they are not guaranteed a certain number of hours each week?  The core question is how workers are supposed to cope with reality when their contracts are not based on their actual working hours.  The Banded Hours Contract Bill and the Bill before the House are trying to empower workers with the dignity they deserve.  The Banded Hours Contract Bill would allow workers to apply for a contract that was reflective of their actual working week.  The Bill before us, in section 3, would achieve the same.  Of course, we support this proposal.<\/p> <p>Section 4 proposes to amend section 18 in order to ensure the minimum entitlement to payment for employees is extended to cover employees initially engaged to undertake work of a casual nature.  Again, we support this principle.  <\/p> <p>Sections 5 and 6 deal with continuity of employment.  Both sections strike a good balance between the rights of employees and employers and give additional protection to people employed on a casual basis.  <\/p> <p>Section 7 creates an entitlement to a corrected written statement of hours of work and specifies a minimum period of six months.  <\/p> <p>Section 8 is an anti-victimisation provision.  It is needed to give the Bill some teeth.  <\/p> <p>Sections 9 and 10 deal with complaints and adjudication, respectively.<\/p> <p>While we reserve the right to table amendments as the Bill makes its way through the Chamber, we see no case whatsoever for delaying its passage.  The UL report has been sitting on a Minister's desk for a year.  It is actually a disgrace that not one of its recommendations has been implemented to date.  We were not put in this Chamber to procrastinate but to legislate.  It is welcome that both Fine Gael and, belatedly, Fianna F&aacute;il are not going to oppose the Bill on this Stage, which means that we can move it forward.  The workers who have to live on if-and-when or zero-hour contracts need us to act now.  Sinn F&eacute;in is ready to act.  Those affected are ordinary people living under extraordinary pressure.  I am glad that those who were opposed to the Bill have changed their minds.<\/p> <p>I welcome the contrast between what happened in the D&aacute;il, where Fianna F&aacute;il delayed the Banded Hours Contract Bill, and the welcome progress made today.  I appeal to both Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il not to undermine the core elements of the Bill on Committee Stage.  It is too important.  There are hundreds of thousands of workers affected who, as I stated, should not have to wait any longer.  In fairness to Senator Gerald Nash, a very good report was produced by the University of Limerick.  The recommendations have been made and we should all be able to buy into them and support the Bill, not just today but on the crucial Stages to come.  I welcome it.  I welcome the positive comments of the Leader of the House and hope we can build on the consensus and enure we can do more good work to protect workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#UU00200","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":409,"content":"<p>Well done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#UU00300","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I commend the Senators who have introduced the Bill.  It is an excellent and really constructive proposal.  I welcome the representatives of Mandate and acknowledge the strong and important work they have done, work that has very much been led by workers.  I have had the opportunity to meet representatives of the National Women's Council and work with some of the strong women working in the unions and who are leading the charge.  Sectors such as retail and hospitality have been particularly affected by the spread of the contract in question.<\/p> <p>Senators have commended the report produced by the University of Limerick.  The university's research was excellent.  The authors consulted widely and went into the issues deeply.  Some have stated the report does not make specific recommendations on if-and-when contracts.  That is because the terms of the research were such that the focus was on zero-hour and low-hour contracts.  As advocates, we were talking about the concerns we already had about zero-hour contracts, yet the research found even worse circumstances that were becoming even more prevalent.  I refer not only to those left on standby waiting to know if, when and where they will be working but also to those entirely subject to if-and-when contracts and those who are not even afforded the basic and already inadequate protections for those on 15-hour minimum contracts.  This is a very important issue.<\/p> <p>When Senator Gerald Nash was in his ministerial role, he engaged in follow-up consultation, to which we were all very happy to contribute, on the recommendations made.  Therefore, there has already been a strong process.  Not only has the University of Limerick made strong recommendations but there has also been public consultation on them.  I join those who are saying we have the ideas and proposals.  A suite of measures have been put forward by Senators, including Sinn F&eacute;in Senators, on banded-hours contracts.  There is a strong set of proposals which we should all try to expedite.<\/p> <p>These contracts are an interesting study of how, while good practice can often move painfully slowly, bad practice can spread like wildfire.  When we talk about these contracts, it is important to recognise that, as legislators, we are not talking about upsetting the rules and practices of ages but about a new and negative practice that moved very speedily across a number of sectors in the past five to ten years.  It has moved with particular rapidity across sectors in which women tend to predominate.  We have seen that a majority of those on low-hour, short-term precarious-hour contracts, particularly part-time precarious-hour contracts, are women.  The Low Pay Commission has acknowledged this.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to which I shall draw attention.  It is important not only to address casualisation in this area but also the problem of in-work poverty.  These contracts are a massive contributor to the reality of in-work poverty which has a strong gender component. <\/p> <p>This legislation offers very important measures.  First, it reflects the reality of the working environment.  It allows for contracts that reflect the reality.  It allows for transparency regarding the reality of how businesses are planning their work and demands transparency in that regard.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It addresses the key issue of predictability.  I agree with Senator Gavan on child care.  People who do not know from one week to the next when or where they will be working are in a bind.  Many women, with reduced-hour availability because of poor child care, find themselves having to pay in advance for numerous hours of child care without knowing if they will need them or use them.  They have to plan predictable lives for their children without having a predictable or manageable working life.  To get the balance right a priority must be to allow citizens working in Ireland to get the balance right in their lives.  We need to give them the skills, the security and legislation they need to allow them to plan and build predictable lives for themselves and their families.  There is a huge emotional, as well as financial, cost to this kind of contract and there is huge insecurity.  It cuts people off from education or training because if they say \"No\" when they get the call they may not get the hours they need again.  It hinders people from developing themselves and affects their access to credit and mortgages.<\/p><p>The hotel and catering industry was mentioned as a place where casual flexibility may be needed but Senator Nash was clear that where there are sectoral agreements in hospitality and health, which are essential, those agreements can be designed to facilitate appropriate and predictable seasonal work.  I do not believe this legislation is contradictory to that in any way and the predictability needed by workers in that sector can be managed through the JLC process.<\/p><p>The Mandate trade union has carried out research which highlighted the concern that unpredictable hours can be used, and are so used by a majority of firms, as an instrument of power in contract negotiations.  Some worrying power dynamics creep into many sectors when if-and-when contracts become the norm and there are questions to answer for companies, a majority of whose contracts are of the if-and-when variety.  These contracts set up a competitive dynamic in which people have to seek the agreement of somebody who determines schedules and this is very unhealthy.<\/p><p>Three years ago the ESRI did some research on the quality of work in Ireland which highlighted a sense of control over people's working lives.  That research may be useful as our debate progresses.  There are also concerns on hostile scheduling, in which people are scheduled to work in ways that affect the predictability of their lives, something which particularly affects those who take a stance on certain issues.  I may table an amendment on this issue and I look forward to the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#UU00400","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":412,"content":"<p>It seems this House should go into a formal group hug, although I am completely opposed to that, Grinch that I can sometimes be.

The Government accepts it is well intentioned and its stated objective is to provide greater protection for employees by more effectively regulating zero hours and related employment practices.  The Government does not oppose the principle of the Bill, but it cannot support the specific provisions put forward in it for several reasons.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the particular interest Senator Gerald Nash has in this area and his role during the term of the previous Government in commissioning the University of Limerick, UL, study into the prevalence of zero-hour and low-hour contracts in the economy, along with their impact on employees.  When he was a Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Senator Gerald Nash was very much respected in the Department for the significant amount of work he put into this specific area.  This Bill is clearly in response to the UL study.  Unfortunately, it is a limited response which does not address several key recommendations for legislative changes made in the UL report.  The Bill also contains proposals for legislative changes in respect of which the UL study made no specific recommendations for legislative change.  Most importantly, the Bill appears to contain no provisions to address the impacts or unintended consequences of the proposed changes.<\/p> <p>It is worth recalling the main findings of the UL study.  It found that zero-hour contracts, as defined within current employment rights legislation, are not extensively used.  It found low working hours can arise in different forms in employment contracts.  The UL report made a range of recommendations relating to contracts, hours of work and notice, minimum hours, how contracted hours should be determined, collective agreements, data gathering and wider contextual issues.<\/p> <p>The programme for Government contains a commitment to tackle the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work and to strengthen regulation of precarious work.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, who is abroad this week on a trade mission, is committed, along with the Minister of State with responsibility for employment and small business, to bringing forward proposals for legislation to protect workers on low-hour contracts as a follow-up to the UL study.  The Ministers' proposals will take account of the large number of submissions received in response to the public consultation on the study.  Those responses reflect a broad range of views, many of which are diametrically opposed views.  A considerable amount of work has been carried out by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in assessing those submissions, as well as developing proposals which aim to provide balanced and workable solutions to the recommendations made in the UL study.  The Ministers' proposals will address the issues of insecure, low hours work in a more comprehensive but also more balanced manner than the approach taken in this Bill.  The Ministers' proposals will address the concerns expressed in the UL study and in the public consultation about the need to improve the predictability of working hours for workers on insecure, low-hour contracts.<\/p> <p>The issue of contracts indicating low-hour requirements and not reflecting workers working much higher hours over significant periods will be addressed.  The proposals will also seek to ensure workers are better informed about the nature of their employment arrangements, as well as their core terms and conditions at an early stage in their employment.  The Ministers' proposals will include provisions aimed particularly at low paid, more vulnerable workers in terms of the minimum compensation for being called in to work and sent home again.  The Ministers' proposals will recognise that casual working, as well as if-and-when arrangements, can suit both employees and employers in certain circumstances.  The proposals will not, therefore, have the effect of eliminating casual working in all circumstances.  This is in contrast to the proposals contained in this Bill.<\/p> <p>The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is currently engaged in an intensive dialogue process with both the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, where all parties wish to secure broad agreement before finalising the proposals.  This ongoing dialogue process has allowed for the impacts and unintended consequences of the Ministers' proposals to be identified, assessed and adjusted to ensure the negative impacts of the legislative changes are minimised or avoided.  In this respect, the Ministers have been made aware in the development of their proposals, and based on submissions on behalf of employers, that there are many situations where casual or on-call or if-and-when needed arrangements apply, such as in the health care sector, in respect of section 39 service providers, and the education sector.<\/p> <p>The Ministers also recognise these arrangements may suit employees and employers in certain circumstances, a point which the UL study acknowledged.  However, the Labour Party Bill would in effect end these arrangements in all circumstances with potentially negative impacts on employment levels and service delivery in sectors such education, health care, elder care and social care.  These are sectors which rely on the flexibility provided by such arrangements to meet peaks in demand, customer needs and regulatory requirements.<\/p> <p>The Bill contains several provisions, which taken together, would make it virtually impossible for genuine casual employment arrangements to operate in the labour market.  This would be an inappropriate and disproportionate response to the questions raised by the UL report about the use of if-and-when arrangements.  The UL study acknowledged the flexibility offered by genuine if-and-when contracts can be mutually beneficial for employers and employees.  For employers in certain sectors, they provide the flexibility needed to run their business.  For example, in the hospitality and hotel sector, it can allow an employer call in additional staff to service weddings and other functions as required.  In the health sector, these arrangements can help employers satisfy a peak in demand and to fill staffing gaps on a short term basis.<\/p> <p>From a worker's perspective, these arrangements can meet the needs of those who want or need more flexible working arrangements.  For example, it can suit students, older workers, individuals who need to balance work with caring responsibilities or highly skilled and highly paid individuals who choose to avail of such arrangements for lifestyle reasons and to supplement a more stable income.<\/p> <p>On a more general note, the Government remains committed to delivering a social economy model to deliver a strong economy and a fair society.  The maintenance and improvement, where possible, of strong protections for workers has been, and will continue to be, a key element of the Government's policy as we look to build on the progress made in recent years in our economic recovery.<\/p> <p>In this respect, several major reforms have been made in recent years in the area of employment rights and industrial relations, including the most significant reform in the history of the State of the workplace relations machinery for the vindication of individual employee rights; the levelling of the playing field for agency workers by affording them equal treatment in respect of their basic working and employment conditions; the enactment of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Acts 2012 and 2015 which have re-established the joint labour committee and registered employment agreement wage-setting mechanisms which were found to be unconstitutional; reform of the law on employees' right to collective bargaining; and the establishment of the Low Pay Commission.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paul Kehoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1805\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1805&amp;amp;pid=PaulKehoeFG&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These reforms are in addition to the existing specific protections in our employment law for those who work on a part-time or temporary  basis.  For example, a part-time employee cannot be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time employee.<\/p><p>Employee protection legislation applies to a part-time employee in the same way as it applies to a full-time employee.  Fixed-term workers may not be treated less favourably than comparable permanent workers.  All temporary agency workers have a right to equal treatment with regular workers from their first day at work.  There are people who say that the previous Government did nothing for the working man or woman.  I refer those people to the increase in the minimum wage provided for under the last Government despite that we are in the midst of the worst ever recession in the history of this State.  The then Government, comprised of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, in providing for this increase recognised the needs of the working man and the working woman.<\/p><p>In addition to the reform of our employment rights and industrial relations regime, our continued economic recovery and, in particular the progress made in reducing unemployment, is also important in providing better opportunities for all.  In this respect, I welcome the latest employment figures which show that unemployment at below 8% is continuing to fall.  The live register has dropped below 300,000 and the number of people employed exceeds 2 million.  In the year to October 2016, the number of casual and part-time workers decreased by 5,748 or 8.8%.  These figures are encouraging.  That is not to suggest, however, that there are not many challenges to be addressed in terms of improving protections, particularly for low paid, vulnerable workers.  Neither is it to suggest that the improving position in employment and job creation will of itself improve the position of vulnerable workers.  On the contrary, many of those who might be considered to be vulnerable, low-paid workers would include individuals who may have several years and more of service to an employer but they may be working on a contract indicating low-hour requirements and not reflecting much higher hours worked over significant periods or they may have concerns about the predictability of their hours and, therefore, their income and about being called into work for unreasonably short periods of continuous work.  These are some of the key issues which the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and  Innovation and the Minister of State with responsibility for employment and business are seeking to address.  In doing so, their proposals will be a more balanced and comprehensive response to the UL study, more focussed on vulnerable, low-paid workers and nuanced so as to avoid or minimise unintended consequences and their impacts.  The proposals will also have the benefit of having been subject to an intensive dialogue process with ICTU and IBEC, with a view to getting broad agreement.  <\/p><p>In contrast to the Ministers&rsquo; proposals, the Protection of Employment (Uncertain  Hours) Bill 2016, while well-intentioned, does not contain any provisions that would address the impacts or unintended consequences of the proposed legislative changes.  It is a limited response to the University of Limerick, UL, study and it does not address a number of important issues raised by it.  For all of the foregoing reasons, the Government cannot support the Bill.  However, the Government will not oppose it so that it may proceed to pre-legislative scrutiny.  In the meantime, both Ministers are working to bring forward legislative proposals in this area as expeditiously as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016111600002#WW01000","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479292200,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, for his kind remarks about the track record of the previous Government and the work that I did with officials in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to try to transform the industrial relations landscape in this country.

The Labour Party in Government, supported by Fine Gael, in what was the most difficult of circumstances for our country in the context of the deepest recession ever experienced by this State and a troika programme and when other countries across the globe were hollowing out employment protections, introduced robust new collective bargaining laws, reintroduced registered employment agreements, employment regulation orders and joint labour committee systems and established the Low Pay Commission and twice increased the national minimum wage.

In doing so, and I do not wish to exaggerate the point, we are driving people into the arms of the Donald Trumps of this world.  People believe that if they do not have a stake in the enterprise for which they work they do not have a stake in society and thus they become more distant from the centre and more distant from their communities.
