I welcome the opportunity to assist the inquiry and I will be pleased to address any questions the committee may wish to ask pertaining to your remit.  My background is that I have spent my career to date working in financial services in Ireland with a particular focus on capital markets and treasury activities.  Immediately prior to my role as finance director at Ulster Bank Group, I spent three years as director with responsibility for finance and treasury at First Active plc, the former First National Building Society, which had converted to plc and floated on the Stock Exchange in 1998.  I was appointed finance director of the Ulster Bank Group in January 2004, following the acquisition of First Active plc by the Ulster Bank Group on behalf of Royal Bank of Scotland.  I remained in this position until December 2007.  And this move to Ulster Bank represented a move from the position of finance director of a publicly quoted company to a reporting line internally in the RBS group, to the group finance director in what was a very much larger multinational  organisation.<\/p> <p>  My specific responsibilities in my capacity as finance director of Ulster Bank included the integration of the First Active and Ulster Bank Group financial accounting systems onto the RBS Group accounting platform; decision support to all of the business areas of the Ulster Bank Group in matters of finance; review of group accounting policies and practices; and assessing and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.  I was chairman of the Ulster Bank Group tax policy and controls committee, the group assets and liabilities committee, the group reconciliations committee and the finance supervisory committee.  <\/p> <p>  My brief included responsibility for statutory and regulatory reporting as well as financial controls and reconciliations for so long as the financial accounting systems resided in Ulster Bank Group.  A major element of my role while in the Ulster Bank Group was delivery of a hugely complex  integration of the financial accounting systems of both First Active and Ulster Bank onto the RBS group financial accounting systems.<\/p><p>With differing regulatory, legal, taxation and even currency regimes, this was an extraordinarily complex project, which had to be delivered while maintaining continuity of accounting reporting and, indeed, controls in Ulster Bank Group throughout the period.<\/p><p> Following completion of the migration project, production of statutory and regulatory accounts, along with the principal accounting services for the Ulster Bank Group, moved to the RBS Group accounting function in Scotland.  As a wholly owned subsidiary of RBS, the role of finance director, as indicated, was much more specialised than might have been encountered in a stand-alone company or, indeed, than I had experienced at First Active plc.  It was, effectively, a divisional management position within the RBS finance function with additional responsibility, including in relation to statutory accounts and regulatory reporting.  Following completion of the integration project and the move of the principal accounting services to Scotland, the role was further narrowed, becoming a role heavily focused on the hugely important business support and financial controls, as well as reporting to, and very close engagement with, RBS Group finance.  In practical terms, the role can be represented as a specialised accounting role at that stage.<\/p><p> I reported to the CEO of Ulster Bank Group and, in parallel, to the RBS Group finance director.  And this latter relationship reflected that, in large part, my responsibilities were carried out under RBS Group strategy, policies, and often under direct influence and control.  I had little involvement in operational matters in the business which did not directly involve delivery by the finance function.  The Ulster Bank finance function had no involvement, for example, in credit policy and strategy and was not represented on the group risk credit policy and strategy committee, which was responsible for maintaining asset quality, determining policy, and ensuring adequate controls within the parameters of the RBS policy framework.<\/p><p> Central to this operating structure is the functional nature of the RBS Group organisational structure.  RBS Group operates as an integrated group requiring that control, policy and process and so forth are driven and controlled from the centre.  A particularly significant instance of this was that, from the outset, RBS Group treasury assumed responsibility for, among other things, treasury and balance sheet management functions and undertook to meet the capital and funding needs of Ulster Bank Group directly.  I had proposed the retention of baseline treasury capability in Ulster Bank Group from the outset but this was not in keeping with RBS policy and was not accepted.  From Ulster Bank's perspective, then, capital funding requirements and balance sheet metrics were viewed in the context of the overall RBS Group situation rather than from a stand-alone perspective.  Ulster Bank was a small part of the RBS Group and in Ulster Bank we had limited influence on, or control responsibility for, the RBS Group balance sheet management.  This approach by RBS Group certainly had cost and scale benefits and had the effect for the group of enabling divisions to focus on business delivery while the RBS Group centre delivered the structural supports, such as the funding capital and balance sheet management.  These structural requirements would, of course be ... form an integral part of management in a stand-alone entity.  <\/p><p> I mention these matters, Chairman, to clarify my role and reporting relationships, as they operated within the RBS policy framework, and to provide the committee with some insight into my role within a wholly owned subsidiary.  That said, I clearly recognise and accept that, as a member of the boards of Ulster Bank Group and as a member of the RBS finance board - that being a committee of the finance directors of RBS divisions and senior finance personnel from RBS Group centre, which was chaired by the RBS Group finance director - I have responsibility for my part in developments within Ulster Bank Group between 2004 and 2007 and any impacts that these developments had on the banking sector generally.  I very much regret that, like so many others, I did not foresee, during my time in Ulster Bank Group, the extent of the difficulties arising within the RBS Group, the extent or duration of the turbulence in wholesale funding markets, the collapse of the property market in Ireland and, indeed, the resulting difficulties for Ulster Bank Group and the impacts on people and the population as a whole.  I dearly wish that we could have known that even ... then even a small part of what we now know so that we might have been able to pursue a different course.  I'm happy, Chairman, to address any questions the committee wish to ask within the context of the inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Torpey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Torpey.  Mr. Gallagher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#D00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430953200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I welcome the opportunity to appear before this inquiry and I shall be as helpful as I can in assisting you in your work.  My opening remarks this morning are supplementary to the written statement, which I submitted to the inquiry on 9 April.<\/p> <p>  My professional background is in international banking.  Prior to joining Ulster Bank I was head of corporate banking international for AIB, with responsibility for businesses in London, Frankfurt and Paris.  I joined as chief executive, corporate markets, at Ulster Bank Group in late 2005 and worked at the bank until I resigned in September 2011.<\/p><p>I joined the bank well into its growth phase, and in the six years I spent working there, I oversaw a two year period of growth followed by four years of intensive portfolio management and remediation of the corporate markets divisions of the bank.<\/p><p> The reputation and strength of RBS Group was a key factor in influencing my decision to join Ulster Bank.  RBS was then a very successful bank.  It was held in high regard globally, and I believe the significant presence they had in Europe, the US and Asia could be leveraged to the benefit of Irish companies seeking to expand in those markets.  Looking back, I was excited about the opportunity to develop and grow a corporate business here to compete with AIB and Bank of Ireland.<\/p><p> As chief executive of the corporate markets, my responsibilities included corporate banking, business and commercial banking, property finance, capital markets in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland.  Corporate markets had approximately 1,700 people working in Dublin, Belfast and 32 business centres around the island.<\/p><p> On my arrival into the business, Ulster Bank already had a well developed and long-standing property division.  The commercial property loan book was then approximately 60% of the corporate loan book.  On joining, a key objective of mine was to diversify the portfolio.  I sought to do this by bringing the RBS global capacity and products to the corporate and business customers in Ireland.  In order to facilitate this objective, I oversaw a significant expansion of the business centre network, the enhancement of the corporate systems capability and initiate a substantial training and investment in our people, particularly on financial and cash flow analysis. <\/p><p> The bank's strategy was to become a third force in the Irish universal banking market, to challenge the dominance of the big two.  As a wholly-owned subsidiary bank, treasury, capital funding and balance sheet management was provided to us by RBS.  Our focus in corporate markets was on growth and diversification of income streams.<\/p><p> The bank's strategy and business agenda were underpinned by a control and reporting framework, which was aligned with the wider RBS group.  We were plugged directly into the RBS credit approval framework.  The risk, credit, finance operations, internal audit, HR and treasury functions all reported into RBS on a matrix basis.  The concept of first and second line of defence was deeply imbedded in the RBS approach to the control environment.  The risk management division of Ulster Bank, which was independent of the corporate markets, was structured, resourced and managed in a manner consistent with other RBS divisional risk management functions.  We were obliged to operate within the parameters of a comprehensive and detailed policy rules and guidelines, which prescribed how risks were to be managed.  These policies covered lending limits and approval structures, LTV limits, stress testing and evaluation processes.<\/p><p> In my view, the governance structures and policies at Ulster Bank were adequate.  Did everything work according to plan?  No, I can't say everything did.  However, in the vast majority of situations, the rigour and consistency of the bank's approach worked well.  The critical mistake was to base our ambitious growth strategy on economic assumptions which we firmly believed to be well founded, but which proved in time to be seriously flawed.  When I joined the bank in 2005, the internal economic analysis and pretty much all of the external economic analysis forecasted continued GDP growth into the medium term.  Ireland had experienced a property boom which had lasted then over ten years, driven in main by the fundamental factors such as low interest rate regime, increasing population, strong growth in employment and rising household incomes.  Corporate activity was particularly strong from the late 1990s onwards through a combination of buoyant indigenous enterprise and foreign direct investment.<\/p><p> Come 2007 when the signals of the slow down became apparent, most economic analysis, including our own, predicted the notorious soft landing.  The consequence of the reliance on flawed assumptions allied to the failure to critically analysis and challenge the pace and extent of the property construction lending has been clear to everyone.  As a former director of Ulster Bank, I deeply regret this.  I spent the period from 2008 onwards remediating the business.  During this period and as a member of the executive of Ulster Bank, we sought and received RBS approval for an action plan to protect the Ulster Bank franchise in Ireland.  In corporate markets, this plan included the allocation of over 300 people to a new division to manage the deteriorating portfolio; the reduction of the intergroup lending limit, which had grown substantially following the introduction of the bank guarantee scheme in the Republic of Ireland, of which Ulster Bank was not part; and the reduction of the cost base of the organisation and the re-shape and re-size of the business to reflect the new economic reality.<\/p><p>Through this very difficult period we continue to have the support and faith of the new RBS management team which has brought in to manage business.  Thank you for listening to my opening remarks and I am happy to address the questions from the members of the inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Gallagher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Thank you Mr. Gallagher and thank you earlier Mr. Torpey.

In particular having invested very heavily in both the purchase of the banks in Ireland and the systems costs that were applied, they sought to grow to be a competitor with, an equal with, or indeed to match the incumbent full-service banks, being AIB and Bank of Ireland.  The strategy, therefore, was one of growth.  The growth was predicated on an environment where there was a near-universal view that the growth prospects for the Irish market continued to be strong and that Ireland was on a good path, shall we say.  Any ambitions to grow the business were subject to the constraints of the risk appetite of the group, subject to the controls, procedures and policies of the RBS Group, as transmitted to Ulster Bank.  So while we had an objective to grow the business, a clear desire and ambition to grow the business, the RBS Group was not tolerant of relaxing standards and controls in pursuit of that growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#N01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Torpey"},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":90,"content":"<p>The Central Bank Governor, nevertheless, I quoted yesterday to McCarthy, said that, you know, growth of 20% or greater should send out warning signals of the balance sheet, that you could quickly come into dangerous territory.

And if you think about what Ulster Bank is on the Republic of Ireland ... in ... for instance, in Donegal, Ulster Bank's market share might be 20%, whereas in Cork and Kerry it might be 2%.

So if we find that ... and I believe it to be the case when I was there, that the majority of debt service policy breaches were for high income earners, that is a mitigant which is acceptable and would have been reflected in the policy revision subsequently.  And I believe also that a very high proportion of those exceptions will have been minor exceptions - as in, very marginally above the policy limits.  It doesn't take from the fact - and it's very, very important, Deputy, I would agree - that where you do have exceptions arising, that they are challenged by the board and satisfactory explanations along the lines I've given or such other as they may be are arrived at to ensure that credit risk appetite is being adhered to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Torpey"},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I think it is fair to say that stress tests failed to capture the outcomes that were to transpire over time, perhaps if for no other reason, that the scale of events was entirely unprecedented and off the scale of any past experience or expectation that might have been captured in an analysis conducted at that time, of even severe but implausible future events.

I think what appears to explain to some extent the difference between what was seen in the stress tests that were conducted and the actual outcomes, is the severity of events and the pervasive nature of those events as they transpired over time.  While stress tests will have looked at percentage changes in values that are here, and while the actual fallen values was materially greater than this, that will have had its own set of impacts.  But I suggest also that the stress tests proved insufficient to capture the wider range of impacts, starting with the international crisis that happened at the same time, extending into the wider fiscal impacts of the downturn in activity in the economy.

Ultimately Ulster Bank was going to compete with two big huge, with two big players in the Irish market, your ambition was to get on to a level kind of pegging position with them.

So there was an active strategy both in the retail bank and the commercial business bank to win the completeness of a customer proposition and that is, deposits, clearing accounts and lending and that was the strategy as evidenced by the branch openings around the country.

And I would subscribe to that; I think it's very important that they are.  Shareholders in many banks had their shareholding values wiped out, they took a fair share of losses, there's no doubt about that.  Banks themselves suffered further penalties and executives in many cases suffered as well.

So we ... that was captured by the speculative lending policy, the same 3%.  So we ... the firm ... the bank was entirely constrained in that and did very little in any of it.  To the extent that the bank funded investment property, the bank would look at things like the quality of the tenants, the mix of tenants, the location of the asset, the level of cash coverage generated by the rental income, the term of the lease, and would lend based on that and an assessment of the owner and an assessment of the valuation.  And those assets on the investment portfolios tended to be large assets and tended to be in large conurbations, including London and Dublin.  And those assets had a repayment capacity through the cash generation from the rental income.  On development lending, Deputy, the location was critical; the nature of the number of homes that could be put on the asset; the assumption of a sales price; the cost to construct; a sensitivity that said, \"Well, what happens if price drops?\"; an assessment of how long the build is to take; a look at the track record of the developer - what has they ... what have they done in other sites?  Have they finished on time?  Have they had cost overruns?  Have they sold?

My team's emphasis was on short-term forecasting and we produced and published quarterly forecasts for GDP, inflation, employment, etc.  These high-frequency short-term forecasts are designed to paint a picture over a two-year time horizon or occasionally less.  Longer-term projections in Ireland are published by the ESRI, which produces forecasts for up to a quarter of a century ahead every two or three years.  And, you've already discussed these with Dr. FitzGerald.  For the economic input into the five-year planning circle ... cycle, Ulster Bank used the ESRI medium-term forecasts.  As all ESRI forecasts, benchmark, high and low variants, envisaged a soft landing - and I refer you to my table in my supplementary witness statement - it follows that all UB medium-term planning was also predicated on a soft landing.  I effectively buttressed this view in terms of my rolling quarterly short-term economic updates and <i>ad-hoc<\/i>reviews.  My forecasts, and those of all other short-term forecasters, remained positive up until early 2008.  The turnaround was then dramatic.  At that time, the central expectation was that 2009 GDP would grow by 3.6%.  Eighteen months later, the consensus was that it would fall by about 8.3%.  This about-turn came too late to influence events, as the credit that fuelled the boom had been extended between 2004 and 2007.  I was generally regarded as being towards the more pessimistic end of the range of short-term forecasters ...certainly over that period.<br\/><br\/>I should add that any views in the UB publications were mine alone and there was no difference between the internal and external positions I adopted.  I was given freedom of speech by Ulster Bank, even if some of the things I said made them uncomfortable on occasion.  I was a trenchant critic of the loose fiscal policy adopted and I was an outspoken advocate of a soft landing.  In general, I did not input directly into the credit, the risk or the lending functions in Ulster Bank.  Instead, my job was to produce regular economic briefings and they used them as they saw fit.  However, there was the occasional exception and I recently came across a case where UB credit drafted a report based on my output and, somewhat unusually, I received a copy of it.  It summarises my views in early 2004 and if you don't mind, Chairman, I'll quote from it:<blockquote>UB Economic Research unit (Pat McArdle) views on the ROI Housing Sector remain positive in the updated report dated 25 February 2004.  Its rating however is amber, taking due recognition of the cycle. ... Neither of the usual major negative influences on the housing market (rapid rises and interest rates and unemployment) is forecast. ...<br \/><br \/>Major changes are due on the supply side - last year['s] completions were in excess of 68 [thousand] but underlying demand is believed to be [around] 50 [thousand].  The difference is accounted for by pent up demand and holiday homes.  There are signs that the building industry is aware of this and has the capacity to orchestrate a smooth transition but this is not certain.  Pat McArdle does not rule out the possibility of a price correction of up to 20%.  Even if this were to happen we do not think that this would have major knock-on effects, given bank capital requirements and stress testing.<\/blockquote><\/p><p>A 20% fall in nominal prices would've equated to a much greater fall in real prices, about 35%, that's when you're after making allowance for inflation.  In effect, therefore, I warned, in February 2004, that real house prices could decline by 35% ... that's within the 30% to 50% range predicted by the two main contrarians some three years later.  My main regret, Chairman, is that I did not continue in this vein.  I should have stepped up my warnings as the housing market initially slowed and then regained momentum and even stronger growth.  However, if anything, my later pronouncements are more consensual in that I did not disagree with the projected 15% to 20% fall in real prices advocated by the Central Bank and the ESRI.  Of course, had I continued in the vein I just outlined, I would've been treated as a contrarian.  Few agreed with them, and while it's cold comfort, it's unlikely that I would've been listened to either.  Indeed, it's ironic that even though I disagreed with the contrarians later, we had stress tested in Ulster Bank for their more extreme predictions.  The problem was not house prices<i>per se<\/i>, but developer and real estate lending and we did not spot it or stress test for it, certainly sufficiently.<br\/><br\/>I want to make the following points.  A soft landing and it's perhaps no harm to dwell on it for a minute since this has received such currency and it may not be as understood in the sense that I understand it.  So a soft landing would've been quite bumpy, involving substantial job losses and up to &euro;3 billion, I had estimated, in tax revenue foregone.  In other words, it would've left a major hole in the budget.  The regulators, management and board bear most responsibility for the collapse here as elsewhere, and I'll come back to that.  Ulster Bank rejected the hard landing hypothesis, but stress tested for house price declines of 56% in real terms.  That was at the very upper end of the range predicted by the contrarians.  This was insufficient because the actual recession was much greater than anyone predicted.<br\/><br\/>I go on now, Chairman, to talk about the implications of a soft landing for a moment.  It could've been, as I said, quite bumpy.  A soft landing that saw house completions fall from their peak around 90,000 to the 50,000 sustainable medium-term level estimated by the ESRI would've had significant implications.  I'd calculated that every 10,000 houses represented one percentage point off growth and that a soft landing would involve 30,000 construction job losses and up to &euro;3 billion in tax revenue foregone.<br\/><br\/>I go on to speak about the regulator.  There were no strong incentives for banks to make arbitrary judgements about the prudent limits of credit expansion.  Hence, the infamous comment by Chuck Prince, chairman of Citigroup: &quot;When the music stops ... things will be complicated, but as long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance.&quot;  The regulator's job is to stop the music, or as it's more often put, &quot;To take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going&quot;.  All regulators failed to do this.  This was a major failing and much of the focus post-crisis has centred on improving bank supervision.  Indeed, responsibility for bank supervision of euro area banks has been removed entirely from national supervisors.<br\/><br\/>When I worked in the banking area of the Department of Finance in the '70s and '80s, I had the distinct impression that when the regulator said, &quot;Jump&quot;, the bank's response was, &quot;How high?&quot;  I was therefore shocked to read in the Honohan report that the regulator spent almost a decade in fruitless correspondence with one financial institution without ever achieving anything.  Clearly, the boot had shifted to the other foot and the regulated, instead of the regulator, were now calling the shots.  However, it seems, and I've only learned this recently, it seems that this only applied to prudential regulation, as bank representatives have testified to this inquiry last week that the regime on the consumer side remained quite strict, which would've been my memory of it from 20 years earlier.  Therefore, I disagree with the conclusion in the Honohan report that the major responsibility lay with the directors and senior managements of the banks that got into trouble.  In my view, the regulator had a higher degree of responsibility.  And this should go without saying, really, because the regulator's job is to promote the safety and soundness of the banking system.<br\/><br\/>If the banks were capable of regulating themselves, there would, of course, be no need for rules and regulations and regulators.  In saying this, I just want to emphasise that I am by no means trying to absolve the banks from blame.  As is clear from the Nyberg and other reports, that there were many actors involved and that the banks were up there at the top.  However, the regulator was the only one who had full information on large exposures and, critically, the only institution that could have sought to curb excessive balance sheet growth.  It was only when the loans were transferred to NAMA in 2010 that it was revealed that the big developers had multiple exposures to the different banks.  The regulator should have had full details from the large exposures reports that it received - I think they were quarterly - and it would've been a simple matter to add them up.  Finally, in this section, in 2009, Patrick Honohan, then Professor of Economics at TCD, wrote, and this has been quoted here yesterday:  <blockquote>A very simple warning sign used by most regulators to identify a bank exposed to increased risk is rapid balance sheet growth.  An annual growth rate of 20 per cent real is often taken as the trigger... Anglo Irish Bank, crossed it in eight of nine years, and indeed its average annual rate of growth 1998-2007 was 36 per cent... So this was a very obvious and public danger sign.<\/blockquote>On this basis the alarm bells should've been ringing for the best part of a decade.<br\/><br\/>Stress testing.  Ulster Bank stress tested for a 36% fall in nominal house prices in its severe stress scenario.  That was equivalent to a real fall ... a fall in real prices, sorry, of 56%, i.e. it was at the very upper end of the range predicted by the contrarians.  Indeed, it was slightly above the upper end, I think.  However, the real problem was commercial and not mortgage lending, and this was not adequately stress tested.  In 2007, at the behest of the Bank of England FSA, global adverse scenarios for the UK, US and euro area were produced by RBS Group economics and we commissioned the ESRI to help translate them into three Irish shock scenarios: a mild, once in a decade, a medium, once in a quarter century, and a severe, once in century recession.  I supplied the ESRI with the external ... these external global assumptions for the three shock scenarios in April 2007.  These scenarios are based on global economic shocks, which severely affected growth, employment, credit, etc., and we left it up to the ESRI and their model to determine the impact of this on the Irish economy and on Irish house prices.<br\/><br\/>The severe scenario envisages a downturn of a magnitude not seen in the post-war period, greater than the 2009 UK recession and greater than any ... anyone else ... there was no other one that was known at that time.  It entailed GDP everywhere going negative for a few years, unemployment rising to low double digits, short-term interest rates falling to be 1% or below, and Irish credit contracting by 5% per annum for a few years.  This results are given in the accompanying table.  In general, the outcome was worse than predicted ... that's the outcome in the event was worse than the scenarios we utilised I just should say for clarification ... and this was mainly because the impact of the construction rate of decline ... related decline, was vastly greater than expected, with new house completions virtually coming to a halt, whereas the model had predicted a fall of 20,000 units only.  The predicted nominal house price fall, however, was 36% and, of course, the actual, as we now know, was 50%.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, Chairman, the financial crisis has been described as an example of groupthink.  In my experience, and I've now been through it, groupthink is almost impossible to understand unless you've experienced it.  I suggest that a useful way to approach it is, perhaps, to look at two more recent examples.  First, the Central Bank's proposed macro-prudential limits on mortgage lending were eminently sensible and less severe than the regime that applied when I took out my first mortgage, yet they were almost universally opposed, even by the Department of Finance, and were watered down in the event.  Second, the expansionary 2015 budget was condemned by IFAC, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, a body expressly established to advise on policy and also by most economists, yet the Government persisted with widespread support from beneficiaries and politicians.  So in my opinion, groupthink may well be alive and well.<br\/><br\/>The Bank for International Settlements was the only major institution I know of to warn of the crisis and I want to end with a quote from it.  In a presentation in 2013, Bill White, who was the former chief economist there, reflected on why his warnings were ignored, and this is also relevant to groupthink.  He said, and I quote: <blockquote>There were a few who did warn that there were serious problems building up under the smooth surface of the Great Moderation.  I would like to believe that we at the BIS saw it more clearly than many others, though certainly the timing and the precise nature of its unfolding eluded us ... Why were these warnings (both public and private) not heeded?  Why were the historical antecedents not given more emphasis?  I am going to suggest in the immortal line of Flanders and Swan, that it was &quot;A Tale of Seduction&quot;.  All of the parties who contributed to the crisis (borrowers, lenders, regulators, central banks, academics and politicians) were each seduced by [the] various influences into believing different things that were not true.  Moreover, since seduction normally involves more than one party, the relationships between these various parties also contributed to their having 'no eye to see and no ear to hear'.<\/blockquote>Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#JJ00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat McArdle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":549,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

Good afternoon, everyone.  Thank you for inviting me along to speak to you.  As requested, I've furnished a statement addressing certain designated lines of inquiry to the banking crisis.  I've also included some general points which I feel are relevant and rather than read out the full statement, I just want to summarise a few remarks.<\/p> <p>  Just by way of background, I was employed by Bank of Ireland in the role of chief economist from February 2001 to August 2013.  I think Mr. Chairman, you ... in your opening remark, you said 1999.  Just to clarify, it was 2001.<\/p><p>During that time my office was in the dealing room of global markets, which was responsible for executing the bank's funding strategy and in providing a service on foreign exchange and interest rates to the customer base.  I was in charge of the bank's economic research unit, which produced analysis and commentary on the Irish and UK economies and in developments in the financial markets.  The unit also provided support to other areas of the Bank of Ireland Group, including a written monthly summary of economic and financial developments to the chief executive.  As chief economist, I also participated in meetings with rating agencies, counterparty banks, and on occasion, debt and equity investors, as well as presentations to customers on economic outlook.  I reported to the head of global markets.<\/p><p> I now want to turn to a couple of general observations on the banking crisis.  The first relates to the banking system that operated in Ireland prior to the crash and to highlight that although there were common features, the range of the subsequent losses illustrates that the banks differed greatly in terms of credit standards, risk appetite, geographical spread and exposure and degree of loan concentration.  Second, banks are mainly staffed by specialists, and in light of the fact that the bank is a publicly-traded company, other than information published in the market, everything is done on a need-to-know basis, which is particularly true in terms of crisis.  A third point relates to the narrative that has developed around the banking crisis, which, given the benefit of hindsight, risks overstating what was known at any point in time.  Our knowledge of the outcome makes it difficult to judge past events.  We should also be clear as to what published data was available and when, an issue I address in more detail in my furnished statement.<\/p><p> In my view, there were three separate factors contributing to the crisis, each overlapping in exacerbating the other.  The first was the property market: Ireland experienced a residential property boom which lasted well over ten years, and in my view, until around 2005, was mainly driven by fundamental factors, including strong growth in employment, rising household incomes, a move to a lower interest rate regime following euro membership and an extraordinary increase in population of, it was a 17% rise in the decade to 2006 of 615,000.  It was only in the latter stages of the boom which saw an easing of credit standards and the Central Bank quarterly survey data of credit standards shows this, particularly from 2005.  Affordability also started to deteriorate and my own affordability model pointed to a marked increase in the cost of servicing a new mortgage in 2007.  Particularly following the monetary tightening initiated by the ECB, we saw the repo rate rise from 2% to a high of 4.25%, which wasn't reached 'till July 2008.  I initially felt, in 2007, that the slowdown in the housing market would involve flat or falling real prices and not a fall in nominal prices, as the latter had only happened once in Ireland over the previous 30 years.  The Irish economy is very open and hence heavily influenced by the international economic cycle, although from 1970 onwards, the Irish economy had contracted in GDP terms in only one year, which was 1982.  The consensus view in mid-2008, which I shared, was that any US recession would be as short-lived as had been the case in the previous two, which had been 1990-91 and 2001.  Both had lasted only eight months.  This didn't prove to be the case, of course, and I believed that the unprecedented collapse of the global credit markets which followed the Lehman bankruptcy in September 2008, was a second and decisive negative which hit the Irish economy and the banking sector.  The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, called it a \"one in 100-year event\". We will never know how steep the Irish property correction would have been in the absence of that collapse and I find it at variance with the facts that some people appear to play down its significance in relation to the banking crisis.  The impact of the credit crunch was certainly extreme, both internationally and in Ireland.  The S&amp;P index fell by 50%, GDP in the developed economies experienced its largest post-war contraction, and Irish GDP, which actually rose by 1.2% in the third quarter of 2008, on the initial figures that were published at that time, contracted by an extraordinary 7.1% in the final three months of 2008.  The total contraction in the recession was about 12.5%.  So over half of that was experienced in just three months, post-Lehman.<\/p><p> Commercial property prices also tumbled, a prime factor behind the decline in the value of bank assets, with record falls recorded in many countries.  UK prices fell by 26% in 2008, while the plunge in Irish values was also unprecedented.  Capital values had fallen by 10% in the first half of the year, before falling by 15% in the third quarter and 18% in the final quarter of 2008 and a further 18% in the first half of 2009.  It is also noteworthy that Ireland chose to mark to market these assets at an extreme stage of the cycle.  It is also noteworthy that not many other countries, if any, followed that example.  <\/p><p> Few, if any, envisaged the effective collapse of the global credit system, while the unprecedented scale of the policy response, including massive state support for banks, zero and even negative interest rates, which are still with us, seven years later, QE and new capital and liquidity rules for the global banking sector, is also testimony to the singular degree of financial disruption that emerged post-Lehman, with the ramifications still being felt, noticeably of course in the euro area.  Finally, a third factor emerged in 2010, and again I don't think this is given enough attention, which relates to the sovereign debt crisis, which by 2012 had developed into an existential crisis for the euro.  State support for the banking sector, initially seen as positive, was now perceived as adding stress to already high sovereign debt levels and the subsequent fall in government bond prices added to bank losses, given their holdings of government debt, a phenomenon that became known as the doom loop.  In that context, it is noteworthy that a number of official reports into the banking crisis in Ireland, including Professor Honohan's, was commissioned in 2010, presumably on the view that the worst was over, but ECB lending to Irish-headquartered banks was higher in early 2011 than in 2008, and ELA support also peaked in 2011.  New regulatory capital requirements also resulted in widespread bank deleveraging, so adding a further downward pressure to asset property markets.<\/p><p> In 2012, the Central Bank's housing models show that Irish residential prices were now as much as 26% below fundamental value.  It is also of note that the Central Bank's prudential capital assessment review, or PCAR, which began in, which was in March 2011, identified a large capital shortfall in the main Irish banks and that ... and then substantially overestimated the projected pre-impairment profitability.  In the event, the requirement to off-load assets and to increase deposits put significant pressure on net interest margin.  The scale and extent to private sector-deleveraging Ireland, which is still apparent, also resulted in a larger fall in bank assets than envisaged in the PCAR.<\/p><p> In summary, the correction under way in the Irish property market in 2008 turned into a crisis for the economy and the banking system in the wake of the post-Lehman collapse in the global credit system and a fallout from the subsequent sovereign debt crisis in Europe was a significant factor in delaying the return to bank profitability and in slowing the pace of economic recovery in Ireland.

You asked me to give evidence on eight lines of inquiry relating to my role as chief economist of Allied Irish Banks.  Now I've covered these as best I can in my written statement of 9 April, and I propose today just to summarise the main points of those lines of inquiry.  Before I do so, I want to clarify that I was not the chief economist of Allied Irish Banks in the period leading up to the banking crisis.  I was promoted to this role in a restructured bank in late 2011, a position I held briefly until my retirement in 2012.  My actual position from 1992 to 2011 was that of chief economist, global treasury.  My role was primarily focused on advice within wholesale treasury and supporting corporate and commercial treasury in relation to general economic issues, particularly around the outlook for interest rates and exchange rates.  The economic research unit which I headed was located within wholesale treasury in the capital markets division.  The AIB Group's property-related Irish exposures were in the retail Ireland division.  Overall risk management, capital management and relations with the supervisory authorities were handled at group division level.<\/p><p>Though part of global treasury, my unit was a limited resource available to other business units across AIB and provided on-demand services to other parts of the group.  One area of support was in relation to stress testing.  My unit produced and published research and I will deal with aspects of that in the questions following my statement.<\/p><p> In giving evidence before this committee, on the lines of inquiry indicated to me, I believe therefore it's important to clarify that I did not occupy a central role within the AIB Group, or a management role in the lending strategy of the retail division.  Furthermore, in relation to some of the lines of inquiry in which I've been asked to give evidence, I must point out that I had very little involvement with the Department of Finance or the Central Bank - Financial Regulator, during my career in AIB.<\/p><p> The first line of inquiry you asked me to comment on was in relation to banks' risk appetite and the appropriateness of their property-related credit policies.  In relation to risk appetite, I make the point in my statement, I use a risk appetite statement from AIB from 2007, and then contrast it with the concentration of property as set out in the bank's presentation on their results for 2006, which shows that property lending constituted 33% of total lending.  I make the point that reconciling the two is only possible, in my opinion, on the basis that AIB believed that its business was well-diversified geographically and sectorally, well managed, of good quality and low risk, based on its customer profile and knowledge of its customers' financial standing.  I believe that banks focussed primarily on what they perceived to be the quality of their individual loan books, with less consideration of the potential systemic risks in the Irish banking system as a whole, and the contagion risks, should serious problems emerge in an important bank, particularly given their overall dependence on external funding.<\/p><p> As to the appropriateness of property related credit policies, I'd make a general point that the sustained growth in the Irish economy in terms of real GDP and employment meant that the assets of the banking system became increasingly tied up in bricks and mortar in one form or another over the period.  As banks are the main source of finance for the Irish private sector, there is a high correlation between the growth in credit and GDP\/GNP.  The appropriateness of Irish bank lending policies cannot be divorced from the stance of fiscal policy, other macro-economic policies, and the role of monetary and prudential policy.  Here, I want to integrate a comment on the third line of inquiry as to the appropriateness of macro-economic and prudential policy, in commenting on this first issue.  Strong growth in bank lending occurred against a very expansionary fiscal policy which provided misguided support to bank lending policies.  Monetary conditions were also very favourable.  Interest rates were too low.  Prudential policy was too deferential and failed to pick up on warning signs.  Last but not least, banks, as described by the Nyberg report, were engaged in high-risk growth strategies involving a significant expansion of credit.  There were no countervailing policies in operation.<\/p><p> Research shows that while the decade of 1990s was primarily driven by exports, the expansion of credit was also a key contributory factor.  Strong employment growth and the rise in the population led to a large increase in house building.  Furthermore, the ratio of private sector debt to GDP was well within the range of other countries.  In the period after entry into EMU, in my opinion, developments prior to around 2002-03 could be characterised as still within acceptable ranges for many key ratios.  A period of slower growth was warranted thereafter as the growth in total lending carried increasing levels of risk as property price inflation and investment and construction headed for unsustainable levels based on international standards.  I set out a number of statistics in my written statement relating to credit expansion which I won't go into here in this summary.<\/p><p> On the second line of inquiry, relating to risk concentration in base, and in adverse scenarios, I would say that stress testing was undertaken within AIB by the stress testing steering group which was part of the central group risk management framework.  My role was to present an overview of the economic scenarios to the STSG based on, for instance, the initial economic data provided by the regulatory authorities, either in the UK or in Ireland.  The aim was to provide group and divisional risk management, finance and credit units, with the fullest possible understanding of the transition from the base case to the adverse economic scenarios.  The actual calculation of the effects of the adverse economic scenarios on the bank's capital and other metrics was undertaken by analysts within the group and divisional risk and credit units.  When it comes to concentration risk, the methodology changed over time to include additional studies to examine the correlation between sectors, particularly in relation to property.  Adjustments were made to the impact on credit provisions to take account of this factor.<\/p><p> As to the third line of inquiry, the adequacy of the assessment and communication of both solvency and liquidity risks in the banking institutions and sector, here I'm really looking at the role of the three policy makers, and I want to focus particularly on fiscal policy, because it seems to me, and certainly from my experience of the Department of Finance, that far too much of the time of the Department is taken up with the annual budget process.  Macro-economic issues over the medium term, or other issues, are not really handled effectively within the Department.  And in terms of publications from the Department, they tend to just simply back up what's contained in the supporting ... what's contained in the annual budget statements.  So therefore, there were no commentaries, that I'm aware of, from the Department, relating to the property sector in the period leading up to the crisis.  The prudential practice covered both micro and macro policies and, I'm quoting here from the Honohan report which pointed out quite a lot of deficiencies in the way in which these policies were carried out, but at no stage did the assessment of the banking system, such as it was, show any concerns about liquidity or solvency issues.<\/p><p> On the macro prudential side there were annual financial stability reports published between 2004 to 2007.  These reports failed to trigger a more cautious approach within the banking system.  An important earlier point worth noting is that several research papers produced within the Central Bank and by the ESRI, the IMF and the OECD, consistently came to the conclusion that Irish house prices were overvalued, often by significant amounts.  I believe that the consistency of this conclusion should have alerted the supervisory authorities to investigate the implications of this more rigorously with the financial institutions.<\/p><p> On the fourth line of inquiry, appropriateness of the expert advice sought, quality of the analysis, and how effectively this was used, I again refer to quite a number of international organisations that provide analysis and advice to the supervisory authorities. However, I also feel that these reports are often subject to a little bit of suasion from the domestic institutions as to what's contained in them.  However a more ... I suppose, a better form or research from these organisations might well be found in the number of housing market reports published by the OECD and the IMF, in the 2003-04 period, and by the OECD in 2006, which raise quite a number of issues in relation to the Irish property market.  And other studies produced by the OECD in 2006 raised issues about adjustments in the property market in the context of a monetary union and these, I believe, were important and useful studies for consideration by the authorities and also by financial institutions.<\/p><p> In the area of contrarian views, I would say that, by the time these contrarian views became public knowledge and got a great deal of publicity, the Irish property market was already in slowdown mode.  I found the reaction to them to be quite surprising because research, I think that we had published, showed that by 2005 the ratio of house prices had already risen quite dramatically, affordability was deteriorating, interest rates were on the rise, investors were increasingly worried about the market, employment growth had levelled off, so we were in a situation where there was a turning point already on the way.<\/p><p> As to the remaining lines of inquiry, Mr. Chairman, I don't propose to read into my ... anymore out of my statement.  I will make the point, though, in relation to the liquidity issue in banks, I sat in the dealing room of AIB during this period and every event, and there were quite a number of them, from mid-2007 to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, was a big event and was quite troubling in the context of how the markets saw it.  I think, if you're not in that space, you don't really have a full appreciation of just how difficult that was.<\/p><p> So, Mr. Chairman, that concludes my summary of the main lines of inquiry, but with your permission, I propose to deal with the issue of Professor John FitzGerald's reference to me in his testimony to the committee on the 11th.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#LL00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Beggs","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":556,"content":"<p>Certainly, just procedurally, this is a section 25 statement regarding the testimony of Professor John FitzGerald to the joint committee on 11 February 2015 and you want to address that matter specifically, Mr. Beggs, yes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#NN00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430953200,"counter":557,"content":"<p>I do indeed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#NN00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Beggs"},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":558,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#NN00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430953200,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I provided the committee with a statement on this matter on 27 March.  Well, first of all, I confirm that I did meet with Professor FitzGerald in relation to stress testing.  I do not recall the exact date but I'm happy to accept from his records that it was in October 2005.  Professor John FitzGerald himself, in his e-mail of 16 February to the committee, accepted the possibility that his recollection of the content of the meeting was faulty.  Professor FitzGerald's recollections of the content and the nature of the meeting were in many key respects very different from mine.  Specifically, I am certain that I expressed no concerns on the part of the AIB board about stress testing.  The board never authorised or was aware of the meeting.  I did not report back to the board on the outcome of the meeting.  The meeting was an exploratory, technical one between economists to ascertain whether the ESRI's model could be used to enhance the scene setting of base and stressed economic scenarios by providing more economic variables than contained in regulatory exercises at the time.  It was never the intention to ask the ESRI to carry out stress tests independently of regulatory ... of the regulatory ones and it was certainly never envisaged that the ESRI would apply macroeconomic scenarios to the bank's internal data.  I never asked Professor FitzGerald to carry out stress testing on behalf of AIB.  I sought to explore whether prescribed regulatory economic stress data, which consisted of only a limited number of indicators, could be run through the model to generate a more graphic and detailed economic picture of the stressed outcomes.  The meeting failed to produce any results.  As I recollect, Professor FitzGerald indicated that the ESRI would not undertake private unpublished work.  There were some limitations as to what the model could do, but he was prepared to make data from the forthcoming medium-term review available to us.  It was an inconclusive meeting and my unit never followed up on that.<br\/><br\/>If Professor FitzGerald did any other work for AIB or other banks on stress testing, I am not aware of it.The impression created by Professor FitzGerald's testimony is that the AIB board was concerned about the lack of severity in the stress test exercises as far back as late 2005, which may imply a broader level of concern.  I have no knowledge of the board's opinion on the matter.  I never received any negative feedback or reports from the board or board risk committee on stress testing.  As a result, I have no reason to believe that the AIB board had any misgivings about regulatory stress testing.  It was not my practice in AIB to attribute comments or opinions to other AIB business units or committees, least of all the board of the bank.<br\/><br\/>Stress testing in AIB is executed through the stress testing steering group, which is responsible for ensuring that a comprehensive stress testing programme is embedded in risk management and to ensure that an effective framework is in place to enable stress testing across the group.  I attended the meetings of the stress testing steering group when a stress test exercise had to be carried out.  My role was to communicate the evolution of the scenarios from base case to stress scenarios to the committee and onward to divisional risk management and business units, as appropriate.  I was not involved in the application of the economic variables to the bank's internal data.  This was ... sorry ... carried out by analysts within the divisional risk and credit units as well as in the group risk unit.  <br\/><br\/>From an early stage, probably prior to 2005, I felt that the regulatory stress testing exercise could become too procedural.  Banks were provided with stress tests, the work was carried out with great care and attention to detail, signed off by bank boards and reported on by the Central Bank in various reports, such as the annual financial report.  I also felt that the stresses were too mild, though not on every occasion.  I was also concerned that the moderate nature of the stresses were not conducive to maximising management buy-in of the risks involved.  This was my personal opinion and had much to do with the view that people performing the stress tests in various business units needed to understand the broader economic and financial implications of a given shock to a base case scenario.  To do this, one needed a model and the ESRI had one.  A model would provide more outputs for consideration, a wider context to the changed economic environment and given the likelihood of a growing stress testing framework, a more consistent approach to the exercise over time.  I raised these issues with the stress testing steering group and suggested that I talk to John FitzGerald in the ESRI to see what could be done.  I stated this would have some cost implications.  <br\/><br\/>I quote John FitzGerald from his testimony to the committee:<blockquote>We did macro-economic scenarios.  The difference compared to what the Central Bank and so on was doing was that we used the model, so it was consistent.  One did not get a house price crash and no change in unemployment; one got a housing price crash, unemployment going through the roof and Government revenues collapsing.  All coming together which is the way to do it.  That was my concern, it was not just the Central Bank.  It was interesting doing something similar for a British owned bank, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority, FSA, had a similar inappropriate approach to stress testing.<\/blockquote>So, I also felt that the amount of data provided and scenario scene setting between the base case and stress tests were too limited.  This applied to both Irish and UK regulatory tests.  I wanted to bring more information to bear on the process of assessing the risks to the business from the economic deterioration under consideration in the stress.  I carried out, personally carried out, most of the work on the macroeconomic inputs for stress testing in AIB.  From year to year, I endeavoured to be consistent in how I interpreted the shocks and in producing additional information for the divisional risk and business teams, particularly the changes in employment, which were not specified in the macro-aggregates in the base or stress scenarios.  This had to be estimated within individual banks from the changes in real GDP and unemployment rates supplied for the exercise.<br\/><br\/>In his testimony, Professor FitzGerald stated on several occasions that his recollection of the meeting in October 2005 might be faulty.  In his letter to the committee of 16 February he states: &quot;However, as my recollection of the timing of the meeting was faulty, there is always the possibility that my recollection of the content of the meeting was also faulty.&quot;  Mr. Chairman, much emphasis has been placed on the importance of this meeting between the ESRI and AIB in October 2005 at the committee hearing on 11 February but it did not have the imprimatur of the AIB board.

I have to say I was very, very surprised to hear what Professor John FitzGerald had to say at the committee meeting.  I've known him quite a long time.  We've worked together in the Department of Finance in the 1970s.  We've had some interactions, over the years.  I ... I suppose, at my own initiative, I decided that what we needed to do ... I was doing the stress testing, shall I say.  I may not be doing the stress testing, you know, indefinitely and I wanted to bring some consistency to the way in which these stresses and the scenarios were being presented to the risk analysts who had to carry out the exercise.  A model was one way of doing it.  So, I approached John FitzGerald with a view to, first of all, inputting the regulatory stress test, the data that we were given by, say, the Central Bank, which were very limited in number.  I wanted to run those results through the model to generate a wider scene setting because the model generates quite a lot of information.  And as Professor FitzGerald states in his ... in the letter to the committee, the model could do that and that, for me, was an important input into the stress test exercise to be carried out within the bank itself.  I wanted the business units to get a full sense of ... the fullest possible sense as to what this stress involved.  With the benefit of hindsight of what happened, it's quite clear that having the clearest and the most, you know, expansive version of a stress and what it would involve might have been useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#OO01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Beggs"},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":580,"content":"<p>Okay.

You know, the thing about once you'd remembered to put it into context is: when stress tests are done, you're looking at past data.  Ireland had had experienced, since 1975, one year in which nominal house prices had fallen, and they'd fallen by 1.7%.  One year since 1970 that GDP had fallen on an annual basis.  So to put in stresses of 2% or 3% falls in GDP, 20% falls in nominal house price would have been severe.  If you're suggesting that they should have had a stress test with a 67% fall in commercial prices, a 50% fall in residential prices, and a 12.5% fall in GDP, obviously they didn't, but at the time I don't think that was unreasonable.  Plus, the major problem for the Irish banks wasn't just Irish commercial property; US commercial property prices fell 40%, and UK commercial property prices fell 35%.

So the first quote, gentlemen, I don't expect you to be familiar with this, but the Oxford University Press published an extended article in 1999 by a Peter Englund from the Stockholm School of Economics. The article is called &quot;The Swedish Banking Crisis: Roots and Consequences&quot;.  And he relied extensively on a paper that was done for the IMF the year before by two analysts.  One is a director of research at the World Bank, for the record, Asli Demirg&uuml;&ccedil;-Kunt and Enrica Detragiache.  And Professor Englund sums up what they found, and I want to read what he says and just ... you'll be able to take note in your head, it's not very complicated.  So to quote:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>[This paper] identifies 30 major banking crises from the early 1980s and onwards.  Most of these are in developing countries, the main exceptions being three of the Nordic countries (Norway, Finland, and Sweden) in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  The majority of these crises appear to have followed a common pattern.  They have (i) been initiated by deregulatory measures, which have (ii) led to overly rapid credit expansion.  This has in turn been followed by (iii) a sustained increase in asset prices, apparently unwarranted by fundamentals (a &lsquo;bubble&rsquo;).  At some point (iv) the bubble has burst, with a dramatic fall in prices and disruption of asset markets (in particular for real estate) and widespread bankruptcies.  This has been accompanied by (v) non-performing loans, credit losses, and an acute banking  crisis, in many cases intertwined with (vi) a currency crisis.  Finally, (vii), a weakened banking sector has inflicted a credit crunch on the private sector, the severity of which has depended on (viii) the government measures taken to salvage the ailing banks.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#TT00800","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":743,"content":"<p>The point I will put to you, and ask for your comment in a minute gentlemen, after the next quote is, apart from the currency crisis, if those eight factors-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#TT00900","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":744,"content":"<p>Sorry there is a phone interruption there ... on top of your ... it might be coming quite close by to you.

I noticed none of you mentioned Mr. McWilliams in your introductory remarks, you did mention Professor Kelly.  Let me quote from the evidence David McWilliams gave to this inquiry.  He said:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>I just want to make some opening remarks about the period in question, starting with 2000 and going up to 2008 and beyond.  [I'll just skip a little bit and then continue] In fact, I probably spent the best part of a decade trying to warn as many people as possible on as many platforms as possible that our property market was going to crash and that when it did, our banking system would be in a situation where money would fly out of the system and lead to a banking crisis.  <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">[...] I made documentaries about this.  I had [my own] TV show [on TV3].  [...]  I warned people at every juncture that our housing market was a credit bubble and credit bubbles bust and it is not a matter of if they bust but when they bust.  [...] When I hear the view that nobody saw this coming or that this was in some way a shock or we were taken by surprise, I do not believe that is the case.  I think the Irish property crash and the banking crash were both incredibly predictable and absolutely preventable.<\/font><\/blockquote><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> And Mr. McWilliams then refers to a &quot;Prime Time&quot; interview he did in October of 2003 which he says was watched by 400,000 people.  And in that he said, and I quote:<\/font><blockquote><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> <\/font>The Irish housing market is a scam.  It is an enormous financial swindle that could potentially confine an entire generation of young Irish workers to years of bad debt.  Far from being a reflection of economic vitality and fundamental demand the housing bubble is, in the main, a vacuous financial confidence trick that has been foisted upon us by an alliance of banks and the landowners.  <br \/><br \/>Today, in Ireland, the price of the average house is close to ten times the average wage.  This represents an economic failure on a monumental scale.  Behind this nonsense is excessive and irresponsible lending from our financial institutions.  The situation would be laughable if it were not so serious.<\/blockquote>Gentlemen, could I ask you to reflect on the two quotes, one from 1998 and then one from Mr. McWilliams some time ago and to give me your reaction?  Why did you not understand these basics, that these other economists did?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#TT01100","speaker":"954","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":747,"content":"<p>Mr. McLaughlin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#UU00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430953200,"counter":748,"content":"<p>I'm not familiar with that paper but the fact that there were previous banking or property crises of course I was familiar with those.  Most of the crises occurred in high inflation periods where the price falls were significant falls in real house prices not in normal prices.  I would argue, and I said in my opening statement, that I think you can explain a lot of what happened in the Irish residential property market up to around 2005 in fundamental terms.  There's not many economies in the western world that have an 18% rise in their population in ten years, so obviously there was a massive increase in demand for housing.  There's not many economies that grew by 9% per annum between 1994 and 2000.  There's not many economies that grew 5.5% between 2000 and 2007. So we're talking at a time when employment was rising very rapidly, population was growing very strongly so I think ... and they other thing I think which one should bare in mind which is ... I think pretty obvious, but most people don't seem to think it has any relevance, is that Ireland joined the euro.  And we went from a relatively high interest rate economy to a very low interest rate economy.  Sweden didn't do that or any of those other countries didn't do that so anyone who looked at any economic analysis or any theory of finance would suggest that if you ... if your average interest rate is 7% or 8% and it becomes 3%, asset prices will rise.  So all of those factors should be taken into account.<\/p><p>I think if you look at the Central Bank's quarterly survey of credit standards, which is done by the ECB all through Europe but the Irish Central Bank publishes the Irish one.  It is only in 2005 that you get credit standards loosening, I think.  Then I think it becomes much more credit driven.  So the last '05, '06, particularly '07, I think were not driven by fundamentals.  I think there was more of a credit driven element to it.  This committee, over the last few days, has been discussing for example the introduction of 100% mortgages for first-time buyers which, if I recall, I think it was in 2005.  So I think it is only over the last two or three years of the boom that we can say there was a bubble element came in.  But also, in 2007, most people including myself were saying the housing market would slow down.  Okay we weren't saying it was going to crash, but we were saying it was going to slow down.  You look at all the forecasts that were produced, everyone thought that house completions would fall.

If I am not wrong, the factor that led to that bubble bursting was German unification and the impact of the currency markets and what that meant for Sweden's fixed exchange rate.  There is always some factor that eventually leads to these.  In the case of the Irish crisis, it was a global crisis.  The European Commission produced some report in 2009 that said, and it actually referenced local shocks and problems, banking crises and mentioned Sweden, but it said this time it is different.  This is a much more significant crisis.  That only sort of explains why the Irish one is a much more significant crisis than maybe one that was managed in Sweden.<br\/><br\/>I reference in my written statement under the issue of the role of advisors in analysing the crisis and I said:<blockquote>Against the backdrop of so much data and analysis, it would be difficult to argue that there was not a build up of interrelated risks and uncertainties in the Irish economy and banking system.  After all, notwithstanding the belief in our economic fundamentals going back to the 1990s, the build up to the Irish banking crisis had previously occurred in varying degrees and circumstances in other advanced countries.<\/blockquote>So I would say we had ample warning through the period.  I referenced OECD reports, IMF reports, that the Irish property market was overvalued.  Econometric studies that were saying we were 70% overvalued and then of course they were then pared back by other studies that said no we're not, which led Morgan Kelly to say by the way all those previous studies did not take a long enough view of the timeframe for these analyses, and he came to the conclusion that we were 50%, 60% overvalued, and we would potentially have a fall of that magnitude.<br\/><br\/>So warning signs were there about what had happened in other countries.  I would agree that in the period from probably 2004, I would say, or 2005 to 2007, lending policies ...  lending was too rapid.  It seems from what I have heard from other witnesses before this committee that maintaining market share, growing market share, seemed to be a more important driver of why credit was growing than there being, if you like, underlying sound reasons for the expansion.  I agree with you that house prices were too high.<\/p><p>They were too high from a very, very early stage in this recovery, making it more difficult for people to buy houses.  In our reports we have ... I referenced this ... showing the impact of rising house prices, rising interest rates on affordability.  By 2006, affordability had deteriorated to its worst levels in ten years and that was only after financial institutions had provided 100% mortgages, 35 to 40-year loans, you know, trackers, whatever ... all the means they could to make it affordable for people to still buy houses.  And at the same time they were providing finance for property developers where there was, obviously, rampant inflation going on, on that side.  So, we were building up a problem, and the question is ... absenting the global economic crisis from mid-2008, how would we have managed that?  That's the, if you like, the counterfactual that can't be ... well, we could think about it, but we haven't really figured out or thought about what might have happened to the Irish property market in the absence of that global shock.  But it did happen and we are in this situation now.  So, I think the warnings ... warnings are there, even in our own research, we had sufficient warnings, that people in, you know, risk management, credit management, should've been saying, \"Yes, okay, I hear you still think there's going to be a soft landing, but, you know, I'm going to be more sceptical than that about it.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#VV00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Beggs","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":754,"content":"<p>Mr. McArdle?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#WW00200","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430953200,"counter":755,"content":"<p>We will always have contrarians, first of all.

So that's the first point, you'll always have contrarians.  I quote you then in my witness statement at page 8, where I quote Professor Honohan to a D&aacute;il committee in June 2010, where he said, &quot;regulators should always pay attention to [contrarians] with coherent but not necessarily right view&quot;.

I mean I do reference this in my statement, that we were running out of road when it comes to housing, that the affordability issue was reaching critical points whereby when you stress-test people's incomes and their ability to afford to buy a house, that we were running at a point where fewer and fewer people would actually be able to meet those criteria, and that, may I say, was against a backdrop where, of extremely expensive average houses.  I mean, I take the view and my comment, my written statement, I dismiss econometric evidence around house prices as being, you know, just that.  But I base my view about the housing market on my own personal experience of my own children in the housing market in 2004, 2005 and 2006, and the extremely high prices that they had to pay for average properties.  And, I'm thinking to myself, you know, how is this going to continue?  What way are we going to manage a business, a sustainable business, if house prices are of this level?  It's all right, you know, offering more and more better terms so that people can afford to buy it, but at the end of the day they are being pushed out to 40-year mortgages with, you know, interest-only or whatever.  This was, actually, running out of steam long before Morgan Kelly pronounced, in my opinion, and our reports, notwithstanding some of the titles we put on some of our reports, and our view that \"we hope for an equilibrium\", or \"we hope for a soft landing\".  The evidence is in the reports, and I did actually supply the committee with the full text of our April '06 report, because they've only given a Finfacts summary of it here, but it does contain, as I said, the evidence that things were becoming untenable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#XX00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Beggs"},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":763,"content":"<p>Gentlemen, briefly, did any of the other two gentlemen, did any of you take any serious notice of what David McWilliams was writing about, from 2000 onwards?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#XX00500","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430953200,"counter":764,"content":"<p>It was just another view.

I'm looking at something, I ... the notion that nobody thought that, everybody thought the housing market would go on forever, is completely wrong.  It's absolutely, completely wrong.  Of course not many people thought it would collapse the way it did but in January 2007, I'm even looking at something I wrote myself, \"the most likely outturn for the market is therefore a period of flat or only modest price growth ... until affordability is restored\" - that's January 2007.  So the notion that everyone was saying it was going to go up 10% per annum is just not true.  The other thing I would point out is the major losses for the Irish banks were not in residential property.  They were in commercial property.  In commercial property.  Not many people, if I recall, wrote anything about commercial property, and that was what caused the damage for Irish banks' profitability and caused them to require significant capital inflow, injection from the State, not residential property.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#XX00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dan McLaughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":765,"content":"<p>We've had substantial evidence here in relation to that, Mr. McLaughlin, which bears out what you're saying.

Or it could have been nationalised, as Professor Honohan has spoken about at length here.  But the one thing that I would just mention is that, Ashoka Mody who was part of the IMF team that came over here, and I think I have got the right man, when Anglo was eventually nationalised the following January, in the middle of January if I recall correctly, he wrote an article that said that all of the trouble in Europe started with that decision.

The idea that a soft landing, if you defined it as something that was mild and gradual, it never happened.  When we are talking about soft landings, we were talking about it in relation to the housing market, I'm really referring there to a soft landing on prices.  When you are at 93,000 units in 2006, it's very unlikely that we are going to have a soft landing, unless we have such a gradual deceleration in the rate of house-building over four or five years, the likelihood was, I think it was referred to by other witnesses here today, that the output drop from 93,000 units to something more sustainable, which in our view was somewhere around 50,000, if it happened in one, two years, was going to have a big impact on the economy.  So the soft landing really referred only to house prices, that house prices could stop rising, so I would agree with that and that was never ... our definition of soft landing was never quite as soft as generally supposed.  In fact, in our report, we make the point that we did not rule out prices falling over several months and at the higher end of the market, where you couldn't justify what people were paying for houses at the top end, that we weren't ruling out significant price declines there, but our concept was, that for the average house price, that that would not decline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#KKK01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Beggs"},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":920,"content":"<p>Can I just finish?

A lot of people disagreed with that, vehemently actually at the time in 2009, I still have that view.  In fact, I think it has turned out better than could have been expected.  What I would say, though, is that the process by which NAMA was set up, it took almost two years from the Bacon report to the transfer of loans was unfortunate.  That timeline was far too long.  Now, I don't think there was anything anyone in Ireland could have done about it because it was dictated by DG Competition in Brussels but it allowed time for the value of those assets to be marked down for a whole variety of reasons, some of which we touched on here earlier, the national interest, and that was unfortunate.  And the final thing I'd say now, is that it's obvious now that NAMA underpaid the banks for the loans they took.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#MMM00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat McArdle"},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":951,"content":"<p>Mr. McArdle, on page 3 of your statement, point 4, \"I want to make the following points ...

That fall in asset prices was ... what happened was NAMA meant that that was marked to market.  Obviously house prices dropped 50% and it's obviously a very serious thing for a lot of people that were in negative equity and some people obviously lost their homes.  But the banks did not mark to market that house price fall, and as we now know the banks have now if you like ... the level of arrears tells you that the banks did not foreclose on those houses and therefore mark to market the price change.
