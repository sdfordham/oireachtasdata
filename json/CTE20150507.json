For example, the document, dated 14 April 2015, states in respect of capacity that the proposed development at Thornton Hall would have provided a maximum of 723 places, in addition to the female prison.  However, the original document, dated 6 February 2015, stated the new prison development would provide accommodation for 1,400 prisoners, with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200.  There is a major discrepancy between the figures presented for the numbers of prisoners who would have been accommodated at Thornton Hall.<\/p> <p>  The original document stated that following the decision not to proceed with the Thornton Hall project, the Department decided to focus resources on providing in-cell sanitation in Mountjoy Prison and noted that the project was nearing completion.  The main reason cited by the Department for purchasing a site for a new prison at Thornton Hall was the lack of in-cell sanitation in Mountjoy Prison and the estimated cost of installing same of &euro;400 million.  Now that the Department has addressed the primary reason for spending &euro;30 million on the purchase of Thornton Hall, it has not indicated what was the cost of providing in-cell sanitation in Mountjoy Prison.  Clarification is required in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The document, dated 14 April 2015, only gave a brief description of the expenditure of &euro;30 million on the Thornton Hall project and some additional minor expenditure in a couple of other areas, including acreage purchased for ancillary purposes.  The document received on 6 February, however, indicated that total expenditure on the prison development project was &euro;50.14 million.  There is, therefore, a discrepancy of &euro;20 million in expenditure.  It is one of a number of serious discrepancies. <\/p> <p>  It should also be recalled that Mountjoy Prison was to be sold and that Shanganagh Castle, the only juvenile open prison in the State, was sold.  There is now no juvenile prison to make up the shortfall in expenditure.  The contents of the two documents suggest either that they were produced by two different people or that the author approached the issue from two perspectives.  I suggest we seek clarification on their contents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015050700002#B00300","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1430989200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Perhaps we should set out the differences the Deputy has outlined by sending a copy of the transcript to the Department to seek clarification on the matters raised.

It is our responsibility as the Committee of Public Accounts to have that information and to analyse it.  That is where the members were coming from and it is the information we want.  Beyond that, in terms of the sale from the bank to the business, that may be for another day.  Is that correct from our last meeting Deputy McDonald?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015050700002#C00300","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1430989200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Yes, that is correct.  In fact, at the finance committee yesterday, a motion was brought forward asking for different individuals to come before that committee.<\/p> <p>  On legal advice that motion was withdrawn on the basis that the commercial interactions, be it around Siteserv and the commercial wisdom of decisions made, are not for that committee or for our committee to scrutinise or second-guess.  The point was made very strongly that the policy oversight, as well as the political oversight and interaction between the system and the IBRC, Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, is very much a legitimate space.  It is not something KPMG will delve into.  Its will be very much a technical and, in my view, a wholly inadequate mechanism for investigating all of these matters.  I support what the Chairman is doing and I would hope that we would have the relevant documentation in advance of next week's meeting so we can prepare ourselves for the exchange.<\/p> <p>  The second question is this but I do not know if it can be answered today.  We need to get some clarity from the Minister because he has made several references to committees of the House and he has referenced our committee in particular.  We need to know not only  hat we will be in receipt of whatever report KPMG produces but to what end.  What level of scrutiny at the end of the day will we be able to apply to such a report, giving our remit, standing orders, Abbeylara, etc?<\/p> <p>  It strikes me there is a strong element of playing for time on the part of the Government.  We are being referenced as part of a very drawn-out sequence.  That is my own view.  Apparently, we are going to get this report.  We are not sure what form it will take or the level of data and information we will be given, however.  The experience has been that all of these interactions are cloaked in a vale of commercial sensitivity.  We have no guarantee that this will not be the case when we finally see the report from KPMG.  We receive it but what next?  What level of scrutiny will we be able to apply to it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015050700002#C00600","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1430989200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>We will come back to that.

Then some other issues arose.  The general opinion around the table was that the committee would play as big a role as it could in the matter.  I would welcome the Committee of Public Accounts paying that role because we are, after all, the committee that deals with taxpayers&rsquo; money and the use and abuse of that money.<\/p> <p>  The system that has been set up is to report by the end of August.  I do not know if the Minister for Finance mentioned this committee.  He did mention the relevant committees of the House. The Taoiseach mentioned this committee.  We do need clarification that this is the committee that will deal with the report when it does come out.  It is to be completed by the end of August.  Presumably, the intention would be that it would be dealt with by the committees of the House in early September.  In the meantime, regarding whatever documentation might be required, I would be agreeable that it would come before the committee and we could be prepared for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015050700002#C00800","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1430989200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Costello that it is important to get clarification on the Government&rsquo;s intention as to what role the committee will have once the report is published after September.

Any paperwork relevant to those transactions from the Department&rsquo;s side is what we are entitled to discuss.  We shall send a clear message to the Department of Finance that this is within our remit, this is what we want to discuss and there is more than just Siteserv.  In a general way we want to deal with that.<\/p> <p>  It is only fair then, on the other side of this, that we would make clear that it is misleading of either the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance or any other Minister to say the Committee of Public Accounts will deal with this.  The committee&rsquo;s remit will not allow it to go into the IBRC or call witnesses.  If the Committee of Public Accounts is to conduct any analysis of this, then an order of the D&aacute;il needs to be made.  The KPMG report, if it is to be referred to us, will have to be given to us with the appropriate powers to analyse it and to call witnesses.<\/p> <p>  Whatever statement has been made on this, from a public interest, it should be specified and clarified that whatever committee deals with this, it will require a certain set of powers to be able to do it properly.

The appropriation account for Vote 30 - Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, had total gross expenditure of just under &euro;394 million in 2013.  Figure 1, which could now be brought onto the screen, indicates how that expenditure was divided between the various Vote programmes.  The largest programme was in relation to broadcasting, under which a total of &euro;242 million, or 61%, was spent.  The bulk of the expenditure under that programme was in the form of grants paid to RTE - just under &euro;182 million, and to Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge - &euro;33.7 million.  &euro;14.4 million was paid into the Broadcasting Fund.  &euro;11.2 million was paid to An Post in respect of the costs of collecting broadcasting licence fees.  The fees collected by An Post are remitted to the Department, and account for the bulk of the appropriations in aid of the Vote.  In 2013, a total of just over &euro;216 million in broadcast licence fee income was received by the Vote.  The net expenditure on the Vote was around &euro;27 million less than was provided for the Vote for 2013.  The Department got the agreement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to carry over &euro;8.5 million in unspent capital funding to 2014.  The balance of the surplus was due for surrender.<\/p> <p>  The report before the committee this morning relates to an examination of the arrangements for the provision of a national emergency call answering service, which comes within the responsibilities of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  By way of background to the examination, I should explain that, in the course of carrying out the audit of the financial statements of ComReg for 2011-12, we noted that the regulator had incurred legal costs of over &euro;310,000 when it settled a legal case taken against it by a telecoms provider.  The company had challenged ComReg on the manner in which it had made a decision to increase the emergency call handling fee by 50%.  It also complained about the absence of an appeal process in respect of fee changes.  Our initial review established that the Department had put in place a complex framework to underpin the emergency call system, and I decided to review the arrangements in parallel with the audit of the 2013 appropriation account for Vote 30.  <\/p> <p>  Historically, emergency call answering was done by Eircom operators.  Since July 2010, the service has been provided by BT Communications Ireland, which won the contract following a tender competition run by the Department between 2007 and 2009.  The contract is for a period of five years, with an option to extend for up to two more years.  I understand that the initial five-year term is due for completion in July of this year.  The emergency call service is fully funded by the telecom service providers.  The companies are charged a handling fee for each call made through their networks.  There is no direct charge for the person making an emergency call.  In practice, the costs are passed on by the companies to their customers through the normal user charges.<\/p> <p>  The emergency call fee charged to the telecoms companies by BT is regulated by ComReg and is based on the expected cost of providing the service and the anticipated volume of emergency calls.  Annual revisions of the call handling fee by ComReg take account of any under- or over-recovery of costs by the service provider in prior periods.  We found that the volume of emergency calls received over the period 2010 to 2014 has been relatively constant at around 2.8 million calls a year.  This is around 42% lower than projected when the service was put out to tender.  The much lower than anticipated call volume, together with some other cost changes, led to a 50% increase in the call handling fee, from the initial rate set of &euro;2.23 per call, to a rate of &euro;3.35 per call.  There were subsequent reductions and increases in the rate, which, in the period 2014\/2015, stood at &euro;3.08 per call.  Legislation provides for ComReg to determine the costs BT may recover through fee charges.  The scope of what costs are reasonable is set out in the concession contract.  This specifies that the costs include a guaranteed rate of return of 6.63% on the capital sum invested by BT, which applies for the duration of the contract.<\/p> <p>  Our examination found that the guaranteed return is calculated on the gross book value of its capital investment - just over &euro;11 million - giving a flat-rate guaranteed return of around &euro;750,000 each year.  This is factored in as a reasonable cost in the fee-setting model.  As BT is also allowed to include a depreciation charge in its costs, its effective rate of return on its capital investment is significantly higher than the 6.63% set out in the agreement.  The rate of 6.63% in the contract was arrived at from a base rate set by the Department, plus a margin proposed by BT in their tender.  The National Development Finance Agency advises State authorities on the optimum financing of public investment projects.  I recommended that the Department should consider consulting with the NDFA on any future projects of a similar size and involving similar complex structures, in order to ensure that the most appropriate terms are agreed, including advice on whether it is appropriate to specify a base rate of return.<\/p> <p>  The governance arrangements for the call answering service are set out in figure 2, which can now be shown on the screen.  The concession agreement between BT and the Department envisaged the establishment of a project board, with representatives of the emergency services, and a liaison committee to facilitate communication on all matters between the Department and BT.  In fact, the liaison committee was never established.  Instead, meetings are held at least quarterly between a Department representative and BT's representative.  The planned project board, referred to as the Emergency Services Group, has been established but it has no formal terms of reference and formal minutes of the group's monthly meetings are not recorded.  I recommended to the Department that it should draw up formal terms of reference for the group and maintain formal records of its meeting, and it has agreed to do so.  <\/p> <p>  BT reports monthly on its performance against service delivery standards specified in the concession agreement.<\/p><p>The reports are reviewed by ComReg and the Department and any instances where performance fails to meet the specified standard are raised and addressed with BT.  Overall, performance standards are being met.  Although provided for in the concession agreement, no annual reviews of BT&rsquo;s performance have taken place.  However, as part of its 2014 annual review of the call-handling fee, ComReg planned to engage an independent consultant to formally review and test the methodology by which BT compiles and calculates its performance reports.  The Department has also agreed to a recommendation to publish an annual report on the performance of the emergency call answering service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015050700002#E01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430989200,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Griffin to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015050700002#F00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430989200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I am appearing here this morning in relation to two issues, the emergency call answering service and the 2013 audited accounts of the Department.<\/p> <p>  The ECAS is responsible for answering all 112 and 999 calls to the emergency services in the State.  Following a tender process, BT Ireland was appointed as operator of the ECAS and the concession agreement with BT commenced operation in July 2010.  Emergency calls are free of charge to the caller on all telecommunications networks.  The ECAS system is funded through the call-handling fee payable by the presenting telephone operators. <\/p> <p>  To ensure the highest level of availability and adequate contingency arrangements, fully replicated data centres are located in Navan and Dublin and three operator centres have been deployed in Navan, Dublin and Ballyshannon.  The ECAS is performing to a consistently high standard and exceeding all the performance levels set out in the concession agreement.  Under the concession agreement, BT is required to ensure 99.999% availability of the service each year.  In other words, the service cannot be unavailable for more than a total of five minutes per annum.  It has handled a total of over 10 million calls since it launched in July 2010.  Of that total, it has filtered out over 6.2 million, thus ensuring the emergency services can deal with genuine emergency calls.  The average speed of answer for a caller to ECAS is 0.6 seconds which is one of the fastest in Europe.  Ireland is one of the first countries in Europe to provide an emergency SMS service.<\/p> <p>  In so far as the 2013 appropriation account is concerned, total gross spend under the Vote in 2013 was just over &euro;393 million, some &euro;33 million below the budget allocation of &euro;426 million.  The underspend is primarily due to slower than expected expenditure on the post codes project, on energy research programmes and on broadcasting expenditure due to lower than forecast TV licence receipts. <\/p> <p>  I will briefly set out some of the key projects supported from the Vote in 2013.  There was expenditure in 2013 of almost &euro;23 million on communications, multimedia developments and the information society.  This expenditure was primarily on the national broadband scheme and the second level schools broadband programme.  Some 234 second level schools in counties Dublin, Kildare and Meath were provided with a 100 Mbps broadband connection in 2013, thus bringing high speed connectivity to 516 schools under the first two phases of the national roll-out programme.  The programme was completed in 2014. <\/p> <p>  Some &euro;75 million was spent in the energy sector in 2013, with &euro;57 million of this expended by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland on the delivery of energy efficiency upgrades.  The schemes funded include residential grants, grants to low income energy consumers through the warmer homes scheme and group community projects.  During the year, over 26,000 homes benefited from an energy efficiency upgrade, supporting around 3,000 jobs and highlighting again the importance of the State&rsquo;s involvement in this area. <\/p> <p>  Expenditure in 2013 in the broadcasting area amounted to &euro;242 million.  Of this, &euro;181.5 million was paid in grant aid to RTE in respect of the revenue from the sale of television licences.  A total of &euro;24.4 million of Exchequer funding and licence fee funding of &euro;9.2 million was provided to TG4 to deliver on programme commitments.  A total of &euro;14.4 million in grants from the broadcasting fund was provided to the audio and audiovisual media sector, supporting about 300 projects.  During the year, the procurement process was completed for the national post code system.<\/p> <p>  Almost &euro;32 million was paid to meet the administration and operational costs of Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Loughs Agency.  This funding enabled IFI to undertake almost 140,000 patrol hours and nearly 6,000 habitat inspections.  A total of &euro;5.4 million was spent on various geoscience projects, including mapping over 3,000 sq. km of the national seabed under INFOMAR, the national seabed survey project. <\/p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s administrative budget has been significantly reduced from &euro;40 million in 2007 to just over &euro;21.5 million in 2013.  Notwithstanding this, the Department has continued to oversee and implement a wide range of new and existing programmes, undertake regulatory functions and provide policy advice across its wide brief. <\/p> <p>  I have separately provided the committee with the Vote outturn figures for 2014.  These indicate gross expenditure of &euro;424.7 million in 2014 compared to &euro;393.6 million in the 2013 outturn.  A breakdown of the 2014 outturn by subhead has also been provided.

It is difficult to know where to start because the Department is so diverse and deals with such a variety of areas.  I will begin with an aspect of its work which I regard as very important.  I refer to the question of the roll-out of broadband services.  I am fortunate in that I am an urban Deputy in Dublin so I am not as familiar with what some of my rural colleagues refer to as bog band.  I understand that the high speed broadband will be rolled out to everybody by 2020.  What is the current situation?  It is obviously a matter of great urgency for people outside the major centres who need to be able to compete and have good access to something which is essential nowadays.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015050700002#F00600","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430989200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>As someone who was born and reared outside Dublin, albeit that I have lived and worked here for over 30 years, I still have plenty of relatives down the country and every time I visit them I get it in the neck about the national broadband plan.  It is a project which for a whole range of reasons is very dear to my heart.  I know it is among the top priorities for the Minister.<\/p> <p>  The national broadband plan needs to be considered in its broadest sense.  This involves both what the commercial sector is doing and what the State plans to do.  Part of our effort over the past couple of years has been on enabling the commercial sector to be involved to a greater extent in the provision of broadband infrastructure.  For example, I refer to the work carried out last year in bringing forward legislation to allow ESB engage in the provision of broadband infrastructure.  Next week, ESB and Vodafone will launch their joint venture which will set out the first 50 towns where they plan to invest and which will benefit under the joint venture programme.<\/p> <p>  One also needs to consider what the other big players in the sector are doing.  There has been a substantial increase in what Eircom had originally targeted to do when the national broadband plan was rolled out in 2012.  The footprint of the Eircom plan which it indicated covering under its NGA programme was approximately 1.2 million households.  This has increased to approximately 1.6 million, if not more.  There has been very significant progress in the private sector in terms of the commercial interventions.<\/p> <p>  Looking at what the Government needs to do, the Minister published a national high speed coverage map last November which set out where the commercial sector was going to intervene by 2016 and what the State needed to do under it its own intervention strategy.  The coverage map is divided in two.  A blue area reflects where the commercial sector will intervene and an amber area reflects where the State needs to intervene.  Effectively, there is a 70:30 split between the commercial and State interventions.  Approximately 700,000 properties need to be covered in the State intervention.  It covers 96% of the land area of the State.  The commercial companies will invest where it is commercially viable to do so.  Therefore, the main focus is on the towns and the larger villages.  The map was published at the end of November 2014.  Public consultation on the map was initiated at that stage and closed on 12 February 2015.  We received 29 submissions and these are being assessed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015050700002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1430989200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>How much further progress will be made by this time next year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015050700002#F00800","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430989200,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I will outline some of the highlights over the next 12 months.

We have put in place formal consolidated terms of reference which have been presented to the emergency services group and which will be finalised at the next meeting of the group in the coming weeks.  The group is now chaired at principal officer level in the Department and formal minutes of the meetings are being recorded.  That is progress in terms of some of the governance deficiencies the Comptroller and Auditor General identified.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the annual review, perhaps we lost sight of that as an issue because our main focus was on identifying whether the system was performing to the key performance indicators, KPIs, outlined in the concession agreement.

Our concern was that if the invitation to tender had not included a base rate, there would have been no competition.  In our view there was a real risk that if one did not provide for some guaranteed rate of return for the tenderers, the existing operator which had assets in place could bid a low management fee and undercut all other bidders and one might not have had a competition.  We needed a competition to ensure we would have the most effective outcome in terms of having an emergency call answering system that would deal with what were life saving issues.  Fundamentally what happened was that bidders bid for a management fee which was required to operate the service.

One of the things the Comptroller and Auditor General clearly sets out in his report is the preference to have the NDFA involved in the process.

These involve people ringing but the calls not being followed up.  \"Silent calls\" are, for example, having one's mobile telephone in a back pocket and hitting the emergency dial by accident.  The technology has changed in the past 12 months or so, in that one needs to do a bit more to issue an emergency call.<\/p><p> I do not have the statistics on the number of hoax calls but the trend in the volume of calls in recent years is interesting.  In 2009, the precursor to ECAS was operated by eircom and received 3.57 million calls.  In 2010, that figure was 3.23 million while in 2011, it was 2.8 million.  In 2012, it was approximately the same but decreased to 2.6 million in 2013.  There was a significant reduction in 2014 to 2.1 million.  The projection for 2015 is approximately 1.8 million.  There has been a substantial reduction in the number of calls.  Much of this is down to investment in the State's telecomms infrastructure, particularly eircom's copper network.  Thanks to upgrading the network, the so-called noisy calls have decreased substantially in the past year or two.<\/p><p> In fairness to ECAS, it had to operate on the basis of the information provided to it.  A service was pitched based on an expected level of calls but the number of calls reduced, which had an impact on the call handling fee and the service's overall level of costs, which have declined in the past 12 months in particular, as I told Deputy Perry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015050700002#M03800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430989200,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Mr. Griffin does not have a figure for hoax calls.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015050700002#N00200","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430989200,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I do not, but-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015050700002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1430989200,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Does he know the cost attributed to them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015050700002#N00400","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430989200,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I could get information on the proportion of the calls that were handled that were considered silent, abandoned, noisy or misdialled.

I give Galway as an example where they still have not been able to prove to me why post office A is different from post office B.  Would Mr. Griffin not have an issue, when a postmaster passes away or retires, that the licence is taken back immediately?  Someone may be happy to take over the licence and need 12 months to prove it as a viable business but that does not seem to be the way An Post is working with this situation.  It seems to operate by getting its hands on the licence, taking it back and making applicants for the licence jump through hoops for six months before telling them if they like the idea or not.  Would the Department not have an issue with that sort of consultation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015050700002#O01300","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430989200,"counter":285,"content":"<p>The information we have from An Post is that this is not the type of consultation process in which it engages.

There are a range of factors, not only the level of business at the office.  We have discussed this with An Post and I do not get the sense that when someone indicates their intention to retire, An Post immediately goes in and pulls down the shutters - far from it.

We have discussed terms of the financial services working group with the Department of Finance on the roles of An Post and the post office network in delivering a basic bank account.  The other thing An Post and the network is grappling with is the Department of Social Protection contract and the move from cash to electronic payments.  Again, it is a reflection of the fact that some customers would prefer an electronic payment.  When one looks at the costs of an over-the-counter cash payment versus an electronic payment, there is a ratio of about 10:1.  It is over &euro;1 for a cash payment but about 10 cent for an electronic payment.  To support that approach would, therefore, have a big impact on the social welfare budget.  That is part of the consideration of the post office development group.  An Post has the DSP contract for two years and it will be bidding again for a continuation of that.  It provides a great service but I hope the group is looking at the whole spectrum of issues facing the post office network and is being creative about the options available around additional business, and public sector business that may be transacted, as well as looking at the whole digital economy.

In fact, letters were issued to approximately 2,800 clients and the objective of the exercise was to determine the best means of communicating with people about payment options.  There was no obligation or requirement on them to switch from an over-the-counter payment to an EFT payment.  One should compare the 2,800 clients with the 800,000 clients who receive Department of Social Protection cash payments through the An Post network.

The \"schizophrenia across government\", as Mr. Griffin described it, is causing havoc in terms of business for post offices.  Mr. Griffin can imagine the position of a postmaster in an office where customers come in waving the letter asking whether they now have to open a bank account, against the backdrop of a history of closures in the post office network, despite there having been few closures in recent years.  This causes a lot of difficulty.  One must ask whether one should invest in one's business or not, whether one is going to be closed or whether the Government will close one's business.  By the latter, I refer to an An Post business decision.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I see is that as the Department and all of us serve the digital agenda, there are those who will not march to the same drumbeat.  There are those who are comfortable collecting cash because they are familiar with doing so, and there are those who are simply marginalised because, as I believe was said during the week, 25% of the population have no broadband.  There are elderly people who simply do not want broadband.  In fact, some people do not want to live in the fast lane.  As governors of society, we have to accept that and accommodate it.  I suggest that the Department of Social Protection and some activities and actions within An Post Network are frightening the daylights out of businesspeople who are already under pressure.  I suggest there is an onus on the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and An Post to ensure any negative actions, such as the issuing of the letter in question, are put to one side until such time as the two groups report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015050700002#P01600","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430989200,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I know there are no plans to issue further letters at this stage.

My colleagues in the Department of Social Protection are better able to speak on this issue than I will ever be.  I am sure that, at some stage, this committee will be speaking to them about it.  One would imagine, however, that if the Department of Social Protection did not explore options to ensure the funding available to it to discharge its functions is being used to the best effect, it would be equally open to criticism.  It has a very clear payment strategy, published a number of years back, that set out a schedule for the moving, where possible, from cash payments to EFT payments.  I do not believe that schedule is in any way being complied with.  In fact, those concerned are quite behind in terms of the process.  However, we are engaging with the Department of Social Protection and a whole range of other Departments and State agencies in regard to what other services could realistically be provided through the post office network.

We are very supportive of ensuring an active oil and gas exploration operation in the State.

That would be my sense of it.  They are open to sitting down with individuals who have difficulties and teasing through what their difficulties are.  There is a process to go through, including initial prospecting, taking out licensing options, moving on from that to full petroleum prospecting authorisation, and then a lease undertaking.  That can take time.  At each phase during the process, there are certain obligations that the prospectee needs to live up to in terms of financial commitments and undertaking a programme of work.  <\/p> <p>  We have to comply with regulatory requirements, obviously, but, having said that, I would characterise our approach as being very much open for business.  We would be hopeful that the 2015 licensing round that will conclude this year will be encouraging in terms of the level of interest and activity that we expect to see.  Operators are now in the system that have not previously been involved within the Irish offshore area, including the likes of Cairn, Kosmos and Woodside.  Although the price of a barrel of crude oil has declined quite dramatically over the last 12 months, we are hopeful that when the round concludes in September there will be a significant degree of interest.

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  As we have a quorum, the committee of inquiry into the banking crisis is now in public session.  Can I ask members and those in the public gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off?  <\/p>  <p>               We begin today's session 1 public hearing discussion with Mr. Michael Torpey, former group finance director at Ulster Bank Group, and Mr. Robert Gallagher, former chief executive, corporate markets division at Ulster Bank.  In doing so, I would like to welcome everyone to the 24th public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis, and today we continue our hearings with senior bank executives who had roles during and after the crisis.  <br\/><br\/>This morning we will hear from witnesses from Ulster Bank, Mr. Michael Torpey, former group finance director, Ulster Bank Group and Mr. Robert Gallagher, former chief executive, corporate markets division of Ulster Bank.  Mr. Michael Torpey was group finance director, Ulster Bank Group, from 2004 to 2007, having previously been financial director at First Active.  Since leaving Ulster Bank, Mr. Torpey has been a group treasurer at Irish Life and Permanent, head of banking at NTMA and, since 2013, has been chief executive, corporate and treasury division at Bank of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Robert Gallagher was chief executive, corporate markets division, Ulster Bank, from 2015 to 2011.  Between 1991 and 2005, Mr. Gallagher had numerous positions in AIB and before that he worked with Citigroup in Australia.  Since 2014, Mr. Gallagher has been director credit at KKR, a US investment firm.  <br\/><br\/>Mr. Torpey and Mr. Gallagher, you are both welcome before the committee this morning and before I commence proceedings, I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  The utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the gallery, those documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.<br\/><br\/>So, in that regard the witnesses have been directed to attend the meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee and will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.

I welcome the opportunity to assist the inquiry and I will be pleased to address any questions the committee may wish to ask pertaining to your remit.  My background is that I have spent my career to date working in financial services in Ireland with a particular focus on capital markets and treasury activities.  Immediately prior to my role as finance director at Ulster Bank Group, I spent three years as director with responsibility for finance and treasury at First Active plc, the former First National Building Society, which had converted to plc and floated on the Stock Exchange in 1998.  I was appointed finance director of the Ulster Bank Group in January 2004, following the acquisition of First Active plc by the Ulster Bank Group on behalf of Royal Bank of Scotland.  I remained in this position until December 2007.  And this move to Ulster Bank represented a move from the position of finance director of a publicly quoted company to a reporting line internally in the RBS group, to the group finance director in what was a very much larger multinational  organisation.<\/p>  <p>  My specific responsibilities in my capacity as finance director of Ulster Bank included the integration of the First Active and Ulster Bank Group financial accounting systems onto the RBS Group accounting platform; decision support to all of the business areas of the Ulster Bank Group in matters of finance; review of group accounting policies and practices; and assessing and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.  I was chairman of the Ulster Bank Group tax policy and controls committee, the group assets and liabilities committee, the group reconciliations committee and the finance supervisory committee.  <\/p>  <p>  My brief included responsibility for statutory and regulatory reporting as well as financial controls and reconciliations for so long as the financial accounting systems resided in Ulster Bank Group.  A major element of my role while in the Ulster Bank Group was delivery of a hugely complex  integration of the financial accounting systems of both First Active and Ulster Bank onto the RBS group financial accounting systems.  <\/p>  <p>         With differing regulatory, legal, taxation and even currency regimes, this was an extraordinarily complex project, which had to be delivered while maintaining continuity of accounting reporting and, indeed, controls in Ulster Bank Group throughout the period.<\/p> <p> Following completion of the migration project, production of statutory and regulatory accounts, along with the principal accounting services for the Ulster Bank Group, moved to the RBS Group accounting function in Scotland.  As a wholly owned subsidiary of RBS, the role of finance director, as indicated, was much more specialised than might have been encountered in a stand-alone company or, indeed, than I had experienced at First Active plc.  It was, effectively, a divisional management position within the RBS finance function with additional responsibility, including in relation to statutory accounts and regulatory reporting.  Following completion of the integration project and the move of the principal accounting services to Scotland, the role was further narrowed, becoming a role heavily focused on the hugely important business support and financial controls, as well as reporting to, and very close engagement with, RBS Group finance.  In practical terms, the role can be represented as a specialised accounting role at that stage.<\/p> <p> I reported to the CEO of Ulster Bank Group and, in parallel, to the RBS Group finance director.  And this latter relationship reflected that, in large part, my responsibilities were carried out under RBS Group strategy, policies, and often under direct influence and control.  I had little involvement in operational matters in the business which did not directly involve delivery by the finance function.  The Ulster Bank finance function had no involvement, for example, in credit policy and strategy and was not represented on the group risk credit policy and strategy committee, which was responsible for maintaining asset quality, determining policy, and ensuring adequate controls within the parameters of the RBS policy framework.<\/p> <p> Central to this operating structure is the functional nature of the RBS Group organisational structure.  RBS Group operates as an integrated group requiring that control, policy and process and so forth are driven and controlled from the centre.  A particularly significant instance of this was that, from the outset, RBS Group treasury assumed responsibility for, among other things, treasury and balance sheet management functions and undertook to meet the capital and funding needs of Ulster Bank Group directly.  I had proposed the retention of baseline treasury capability in Ulster Bank Group from the outset but this was not in keeping with RBS policy and was not accepted.  From Ulster Bank's perspective then, capital funding requirements and balance sheet metrics were viewed in the context of the overall RBS Group situation rather than from a stand-alone perspective.  Ulster Bank was a small part of the RBS Group and in Ulster Bank we had limited influence on, or control responsibility for, the RBS Group balance sheet management.  This approach by RBS Group certainly had cost and scale benefits and had the effect for the group of enabling divisions to focus on business delivery while the RBS Group centre delivered the structural supports, such as the funding capital and balance sheet management.  These structural requirements would, of course be ... form an integral part of management in a stand-alone entity.  <\/p> <p> I mention these matters, Chairman, to clarify my role and reporting relationships, as they operated within the RBS policy framework, and to provide the committee with some insight into my role within a wholly owned subsidiary.  That said, I clearly recognise and accept that, as a member of the boards of Ulster Bank Group and as a member of the RBS finance board - that being a committee of the finance directors of RBS divisions and senior finance personnel from RBS Group centre, which was chaired by the RBS Group finance director - I have responsibility for my part in developments within Ulster Bank Group between 2004 and 2007 and any impacts that these developments had on the banking sector generally.  I very much regret that, like so many others, I did not foresee, during my time in Ulster Bank Group, the extent of the difficulties arising within the RBS Group, the extent or duration of the turbulence in wholesale funding markets, the collapse of the property market in Ireland and, indeed, the resulting difficulties for Ulster Bank Group and the impacts on people and the population as a whole.  I dearly wish that we could have known that even ... then even a small part of what we now know so that we might have been able to pursue a different course.  I'm happy, Chairman, to address any questions the committee wish to ask within the context of the inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Torpey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Torpey.

I welcome the opportunity to appear before this inquiry and I shall be as helpful as I can in assisting you in your work.  My opening remarks this morning are supplementary to the written statement, which I submitted to the inquiry on 9 April.<\/p>  <p>  My professional background is in international banking.  Prior to joining Ulster Bank I was head of corporate banking international for AIB, with responsibility for businesses in London, Frankfurt and Paris.  I joined as chief executive, corporate markets, at Ulster Bank Group in late 2005 and worked at the bank until I resigned in September 2011.  <\/p>  <p>         I joined the bank well into its growth phase, and in the six years I spent working there, I oversaw a two year period of growth followed by four years of intensive portfolio management and remediation of the corporate markets divisions of the bank.<\/p> <p> The reputation and strength of RBS Group was a key factor in influencing my decision to join Ulster Bank.  RBS was then a very successful bank.  It was held in high regard globally, and I believe the significant presence they had in Europe, the US and Asia could be leveraged to the benefit of Irish companies seeking to expand in those markets.  Looking back, I was excited about the opportunity to develop and grow a corporate business here to compete with AIB and Bank of Ireland.<\/p> <p> As chief executive of the corporate markets, my responsibilities included corporate banking, business and commercial banking, property finance, capital markets in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland.  Corporate markets had approximately 1,700 people working in Dublin, Belfast and 32 business centres around the island.<\/p> <p> On my arrival into the business, Ulster Bank already had a well developed and long-standing property division.  The commercial property loan book was then approximately 60% of the corporate loan book.  On joining, a key objective of mine was to diversify the portfolio.  I sought to do this by bringing the RBS global capacity and products to the corporate and business customers in Ireland.  In order to facilitate this objective, I oversaw a significant expansion of the business centre network, the enhancement of the corporate systems capability and initiated substantial training and investment in our people, particularly on financial and cash flow analysis. <\/p> <p> The bank's strategy was to become a third force in the Irish universal banking market, to challenge the dominance of the big two.  As a wholly owned subsidiary bank, treasury, capital funding and balance sheet management were provided to us by RBS.  Our focus in corporate markets was on growth and diversification of income streams.<\/p> <p> The bank's strategy and business agenda were underpinned by a control and reporting framework, which was aligned with the wider RBS Group.  We were plugged directly into the RBS credit approval framework.  The risk, credit, finance operations, internal audit, HR and treasury functions all reported into RBS on a matrix basis.  The concept of first and second line of defence was deeply imbedded in the RBS approach to the control environment.  The risk management division of Ulster Bank, which was independent of the corporate markets, was structured, resourced and managed in a manner consistent with other RBS divisional risk management functions.  We were obliged to operate within the parameters of a comprehensive and detailed policy rules and guidelines, which prescribed how risks were to be managed.  These policies covered lending limits and approval structures, LTV limits, stress testing and evaluation processes.<\/p> <p> In my view, the governance structures and policies at Ulster Bank were adequate.  Did everything work according to plan?  No, I can't say everything did.  However, in the vast majority of situations, the rigour and consistency of the bank's approach worked well.  The critical mistake was to base our ambitious growth strategy on economic assumptions which we firmly believed to be well founded, but which proved in time to be seriously flawed.  When I joined the bank in 2005, the internal economic analysis and pretty much all of the external economic analysis forecasted continued GDP growth into the medium term.  Ireland had experienced a property boom which had lasted then over ten years, driven in main by the fundamental factors such as low interest rate regime, increasing population, strong growth in employment and rising household incomes.  Corporate activity was particularly strong from the late 1990s onwards through a combination of buoyant indigenous enterprise and foreign direct investment.<\/p> <p> Come 2007 when the signals of the slow down became apparent, most economic analysis, including our own, predicted the notorious soft landing.  The consequence of the reliance on flawed assumptions allied to the failure to critically analysis and challenge the pace and extent of the property construction lending has been clear to everyone.  As a former director of Ulster Bank, I deeply regret this.  I spent the period from 2008 onwards remediating the business.  During this period and as a member of the executive of Ulster Bank, we sought and received RBS approval for an action plan to protect the Ulster Bank franchise in Ireland.  In corporate markets, this plan included the allocation of over 300 people to a new division to manage the deteriorating portfolio; the reduction of the intergroup lending limit, which had grown substantially following the introduction of the bank guarantee scheme in the Republic of Ireland, of which Ulster Bank was not part; and the reduction of the cost base of the organisation and the re-shape and re-size of the business to reflect the new economic reality.  <\/p>  <p>         Through this very difficult period we continue to have the support and faith of the new RBS management team which has brought in to manage business.  Thank you for listening to my opening remarks and I am happy to address the questions from the members of the inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Gallagher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Gallagher, and thank you earlier, Mr. Torpey.

But others from other institutions have come in here and firmly pointed the finger at Ulster Bank as being the instigators of this particular product.  And yesterday, Mr. McCarthy gave evidence to the committee that 100% mortgages formed about 1% of their mortgage loan book, I think, in Ulster Bank, prior to the direct marketing of this product, and then it went up to about 4%, I think, was the figure that he used yesterday.  Do you have any feelings about being characterised as the instigators of this product and, you know, what is your own, I suppose, opinion now, if you could elaborate on that a bit more, as to the effect that the 100% mortgage and the direct marketing of that as a product into the Irish market ultimately had on mortgage lending across the board in all the banks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#H00800","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430953200,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I think, Deputy, the 100% mortgages is one of a number of elements of an extraordinarily competitive market that existed in the period to which you're referring.

In particular having invested very heavily in both the purchase of the banks in Ireland and the systems costs that were applied, they sought to grow to be a competitor with, an equal with, or indeed to match the incumbent full service banks, being AIB and Bank of Ireland.  The strategy, therefore, was one of growth.  The growth was predicated on an environment where there was a near universal view that the growth prospects for the Irish market continued to be strong and that Ireland was on a good path, shall we say.  Any ambitions to grow the business were subject to the constraints of the risk appetite of the group, subject to the controls, procedures and policies of the RBS Group, as transmitted to Ulster Bank.  So while we had an objective to grow the business, a clear desire and ambition to grow the business, the RBS Group was not tolerant of relaxing standards and controls in pursuit of that growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#N01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Torpey"},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":574,"content":"<p>The Central Bank Governor, nevertheless, I quoted yesterday to McCarthy, said that, you know, growth of 20% or greater should send out warning signals of the balance sheet, that you could quickly come into dangerous territory.

The approach to policy in residential mortgages was ... and, as would be good practice today, indeed, that you had policies which then had a tolerance around them because prescriptive policies of their nature lead to a need for a certain level of exception.  And, to be entirely frank, Deputy, once you're moving beyond low-teens, mid-teens exceptions, you have to raise a question as to the appropriateness of policy.  The exceptions to policy were the subject of challenge by the board of UBIL throughout.  And to the specific item of debt service ratio policy exceptions within ... within UBIL ... and you will note on the page to which you've referred me, the difference between the First Active and the UBIL experience; that arose largely because the exceptions were very highly concentrated on people with higher incomes such that the appropriate debt service requirement will not have been captured by policy and, indeed, the revision to policy will have captured that.  So if we find that ... and I believe it to be the case when I was there, that the majority of debt service policy breaches were for high income earners, that is a mitigant which is acceptable and would have been reflected in the policy revision subsequently.  And I believe also that a very high proportion of those exceptions will have been minor exceptions - as in, very marginally above the policy limits.  It doesn't take from the fact - and it's very, very important, Deputy, I would agree - that where you do have exceptions arising, that they are challenged by the board and satisfactory explanations along the lines I've given or such other as they may be are arrived at to ensure that credit risk appetite is being adhered to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Torpey"},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":657,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I think it is fair to say that stress tests failed to capture the outcomes that were to transpire over time, perhaps if for no other reason, that the scale of events was entirely unprecedented and off the scale of any past experience or expectation that might have been captured in an analysis conducted at that time, of even severe but implausible future events.

I think what appears to explain to some extent the difference between what was seen in the stress tests that were conducted and the actual outcomes, is the severity of events and the pervasive nature of those events as they transpired over time.  While stress tests will have looked at percentage changes in values that are here, and while the actual fallen values was materially greater than this, that will have had its own set of impacts.  But I suggest also that the stress tests proved insufficient to capture the wider range of impacts, starting with the international crisis that happened at the same time, extending into the wider fiscal impacts of the downturn in activity in the economy.

Given your own international experience, Mr. Gallagher, of banking, what is your view of Ulster Bank's growth strategy as compared with strategies that would have been seen or been involved with elsewhere during your international career?  Ultimately Ulster Bank was going to compete with two big huge, with two big players in the Irish market, your ambition was to get on to a level kind of pegging position with them.

So there was an active strategy both in the retail bank and the commercial business bank to win the completeness of a customer proposition and that is, deposits, clearing accounts and lending and that was the strategy as evidenced by the branch openings around the country.

And I would subscribe to that; I think it's very important that they are.  Shareholders in many banks had their shareholding values wiped out, they took a fair share of losses, there's no doubt about that.  Banks themselves suffered further penalties and executives in many cases suffered as well.

So we ... that was captured by the speculative lending policy, the same 3%.  So we ... the firm ... the bank was entirely constrained in that and did very little in any of it.  To the extent that the bank funded investment property, the bank would look at things like the quality of the tenants, the mix of tenants, the location of the asset, the level of cash coverage generated by the rental income, the term of the lease, and would lend based on that and an assessment of the owner and an assessment of the valuation.  And those assets on the investment portfolios tended to be large assets and tended to be in large conurbations, including London and Dublin.  And those assets had a repayment capacity through the cash generation from the rental income.  On development lending, Deputy, the location was critical; the nature of the number of homes that could be put on the asset; the assumption of a sales price; the cost to construct; a sensitivity that said, \"Well, what happens if price drops?\"; an assessment of how long the build is to take; a look at the track record of the developer - what has they ... what have they done in other sites?  Have they finished on time?  Have they had cost overruns?  Have they sold?

My team's emphasis was on short-term forecasting and we produced and published quarterly forecasts for GDP, inflation, employment, etc.  These high-frequency short-term forecasts are designed to paint a picture over a two-year time horizon or occasionally less.  Longer-term projections in Ireland are published by the ESRI, which produces forecasts for up to a quarter of a century ahead every two or three years.  And, you've already discussed these with Dr. FitzGerald.  For the economic input into the five-year planning circle ... cycle, Ulster Bank used the ESRI medium-term forecasts.  As all ESRI forecasts, benchmark, high and low variants, envisaged a soft landing - and I refer you to my table in my supplementary witness statement - it follows that all UB medium-term planning was also predicated on a soft landing.  I effectively buttressed this view in terms of my rolling quarterly short-term economic updates and <i>ad-hoc<\/i>reviews.  My forecasts, and those of all other short-term forecasters, remained positive up until early 2008.  The turnaround was then dramatic.  At that time, the central expectation was that 2009 GDP would grow by 3.6%.  Eighteen months later, the consensus was that it would fall by about 8.3%.  This about-turn came too late to influence events, as the credit that fuelled the boom had been extended between 2004 and 2007.  I was generally regarded as being towards the more pessimistic end of the range of short-term forecasters ... certainly over that period.<br\/><br\/>I should add that any views in the UB publications were mine alone and there was no difference between the internal and external positions I adopted.  I was given freedom of speech by Ulster Bank, even if some of the things I said made them uncomfortable on occasion.  I was a trenchant critic of the loose fiscal policy adopted and I was an outspoken advocate of a soft landing.  In general, I did not input directly into the credit, the risk or the lending functions in Ulster Bank.  Instead, my job was to produce regular economic briefings and they used them as they saw fit.  However, there was the occasional exception and I recently came across a case where UB credit drafted a report based on my output and, somewhat unusually, I received a copy of it.  It summarises my views in early 2004 and if you don't mind, Chairman, I'll quote from it:<\/p><blockquote>UB Economic Research unit (Pat McArdle) views on the ROI Housing Sector remain positive in the updated report dated 25 February 2004.  Its rating however is amber, taking due recognition of the cycle. ... Neither of the usual major negative influences on the housing market (rapid rises and interest rates and unemployment) is forecast. ...<br \/><br \/>Major changes are due on the supply side - last year['s] completions were in excess of 68 [thousand] but underlying demand is believed to be [around] 50 [thousand].  The difference is accounted for by pent up demand and holiday homes.  There are signs that the building industry is aware of this and has the capacity to orchestrate a smooth transition but this is not certain.  Pat McArdle does not rule out the possibility of a price correction of up to 20%.  Even if this were to happen we do not think that this would have major knock-on effects, given bank capital requirements and stress testing.<\/blockquote>  <p>  <\/p>  <p>         A 20% fall in nominal prices would've equated to a much greater fall in real prices, about 35%, that's when you're after making allowance for inflation.  In effect, therefore, I warned, in February 2004, that real house prices could decline by 35% ... that's within the 30% to 50% range predicted by the two main contrarians some three years later.  My main regret, Chairman, is that I did not continue in this vein.  I should have stepped up my warnings as the housing market initially slowed and then regained momentum and even stronger growth.  However, if anything, my later pronouncements are more consensual in that I did not disagree with the projected 15% to 20% fall in real prices advocated by the Central Bank and the ESRI.  Of course, had I continued in the vein I just outlined, I would've been treated as a contrarian.  Few agreed with them, and while it's cold comfort, it's unlikely that I would've been listened to either.  Indeed, it's ironic that even though I disagreed with the contrarians later, we had stress tested in Ulster Bank for their more extreme predictions.  The problem was not house prices<i>, per se<\/i>, but developer and real estate lending and we did not spot it or stress test for it, certainly sufficiently.<br\/><br\/>I want to make the following points.  A soft landing and it's perhaps no harm to dwell on it for a minute since this has received such currency and it may not be as understood in the sense that I understand it.  So a soft landing would've been quite bumpy, involving substantial job losses and up to &euro;3 billion, I had estimated, in tax revenue foregone.  In other words, it would've left a major hole in the budget.  The regulators, management and board bear most responsibility for the collapse here as elsewhere, and I'll come back to that.  Ulster Bank rejected the hard landing hypothesis, but stress tested for house price declines of 56% in real terms.  That was at the very upper end of the range predicted by the contrarians.  This was insufficient because the actual recession was much greater than anyone predicted.<br\/><br\/>I go on now, Chairman, to talk about the implications of a soft landing for a moment.  It could've been, as I said, quite bumpy.  A soft landing that saw house completions fall from their peak around 90,000 to the 50,000 sustainable medium-term level estimated by the ESRI would've had significant implications.  I'd calculated that every 10,000 houses represented one percentage point off growth and that a soft landing would involve 30,000 construction job losses and up to &euro;3 billion in tax revenue foregone.<br\/><br\/>I go on to speak about the regulator.  There were no strong incentives for banks to make arbitrary judgments about the prudent limits of credit expansion.  Hence, the infamous comment by Chuck Prince, chairman of Citigroup: &quot;When the music stops ... things will be complicated, but as long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance.&quot;  The regulator's job is to stop the music, or as it's more often put, &quot;To take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going&quot;.  All regulators failed to do this.  This was a major failing and much of the focus post-crisis has centred on improving bank supervision.  Indeed, responsibility for bank supervision of euro area banks has been removed entirely from national supervisors.<br\/><br\/>When I worked in the banking area of the Department of Finance in the '70s and '80s, I had the distinct impression that when the regulator said, &quot;Jump&quot;, the bank's response was, &quot;How high?&quot;  I was therefore shocked to read in the Honohan report that the regulator spent almost a decade in fruitless correspondence with one financial institution without ever achieving anything.  Clearly, the boot had shifted to the other foot and the regulated, instead of the regulator, were now calling the shots.  However, it seems, and I've only learned this recently, it seems that this only applied to prudential regulation, as bank representatives have testified to this inquiry last week that the regime on the consumer side remained quite strict, which would've been my memory of it from 20 years earlier.  Therefore, I disagree with the conclusion in the Honohan report that the major responsibility lay with the directors and senior managements of the banks that got into trouble.  In my view, the regulator had a higher degree of responsibility.  And this should go without saying, really, because the regulator's job is to promote the safety and soundness of the banking system.<br\/><br\/>If the banks were capable of regulating themselves, there would, of course, be no need for rules and regulations and regulators.  In saying this, I just want to emphasise that I am by no means trying to absolve the banks from blame.  As is clear from the Nyberg and other reports, that there were many actors involved and that the banks were up there at the top.  However, the regulator was the only one who had full information on large exposures and, critically, the only institution that could have sought to curb excessive balance sheet growth.  It was only when the loans were transferred to NAMA in 2010 that it was revealed that the big developers had multiple exposures to the different banks.  The regulator should have had full details from the large exposures reports that it received - I think they were quarterly - and it would've been a simple matter to add them up.  Finally, in this section, in 2009, Patrick Honohan, then professor of economics at TCD, wrote, and this has been quoted here yesterday:  <\/p><blockquote>A very simple warning sign used by most regulators to identify a bank exposed to increased risk is rapid balance sheet growth.  An annual growth rate of 20 per cent real is often taken as the trigger ... Anglo Irish Bank, crossed it in eight of nine years, and indeed its average annual rate of growth 1998-2007 was 36 per cent ... So this was a very obvious and public danger sign.<\/blockquote> <p>On this basis the alarm bells should've been ringing for the best part of a decade.<br\/><br\/>Stress testing.  Ulster Bank stress tested for a 36% fall in nominal house prices in its severe stress scenario.  That was equivalent to a real fall ... a fall in real prices, sorry, of 56%, i.e. it was at the very upper end of the range predicted by the contrarians.  Indeed, it was slightly above the upper end, I think.  However, the real problem was commercial and not mortgage lending, and this was not adequately stress tested.  In 2007, at the behest of the Bank of England FSA, global adverse scenarios for the UK, US and euro area were produced by RBS Group economics and we commissioned the ESRI to help translate them into three Irish shock scenarios: a mild, once in a decade, a medium, once in a quarter century, and a severe, once in century recession.  I supplied the ESRI with the external ... these external global assumptions for the three shock scenarios in April 2007.  These scenarios are based on global economic shocks, which severely affected growth, employment, credit, etc., and we left it up to the ESRI and their model to determine the impact of this on the Irish economy and on Irish house prices.<br\/><br\/>The severe scenario envisages a downturn of a magnitude not seen in the post-war period, greater than the 2009 UK recession and greater than any ... anyone else ... there was no other one that was known at that time.  It entailed GDP everywhere going negative for a few years, unemployment rising to low double digits, short-term interest rates falling to be 1% or below, and Irish credit contracting by 5% per annum for a few years.  This results are given in the accompanying table.  In general, the outcome was worse than predicted ... that's the outcome in the event was worse than the scenarios we utilised I just should say for clarification ... and this was mainly because the impact of the construction rate of decline ... related decline, was vastly greater than expected, with new house completions virtually coming to a halt, whereas the model had predicted a fall of 20,000 units only.  The predicted nominal house price fall, however, was 36% and, of course, the actual, as we now know, was 50%.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, Chairman, the financial crisis has been described as an example of groupthink.  In my experience, and I've now been through it, groupthink is almost impossible to understand unless you've experienced it.  I suggest that a useful way to approach it is, perhaps, to look at two more recent examples.  First, the Central Bank's proposed macro-prudential limits on mortgage lending were eminently sensible and less severe than the regime that applied when I took out my first mortgage, yet they were almost universally opposed, even by the Department of Finance, and were watered down in the event.  Second, the expansionary 2015 budget was condemned by IFAC, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, a body expressly established to advise on policy and also by most economists, yet the Government persisted with widespread support from beneficiaries and politicians.  So in my opinion, groupthink may well be alive and well.<br\/><br\/>The Bank for International Settlements was the only major institution I know of to warn of the crisis and I want to end with a quote from it.  In a presentation in 2013, Bill White, who was the former chief economist there, reflected on why his warnings were ignored, and this is also relevant to groupthink.  He said, and I quote: <\/p><blockquote>There were a few who did warn that there were serious problems building up under the smooth surface of the Great Moderation.  I would like to believe that we at the BIS saw it more clearly than many others, though certainly the timing and the precise nature of its unfolding eluded us ... Why were these warnings (both public and private) not heeded?  Why were the historical antecedents not given more emphasis?  I am going to suggest in the immortal line of Flanders and Swan, that it was &quot;A Tale of Seduction&quot;.  All of the parties who contributed to the crisis (borrowers, lenders, regulators, central banks, academics and politicians) were each seduced by [the] various influences into believing different things that were not true.  Moreover, since seduction normally involves more than one party, the relationships between these various parties also contributed to their having 'no eye to see and no ear to hear'.<\/blockquote> <p>Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#JJ00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat McArdle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":1033,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

Good afternoon, everyone.  Thank you for inviting me along to speak to you.  As requested, I've furnished a statement addressing certain designated lines of inquiry to the banking crisis.  I've also included some general points which I feel are relevant and rather than read out the full statement, I just want to summarise a few remarks.<\/p>  <p>  Just by way of background, I was employed by Bank of Ireland in the role of chief economist from February 2001 to August 2013.  I think Mr. Chairman, you ... in your opening remark, you said 1999.  Just to clarify, it was 2001.  <\/p>  <p>         During that time my office was in the dealing room of global markets, which was responsible for executing the bank's funding strategy and in providing a service on foreign exchange and interest rates to the customer base.  I was in charge of the bank's economic research unit, which produced analysis and commentary on the Irish and UK economies and in developments in the financial markets.  The unit also provided support to other areas of the Bank of Ireland Group, including a written monthly summary of economic and financial developments to the chief executive.  As chief economist, I also participated in meetings with rating agencies, counterparty banks, and on occasion, debt and equity investors, as well as presentations to customers on economic outlook.  I reported to the head of global markets.<\/p> <p> I now want to turn to a couple of general observations on the banking crisis.  The first relates to the banking system that operated in Ireland prior to the crash and to highlight that although there were common features, the range of the subsequent losses illustrates that the banks differed greatly in terms of credit standards, risk appetite, geographical spread and exposure and degree of loan concentration.  Second, banks are mainly staffed by specialists, and in light of the fact that the bank is a publicly-traded company, other than information published in the market, everything is done on a need-to-know basis, which is particularly true in terms of crisis.  A third point relates to the narrative that has developed around the banking crisis, which, given the benefit of hindsight, risks overstating what was known at any point in time.  Our knowledge of the outcome makes it difficult to judge past events.  We should also be clear as to what published data was available and when, an issue I address in more detail in my furnished statement.<\/p> <p> In my view, there were three separate factors contributing to the crisis, each overlapping in exacerbating the other.  The first was the property market: Ireland experienced a residential property boom which lasted well over ten years, and in my view, until around 2005, was mainly driven by fundamental factors, including strong growth in employment, rising household incomes, a move to a lower interest rate regime following euro membership and an extraordinary increase in population of, it was a 17% rise in the decade to 2006 of 615,000.  It was only in the latter stages of the boom which saw an easing of credit standards and the Central Bank quarterly survey data of credit standards shows this, particularly from 2005.  Affordability also started to deteriorate and my own affordability model pointed to a marked increase in the cost of servicing a new mortgage in 2007.  Particularly following the monetary tightening initiated by the ECB, we saw the repo rate rise from 2% to a high of 4.25%, which wasn't reached 'til July 2008.  I initially felt, in 2007, that the slowdown in the housing market would involve flat or falling real prices and not a fall in nominal prices, as the latter had only happened once in Ireland over the previous 30 years.  The Irish economy is very open and hence heavily influenced by the international economic cycle, although from 1970 onwards, the Irish economy had contracted in GDP terms in only one year, which was 1982.  The consensus view in mid-2008, which I shared, was that any US recession would be as short-lived as had been the case in the previous two, which had been 1990-91 and 2001.  Both had lasted only eight months.  This didn't prove to be the case, of course, and I believed that the unprecedented collapse of the global credit markets which followed the Lehman bankruptcy in September 2008, was a second and decisive negative which hit the Irish economy and the banking sector.  The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, called it a \"one in 100-year event\". We will never know how steep the Irish property correction would have been in the absence of that collapse and I find it at variance with the facts that some people appear to play down its significance in relation to the banking crisis.  The impact of the credit crunch was certainly extreme, both internationally and in Ireland.  The S&amp;P index fell by 50%, GDP in the developed economies experienced its largest post-war contraction, and Irish GDP, which actually rose by 1.2% in the third quarter of 2008, on the initial figures that were published at that time, contracted by an extraordinary 7.1% in the final three months of 2008.  The total contraction in the recession was about 12.5%.  So over half of that was experienced in just three months, post-Lehman.<\/p> <p> Commercial property prices also tumbled, a prime factor behind the decline in the value of bank assets, with record falls recorded in many countries.  UK prices fell by 26% in 2008, while the plunge in Irish values was also unprecedented.  Capital values had fallen by 10% in the first half of the year, before falling by 15% in the third quarter and 18% in the final quarter of 2008 and a further 18% in the first half of 2009.  It is also noteworthy that Ireland chose to mark to market these assets at an extreme stage of the cycle.  It is also noteworthy that not many other countries, if any, followed that example.  <\/p> <p> Few, if any, envisaged the effective collapse of the global credit system, while the unprecedented scale of the policy response, including massive state support for banks, zero and even negative interest rates, which are still with us, seven years later, QE and new capital and liquidity rules for the global banking sector, is also testimony to the singular degree of financial disruption that emerged post-Lehman, with the ramifications still being felt, noticeably of course in the euro area.  Finally, a third factor emerged in 2010, and again I don't think this is given enough attention, which relates to the sovereign debt crisis, which by 2012 had developed into an existential crisis for the euro.  State support for the banking sector, initially seen as positive, was now perceived as adding stress to already high sovereign debt levels and the subsequent fall in government bond prices added to bank losses, given their holdings of government debt, a phenomenon that became known as the doom loop.  In that context, it is noteworthy that a number of official reports into the banking crisis in Ireland, including Professor Honohan's, was commissioned in 2010, presumably on the view that the worst was over, but ECB lending to Irish-headquartered banks was higher in early 2011 than in 2008, and ELA support also peaked in 2011.  New regulatory capital requirements also resulted in widespread bank deleveraging, so adding a further downward pressure to asset property markets.<\/p> <p> In 2012, the Central Bank's housing models show that Irish residential prices were now as much as 26% below fundamental value.  It is also of note that the Central Bank's prudential capital assessment review, or PCAR, which began in, which was in March 2011, identified a large capital shortfall in the main Irish banks and that ... and then substantially overestimated the projected pre-impairment profitability.  In the event, the requirement to offload assets and to increase deposits put significant pressure on net interest margin.  The scale and extent of private sector deleveraging in Ireland, which is still apparent, also resulted in a larger fall in bank assets than envisaged in the PCAR.<\/p> <p> In summary, the correction under way in the Irish property market in 2008 turned into a crisis for the economy and the banking system in the wake of the post-Lehman collapse in the global credit system and a fallout from the subsequent sovereign debt crisis in Europe was a significant factor in delaying the return to bank profitability and in slowing the pace of economic recovery in Ireland.

You asked me to give evidence on eight lines of inquiry relating to my role as chief economist of Allied Irish Banks.  Now I've covered these as best I can in my written statement of 9 April, and I propose today just to summarise the main points of those lines of inquiry.  Before I do so, I want to clarify that I was not the chief economist of Allied Irish Banks in the period leading up to the banking crisis.  I was promoted to this role in a restructured bank in late 2011, a position I held briefly until my retirement in 2012.  My actual position from 1992 to 2011 was that of chief economist, global treasury.  My role was primarily focused on advice within wholesale treasury and supporting corporate and commercial treasury in relation to general economic issues, particularly around the outlook for interest rates and exchange rates.  The economic research unit which I headed was located within wholesale treasury in the capital markets division.  The AIB Group's property-related Irish exposures were in the retail Ireland division.  Overall risk management, capital management and relations with the supervisory authorities were handled at group division level.  <\/p>  <p>         Though part of global treasury, my unit was a limited resource available to other business units across AIB and provided on-demand services to other parts of the group.  One area of support was in relation to stress testing.  My unit produced and published research and I will deal with aspects of that in the questions following my statement.<\/p> <p> In giving evidence before this committee, on the lines of inquiry indicated to me, I believe therefore it's important to clarify that I did not occupy a central role within the AIB Group, or a management role in the lending strategy of the retail division.  Furthermore, in relation to some of the lines of inquiry in which I've been asked to give evidence, I must point out that I had very little involvement with the Department of Finance or the Central Bank - Financial Regulator, during my career in AIB.<\/p> <p> The first line of inquiry you asked me to comment on was in relation to banks' risk appetite and the appropriateness of their property-related credit policies.  In relation to risk appetite, I make the point in my statement, I use a risk appetite statement from AIB from 2007, and then contrast it with the concentration of property as set out in the bank's presentation on their results for 2006, which shows that property lending constituted 33% of total lending.  I make the point that reconciling the two is only possible, in my opinion, on the basis that AIB believed that its business was well diversified geographically and sectorally, well managed, of good quality and low risk, based on its customer profile and knowledge of its customers' financial standing.  I believe that banks focussed primarily on what they perceived to be the quality of their individual loan books, with less consideration of the potential systemic risks in the Irish banking system as a whole, and the contagion risks, should serious problems emerge in an important bank, particularly given their overall dependence on external funding.<\/p> <p> As to the appropriateness of property related credit policies, I'd make a general point that the sustained growth in the Irish economy in terms of real GDP and employment meant that the assets of the banking system became increasingly tied up in bricks and mortar in one form or another over the period.  As banks are the main source of finance for the Irish private sector, there is a high correlation between the growth in credit and GDP-GNP.  The appropriateness of Irish bank lending policies cannot be divorced from the stance of fiscal policy, other macroeconomic policies, and the role of monetary and prudential policy.  Here, I want to integrate a comment on the third line of inquiry as to the appropriateness of macroeconomic and prudential policy, in commenting on this first issue.  Strong growth in bank lending occurred against a very expansionary fiscal policy which provided misguided support to bank lending policies.  Monetary conditions were also very favourable.  Interest rates were too low.  Prudential policy was too deferential and failed to pick up on warning signs.  Last but not least, banks, as described by the Nyberg report, were engaged in high-risk growth strategies involving a significant expansion of credit.  There were no countervailing policies in operation.<\/p> <p> Research shows that while the decade of 1990s was primarily driven by exports, the expansion of credit was also a key contributory factor.  Strong employment growth and the rise in the population led to a large increase in house building.  Furthermore, the ratio of private sector debt to GDP was well within the range of other countries.  In the period after entry into EMU, in my opinion, developments prior to around 2002-03 could be characterised as still within acceptable ranges for many key ratios.  A period of slower growth was warranted thereafter as the growth in total lending carried increasing levels of risk as property price inflation and investment and construction headed for unsustainable levels based on international standards.  I set out a number of statistics in my written statement relating to credit expansion which I won't go into here in this summary.<\/p> <p> On the second line of inquiry, relating to risk concentration in base, and in adverse scenarios, I would say that stress testing was undertaken within AIB by the stress testing steering group which was part of the central group risk management framework.  My role was to present an overview of the economic scenarios to the STSG based on, for instance, the initial economic data provided by the regulatory authorities, either in the UK or in Ireland.  The aim was to provide group and divisional risk management, finance and credit units, with the fullest possible understanding of the transition from the base case to the adverse economic scenarios.  The actual calculation of the effects of the adverse economic scenarios on the bank's capital and other metrics was undertaken by analysts within the group and divisional risk and credit units.  When it comes to concentration risk, the methodology changed over time to include additional studies to examine the correlation between sectors, particularly in relation to property.  Adjustments were made to the impact on credit provisions to take account of this factor.<\/p> <p> As to the third line of inquiry, the adequacy of the assessment and communication of both solvency and liquidity risks in the banking institutions and sector, here I'm really looking at the role of the three policy makers, and I want to focus particularly on fiscal policy, because it seems to me, and certainly from my experience of the Department of Finance, that far too much of the time of the Department is taken up with the annual budget process.  Macroeconomic issues over the medium term, or other issues, are not really handled effectively within the Department.  And in terms of publications from the Department, they tend to just simply back up what's contained in the supporting ... what's contained in the annual budget statements.  So therefore, there were no commentaries, that I'm aware of, from the Department, relating to the property sector in the period leading up to the crisis.  The prudential practice covered both micro and macro policies and, I'm quoting here from the Honohan report which pointed out quite a lot of deficiencies in the way in which these policies were carried out, but at no stage did the assessment of the banking system, such as it was, show any concerns about liquidity or solvency issues.<\/p> <p> On the macro prudential side there were annual financial stability reports published between 2004 to 2007.  These reports failed to trigger a more cautious approach within the banking system.  An important earlier point worth noting is that several research papers produced within the Central Bank and by the ESRI, the IMF and the OECD, consistently came to the conclusion that Irish house prices were overvalued, often by significant amounts.  I believe that the consistency of this conclusion should have alerted the supervisory authorities to investigate the implications of this more rigorously with the financial institutions.<\/p> <p> On the fourth line of inquiry, appropriateness of the expert advice sought, quality of the analysis, and how effectively this was used, I again refer to quite a number of international organisations that provide analysis and advice to the supervisory authorities.  However, I also feel that these reports are often subject to a little bit of suasion from the domestic institutions as to what's contained in them.  However a more ... I suppose, a better form or research from these organisations might well be found in the number of housing market reports published by the OECD and the IMF, in the 2003-04 period, and by the OECD in 2006, which raise quite a number of issues in relation to the Irish property market.  And other studies produced by the OECD in 2006 raised issues about adjustments in the property market in the context of a monetary union and these, I believe, were important and useful studies for consideration by the authorities and also by financial institutions.<\/p> <p> In the area of contrarian views, I would say that, by the time these contrarian views became public knowledge and got a great deal of publicity, the Irish property market was already in slowdown mode.  I found the reaction to them to be quite surprising because research, I think that we had published, showed that by 2005 the ratio of house prices had already risen quite dramatically, affordability was deteriorating, interest rates were on the rise, investors were increasingly worried about the market, employment growth had levelled off, so we were in a situation where there was a turning point already on the way.  <\/p>  <p>           As to the remaining lines of inquiry, Mr. Chairman, I don't propose to read into my ... anymore out of my statement.  I will make the point, though, in relation to the liquidity issue in banks, I sat in the dealing room of AIB during this period and every event, and there were quite a number of them, from mid-2007 to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, was a big event and was quite troubling in the context of how the markets saw it.  I think, if you're not in that space, you don't really have a full appreciation of just how difficult that was.<\/p> <p> So, Mr. Chairman, that concludes my summary of the main lines of inquiry, but with your permission, I propose to deal with the issue of Professor John FitzGerald's reference to me in his testimony to the committee on the 11th.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#LL00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Beggs","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":1040,"content":"<p>Certainly, just procedurally, this is a section 25 statement regarding the testimony of Professor John FitzGerald to the joint committee on 11 February 2015 and you want to address that matter specifically, Mr. Beggs, yes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#NN00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430953200,"counter":1041,"content":"<p>I do indeed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#NN00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Beggs"},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":1042,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#NN00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430953200,"counter":1043,"content":"<p>I provided the committee with a statement on this matter on 27 March.  Well, first of all, I confirm that I did meet with Professor FitzGerald in relation to stress testing.  I do not recall the exact date but I'm happy to accept from his records that it was in October 2005.  Professor John FitzGerald himself, in his e-mail of 16 February to the committee, accepted the possibility that his recollection of the content of the meeting was faulty.  Professor FitzGerald's recollections of the content and the nature of the meeting were in many key respects very different from mine.  Specifically, I am certain that I expressed no concerns on the part of the AIB board about stress testing.  The board never authorised or was aware of the meeting.  I did not report back to the board on the outcome of the meeting.  The meeting was an exploratory, technical one between economists to ascertain whether the ESRI's model could be used to enhance the scene setting of base and stressed economic scenarios by providing more economic variables than contained in regulatory exercises at the time.  It was never the intention to ask the ESRI to carry out stress tests independently of regulatory ... of the regulatory ones and it was certainly never envisaged that the ESRI would apply macroeconomic scenarios to the bank's internal data.  I never asked Professor FitzGerald to carry out stress testing on behalf of AIB.  I sought to explore whether prescribed regulatory economic stress data, which consisted of only a limited number of indicators, could be run through the model to generate a more graphic and detailed economic picture of the stressed outcomes.  The meeting failed to produce any results.  As I recollect, Professor FitzGerald indicated that the ESRI would not undertake private unpublished work.  There were some limitations as to what the model could do, but he was prepared to make data from the forthcoming medium-term review available to us.  It was an inconclusive meeting and my unit never followed up on that.<br\/><br\/>If Professor FitzGerald did any other work for AIB or other banks on stress testing, I am not aware of it.The impression created by Professor FitzGerald's testimony is that the AIB board was concerned about the lack of severity in the stress test exercises as far back as late 2005, which may imply a broader level of concern.  I have no knowledge of the board's opinion on the matter.  I never received any negative feedback or reports from the board or board risk committee on stress testing.  As a result, I have no reason to believe that the AIB board had any misgivings about regulatory stress testing.  It was not my practice in AIB to attribute comments or opinions to other AIB business units or committees, least of all the board of the bank.<br\/><br\/>Stress testing in AIB is executed through the stress testing steering group, which is responsible for ensuring that a comprehensive stress testing programme is embedded in risk management and to ensure that an effective framework is in place to enable stress testing across the group.  I attended the meetings of the stress testing steering group when a stress test exercise had to be carried out.  My role was to communicate the evolution of the scenarios from base case to stress scenarios to the committee and onward to divisional risk management and business units, as appropriate.  I was not involved in the application of the economic variables to the bank's internal data.  This was ... sorry ... carried out by analysts within the divisional risk and credit units as well as in the group risk unit.  <br\/><br\/>From an early stage, probably prior to 2005, I felt that the regulatory stress testing exercise could become too procedural.  Banks were provided with stress tests, the work was carried out with great care and attention to detail, signed off by bank boards and reported on by the Central Bank in various reports, such as the annual financial report.  I also felt that the stresses were too mild, though not on every occasion.  I was also concerned that the moderate nature of the stresses were not conducive to maximising management buy-in of the risks involved.  This was my personal opinion and had much to do with the view that people performing the stress tests in various business units needed to understand the broader economic and financial implications of a given shock to a base case scenario.  To do this, one needed a model and the ESRI had one.  A model would provide more outputs for consideration, a wider context to the changed economic environment and given the likelihood of a growing stress testing framework, a more consistent approach to the exercise over time.  I raised these issues with the stress testing steering group and suggested that I talk to John FitzGerald in the ESRI to see what could be done.  I stated this would have some cost implications.  <br\/><br\/>I quote John FitzGerald from his testimony to the committee:<\/p><blockquote>We did macro-economic scenarios.  The difference compared to what the Central Bank and so on was doing was that we used a model, so it was consistent.  One did not get a housing price crash and no change in unemployment; one got a housing price crash, unemployment going through the roof and Government revenue collapsing, all coming together which is the way to do it.  That was my concern.  It was not just the Central Bank.  It was interesting doing something similar with a British owned bank.  The Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority, FSA, had a similar inappropriate approach to stress testing.<\/blockquote>  <p>So, I also felt that the amount of data provided and scenario scene setting between the base case and stress tests were too limited.  This applied to both Irish and UK regulatory tests.  I wanted to bring more information to bear on the process of assessing the risks to the business from the economic deterioration under consideration in the stress.  I carried out, personally carried out, most of the work on the macroeconomic inputs for stress testing in AIB.  From year to year, I endeavoured to be consistent in how I interpreted the shocks and in producing additional information for the divisional risk and business teams, particularly the changes in employment, which were not specified in the macro-aggregates in the base or stress scenarios.  This had to be estimated within individual banks from the changes in real GDP and unemployment rates supplied for the exercise.<br\/><br\/>In his testimony, Professor FitzGerald stated on several occasions that his recollection of the meeting in October 2005 might be faulty.  In his letter to the committee of 16 February he states: &quot;However, as my recollection of the timing of the meeting was faulty, there is always the possibility that my recollection of the content of the meeting was also faulty.&quot;  Mr. Chairman, much emphasis has been placed on the importance of this meeting between the ESRI and AIB in October 2005 at the committee hearing on 11 February but it did not have the imprimatur of the AIB board.

I have to say I was very, very surprised to hear what Professor John FitzGerald had to say at the committee meeting.  I've known him quite a long time.  We've worked together in the Department of Finance in the 1970s.  We've had some interactions, over the years.  I ... I suppose, at my own initiative, I decided that what we needed to do ... I was doing the stress testing, shall I say.  I may not be doing the stress testing, you know, indefinitely and I wanted to bring some consistency to the way in which these stresses and the scenarios were being presented to the risk analysts who had to carry out the exercise.  A model was one way of doing it.  So, I approached John FitzGerald with a view to, first of all, inputting the regulatory stress test, the data that we were given by, say, the Central Bank, which were very limited in number.  I wanted to run those results through the model to generate a wider scene setting because the model generates quite a lot of information.  And as Professor FitzGerald states in his ... in the letter to the committee, the model could do that and that, for me, was an important input into the stress test exercise to be carried out within the bank itself.  I wanted the business units to get a full sense of ... the fullest possible sense as to what this stress involved.  With the benefit of hindsight of what happened, it's quite clear that having the clearest and the most, you know, expansive version of a stress and what it would involve might have been useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#OO01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Beggs"},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":1064,"content":"<p>Okay.

You know, the thing about once you'd remembered to put it into context is: when stress tests are done, you're looking at past data.  Ireland had had experienced, since 1975, one year in which nominal house prices had fallen, and they'd fallen by 1.7%.  One year since 1970 that GDP had fallen on an annual basis.  So to put in stresses of 2% or 3% falls in GDP, 20% falls in nominal house price would have been severe.  If you're suggesting that they should have had a stress test with a 67% fall in commercial prices, a 50% fall in residential prices, and a 12.5% fall in GDP, obviously they didn't, but at the time I don't think that was unreasonable.  Plus, the major problem for the Irish banks wasn't just Irish commercial property; US commercial property prices fell 40%, and UK commercial property prices fell 35%.

So the first quote, gentlemen, I don't expect you to be familiar with this, but the Oxford University Press published an extended article in 1999 by a Peter Englund from the Stockholm School of Economics. The article is called &quot;The Swedish Banking Crisis: Roots and Consequences&quot;.  And he relied extensively on a paper that was done for the IMF the year before by two analysts.  One is a director of research at the World Bank, for the record, Asli Demirg&uuml;&ccedil;-Kunt and Enrica Detragiache.  And Professor Englund sums up what they found, and I want to read what he says and just ... you'll be able to take note in your head, it's not very complicated.  So to quote:<\/p><blockquote>[This paper] identifies 30 major banking crises from the early 1980s and onwards.  Most of these are in developing countries, the main exceptions being three of the Nordic countries (Norway, Finland, and Sweden) in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  The majority of these crises appear to have followed a common pattern.  They have (i) been initiated by deregulatory measures, which have (ii) led to overly rapid credit expansion.  This has in turn been followed by (iii) a sustained increase in asset prices, apparently unwarranted by fundamentals (a &lsquo;bubble&rsquo;).  At some point (iv) the bubble has burst, with a dramatic fall in prices and disruption of asset markets (in particular for real estate) and widespread bankruptcies.  This has been accompanied by (v) non-performing loans, credit losses, and an acute banking  crisis, in many cases intertwined with (vi) a currency crisis.  Finally, (vii), a weakened banking sector has inflicted a credit crunch on the private sector, the severity of which has depended on (viii) the government measures taken to salvage the ailing banks.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#TT00800","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":1227,"content":"<p>The point I will put to you, and ask for your comment in a minute gentlemen, after the next quote is, apart from the currency crisis, if those eight factors-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#TT00900","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":1228,"content":"<p>Sorry there is a phone interruption there ... on top of your ... it might be coming quite close by to you.

I noticed none of you mentioned Mr. McWilliams in your introductory remarks, you did mention Professor Kelly.  Let me quote from the evidence David McWilliams gave to this inquiry.  He said:<\/p><blockquote>I just want to make some opening remarks about the period in question, starting with 2000 and going up to 2008 and beyond.  [I'll just skip a little bit and then continue] In fact, I probably spent the best part of a decade trying to warn as many people as possible on as many platforms as possible that our property market was going to crash and that when it did, our banking system would be in a situation where money would fly out of the system and lead to a banking crisis.  <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">[...] I made documentaries about this.  I had [my own] TV show [on TV3].  [...]  I warned people at every juncture that our housing market was a credit bubble and credit bubbles bust and it is not a matter of if they bust but when they bust.  [...] When I hear the view that nobody saw this coming or that this was in some way a shock or we were taken by surprise, I do not believe that is the case.  I think the Irish property crash and the banking crash were both incredibly predictable and absolutely preventable.<\/font><\/blockquote> <p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> And Mr. McWilliams then refers to a &quot;Prime Time&quot; interview he did in October of 2003 which he says was watched by 400,000 people.  And in that he said, and I quote:<\/font><\/p><blockquote><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> <\/font>The Irish housing market is a scam.  It is an enormous financial swindle that could potentially confine an entire generation of young Irish workers to years of bad debt.  Far from being a reflection of economic vitality and fundamental demand the housing bubble is, in the main, a vacuous financial confidence trick that has been foisted upon us by an alliance of banks and the landowners.  <br \/><br \/>Today, in Ireland, the price of the average house is close to ten times the average wage.  This represents an economic failure on a monumental scale.  Behind this nonsense is excessive and irresponsible lending from our financial institutions.  The situation would be laughable if it were not so serious.<\/blockquote> <p>Gentlemen, could I ask you to reflect on the two quotes, one from 1998 and then one from Mr. McWilliams some time ago and to give me your reaction?

Most of the crises occurred in high inflation periods where the price falls were significant falls in real house prices not in normal prices.  I would argue, and I said in my opening statement, that I think you can explain a lot of what happened in the Irish residential property market up to around 2005 in fundamental terms.  There's not many economies in the western world that have an 18% rise in their population in ten years, so obviously there was a massive increase in demand for housing.  There's not many economies that grew by 9% per annum between 1994 and 2000.  There's not many economies that grew 5.5% between 2000 and 2007. So we're talking at a time when employment was rising very rapidly, population was growing very strongly so I think ... and they other thing I think which one should bare in mind which is ... I think pretty obvious, but most people don't seem to think it has any relevance, is that Ireland joined the euro.  And we went from a relatively high interest rate economy to a very low interest rate economy.  Sweden didn't do that or any of those other countries didn't do that so anyone who looked at any economic analysis or any theory of finance would suggest that if you ... if your average interest rate is 7% or 8% and it becomes 3%, asset prices will rise.  So all of those factors should be taken into account.  <\/p>  <p>           I think if you look at the Central Bank's quarterly survey of credit standards, which is done by the ECB all through Europe but the Irish Central Bank publishes the Irish one.  It's only in 2005 that you get credit standards loosening, I think.  Then I think it becomes much more credit driven.  So the last ... '05, '06, particularly '07, I think were not driven by fundamentals.  I think there was more of a credit driven element to it.  This committee, over the last few days, has been discussing for example the introduction of 100% mortgages for first-time buyers which, if I recall, I think it was in 2005.  So I think it is only over the last two or three years of the boom that we can say there was a bubble element came in.  But also, in 2007, most people, including myself, were saying the housing market would slow down.  Okay we weren't saying it was going to crash, but we were saying it was going to slow down.  You look at all the forecasts that were produced, everyone thought that house completions would fall.  By the way, is there a shortage of housing now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#UU00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Dan McLaughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":1234,"content":"<p>Sorry, was that a question to me?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#VV00200","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430953200,"counter":1235,"content":"<p>It was rhetorical.

If I am not wrong, the factor that led to that bubble bursting was German unification and the impact of the currency markets and what that meant for Sweden's fixed exchange rate.  There is always some factor that eventually leads to these.  In the case of the Irish crisis, it was a global crisis.  The European Commission produced some report in 2009 that said, and it actually referenced local shocks and problems, banking crises and mentioned Sweden, but it said this time it is different.  This is a much more significant crisis.  That only sort of explains why the Irish one is a much more significant crisis than maybe one that was managed in Sweden.<br\/><br\/>I reference in my written statement under the issue of the role of advisors in analysing the crisis and I said:<\/p><blockquote>Against the backdrop of so much data and analysis, it would be difficult to argue that there was not a build up of interrelated risks and uncertainties in the Irish economy and banking system.  After all, notwithstanding the belief in our economic fundamentals going back to the 1990s, the build up to the Irish banking crisis had previously occurred in varying degrees and circumstances in other advanced countries.<\/blockquote>  <p>So I would say we had ample warning through the period.  I referenced OECD reports, IMF reports, that the Irish property market was overvalued.  Econometric studies that were saying we were 70% overvalued and then of course they were then pared back by other studies that said no we're not, which led Morgan Kelly to say &quot;By the way, all those previous studies didn't take a long enough view of the timeframe for these analyses&quot;, and he came to the conclusion that we were 50%, 60% overvalued, and we would potentially have a fall of that magnitude.<br\/><br\/>So warning signs were there about what had happened in other countries.  I would agree that in the period from probably 2004, I would say, or 2005 to 2007, lending policies ...  lending was too rapid.  It seems from what I have heard from other witnesses before this committee that maintaining market share, growing market share, seemed to be a more important driver of why credit was growing than there being, if you like, underlying sound reasons for the expansion.  I agree with you that house prices were too high.  <\/p>  <p>         They were too high from a very, very early stage in this recovery, making it more difficult for people to buy houses.  In our reports we have ... I referenced this ... showing the impact of rising house prices, rising interest rates on affordability.  By 2006, affordability had deteriorated to its worst levels in ten years and that was only after financial institutions had provided 100% mortgages, 35 to 40-year loans, you know, trackers, whatever ... all the means they could to make it affordable for people to still buy houses.  And at the same time they were providing finance for property developers where there was, obviously, rampant inflation going on, on that side.  So, we were building up a problem, and the question is ... absenting the global economic crisis from mid-2008, how would we have managed that?  That's the, if you like, the counterfactual that can't be ... well, we could think about it, but we haven't really figured out or thought about what might have happened to the Irish property market in the absence of that global shock.  But it did happen and we are in this situation now.  So, I think the warnings ... warnings are there, even in our own research, we had sufficient warnings, that people in, you know, risk management, credit management, should've been saying, \"Yes, okay, I hear you still think there's going to be a soft landing, but, you know, I'm going to be more sceptical than that about it.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#VV00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Beggs","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":1238,"content":"<p>Mr. McArdle?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#WW00200","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430953200,"counter":1239,"content":"<p>We will always have contrarians, first of all.

So that's the first point, you'll always have contrarians.  I quote you then in my witness statement at page 8, where I quote Professor Honohan to a D&aacute;il committee in June 2010, where he said, &quot;regulators should always pay attention to [contrarians] with coherent but not necessarily right views&quot;.  He went on to say &quot;Contrarians are nearly always wrong but it is the &quot;nearly&quot; that matters&quot;.  So, here you're operating on a very small probability - it's the nearly that matters - and more attention was not paid to those two studies, you say, because warnings like that are nearly always wrong, in the words of Professor Honohan.

I mean I do reference this in my statement, that we were running out of road when it comes to housing, that the affordability issue was reaching critical points whereby when you stress test people's incomes and their ability to afford to buy a house, that we were running at a point where fewer and fewer people would actually be able to meet those criteria, and that, may I say, was against a backdrop where, of extremely expensive average houses.  I mean, I take the view and my comment, my written statement, I dismiss econometric evidence around house prices as being, you know, just that.  But I base my view about the housing market on my own personal experience of my own children in the housing market in 2004, 2005 and 2006, and the extremely high prices that they had to pay for average properties.  And, I'm thinking to myself, you know, how is this going to continue?  What way are we going to manage a business, a sustainable business, if house prices are of this level?  It's all right, you know, offering more and more better terms so that people can afford to buy it, but at the end of the day they are being pushed out to 40-year mortgages with, you know, interest-only or whatever.  This was, actually, running out of steam long before Morgan Kelly pronounced, in my opinion, and our reports, notwithstanding some of the titles we put on some of our reports, and our view that &quot;we hope for an equilibrium&quot;, or &quot;we hope for a soft landing&quot;.  The evidence is in the reports, and I did actually supply the committee with the full text of our April '06 report, because they've only given a <i>finfacts<\/i>summary of it here, but it does contain, as I said, the evidence that things were becoming untenable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#XX00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Beggs"},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":1247,"content":"<p>Gentlemen, briefly, did any of the other two gentlemen, did any of you take any serious notice of what David McWilliams was writing about from 2000 onwards?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#XX00500","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430953200,"counter":1248,"content":"<p>It was just another view.

I'm looking at something, I ... the notion that nobody thought that, everybody thought the housing market would go on forever, is completely wrong.  It's absolutely, completely wrong.  Of course, not many people thought it would collapse the way it did but in January 2007, I'm even looking at something I wrote myself, \"the most likely outturn for the market is therefore a period of flat or only modest price growth ... until affordability is restored\" - that's January 2007.  So the notion that everyone was saying it was going to go up 10% per annum is just not true.  The other thing I would point out is the major losses for the Irish banks were not in residential property, they were in commercial property ... in commercial property.

Or it could have been nationalised, as Professor Honohan has spoken about at length here.  But the one thing that I would just mention is that Ashoka Mody, who was part of the IMF team that came over here, and I think I have got the right man, when Anglo was eventually nationalised the following January, in the middle of January if I recall correctly, he wrote an article that said that all of the trouble in Europe started with that decision.

The idea that a soft landing, if you defined it as something that was mild and gradual, it never happened.  When we are talking about soft landings, we were talking about it in relation to the housing market, I'm really referring there to a soft landing on prices.  When you are at 93,000 units in 2006, it's very unlikely that we are going to have a soft landing, unless we have such a gradual deceleration in the rate of house building over four or five years, the likelihood was, I think it was referred to by other witnesses here today, that the output drop from 93,000 units to something more sustainable, which in our view was somewhere around 50,000, if it happened in one, two years, was going to have a big impact on the economy.  So the soft landing really referred only to house prices, that house prices could stop rising, so I would agree with that and that was never ... our definition of soft landing was never quite as soft as generally supposed.  In fact, in our report, we make the point that we did not rule out prices falling over several months and at the higher end of the market, where you couldn't justify what people were paying for houses at the top end, that we weren't ruling out significant price declines there, but our concept was, that for the average house price, that that would not decline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#KKK01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Beggs"},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":1405,"content":"<p>Can I just finish?

My view ... this leads me into my view of NAMA ... I'm on record on saying NAMA at the time ... when I was writing for <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, was the least worst option.  A lot of people disagreed with that, vehemently actually at the time in 2009, I still have that view.  In fact, I think it has turned out better than could have been expected.  What I would say, though, is that the process by which NAMA was set up, it took almost two years from the Bacon report to the transfer of loans was unfortunate.  That timeline was far too long.  Now, I don't think there was anything anyone in Ireland could have done about it because it was dictated by DG Competition in Brussels but it allowed time for the value of those assets to be marked down for a whole variety of reasons, some of which we touched on here earlier, the national interest, and that was unfortunate.  And the final thing I'd say now is that it's obvious now that NAMA underpaid the banks for the loans they took.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050700002#MMM00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat McArdle"},{"type":"speech","time":1430953200,"counter":1436,"content":"<p>Mr. McArdle, on page 3 of your statement, point 4, \"I want to make the following points ...

That fall in asset prices was ... what happened was NAMA meant that that was marked to market.  Obviously house prices dropped 50% and it's obviously a very serious thing for a lot of people that were in negative equity and some people obviously lost their homes.  But the banks did not mark to market that house price fall, and as we now know the banks have now if you like ... the level of arrears tells you that the banks did not foreclose on those houses and therefore mark to market the price change.

The photo shoot is for Europe Day and all committee members and the Ceann Comhairle will be there.<\/p> <p>  I ask people, including those in the Visitors Gallery, to switch off their mobile telephones as they interfere with the equipment.  Putting them on silent mode does not help.<\/p> <p>  Today, we are marking Europe Day in the Oireachtas.  The committee will begin its consideration of the challenges facing Europe and the changing attitudes to the European Union.  We have invited a number of citizen groups.  We are joined by representatives of the Irish Countrywomen's Association and Active Retirement Ireland as well as by a number of people from Youth Work Ireland and by Ms Noelle O'Connell, who we all know from the European Movement.  We will hear contributions from each of those organisations and then we will have some questions from members. <\/p> <p>  Anecdotal and statistical evidence points to a decline in support across the European Union for the European project.  That decline in support is mirrored somewhat in Ireland as well.  At the same time, we have seen a rise in support for extreme right and left wing politics in Europe.  It is, therefore, a useful opportunity, during Europe Week, to have a discussion about this rise in extremism, which is why we invited in these groups from across Irish society to hear their views.<\/p><p>We are keen to find out what they think could be done to try to lead to an increase in support for and engagement in the European project.  We are hoping to gain an insight into and better understanding of issues in respect of changing attitudes towards Europe.<br\/><br\/>Before we begin I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not make charges, criticise or comment on a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

On behalf of my fellow board members I thank the joint committee for this kind invitation to discuss changing attitudes to the European Union, as perceived among the members of the largest membership organisation of women in Ireland.  In preparation for this presentation I held a series of interviews with a number of current federation presidents, members of our board, former presidents and some guild members.  I asked them a series of questions about their attitudes to the European Union and, although anecdotal, I will report on their responses.<\/p> <p>  The ICA was founded in Wexford in 1910.  Since the start, the ICA has tackled the big issues of the day.  Before modern-day Europe was born in 1957 the ICA was instrumental in providing practical support in the development of basic utilities in Ireland such as water and electricity.  Before setting out the finer details of the responses I wish to highlight some of the ways the ICA is committed to the European project.  Although I will touch on some of the evidence of changing attitudes I am keen to reiterate that historically and in particular during my presidency, the ICA has always strongly supported the European project.<\/p> <p>  I represent more than 10,000 women.  Two areas of significant importance to our members are family and health.  The women of the ICA look to Europe to ensure that important issues like child care and early education are high on the agenda of policy makers.  Some of the mothers and grandmothers in the ICA have children with special needs.  They look to Europe for support for inclusive schooling and specialised staff.  Through our membership of the Confederation of Family Organisations in the European Union, COFACE, we have been able to push a number of policy recommendations that have come from European institutions.  We have been members of the organisation since 1957.  Without this link to Europe the ICA would not have been able to participate with COFACE in lobbying for more family-friendly policies over the years.<\/p> <p>  Let us turn to the matter of health.  Last month, together with the European Parliament information office in Ireland, the ICA held a symposium on health issues and initiatives focused on promoting good health in older people.  The event looked at solutions to the challenges facing rural communities in particular.  Contributors spoke about how they overcome their problems and what their communities are faced with today.  One of the areas covered was the Europe against cancer programme initiated by the European Council.  The ICA was active in pushing for national breast cancer screening and more recently the ICA was part of a successful campaign to extend BreastCheck to women aged 65 and 69 years of age.  The fact that I know the Commission has recently established a new expert group on cancer control gives me the support I need to tell my members that Europe is fighting for cancer control.<\/p> <p>  I will outline some information on the interviews I held with our current and former presidents and other members of the ICA.  I asked the members only to speak about the past three years, as this covers my term in office.  All of the women I polled were aged 50 years and over.  The main response I received from the ICA women was that they strongly support the European project.  Members believe that the European directives, where implemented by the Government, have been successful.  These have included family, health, fiscal and farming policies.  When asked the direct question, \"Do you think that there has been declining support for the EU project in the past three years?\" the overwhelming answer among ICA members was \"No.\"  When asked if they believed they had been supported by Europe in the past three years I received a resounding \"Yes\".  I asked for examples of this and the members took the view that they had been bailed out by Europe and that we would not now have the economy and stability we are now beginning to notice without the help of Europe.  Members representing the farming sector commented on the lifting of the milk quotas as being a boon to our dairy farmers.  The quality of our new roads and infrastructure was another example of the reason for their support.  The EU healthy eating policies that have been implemented in Irish schools came up as another area cited positively.  Members of the ICA believe that for a small country we have a big voice in Europe and they believe this is thanks to the outstanding work of the 11 Irish MEPs.  The support for the MEP structure and their role is strong.  Some of the members I spoke to have second homes in France and Spain.  They commented that rural communities in Ireland seem to have fared better than elsewhere and referred to help from French and Spanish communities.  Some members took the view that even if the United Kingdom left the EU, Ireland would not suffer unduly since Ireland's relationship with Europe is so strong.  ICA members believe that the European equality directives have helped women in Ireland in terms of our equality laws.<\/p> <p>  However, it is not all positive.  Members felt that the Irish were dealt with very harshly by the troika and that austerity measures imposed upon us were too severe.  They also expressed the view that European policy makers often seem rather remote or removed from the understanding of the everyday life of an Irish person, particularly with reference to losing our well-educated young people, who have been forced to emigrate.  I thank the committee members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015050700002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mrs. Elizabeth Wall"},{"type":"speech","time":1431003600,"counter":1696,"content":"<p>Thank you for that contribution Mrs. Wall.

I will set out a little background.  Active Retirement Ireland is a national network of over 560 local active retirement associations across the breath of Ireland, south and north of the Border.  Each is self-managed and run by older people by themselves and for themselves.  We have over 24,500 members in the organisation from the age of 50 years upwards to 100 years.  We operate across nine regions.  Our mission is to reach out to all older people to stop loneliness through friendship and support.  Our organisation has been a member of AGE Platform Europe since 2009.  We are pleased AGE Platform Europe is seeking consultative status at the Council of Europe in order that it can participate more in debates.<\/p> <p>  I will set out our views on older people in Europe.  The current generation of older people includes those aged 55 years plus.  It is not a homogeneous group and we have members from 55 years right up to 100 years of age.  This includes several generations.  They have strong memories of Ireland pre-1973.  The country was post-colonial and rather inward focused.  Pre-EEC Ireland was an unequal and unfair society.  One example of this was the so-called marriage bar, removed in 1973.  It would not have been removed were it not for Ireland wanting to get into the EEC at the time and the provision that we had to put in place some equality laws for that to happen and so on.  That policy cost an entire generation of women their own pension rights.  This is only beginning to emerge today in terms of policies that acted against women's equality.  Irish equality legislation, including measures to address ageism, was practically non-existent prior to EEC membership.  Since then, however, we have seen the Equal Status Act 2000 as well as the Employment Equality Act 1998.  These are all in the memories of people who have gone through the labour force.<\/p> <p>  Older people have seen the European Union bring major improvements to Irish infrastructure.  When we ask people throughout the country about it they talk of the new roads.  They still refer to these as the new roads although they may have been in place for some time.  We have preserved rural Ireland by attracting businesses and investment to rural Ireland.  All this is due to EU support.  This is in the memory of people as a result of coming into the EU.  We are aware of the influence of European Social Fund programmes throughout the years for women's projects, communities, child care, youth projects and more.  These have impacted throughout Ireland and have helped to build excellent infrastructure and child care centres throughout Ireland that are run in communities by communities.<\/p><p>Farmers across Ireland have seen improvements in their standard of living and have been able to avail of improvements and developments in their sector.  This is in the living memory of our members. <\/p><p> The developments, however, are not all positive.  The dreaded regulations are sometimes feared more than necessary, for example, there was a fear that we would all be eating straight bananas but that did not happen.  There was a perception that the EU would bring that down on people.  There is a perception that the MEPs and Commissioners are \"over there\", that it is a cushy number and they are out of touch. <\/p><p> The bailout and recession were seen as the result of EU outsiders wielding influence.  Austerity hit older people.  Whether due to the EU or not, they lost trust in their banks and institutions.  It is all seen as one big pot.  That is the negative effect that is hitting people.<\/p><p> The biggest recent changes are the changes in perception.  On the positive side, people became more open to older people.  I hope that was a change in attitude to Europe rather than a change in attitude to Ryanair but we will say it is a changed attitude to Europe.  Tourism has rejuvenated urban and rural areas in Ireland and has provided opportunities for older people to go to the Continent and see it in its entirety.<\/p><p> Flexicurity of pensions has allowed many older people move around Europe for long periods of time and make retirement homes in warmer climes for three to six months.  MEPs organise trips to Brussels and Strasbourg for active retirement associations.  That is very popular and has opened up Europe for people to see the different structures there.<\/p><p> We have changed our attitudes over the past 32 years but there is more to do.  The EU can regain the trust of older people through the role it plays in equality legislation.  Ireland&rsquo;s ageism laws are non-existent.  The EU can play a stronger role in that regard.  Ageism is rife in every part of Irish society.  We are all ageist in our own way and need to be more aware of that.  The EU can take a lead role in ensuring that older people&rsquo;s voices are heard in tourism, consumer protection, health policies in particular, and the whole concept of healthy and positive ageing.  The National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, centre did research for us a couple of years ago with active retirement members which found that by participating in activities that make their lives more active and engaged and less lonely, they contribute the equivalent of &euro;15 million a year to their own health.  There is a big agenda in protecting the human rights of older people.  We would like to see the working group do more work on that non-binding instrument on the promotion of human rights for older people.  That work needs to be linked to other instruments, such as the Madrid international plan on ageing and the global network of age-friendly cities and communities, because we have a national positive ageing strategy in Ireland but we do not have an implementation plan.  While attitudes to the EU have certainly changed and many older people can see the benefits, there is more work to be done and we would be very willing to engage in that work on health promotion, policy, ageism and human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015050700002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maureen Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431003600,"counter":1699,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kavanagh.

In school, we learn that there are 28 member states but that is about all we learn.  It is covered under Civic, Social and Political Education, CSPE, but only <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  Some people have a lot of knowledge if they have an interest in politics but that depends on the person and not everyone will have the same knowledge of the EU.  The teaching of the subject varies from school to school.  There is no consistent training in the teaching of the topic.  The language used in all EU promotional materials and policies is very inaccessible.  For example, what are &ldquo;synergies&rdquo;, or even something as simple as MEP?  Many do not even know what MEP means, let alone who are the MEPs.<br\/><br\/>There are two areas of EU youth strategy which are very relevant to the lives of young people in Ireland today, the structured dialogue process and youth exchanges.

I stress, however, that is a very rare thing and my friends, let alone every young person in Ireland, do not know what I am doing.<\/p> <p>  The structured dialogue process is the way the EU gathers opinions and information from young people on youth policies.  It is run by the European Commission.  I returned last night from a review of the process in Brussels and I have attended two conferences, in Rome and Riga.  There are positive aspects of the structured dialogue process, such as bringing everyone together and having a forum to discuss our views on a European level, which has great potential to change the lives and policies for young people, which it tries to do.  There is, however, always a &ldquo;but&rdquo;; current effectiveness is very questionable.  Ireland and Britain are the only two countries sending young people.  One sees young people aged 30 and more, who are irrelevant.  Ireland is leading on the consultation side compared with other countries.  Young voices is our consultation process.  It is a quite elitist group as is the content being discussed.  We have to challenge views such as young people not being relevant actors in the political process.  That was a comment I heard at one of the conferences.

Often there is little for the EVS volunteers to do in Ireland.  The challenge for them is the massive amount of paper work involved.  People are turned off applying because they will have to do all this paper work.  A massive part of non-engagement is the bureaucracy involved.

The Comhairle na n&Oacute;g youth councils could provide a very good opportunity for young people to learn about the EU and get involved in decision-making at EU level.  Making youth structures accessible to all, reaching seldom heard, hard to reach young people is difficult for all Irish-based participation structures but we need as a society to find ways of engaging with them to ensure their voices are heard at all levels, including at European level.

I am the executive director of European Movement Ireland.  As members may be aware, our organisation was founded in 1954 to develop the connection between Ireland and Europe.  Europe week and Europe day on Saturday are a little bit like Christmas for us - the busiest week of the year.  I congratulate the committee on today's initiative.  It is an opportune time for us to assess sentiment and public attitudes towards our relationship with Europe.  I may have drawn the short straw in following all the excellent presentations; I have a lot of statistics in my address and apologise in advance if it is like death by statistics so soon after lunch.  I hope the members will bear with me nonetheless.<br\/><br\/>With an impressive 71% turnout, the accession to the European Community referendum was ratified by 83% of the Irish electorate in 1972.  In general, our 40-year membership of the EU has been well received and, as was touched upon in some of the earlier presentations, is widely recognised as having been a key enabler in modernising both our economy and our wider society.  That said, the past several years were most difficult as the global financial crisis impacted in Ireland with full force.  When Ireland exited the external financial assistance programme, commonly known as the troika programme, in December 2013, we were the first programme country to do so.  The most recent recession experience has certainly influenced public opinion of and sentiment towards the EU, as it has across the Union and particularly in southern Europe.  From 2007, Irish people&rsquo;s trust in the EU had generally been in decline.  To gauge our current attitude, I will refer to some of the most recent opinion polling data which indicate that, notwithstanding many challenges, we continue to retain a positive view of our membership of the EU. <br\/><br\/>In January 2013 at the start of the 7th Irish EU Presidency<b>, <\/b>European Movement Ireland commissioned Red C to ascertain Irish people&rsquo;s views on Irish-EU relations.  More than 1,000 people were sampled and the independent poll results were encouraging.  They indicated that 85% believed Ireland should remain part of the European Union, while 83% believed Ireland has benefited from membership overall.  Just 29% believed that Ireland should leave the EU if the UK decided to do so with only 25% agreeing that Ireland should leave the euro currency.  Although that poll took place in January 2013 this last point is of relevance today, the day of the UK general election.  Regardless of the decision the UK takes as the term BrExit enters everyday parlance, it was encouraging to see that only 29% believed Ireland should leave the EU if the UK did so.<br\/><br\/>Eurobarometer No. 82 from November 2014 has returned the most encouraging and most recent results to date.  To assess public attitudes towards the EU, Eurobarometer assigned two variables, namely, &lsquo;trust in the EU&rsquo; and &lsquo;image of the EU&rsquo;.  Prior to the global financial crisis and subsequent EU-IMF programme, trust in the EU was generally high in Ireland.  However, after the first year of the EU-IMF programme distrust in the EU had increased significantly from 39% to 60%.  Indeed, during the years 2010 to 2013, public opinion cooled somewhat towards the EU.  As trust levels dropped, fewer and fewer Irish people held a positive image of the EU, although Ireland was by no means an outlier in this respect.  As of November 2014, trust levels appeared to be on the rise again in Ireland, with 37% of people surveyed saying they now trusted the EU.  This is the highest recorded level since the lows of the 2011 crisis.  Like trust levels, Irish people&rsquo;s positive image of the EU had also been in decline in recent years from the previous high levels.  The results suggest that a more positive view of the EU is returning with 53% saying they have a positive image of the EU, up 12 points since spring 2014 and 16 points since 2013.  Indeed, last November&rsquo;s Eurobarometer report represents the highest levels of people in Ireland holding a positive image of the EU since 2009. <br\/><br\/>According to the latest KBC Ireland-ESRI consumer sentiment index, Irish consumer confidence increased in April 2015 to 98.7%.  Interestingly, we can see that as growth has returned to Ireland, so too has a more positive attitude towards the EU, albeit in a more measured manner.  Similarly, the Eurobarometer report indicated that Irish optimism about the future of the EU rose from 58% in May 2012 to 78% in November 2014, which was the highest across all 28 member states and was set against an EU average of 56%.  However, we also need to take on board the fact that 53% of Irish people disagreed with the statement that their voice in the EU counts.  This is something Ms Ryan, Ms Gayson and Ms Coady touched upon in their presentations.  Clearly much more work needs to be done. <br\/><br\/>The decline of trust in the EU is not solely tied to growth rates and economic indicators but is more deeply rooted.  To fully reverse any downward trends in public opinion, the EU must continue to improve the way in which it interacts and does business with its citizens.  In Ireland, the recent upswing in sentiment does not mean that we can be complacent about our future relationship with the EU.  It has often been said that national governments are quick to claim credit for any positive news that might originate from the EU while being just as quick to blame Brussels for any bad news or restrictions.  It is a difficult balancing act which colours public perception of the EU&rsquo;s role in people&rsquo;s daily lives.  In turn the EU, its various institutions and elected representatives need to strive to engage with all citizens to improve the results I have outlined in our own poll and the Eurobarometer survey. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015050700002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Noelle O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1431003600,"counter":1709,"content":"<p>I invite Deputy Halligan to begin the session with the initial questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015050700002#E00100","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1431003600,"counter":1710,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their very detailed contributions.  It is interesting that we are dealing with an all-women delegation.  EU statistics show the high rate of unemployment among women.  It is interesting that youth unemployment is extremely high in the EU with approximately 20.8 million people currently unemployed in Europe.  Youth unemployment in Greece is running at about 56%.  I have always believed that in tough times of austerity, whether in Ireland or elsewhere, that women are always at the coal-face.  I am sure many Deputies and councillors have noted that women are either forced out to work or cannot find work or they must work and then deal with child care when they come home.  We underestimate the levels of poverty that affect women right across Europe, those in the workplace and women who are not working.  I congratulate the delegates on the superb work of their organisations, Active Retirement Ireland and the ICA across the country.  I have connections in Waterford with those organisations and they do superb work.<\/p> <p>  Have the organisations formed contacts with other groups across Europe such as with women's groups or groups representing young farmers or farmers, countrywomen's associations, active retirement groups and youth groups?  At this stage it is very important for all of us.  It is okay for politicians meeting politicians which happens regularly across Europe.  However, it can be difficult for us to meet ordinary, everyday people unless we go to Europe and I have been to many countries in Europe, including Greece, over recent years.  Have the delegates been to the European Union and met all our MEPs?  I hope they have.  Are there similar groups in Europe with which the organisations could interact?  I imagine this would be important in the next number of years.  I know that opinion polls swing up and down with regard to Europe but there is evidence of a disassociation from Europe on the part of many people.  I am not making a political speech but we could be in serious times if the Conservatives are elected in England.  I have been to London and to the Houses of Parliament.  Even some Labour MPs are advocating that the UK should get out of Europe.  Therefore, it is not a foregone conclusion that Britain would not pull out of Europe in a few years time.  I do not think they will but I see it as less than 50:50 as it stands.  However, organisations more so than politicians have a better chance of meeting ordinary, everyday who work across Europe.  The delegates may be doing this already but it would be very interesting if groups like those here today were to meet up with groups from various countries in Europe.  Perhaps an annual meeting could be arranged to share figures and assessments.  The delegates could then report back to this committee on the people they met who are in the same situation as women in Ireland.  I thank the delegates for their detailed contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015050700002#E00200","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1431003600,"counter":1711,"content":"<p>I join with the Chairman and other members in welcoming our guests.

The longer we are here the older we get and I speak as someone who is reminded by my wife every day that I am getting closer to a very special birthday in the next few days.  I am also speaking as someone who has taken a very active interest in young people's affairs over many years.  I go to schools and colleges, sometimes to take it on the chin and to brave it out, but I often say to young people who feel there is a lack of support and a lack of encouragement, that we have to start somewhere and we have to start by acknowledging our mistakes.  <\/p> <p>  Many different parts of society have let down our young people.  We need to make a start to redress that.  I meet with Deputies, Senators and Ministers from all parties and none who are very determined in that respect.  It is important to acknowledge the work of the organisations.  Oftentimes we refer to our young people as being the leaders of tomorrow when in fact, here we have leaders of today.  Other people will be the leaders of tomorrow and we need to encourage and support them as much as possible.  I agree with the Chairman's offer to follow through on the links and the established relationships so that we can help young people on their journey.  If we never achieved anything else as parliamentarians and as adults, except playing our part in encouraging our young people and helping them on their journey through the pathways they wish to pursue, then we will have achieved a great deal.  I am very happy to affirm the Chairman's offer for the committee to help the organisations achieve this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015050700002#E00300","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"speech","time":1431003600,"counter":1712,"content":"<p>I apologise for my late arrival and for missing the presentations but I have read them.  I have a question for Ms Noelle O'Connell from European Movement Ireland.  Ms O'Connell referred to a decline in trust.  Has there been a change in attitude to Europe?  When Ireland joined the EEC there was a much more defined party structure and party support and RTE was the means of accessing information.  Nowadays news is instant and we have more access to information as to what is happening in other countries.  The downturn in the economy has played a large part because for a long time Europe was presented to us as being what we could get out of it in terms of infrastructural or agricultural grants.  This attitude has changed in time and we have seen that with the referenda.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the presentation from Youth Work Ireland.  Is the history of the EEC and of post-war Europe taught in the CPSE programme in schools?  I have been invited to speak to CPSE classes in schools.  Is this happening in all schools?  Should CPSE be a compulsory subject?  I refer to the practice of discontinuing the teaching of history at leaving certificate level which may cause problems in how historical events are viewed.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015050700002#E00400","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1431003600,"counter":1713,"content":"<p>To what extent can we engineer a sense of belonging to Europe?

I am not sure what we could have done to attract more attention.  We tried everything but what we ended up with was a missed opportunity.

It was a perfect way for him to begin his contribution.  Active Retirement Ireland is concerned with changing attitudes among and about older people.  There is no definitive answer as to the age at which a person is categorised as old, but what is true is that we are all getting older.  Deputy Byrne spoke about climbing mountains, which I was delighted to hear.  Why should we not be climbing mountains as we get older?  A group of our members will be going surfing in Bundoran in September.  They are all in their 80s but it is something they want to do.  It is all about adjusting perceptions about what one can and cannot do as one gets older.  Deputy Byrne told us how he is X age and he still climbs mountains.  That is what we should be aiming for, but the debate has to happen.  The EU could lead on this issue in the same away as it led the fight for equality for women.  In the 1970s, for example, it was quite normal to see women in bikinis advertising cars, but as efforts to implement gender equality were advanced, people began to question how women were being portrayed in the media.  There should be a similar effort to prevent the media from always depicting older people as being on zimmer frames.  That is ageism and the EU could take a massive lead on addressing it.<\/p> <p>  On the question of measures for workers, members will recall some of the great initiatives that were run under F&Aacute;S whereby young workers were able to go abroad to do work experience and bring that back into the workplace.  Consideration should be given to developing trans-Europe programmes under which people could work abroad in a company abroad, for example, and gain skills and experience.  The possibilities are endless because we are all one.  We need to break down borders not just across tourism and active citizenship but across all areas.

For CSPE, most schools have a class once a week and, even at that, teachers sometimes do not know they will be teaching it until the students come in and sit down with their books.  How can we expect young people to learn about issues like Europe and the EU when teachers are given no notice they will be giving the lessons?  CSPE needs to be reformed.  At the very least, we must ensure teachers are trained to teach it in a more consistent way.  Not every school will bring somebody in to discuss a topic; sometimes a project will consist of the class going on a mountain hike, for instance.

There is a model for what might be done at second level based on the success of this programme at primary level.  I would be interested to speak about that with the delegates from Youth Work Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kyne asked about Ireland's relationship with the EU and our view on the decline in trust and a positive image.<\/p><p>That is a really valid point.  Our relationship with the EU, as both a country and a people, has certainly matured and it is now less viewed through rose-tinted glasses or from the lofty heights as was the case previously.  It is more realistic and grounded.  For policy wonks such as myself, Eurobarometer reports are really interesting.  When one examines the various charts, it is interesting to note that the increase in distrust corresponds directly to the challenges surrounding the financial crisis.  However, the position is stabilising and there is more of an element of realism abroad.<\/p><p> Another matter on which the other speakers touched relates to the role of the media.  We are keeping a watching brief with regard to, for example, the way in which the general election campaign in the UK is being reported at present.  I think a further session with the committee would be required in order to deal with that matter in detail.<\/p><p> Deputy Keating and others referred to youth projects, language, perception and communication.  For decades our organisation has been trying to communicate and distil information on all things relating to the EU in as jargon-free a manner as possible.  It is a challenge and it is not easy because one is dealing with the alphabet soup of acronyms.  However, we do our best.  This matter reflects both the multifaceted and complex nature of the EU and Ireland's relationship with it, but just because that is the case does not mean we should not try.  Programmes such as ERASMUS and Youth in Action are very important and beneficial in terms of the positive experiences to which the previous speakers referred.  The Chairman inquired about this matter from the perspective of workers and I can inform him that there is the ERASMUS for entrepreneurs programme.  In a previous life I worked on the INTERREG programme, which was very successful in promoting SME business links between the south east of Ireland and south-west Wales.  That was a really practical and solid way of facilitating that level of cross-border business engagement.

The child care sector faces a number of challenges including significant costs faced by families for child care, conditions and accreditation for training for child care workers and increased regulation and funding issues for the sector.  The committee appointed Deputy Sandra McLellan as rapporteur to work with her colleagues in preparing a report on this issue.  I would also like to acknowledge Deputy Robert Troy and Senator Jillian van Turnhout's contribution to our discussion of this issue.<\/p><p>I welcome our witnesses to the meeting: Ms Teresa Heeney, chief executive officer of Early Childhood Ireland; Ms Orla O'Connor, director of the National Women's Council of Ireland; Ms Maria Corbett, deputy chief executive of the Children's Rights Alliance; and Ms Ciair&iacute;n de Buis, director of Start Strong.  The committee has asked each witness to focus on a different aspect of the child care debate.  Ms Heeney is going to open with a short overview of the national situation to set the scene and identify the current state of play with regard to child care and early education in Ireland.  Ms O'Connor will address the costs of child care and the impact on female participation in the workforce.  Ms Corbett will mainly focus on the issue of child care and disability, looking at how we need to cater for child care for those with special needs and Ms de Buis will close the session by considering the future of child care in Ireland, what we mean by quality and affordable child care and what measures need to be considered to achieve this.<\/p><p>Before we commence, I wish to remind witnesses of the position on privilege.  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>I call on Ms Teresa Heeney to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#H00100","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430987400,"counter":1741,"content":"<p>Early Childhood Ireland welcomes the invitation to be here today and congratulates the committee on its decision to prepare a report on child care at this critical time.<\/p><p>It is fitting that it is this committee and not the committee for stabilising the economy, the committee to get women back to the workforce, or the committee to address poverty and deprivation that is considering the issue.  This committee focuses on the needs and rights of our children and the type of childhood we want for them.  That, first and foremost, must be the focus of any plan or vision for early childhood education in Ireland.<\/p><p> The committee's report must be about ensuring quality.  To do that, it must ensure that significant public investment is added into this sector and goes directly into services rather than any form of tax credits.  My colleague Ciair&iacute;n is going to talk about that later and give examples of how tax credits do not work in this context.  A child-focused plan will listen to the incontrovertible evidence that children do better if they spend at least their first year with their parent.  We must invest in the extension of leave arrangements to ensure that children can be with a parent for at least the first year of their lives.<\/p><p> A child-focused plan would ensure that all children attending settings have access to the supports they need to make the most of that time.  That includes children in our most disadvantaged areas who need and deserve more than services which are obliged to hire community employment staff due to the lack of funding.  It includes children with additional needs who have virtually no access to special needs assistants in their preschool and therefore often cannot access their entitlement as the service cannot accommodate them.  It includes children under the age of three whose parents currently receive virtually no support when it comes to paying for the cost of their child care.  It includes children in child minding settings, the vast bulk of which are unregulated and therefore totally uninspected, as well as children in after-school settings which are also unregulated and therefore uninspected.  It also includes the parents of all of these children, who rightfully expect that they should not have to pay the full cost of child care themselves, amounting to an average 34% of their income, double that of their European counterparts.  <\/p><p> The committee's report must also call for a viable system for all operators of early childhood education.  We have an example of the current free preschool year or ECCE contract, which is not fit for purpose for operators in many ways.  The current capitation level does not cover costs and does not allow a sufficient margin for any additional bills or costs.  There is no doubt that many early childhood settings are trading recklessly.  Consider the setting in Waterford required to build a sleep room for compliance.  The operator has been paying the builder &euro;400 every month for the past three years and will be paying this for another five years.  That service made a net loss of &euro;3,000 last year.  The current capitation levels allow for no planning or development of a service due to its unpredictability.  We know owner-managers of most services often take no salary and have no access to income at all over the summer, while staff in many services are required to go on the dole over the summer.<\/p><p> We have advocated for years about commercial rates being charged on early childhood education settings and the cost of that to them.  Just last evening we received a call from a member who owns a small service in Limerick where a revaluation has recently been completed.  Her commercial rates bill will go from &euro;4,200 in 2014 to &euro;9,500 in 2015.  Another woman I spoke with last Friday in Sligo is about to be sued by her council as she has not paid rates in six years.  Her rates bill is &euro;30,000.  The money is not in anybody's account to pay those kinds of bills.  The bottom line is that the free preschool year contract must be renegotiated and made fit for purpose before a second year can be contemplated.  I would welcome more questions on this and would certainly like to see reference to it in the committee's report.<\/p><p> The committee's report must also call for planning to ensure sustainability.  The Department of Education and Skills has a planning document clearly setting out the requirements for schools for the next 15 years, which is available on its website.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs must develop the same document and construct a plan for its achievement with all stakeholders.  Currently, the lack of a clear plan is leading to duplication and poor sustainability.  Settings are expected to take on the risk of developing and building their facilities but the current policy of unplanned expansion is resulting in an oversupply, which Pobal estimates stands at 31,000 available places currently in Ireland.<\/p><p>Expansion must be planned and monitored to ensure existing settings can predict their viability year on year.<\/p><p> The sector is a sizeable employer, employing approximately 25,000 women who, on average, earn approximately  &euro;10 per hour.  Let me give the committee two examples.  Let us consider a young woman who has a level 7 degree and assume that the setting in which she works receives for her the higher capitation rate for the free preschool year.  That is her role for 15 hours a week.  In the afternoon the only other role the setting can offer her is that of cleaner which she has taken on because her morning salary is insufficient.  Let us consider another young woman with whom we spoke two weeks ago who has a level 8 honours degree in early childhood education.  She is working in a setting in the morning and her part-time job is in a chipper which wants her to work more hours on a higher salary than the setting is prepared to offer her.  A wage for a person like her, working 15 hours a week at &euro;10 an hour for 38 weeks of the year, amounts to &euro;5,700 per annum.  These staff are unlikely to be offered a car loan, much less a mortgage.  Therefore, we see the sector being bled dry of their expertise and experience.  We need 52 week contracts with professional salaries that provide for CPD planning and preparation time for all those involved for it to be viable as a quality sector.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for listening and welcome any question that may arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Heeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430987400,"counter":1744,"content":"<p>On behalf of the National Women's Council of Ireland, I thank the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to make this presentation.  I welcome the work being done by the committee and the attention it is giving to this issue.  We look forward to the production of its report.<\/p> <p>  The National Women's Council of Ireland is the leading national women&rsquo;s membership organisation, with over 180 member groups from a diversity of backgrounds, sectors and locations.  For a long time, child care has been a core issue for the council.  It is a gender equality issue.  The cost of child care continues to act as a significant barrier to women&rsquo;s equality in Ireland.  Having a child is both important and rewarding for most parents, but it is also an expensive time, bringing with it many dilemmas, for mothers in particular.  Mothers and our members consistently highlight the crippling cost of child care and the pressure this places on them and their families.  The cost of child care impacts on a wide range of decisions women make such as when to return to work, whether to work part or full-time, the type of job they should take up after unemployment, when and at what age their child will enter school and who will care for their children.  These are critical decisions parents should be enabled to make without the pressure of having to ask, \"What can we afford?\"<\/p> <p>  Public spending on child care and early education as a percentage of GDP is the lowest in the OECD.  The average is approximately 0.7%.  We should be working towards a target of 1% of GDP.  In countries such as Iceland, Denmark and Sweden spending is as high as 1.4% of GDP.  In Ireland we spend between 0.2% and 0.4%, which indicates the huge gap here.  Consequently, child care costs in Ireland are the most expensive in comparison with those elsewhere in the European Union.  Mothers who have contacted the National Women's Council of Ireland report prices of between &euro;800 and &euro;1,100 for a full-time place, depending on where they live.  This means that a person needs to earn a minimum of  &euro;11,000 per annum just to cover child care costs.  The most recent research from the Vincentian Partnership has looked at these costs, particularly for lone parents, and believes a lone parent with two children needs to earn approximately &euro;40,000 a year to cover child care costs.  That is the situation parents, particularly mothers, face.  In comparison, parents in Denmark pay a maximum of approximately &euro;400 per month for a full-time child care place for a child over one year and this amount is then scaled down or reduced depending on the parent's income.<\/p> <p>  It is clear to us and I believe to the committee that the current provision in Ireland is not working to facilitate parents to combine work and family life.  It limits the choices for women.  The statistics are stark in terms of employment rates for women, particularly as they relate to women without children.  Employment rates plummet significantly when there are more than two children in a family.  The same impact is not seen in the employment of men in whose case the number of children makes no difference.  This clearly is a gender equality issue.<\/p><p> The NWCI has been advocating improvements.  We proposed a new child care model in 2004 to an Oireachtas committee but it is disappointing that in the intervening 11 years, there has been little progress on this issue and we are here again today advocating the same model.  Our model proposes a publicly subsidised, high quality and universal model of child care combined with a system of paid leave which supports mothers and fathers to combine work and family life.  Back in 2004 and still today, our proposal was and is about a child centred mode but it is also a model that includes clear gender equality objectives.  This is the type of model we see in Scandinavian and Nordic countries and it has worked in the best interests of children and families. <\/p><p> I now wish to highlight some of the details of what the NCWI calls for.  The introduction of the free preschool year was the first positive step to bringing Ireland on a par with other European countries.  We recommend the introduction of a second preschool year, followed by an incremental implementation of a subsidised model of provision, linked to quality and based on a parent's ability to pay to a maximum capped level.  This should also include out of school hours care.  We have put forward suggestions in terms of how this can be incrementally achieved over a ten-year period.  When we talk about quality child care here, it is important to realise that quality cannot be judged or assessed without taking into account the pay and conditions of child care workers.  These must be central to this model.  Child care is predominantly provided by women workers who are paid just above the minimum wage and yet we rightly require a high level of skills and expertise.  Investment in a Nordic-type model would reap dividends, not just in terms of supporting children&rsquo;s well-being and development, which is critical, but in terms of our long-term economic and social policies.<\/p><p> Another important detail concerns parental leave and the reconciliation of work and family life.  International evidence shows that in the interests of children, the provision of leave for parents, particularly in the first year of a child&rsquo;s life, is critical.   The extension of maternity leave and benefit to 26 weeks was a positive step and was something we campaigned for and welcomed when introduced.  It is important that maternity benefit and leave remain intact for mothers and we do not want to see this element shared.  This is the view expressed to us by women and mothers.  This benefit and leave is important for them and is important also in terms of recommendations from the WHO on breast feeding.  <\/p><p> There is no statutory leave in Ireland for fathers at present and this is an important issue for the NWCI.  We have been advocating leave for fathers for a long time because currently fathers are forced to use annual leave when their child is born.  The absence of paternity leave also sends a strong message as to which parent should be the primary carer, thereby reinforcing gender stereotypes and gender inequality.  There is an opportunity this year, whether through the budget or the forthcoming Family Leave Bill to provide statutory paid parental leave.  We advocate that two weeks paternity leave should be provided as a separate leave entitlement for fathers when their child is born.  We also suggest there should be an additional six months paid parental leave, through a social protection payment.  I stress that this leave should be paid, because the current system of unpaid parental leave is of little use to parents. <\/p><p> Once again, we have a significant opportunity as Ireland moves out of recession to invest in a sustainable child care model that will benefit children, mothers, fathers and families.  It is important that Deputies and Senators show leadership and advocate investment in this sustainable model.  There is a danger that we will move into a short-term solution as we move towards a general election.  While that is understandable, it is critical in terms of the interests of children, mothers and families that we consider a sustainable, long-term solution.  This makes common sense, because we can afford this model.<\/p><p>The countries that invest are the most successful in economic and social terms.  If we want to follow that path of success, we will have to change our model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430987400,"counter":1747,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for inviting me to participate in this discussion.  I concur with the comments made by previous speakers.  The Children's Rights Alliance unites more than 100 member organisations which are working together to make Ireland one of the best places in the world in which to be a child.  We seek to make changes to the lives of children by ensuring their rights are respected and protected in our laws, policies and services.  I will provide the committee with a children's rights lens through which to consider the issues arising.  I will focus my remarks on the issue of children with special needs and the importance of quality and affordability.<\/p> <p>  Every year the Children's Rights Alliance produces a report card to grade the Government's progress on its commitments to children, including the commitments in the programme for Government.  Members will have received copies of an extract from the report card dealing with early childhood care and education.  There has been huge progress in recognising the importance of this area, but the experience of the child and parents cannot be overestimated in terms of the impact on families and children.  This year the Government is examining ways of embedding its national policy on children and young people, Better Outcomes, Brighter Future.  I will relate that policy to the issues we are discussing.<\/p> <p>  A number of articles in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child are relevant to the issues of affordability and quality.  Ireland ratified the convention in 1992, thereby pledging to the international community that we would uphold these rights.  Article 18 of the convention obliges states to give appropriate assistance to parents in the performance of their child rearing responsibilities and ensure the development of institutions, facilities and services for the care of children.  States are also obliged to take appropriate measures to ensure the children of working parents have the right to benefit from child care services and facilities.  The free preschool year, subsidised child care and child benefit are the key mechanisms through which Ireland meets its obligation under the article, but it needs to do much more in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Article 28 provides that all children have the right to an education.  The UN committee has interpreted this right as beginning at birth.  One of the more positive developments in recent years is the recognition that child care is not simply a matter of putting children somewhere while their parents work.  It is important for the educational development of the child.  The right to education is closely linked with the child's right under Article 6 of the convention to development.<\/p> <p>  Article 27 obliges states to recognise the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for his or her physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development.  The issue of child poverty has to be addressed head-on in Ireland.  The statistics indicate that the number of children affected by poverty has climbed throughout the recession, with the figure jumping from 6.3% in 2008 to 11.7% in 2013.  These are damning statistics.  Affordable child care is part of the solution to the problem of child poverty.  The European Commission has stated Ireland needs to do more to reduce the barriers faced by parents in finding employment and avoiding the risk of poverty.<\/p><p>The State&rsquo;s schemes for subsidising child care do not provide parents with an automatic entitlement to subsidies.  Access to the community child care subvention programme, for example, depends on where one is living and the time of year in which one is seeking a place.  Compared to elsewhere in Europe and other developed countries, this is a significant gap in public services.<\/p><p> On the issue of children with special needs, my colleague, Ms Heeney, is representing Early Childhood Ireland which undertook a survey of practitioners that found that 11% of early years services had to refuse a child with additional needs because they were unable to meet his or her needs.  It is disheartening to hear parents tried to include their child in a child care setting but were unable to do so.  Every year approximately 200 children with special needs avail of a mechanism whereby their attendance in a free preschool year is split over two years to allow them to start later.  This is a positive measure, but we need to understand why services are unable to meet the needs of children with disabilities.  I urge the committee to investigate ways of upskilling services in their totality to cater for children with special needs by improving child-staff ratios, training and upskilling.  This is critical for any integrated service catering for a childhood disability, whether social, developmental or educational.<\/p><p> Uptake of the free preschool year is 95%, which is fantastic.  However, we must identify the remaining 5%.  Do they include children with disabilities and special needs?  Are some of them Traveller or Roma children whose parents are hesitant about accessing public services?  We need to focus on those 5% if we are to ensure the service is available to all children.  The key component of any rights based approach is providing access for all children under Article 2 of the convention which deals with non-discrimination.  Decisions should be made in the best interests of the child.<\/p><p> Within the early years settings, whether it be a cr&egrave;che or a childminder, we do not have a national picture of the quality of the services provided.  How can we improve services if we do not understand the problems arising?  We need to continue the work begun as part of the early years quality agenda, but we should also carry out quality audits across the board to understand children's experiences.  Early childhood education and care are only beneficial to children if the quality is high.  Previous speakers have noted that childminders fall outside the national regulations.  We are concerned about that gap from the perspective of quality and child protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Corbett","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430987400,"counter":1749,"content":"<p>On behalf of Start Strong, I thank the joint committee for inviting me to address it and its decision to examine ways of ensuring high quality and affordable early years care for children.  There was an extensive discussion in the media recently about a crisis in child care.<\/p><p>That media commentary has often focused on the crisis of affordability.  We have heard this morning about how Irish parents pay some of the highest costs in the world.  I think it is important to emphasise that it is not that we have the highest costs in the world, it is that parents pay the highest costs in the world.  Overall, we pay more than twice the EU average, and between three and four times the EU average if we happen to be lone parents.  But the cost of child care is not the only child care crisis.  There is also a crisis of quality, and any of us who watched that RTE \"Prime Time\" investigation will remember how important quality is and how very clear it was that there is not high quality, necessarily, across all services.  That programme brought the quality crisis to public attention, but since then that quality crisis has been pushed back from the headlines, yet those issues have not gone away.  We are not suggesting, by any means, that all services are like those that featured in that \"Prime Time\" programme.  Some services are undoubtedly high quality, but, overall, we believe that the quality is variable and parents have no assurance that the service to which they are entrusting their child is one of high quality.   As Ms Corbett mentioned, at a national level, we do not know enough about the quality of our services.  We do not conduct an audit or a survey of quality, and we only require services to meet the most basic of standards and, yet, we have services that are also of high quality.<\/p><p> At the root of both the affordability crisis and the quality crisis is a third child care crisis - low investment and low public investment.  Public spending on Ireland&rsquo;s preschool services, including all spending by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, as well as some additional spending by the Department of Education and Skills, amounts to less than &euro;270 million per year.  That is less than 0.2% of GDP.  Some of the figures range higher than that but they actually include the infant classes in schools.  If one looks at early years services, it is less than 0.2% of GDP, which is a fraction of the OECD average of 0.8% and far below the 1% recommendation of UNICEF.  Many countries already exceed that 1% investment level.  They include, of course, all the Nordic countries, but they also include the likes of New Zealand, France, and the UK.<\/p><p> As I said, some services in Ireland do offer high quality care, but they do so almost in spite of a lack of funding and support.  They do so in a situation where staff usually earn just above the minimum wage and have poor working conditions.  We have already heard this morning about staff being laid off during the summer months and many managers who just do not draw a salary or, for those who do, draw a residual salary.  It is whatever is left over after everything else has been accounted for.<\/p><p> That some children benefit from high-quality early care and education is a reflection on the dedication and the commitment of those services, but for those services to continue to provide high-quality care and education, we need a new model, one that is sustainable and that focuses on children and quality as well as affordability, because we all know that where it is of high quality, early care and education brings benefits all round - to children, to parents, and to our economy.  Where it is of low quality, many of those benefits disappear and children can suffer long-term harm.  This harm that can be suffered through poor quality has been recognised in a growing body of research, most particularly by the OECD.<\/p><p> Coming back to Ireland, the recent report from the European Commission, namely, its 2015 report published just a couple of months ago in February 2015, highlighted concerns about the quality of child care in Ireland and pointed to that lack of an overall monitoring system, of a varying compliance with minimum standards and regulations, and the qualifications levels of staff.  A lot of that comes back to the fact that our model of child care provision or of early years provision within Ireland is very much based on a market model.  We have low public investment and quality and affordability are largely left to the market.  We commissioned research from Professors Penn and Lloyd in 2014 which we published in November 2014.  It showed that variable quality and inequitable access are typical of countries, such as ourselves, where we rely on a market model within our child care system.  We need a new model of early years.  We need a model that builds on our legacy of private, community provision and of childminding, but it significantly enhances public investment and public involvement to ensure quality and affordability.<\/p><p>Child care should be regarded as a public service.  It is not suited to market provision, no more than our school education system is.  When we talk about staff being laid off for the summer months, of managers drawing no salary, of high turnover within services, we would not accept that within our schools education system and, yet, we seem to think that is acceptable within our early years system, and it is our early years system that is the very foundation of our learning and education.  I think we need to recognise and say much more clearly that that is no longer acceptable, because it is children who do not benefit or who, at worse, are harmed by that.<\/p><p> Recent public debate has often focused on the notion of child care tax credits and, as our colleagues here this morning have said, they do not work.  They will not do anything to improve quality.  They cannot incentivise high quality; they cannot be made conditional on quality.  In systems funded through tax credits, the quality of services depends on the impact of an inspection system, but the regulations that our early years inspectorate uses are based on minimum standards and are focused on health and safety, rather than children&rsquo;s learning and development.  Both the \"Prime Time\" investigation and the Irish evidence and research that is available demonstrate that our inspection system is failing to ensure high quality provision.  Tax credits also have limited and sometimes no impact on affordability and can, at times, drive prices upward, so they achieve the opposite of what they set out to achieve.  That is the experience of other countries that have shifted from supply-side funding to tax-based funding.  It happened in both the Netherlands and Australia when they moved to child care tax credits in the early 2000s.  Both subsequently saw the rise in child care costs outstripping inflation and negating the financial benefit of the tax credits to parents.  More details around that are included in our longer submission, which has been circulated to the committee.<\/p><p> Given that I have just said what does not work, I want to turn now to what does work.  The alternative is public investment in services, subsidising the cost of places for parents and linking that public investment to quality - public investment that will allow us to achieve the double dividend of high quality and affordability.  That is the approach that was recommended by the OECD, after they reviewed what happen in 20 different countries within early care and education.<\/p><p> Our current child care funding schemes already take that form of direct investment in services and they subsidise the cost to parents, both through the free preschool year, which is available universally, and then through the more limited schemes, such as the child care subvention scheme.  Those schemes, however, are limited, particularly the subvention scheme.  They are limited in their availability, who they subsidise places for, and the quality conditions attached to them, but they provide a framework that can be built on.  We need to ensure, at the very least, that all children who should be entitled to a place through the subvention scheme can access a place through the subvention scheme.  We need, then, to make sure that it is not based on geography, that it is not down to luck, as to whether one's parents live in an area in which there is a community child care setting.  It also means that it needs to be widened across to all services, so those both privately and community can provide the child care subvention schemes.  It also needs to be widened to regulated childminders who meet quality standards, but that, of course, means we need to regulate childminders.  Start Strong, along with others, has long campaigned for childminders to be brought within the regulatory framework, for the benefit of children, and also for childminders.  Incidentally, Childminding Ireland, which represents childminders, is very much in favour of regulation of childminders.  <\/p><p> We also need to move towards a second free preschool year.  We need to address the funding model but we also need a very clear commitment that we will introduce a second free preschool year, and within a relatively short time framework.  We need to then link any public money that is invested in early years to the quality of those early years services in the provision and those quality conditions need to increase incrementally over time.  We need to look at capping fees that parents have to pay, to ensure that the costs of improving quality are not just passed on to parents, so that children can benefit from them as well.<\/p><p> I touched briefly on the issue of childminders.  We commissioned Goodbody to research this and it estimates there are approximately 50,000 young children being cared for by professional childminders.  Those children do not benefit from a regulatory framework.  We need to ensure they do.  We need something as basic as ensuring Garda vetting is in place for those childminders, and to examine the risks for children, anxiety for many parents, and the lack of recognition and support for the childminders.<\/p><p> We have set out proposals for how that can be achieved that cover the regulation and developing supports to help childminders achieve quality standards and to open up public funding schemes to those childminders, provided quality standards are met.  Children and parents should be assured that services they access, whether centre-based or childminders, are of high quality.<\/p><p> Child care is only part of the answer.  We also need to consider paid parental leave for the first year because that is in children's interests.  We need to ensure there is paid parental leave in addition to the existing maternity leave provision in order that both parents can share those early months of a child's life.  We also need to ensure both parents can be at home at the very least for the first two weeks of a child's life and that either parent can be at home over the next year.<\/p><p> The interdepartmental group will shortly report to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on options for future investment in child care.  We have made a submission with several detailed recommendations.  I will not go through their detail but our proposals boil down to this: children&rsquo;s interests must come first in designing child care policy.  Child care has several effects.  There are issues such as labour market support and ensuring our recovering economy continues to recover, but children need to be at the centre of that, and in designing any policy, we need to ensure it focuses on children.  The quality of child care is critical, therefore, as is ensuring affordable services.  We need to increase our public investment significantly in early years' services, linking that public investment to higher quality.  Children would benefit from higher-quality services and their parents from more affordable child care.  It is possible to improve the quality and affordability of child care at the same time.  It is important to do both at the same time.  If we focus exclusively on one, the other will miss out.  We need to make those subsidies conditional on raising quality standards.  We need to remember that child care is part of the larger early care and education system and ensure paid parental leave is part of that jigsaw, as well as flexible working conditions in order that children can thrive in those early years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ciair&iacute;n de Buis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1753,"content":"<p>I thank all the speakers for their very interesting presentations on a topic that is close to my heart.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#Q00200","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1754,"content":"<p>I thank the four ladies who have made presentations today.  We have to remember that the most important stakeholder in this sector is the child.  No one disputes that high value, quality preschool education is of great importance.<\/p> <p>  I thank the various organisations that fed into our party&rsquo;s proposal to bring forward a fully costed strategy and a timeline for its implementation.  When we considered increased maternity leave, we considered increased capitation based on qualification and even restoring the capitation cut in the past couple of years; expanding the community child care scheme in order that children from less well-off families would not be negatively affected by where they live; and introducing a special educational needs fund, about which one of the speakers spoke.  If only 200 applied for the free preschool year split over two years, how many children with special educational needs are not availing of it at all?<\/p><p>There are thousands of children with special educational needs, not just 200.  Access to the preschool year is based on the location of the service provider, depending on the goodwill of the HSE.  That is why we want a national fund.  When all the outstanding quality issues are dealt with, we should work towards introducing a second preschool year.<br\/><br\/>A recent study on a child&rsquo;s outcome in preschool, commissioned as part of the national early years access initiative, found that socially generated disparities between children observed at the beginning of the free preschool year tend to remain unchanged or even to widen after the free preschool year.  Why is that?  Only 3% of a child&rsquo;s life, up to the end of the free preschool year, is spent in that year.  Our party proposed a multi-dimensional policy that supports not only children but also families because a child&rsquo;s learning and development unfolds and responds to the environment in which he or she lives.  That environment offers great opportunities but also poses huge risks.  We all know that intervention at the earliest possible time in a child&rsquo;s life is critical.  That is why we talk about improving families&rsquo; economic security.<br\/><br\/>Last night I spoke to a lady who used to work in family mediation in the Department of Social Protection.  Her work led her to study psychology and now she works in child and adolescent mental health.  We were talking in the context of the upcoming referendum about the most disadvantaged children.  They are not the children with only one parent.  Lone parents have financial security.  Children in low-income families are most disadvantaged.  Involuntary unemployment leads to the greatest social problems, to depression and poverty.  That is not the best place to leave children.  One of the most damning figures is that in recent years our childhood poverty figures have doubled.  That is an awful indictment of our society.  That is why we need to support children in the family unit, rather than exclusively investing all supports in one component of our child care setting, service providers.  According to a recent Ipsos-MRBI poll published in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, 42% of children are cared for by their grandparents, 20% by childminders and only 20% by service providers.  I do not think all additional funding that becomes available over the next few years should be invested in one particular sector.  We should not be directing, controlling or forcing parents to go to a service provider to avail of affordable child care.  We should not tell parents who choose to go to a childminder or to leave their child with a grandparent that unless they go to a service provider, we will not give them any support, regardless of their means, rather than help them back to employment, which would put them in a position to provide economic security for their family.<br\/><br\/>People who opt to use childminders should be supported.  Childminders should be regulated and vetted.  That is why we as a party, when the vetting legislation was going through the D&aacute;il, put forward proposals which, unfortunately, were not adopted.  People say tax credits will do nothing for quality but the biggest problem with quality is the new registration process.<\/p><p>However, the legislation that passed through the Houses 15 months ago is yet to be implemented.

This is the first of three hearings focusing on child care.  As elected representatives, it is vital that we engage, listen to opinions and consider all of the ideas presented to us.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of this important report is to devise credible suggestions and solutions for an agreed pathway towards tackling the major challenges facing families and the child care sector.  Some positive steps have been taken, for example, the free preschool year, but many elected representatives have highlighted a number of challenges.  We are coming from a good starting point.<\/p> <p>  As part of my work as special rapporteur on child care, I have taken part in a number of consultation meetings and public meetings across the country.  Several of the issues raised by the witnesses are those that have been raised with us.  We want this report to enjoy an all-party consensus and to make strong recommendations.<\/p> <p>  I will highlight a number of matters.  The witnesses should feel free to agree or disagree with my points.  Regarding a vision for early childhood education, child care must be seen as about more than just caring for and minding children.  It is a critical part of a child's development and education.  The use of terminology is important if we are to value and recognise the important and diverse work that child care services provide.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the consolidation of child care services, the importance of having an efficient, affordable, accessible and quality child care sector is dependent on having a co-ordinated and consolidated approach to it.  Underfunding, red tape, bureaucracy and responsibility shared between multiple Departments and agencies are seen as barriers to progress.  A more consolidated sector under the remit of one Department with strong oversight and governance is vital.<\/p> <p>  The child care sector needs to be better valued and recognised by the State if we are to professionalise and improve the quality therein.  There is an overreliance on community employment, CE, schemes.  Funding pressures and a lack of accreditation and proper pay and working conditions for staff are seen as barriers to improving quality in the sector.<\/p> <p>  Regarding targeted funding initiatives, we must increase funding into community and State-led schemes, extend maternity and paternity cover and guarantee the quality of the first free preschool year before extending a second.  Child care tax credits for families are not necessarily the solution, but investment in quality child care is the solution.  The Government needs to conduct an assessment of the cost of running a professional and quality, State-led child care service and then use this as the benchmark for decision making rather than the other way around.<\/p> <p>  Regarding child care, job creation and in-work poverty, the lack of affordable and accessible child care is a barrier to many citizens, mainly women, from entering the labour force.  It is also a key driver of in-work poverty and low pay.  If we are to have decent work and a living wage for all, we must invest in child care.  This is critical in terms of making work pay and reducing unemployment.<\/p> <p>  Social inclusion is vital in developing child care policy.  Members of our new communities, Travellers and the parents of children with physical and-or intellectual disabilities need added supports.  The lack of special needs assistants, SNAs, in early child care services is a form of discrimination against children with complex needs and disabilities.  Equality must underpin child care services.<\/p> <p>  I will ask a few short questions.  What are the witnesses' opinions on the subvention scheme?<\/p><p>Should it be made available to privately run cr&egrave;che services?  Would there be a capacity to supply services for a second free preschool year, given the resources and manpower - womanpower - that are available?  Would it be better to increase the 38 weeks to 52 weeks or 48 weeks for the purposes of job security for those working in the sector and continuity of care for children?  Should children with special needs be guaranteed two free preschool years to ensure that they are given sufficient care?  Where a child is diagnosed during a preschool year and is not ready for a mainstream school, he or she often needs to stay at home if the child's parents cannot afford to send him or her to school during the year when he or she is not ready.  What is the solution?  Who should provide the special medical and physio therapy equipment required by children with special needs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#S00400","speaker":"981","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1761,"content":"<p>I will make a declaration of interest, in that I am chair of Early Childhood Ireland.

The people in question have degrees.  We are encouraging people to become more qualified and we discuss the word \"quality\", yet we do not seem to recognise either.  I do not know whether professionals having to go on the dole in the summer would be accepted in any other professional career.  Why do we tolerate and accept this?<\/p> <p>  The word \"quality\" has been thrown around the room.  Could one of the witnesses paint for me a picture of what quality looks like?  I have in mind ratios and degrees.  From the perspective of children and parents, however, what do we mean by \"quality\"?  I do not know.  We throw the word around.  I just want to be sure.<\/p> <p>  Rates pose an issue, and when the Valuations Act 2015 was before the Seanad, we received a great deal of support from everyone when we tried to address it.  The State is setting all of the parameters for the free preschool year, for example, capitation, space, ratios and the fact that parents cannot be charged.  I am supportive of these, but there can be differences between the rates charged by various towns that are only a few miles apart.  We debate the private, public and community provision of child care and listen to the providers of the free preschool year, but that is the wrong place to make the differentiation.  They are providing a contract and the Government should be seeking value for money.  We should explore the rates issue.<\/p> <p>  Regarding special needs assistants, SNAs, and children with special educational needs, it was stated that 11% had to be turned away.  Those parents are probably already struggling.<\/p><p>It is important, not only for that child but for all children, that he or she is part of that setting.  It is telling - this, again, is something about which we should perhaps be shouting more - that while the Department of Education and Skills provides more than 6,500 special needs assistants in primary schools, it provides none in the early childhood education sector, despite all that we know about the need to interact much earlier with children.  While there are one or two State agencies that make provision in this area, the contribution of the Department of Education and Skills is zero, which says a lot.<\/p><p> On costs, the State has questions to answer about the number of Departments and agencies involved in the provision of child care and interested in the issue.  In this regard I saw a map which had been provided by Mr. Thomas Walsh of NUIM and was confused.  I had thought I understood the sector.  On inspections, a person choosing to operate a child care service needs to know the basis on which the service is to be inspected, how it will be inspected and by whom it will be inspected.  Many Departments are involved in inspections.  Perhaps they might involve themselves more in ensuring quality in the delivery of services.  <\/p><p> My final point is about how we do this and where we invest.  It is very telling that the take-up of the free preschool year is 95%.  This means that parents do value it.  As rightly stated, there is an issue about childminding and I would include au pairs in that mix.  I know that it is a smaller grouping, but the fact is we are allowing this sector to go unregulated.  I have met the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to discuss this issue.  As nobody wants to take responsibility for the issue of au pairs, it falls between two stools.  We have people in Ireland who are minding children, but who are unregulated.  For me, that is wrong.  <\/p><p> On the free preschool year, previously we had the early child care supplement, which was a cash transfer.  In fairness to the Minister for Finance at the time, the late Brian Lenihan, and the then Minister of State, former Deputy Barry Andrews, they withdrew the supplement and introduced the free preschool year because it was determined investment was the answer.  I certainly back the calls for investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#T00800","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1769,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their detailed contributions and the work they are doing.  It is unfortunate that in the period 2000 to 2010, when huge funds were available, there was very little development in this area.  A lot more should have been done during that ten year period.  What was able to be done in the past three to four years was limited because of the lack of funding.  It was stated 0.8% of GDP should be invested in child care, which equates to more than &euro;1 billion.  In the context of the current debate on spending, we need to look at from where this funding will come and how we plan to spend it.  In planning for expenditure on the expansion of services, are the delegates suggesting this be done over a two or five year period?  <\/p> <p>  On the current debate on the need for a second preschool year, do the delegates believe we should focus first on additional investment in the first preschool year, thus ensuring a better quality service and better support for those providing the service?  Also, what is their view on providers being paid for only 30 plus weeks when there are 52 weeks in the year, which means that there is no adequate provision for service providers during a large part of the year?<\/p> <p>  On the self-employed and the 12 months parental leave issue, there are a huge number of people in this country who are self-employed.  In some cases, a husband and a wife are self-employed.  How does one deal with the issue of trying to provide support for them?  There are many people who are working and do not have access to services, particularly people living in the greater Dublin area.  How does one provide assistance for those who want to continue in their business rather than take leave lest their business declines?  How can we support them in sustaining their workforce and business, while at the same time providing them with the support they require in terms of child care should they take leave from work?  These are issues we also need to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#U00200","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430987400,"counter":1770,"content":"<p>On Deputy Robert Troy's question about the reason we are focusing on one element, I do not think anybody here was focusing on any one element.  We all spoke about the need to invest in early years education, which includes centre based provision, childminders, paid parental leave and work flexibility.  It is a range of aspects rather than any one specific element.  Again, the perspective from which Start Strong is coming is what is beneficial to children and what is most in their interests.  Our key focus is on the child's early years, from birth to age 6 years, and what is of most benefit during that time.  All of Start Strong's recommendations are focused on children and range across the settings in which children are to be found and where they benefit from early care and education.<\/p> <p>  The aforementioned links with the point made by Deputy Sandra McLellan in that the terminology is crucially important.  Within Start Strong we tend to use the phrase \"children's early care and education\" because our focus is on the early years and early education.  The term \"child care\" is convenient shorthand.  In terms of the terminology used, it is what people are familiar with, but what we are talking about is children's early care and education, the foundations of their learning which carry through into their adulthood and throughout their lives.<\/p> <p>  There were some specific questions about qualifications, departmental roles and so on.  I agree that one Department needs to have responsibility in this area.  Currently, responsibility is fractured, which leads to a fragmented approach in policy and solutions and a lack of clarity as to who is responsible for which area and so on.  It is important that the next Government, regardless of make-up, assign responsibility for early years education to one Department.  I also suggest, at the very least, that there is a need to have a Minister of State with responsibility for early years education. <\/p> <p>  On the specifics of inspections, the Department of Education and Skills recently announced that there would be education focused inspections.  While it is welcome that there is finally to be an education focus in inspections, it is, to say the least, unfortunate that it is another layer of inspections.  We need to reform and merge the current inspection system to ensure it is focused on children and their early care and education, including bringing it within one home.  <\/p> <p>  On the issue of qualifications and the reliance on community employment schemes and so on, there will shortly be a requirement for minimum qualifications for all of those working in this area.  However, they are minimal.  We need to look at increasing them and moving towards a graduate-led workforce, which would bring with it many issues in terms of funding, structures and how schemes work.  <\/p> <p>  On children with additional needs, access to services, the low number of children who have the option of splitting across two years, SNAs and so on, as stated, the take-up rate of the preschool year is 95%.  Ms Corbett referred to the missing 5% of children.  I suspect a significant proportion of them are children with additional needs whose needs are not being met.  There is a tendency to look towards the SNA model, but I am not sure that that is what would work for children.  There is a greater issue around ensuring those working in the sector can provide the supports needed and that there are additional resources in place across services, whether they are centre based or provided by childminders, in order that they can provide the services needed.<\/p><p>For some children, that may mean the splitting of the free preschool year, while for others it would not.  We also must remember that the free preschool year covers a short time and there are additional needs outside that as well.  We need to ensure that those resources are put in place and can be accessed.  Much of this relates to training and ensuring that services can access the additional supports if and when they are required.<\/p><p> There is the question of what a high-quality service looks like.  The greatest proxy in looking at a high-quality service is the qualification of those working with children.  That really does not answer the question of what such a service looks like.  From a child's perspective, he or she should know the adult with whom he or she is working.  The adult would have been there last week, is there this week and will be there next week.  These children should not have to build a new relationship with somebody new because of the churn of staff.  That is no reflection on staff.  If I was paid the minimum wage or just above it and knew I would be laid off in the summer months, I would be looking for something more.  We have heard about the women who would be paid more in chippers and other areas.  I am aware of one woman who was qualified and left an early years centre to work in a bookmaker's office.  What does it say about us as a society that we would pay such a woman more to work in a bookmaker's office than to work with our youngest children?  There are issues in this respect.  In a quality service, the learning is child-led and play-based.  We are not talking about having school a little earlier and this is very much about young children and how they learn.  Play is the work of young children.<\/p><p> Senator Colm Burke raised the family leave issue.  We look at this from a child's perspective and what is good for children.  We have all argued that it is good for children to be at home for the first year.  There is a need to examine how we structure that family leave to ensure that all parents, and not just those in employment, can avail of a paid parental leave period.  There must be some portion allocated on a \"use it or lose it\" basis so that both parents will spend time with the child in the first year at home.  Fathers, in particular, would be enticed to spend some of that time at home.  As my colleague, Ms O'Connor, mentioned, it is also crucial that the existing maternity leave provision stays as it is.  There are World Health Organization recommendations in this regard to ensure that a mother can breast-feed for the first six months if they choose to do so.  In the early months, mothers are under enough pressure without having to see if they need to split leave with another parent.  It is important that all parents, regardless of being employed or self-employed, can have the first year.  The process should not just stop with the first year, with parents getting back to the treadmill, and there should be flexible work leave policies in place so that parents are not faced with deciding what they can afford but rather what is good for them and their children.  Cost should not be a primary consideration, although it must be a factor.  It is a hard enough role to be parents to young children without having the additional stress of deciding what is affordable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#V00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Ciair&iacute;n de Buis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1772,"content":"<p>We have one of the lowest rates of breast feeding in Europe and it is very poorly funded.

I do not want to repeat her comments but I am afraid I may well do so.  In describing what a quality service looks like, I refer the committee to the Competence Requirements in Early Childhood Education and Care, or CoRe, report, which was a major European report that examined what a quality service might be and its characteristics.<\/p><p>It refers to a competent system of early childhood education.  One characteristic is having qualified staff, with such personnel having time for planning and discussion with parents.  The service would be characterised by low ratios and would begin after the child turns one.  All the characteristics described by Ms de Buis - having a curriculum that is child-led, play-based and not \"schoolified\" - are very important.  We did not speak in any depth earlier about the issue of competent inspection, monitoring and planning.<\/p><p> Ms de Buis mentioned the number of agencies that inspect early childhood settings now, and the level of bureaucracy that operators and staff in early childhood settings must undertake is phenomenal.  There are at least five Government agencies going in and out the door of early childhood settings at any given time.  Those agencies have not been tasked to find and create an aligned set of documentation that meets all the requirements.  That is unacceptable.  I am aware that the committee will welcome Mr. Gordon Jeyes later this morning, and Tusla is in charge of the preschool inspection regime.  It is an issue on which we would love to hear his thoughts.  We want to know what efforts are being made to align the current inspection system.<\/p><p> With respect to additional needs, we mentioned how an agency is not prepared to take responsibility and never is that more true than with children who have additional needs in early childhood settings.  It does not seem to be the responsibility of the HSE, Tusla, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs or the Department of Education and Skills.  As yet, nobody has been prepared to stand up, say it is their responsibility and do something about the issue.  I tend to agree with Ms de Buis that there is significant evidence that special needs assistants may not be the answer.  We refer the committee to the National Council for Special Education, which has developed a new framework that would essentially make available a fund, within a framework, that would be available to a school based on a number of general demographic trends.  An amount of money could be allocated to a setting and it would be possible to use that fund to allocate additional staff time if required or equipment.  It is certainly worth looking at that.<\/p><p> We recognise there is a big jump in going from &euro;270 million now to the &euro;1 billion that it will cost.  Last year, when we spoke to the media about the need to invest &euro;1 billion in early childhood education, one journalist told me I was in cloud cuckoo-land.  If that is true, all the Government policies are equally in cloud cuckoo-land, as one may talk the talk but walking the walk will mean that approximately &euro;1 billion will have to be spent if we want to achieve a high-quality system and one which can predict quality at any given time.  That is what parents looking for peace of mind want, no matter where a child is being looked after.<\/p><p> Deputy McLellan asked about planning and extension of the existing preschool year.  The existing contract for the first free preschool year is not fit for purpose.  It does not provide sufficient capitation to be able to afford decent salaries for staff, so we must address the problems with the current year before we begin looking at expansion to a second year.  It is a critical point to be emphasised today.  Early Childhood Ireland represents 3,500 operators of settings around the country and we recommend to our members that they do not sign any new contract for an extension until they are satisfied they can operate their setting - whether it is private or not for profit - in a way that can maintain high-quality professional staff in the setting.<\/p><p>That is really important.  There is a lot of talk about a second year, but nobody knows what will be required to deliver on it.  While there are vacancies in many services, in many areas of the country there are no vacancies.  Therefore, to say that we are now going to provide a universal free preschool year in every setting for every child makes no sense, because the places are not there.  A concerted plan needs to be developed to say how many places will be needed in every county and town in the country for the next ten years and how they will be provided.  They have to be built with public investment and delivered by private and not-for-profit organisations.  That is the existing mixed model and we have to build on that.  Ireland is not unusual but, as each of my colleagues said, we need a system of public investment under which the Government's and the public's money is monitored and inspected and we assure ourselves that there is a good return on investment because we monitor and ensure the quality of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Heeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430987400,"counter":1776,"content":"<p>I will answer some of the questions.  My first point links to Deputy Troy's and Senator van Turnhout's remarks.  When developing our policy and infrastructure we need to look at where we want to go rather than looking at the current situation in which parents are being forced to make decisions in the context of really poor leave, extremely expensive child care and a lack of flexibility and consistency in the existing services.  This is part of the reason we say there needs to be a type of Nordic model.  What many mothers are saying to us is that they often end up in occasional child care situations - that they can only afford so many days a week in a creche and then they have to depend on family members and on using some of their annual leave.  It is important that we do not try to put in place measures that maintain that system.  We need to look at what we want to achieve.<\/p> <p>  When the free preschool year was introduced, there was no promotion of it, yet there was a take up of over 95%.  I recognise the issues that have been raised with regard to quality, but parents saw that the preschool year was universal, free and accessible and they regarded it as offering good quality for their children.  That is the important point and it links back to some of the issues raised by Deputy Troy on how other options can be supported.  It is important that when we hopefully move to a more progressive model, our other policies link up.  I am not saying that our investment in child care needs will address all of the issues the Deputy raised, which are really important issues for economic security and low-income families.  However, those are issues for our social protection system.  It is about precarious work and low pay.  I do not think the child care infrastructure can address all of those issues, nor do I think we should be trying to devise features within child care in an effort to compensate for some of the issues regarding low pay and precarious work in the economy.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the important issue of maternity leave, as raised by Senator van Turnhout, and the comparisons with the Nordic model, under which there is shorter maternity leave.  Research and evidence on this model in Ireland is not widespread, but I refer to one substantial piece of work carried out by the Equality Authority and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency which showed for the first time the pressure that is often put on women to return to work early.  The study was carried out in recession times.  It is an issue of concern to the National Women's Council of Ireland that if maternity leave is shortened that this tends to happen.  In the Nordic countries leave is much more ingrained and the sharing of care between men and women is more ingrained.  We need to consider those issues.<\/p><p>Certainly, women are saying to us that they want those six months.<\/p><p> Another important issue that Senator Burke raised was the question of where the funding comes from.  This needs substantial investment.  We believe it is about making those choices, but we need to remember that these are really serious choices.  Let us consider some of the things discussed in the spring statement and that are under discussion now that we are coming into an election period.  If we erode our tax base then we cannot afford this type of child care model.  We need a progressive model of taxation that prioritises public services and public investment.  We cannot erode it.  This is clearly one of the lessons coming out of the recession and austerity.  There needs to be a progressive model of taxation to allow this to happen.  Otherwise, it cannot happen.  We cannot have it both ways.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430987400,"counter":1778,"content":"<p>I echo the request to ensure that there is a package of family leave to enable a child to remain at home for the first year.  I echo what Ms O'Connor has said about how the recent budget has weakened the rate of maternity benefit and brought it into the tax net.  We are before the committee today making the case that we need to protect the payments, extend them and bring in paid paternity leave to create a family leave package that will cover the first year.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the question about a second free preschool year.  We are supportive of its introduction.  We are cognisant, however, that we need to get the quality right before we roll it out.  I am a little concerned now that it has dropped off the political agenda and the timeline has been pushed out.  Although we are saying we want it but only when the quality is right, that should not mean we do nothing for the next couple of years.  It means we should start planning now to get the quality right and secure some timelines to make a plan for how we bring in the second year.  Otherwise, I fear it will simply drop away.  I am concerned that the commitment is being pushed further out.<\/p> <p>  This ties in with the fact that we still have no national early years strategy.  It has been promised, but it is late.  Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the national framework that the early years strategy was meant to come under, has been published.  The problem is that when we are discussing the budget, funding and the choices we need to make, we do not have a national coherent strategy guiding us.  As we can see from all the inputs, it is very much an interdepartmental issue and it crosses into many areas.  I am concerned that without a national strategy, a clear budget or a clear vision, this issue may progress but only in a piecemeal fashion and in a manner in which we are simply responding to crises.  The \"Prime Time\" programme made for disturbing watching.  It led to a response, but we need to maintain the momentum to ensure that the elements promised as a result actually come to fruition.  It goes back to the point I started with.  We have done a great deal of talking on this issue, but the question is whether things have changed for the child and parents.  We need to question that.<\/p> <p>  I have looked at the report card we use to track this area year-on-year.  This year I really struggled with it.  Reference was made to how we have a new inspectorate and a focus on education.  I thought this was a mistake, and I had to go back to try to understand how we had added a new layer in without bringing it into the existing inspectorate.  Furthermore, while I welcome the focus on education, it is a difficult area to navigate.  I say that as an outsider looking in, but it must be even more difficult for providers who have to work with it and meet those regulations.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to children with special needs and disabilities.  This area really needs a joined-up approach. The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act remains largely un-commenced.  We need to recognise the importance of early intervention, prevention, social integration and supporting parents in the early years in cases in which a child has been born with, has developed or is developing a special need or disability.  That is the fundamental time to intervene and support the children and families in question.<\/p> <p>  All children in Ireland have a right to access the free preschool year.  It is unacceptable that children with special needs are being denied access to the scheme or denied the right on the basis that the providers maintain they would like to include the children but are simply insufficiently supported.  We have to address that.  It is a serious position that our publicly supported services are unable to meet the needs of those children.<\/p> <p>  I echo the point about special educational needs assistants.  While they do fantastic work and I have great respect for the work they do, I do not believe that term should be the answer to this issue.  There is no clarity as to the qualifications a person needs to be an SNA.  Obviously the National Council for Special Education has progressed recently in respect of clarifying its role in schools.  Anyway, we need not necessarily go down that route.  We can look at what is needed in the early years settings.  Earlier, we discussed a fund to ensure that a service could provide the extra supports, as opposed to adding one extra assistant for each child.  I believe we could move away from that model and try to think about it in a more integrated way.<\/p> <p>  Finally, let us consider the question of quality.  The inputs made already have been very helpful.  In the discussion about the day-to-day experience for a child in the early years settings, one factor we have not mentioned is the length of time they are in the centre.  If a child is in a centre for too long, the benefits start to drop away, if that makes sense.  We need to support families to enable them to engage in education and work but they need to be able to do so within a reasonable timeframe and such that they can get their children from the child care centres in good time, because if the day is too long for the child, the benefits start to roll back somewhat.<\/p> <p>  My last point relates to quality.  We have talked about inspectorates, health and safety and the role of education.  I am keen for a focus on food within the services, especially in areas of high deprivation in Ireland where food poverty is a real issue.  We have heard from one of the early years centres.  The relevant people took the view that food was a major issue in those families.  We need to look at how we can extend the school meals programme and consider how we can bring that in to early years settings in communities where people are struggling with food poverty.<\/p> <p>  If we want to improve quality in early years settings we need to focus on the staff.  We need increased qualifications and professionalisation but we also need to consider it in terms of what is happening from day to day.  What about the curriculum?  Aistear and S&iacute;olta are the national quality frameworks around the curriculum for early years.  We need to ensure they are fully rolled out and supported.  As I understand it, they are considered to be patchy within the sector as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Corbett"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1779,"content":"<p>We have three final contributors, but they can only have one minute each because we are under time pressure and we have to start another meeting directly after this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#Z00300","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1780,"content":"<p>I am sorry I was not here for all the earlier presentations.

If I heard her right she said there was a sea-change in recent years.  In the Children's Rights Alliance report, this Government inherited a B on this specific area of child care and it has gone down to a D plus in the last survey, which is a damning indictment on what has happened under it.  The witness is critical of certain aspects of what we did also and we had a lower rating.  All Governments will get praise and criticisms from the Children's Rights Alliance and that is accepted, but I think there has been a massive change for the negative in this area and it has shown up in all the surveys.<\/p> <p>  I am a father.  Mine and Ann's third child is going through the free year and he is about to finish up.  We have had a very good impression of the year for various reasons.  We have been through two different providers, both very good.  We have had nothing but a positive experience with it.  The children have got a fantastic education out of it.  I speak politically when I say I am very proud it was Brian Lenihan who brought that in.  He was Minister for Finance but he had the background as Minister for Children beforehand.  As mentioned, there are difficulties with it.  We have put the second free year onto the agenda and it is in our policy to suggest it be brought in during year three of the next Government.  That may give time to address some of the issues raised.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise the issue of special education needs.  I live on the Louth-Meath border.  As the crow flies I am only 100 m from the Louth border but the two facilities we have used are both in County Meath.  There is a special needs assistants service in County Meath provided by the HSE, and I could not tell you what is available down the road in County Louth.  We have had the Department of Health and Children, we have the Department of Education in this area and we have Pobal, but it came as complete shock to me that the HSE was providing these special needs assistants.  Our child was in a class with a Down syndrome child and as a parent - while I cannot comment on the child himself, he is not my child - it was a hugely positive experience for the whole class to be in that setting and for integrated education to take place at that level.  It seemed to work well from the staff point of view apart from all the ordinary pressures of being involved in such a service.  This model has been criticised by our expert colleagues here, but it is certainly something that the parents in Meath value enormously, and they would like to have more of it.  The problem is that the funding in County Meath - I do not know about other counties - is provided on a year-to-year basis.  This year they were told that the funding was being completely eliminated.  We had to put up a massive fight to get the money back.  The HSE told parents that it would give the money but that it would now have to take away a home-care package for a dying child.  That is what the parents were told, so imagine the stress; it is outrageous.  That is now par for the course with the HSE in recent months because Mr. John Duggan and the Soliris------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#AA00600","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1787,"content":"<p>Senator, we are under time pressure------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#AA00700","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1788,"content":"<p>I am not taking up any more time than Senator Henry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#AA00800","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1789,"content":"<p>I appreciate that but I am the Chair, Senator, and everybody has been allotted fair time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#AA00900","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1790,"content":"<p>I have not, as a member of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#AA01000","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1791,"content":"<p>You are not a member of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#AA01100","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1792,"content":"<p>I am a member of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#AA01200","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1793,"content":"<p>I apologise, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#AA01300","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1794,"content":"<p>If you are chairing the meeting you should know who the members are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#AA01400","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1795,"content":"<p>Could you ask a question, thank you, Senator?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#AA01500","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1796,"content":"<p>I am adhering to what you said about equality of time.  HSE has made that point to parents: that someone else is going to suffer because their children are gaining, and not even gaining what other children have had before there has been a huge cut.  I want more recognition of the fact that grandparents are currently providing a massive amount of care.  It seems that this is nearly always due to affordability, especially if young and preschool children are involved sometimes with the involvement of very elderly grandparents.  If one knocks at doors in any housing estate, particularly in south County Meath during the day, one will meet many grandparents who do a huge amount of work, mainly for cost reasons.  I pay tribute to them.  Some are very elderly and have said to me that they are finding it very difficult physically.  Some do not find it difficult and love doing it.  In my own case, with my wife working different days each week, it is a much more flexible arrangement and my mother seems to love it, or at least that is what she tells us.  We need grandparents because of the flexibility to provide care at night time as well as during the day.  This committee needs to recognise the contribution they make.  Many are not paid and while the tax structure is there to help, it can actually catch them out if they do not completely comply with the strict rules when doing the child-minding in their own home.

All the research shows that after two years it is too late.  The children blossom early in the first two years and everything needs to focus on that.  It needs to be totally under the State system, like the national and second level school system where there are teacher qualification standards.  Our national aspiration should be to integrate these early child care standards into the State-run education system with highly educated teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#AA02700","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1808,"content":"<p>I apologise Senator but somebody's phone is interfering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#AA02800","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1809,"content":"<p>It was not my phone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#BB00200","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1810,"content":"<p>I just wanted to make sure the Senator is heard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#BB00300","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1811,"content":"<p>The current lack of vetting will be a scandal in the future.

They have thriving SME sectors and a high proportion of female entrepreneurs.  We can manage this.  It is possible and these countries do much better than we are doing in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I also want to return to Senator Byrne's comments on grandparents.  This is a very important issue because grandparents are so involved in child care in Ireland.  Is putting in place policies that enhance the best approach to this issue?  A recent study, which I think was carried out by TILDA, around the involvement of grandparents discusses the mental health of grandparents and depression among grandparents in terms of providing child care.  The issue emerging in this study, with which we are familiar, because we often talk about grandmothers in this context and there is a gender issue, is choice.  Of course, grandparents want to spend time with their grandchildren, but it is about choice and not necessarily being factored into the provision of child care.

That is wonderful if it is what those grandparents want to do, but I suspect many of them are providing that service to their children and grandchildren because of affordability issues.  Grandparents should not be seen as part of a service.  They are the grandparents of the child and that should be their relationship with their grandchild.  A great deal of stress and mental health issues would be greatly alleviated for those grandparents if this were acknowledged.<\/p> <p>  On maternity leave and Senator White's reference to her own Bill, our recommendation, along with the National Women's Council of Ireland and others, is to ensure that the existing maternity provision remains for all women because it improves outcomes for children.  It really does not matter whether a child's mother is self-employed, employed in a small or large multinational business or in the public service.  What matters is the development of that relationship with their parents and particularly their mother in those early days.<\/p> <p>  We need to start taking seriously the issues raised regarding spending priorities, the second pre-school year and so on.  Much of this comes back to the lack of vision at a national policy level.  I do not want to get into the party politics argy-bargy, but in general, over many years, there has been a lack of vision and of priority in expenditure and we need to address that.  We should have a national early years strategy that sets out the timeframe and the increase in expenditure.  We are not eejits here.  We know this cannot happen overnight, but it must be done incrementally over time.  Part of that is a commitment to moving towards the second free pre-school year.  That second free pre-school year can itself be an incentive to improve quality if we focus that public expenditure, link it and make it conditional on quality.  That is what we need to move towards.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding the issues raised about SNAs, of course there are excellent SNAs in place and at time they can be the right answer.  At other times, it is not the right answer and can lead to a situation where a child cannot fully participate in a mainstream service if the only additional support there is a special needs assistant because it needs to be much broader than that to ensure a child can fully participate in early education.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Garda vetting, Senator White was right.  This is a scandal in the making.  We have 50,000 young children in the care of childminders who are not obliged to have the most basic of Garda vetting.  There have been numerous opportunities to change this in recent legislation and across parties amendments have been put forward to address that and none of them have been taken on board.  That needs to be addressed immediately.  There is, again, an opportunity to do that with the Children First legislation that is currently on Committee Stage.

In preparing its report, the committee needs in the first instance to set out what we believe early childhood education is for and whom it is for.  If we decide it is about providing excellent opportunities to children to have excellent experiences in the first six years of their lives, that tells us about the fact that children do better when at home for their first year, for example.  I would like the members to imagine whether it is acceptable for children to arrive in early childhood settings at 6.45 a.m. in their pyjamas.  This happened this morning in many settings.  Six-month-old children arrived this morning to the care setting in their pyjamas and will be there all day before they are picked up at 6 p.m.  If that is not what we want for children - I do not believe anybody believes it is what we want for our youngest children - it tells us we need to invest in one year, at least, of parental leave.  What is the system for and whom is it for?<\/p> <p>  If we think the system needs to be predictable and provide, on a blanket basis, high-quality experiences for all the children, it means we must listen to what the evidence tells us about having highly qualified staff who are remunerated well and motivated to stay in the sector.  These factors all add up when one thinks about whom the system is for and if one places children at the centre.<\/p> <p>  If we want to ensure experiences are predictable and always of high quality, it means we need to monitor the services properly, inspect them regularly and ensure training and professional development are available at all times for the staff.<\/p> <p>  I would like to finish by reverting to Senator Byrne.

All we are saying is that one solution may not always be the right one.  SNAs may not always comprise the right solution.  We may need to think about a more complex way of viewing that.<\/p> <p>  The other element of predictability is that it cannot be acceptable to have a geographical lottery that defines the quality of the experiences of our children.  If families happen to live in an area where there is a community service with a subvention scheme, they have access to a more affordable, but still not cheap, child care service.

I noted that there has been a big shift in early childhood care and education.  I was thinking according to a long timeline.  I was thinking about the fact that when Ireland started to get involved, public support associated with child care was seen through the lens of getting women into the labour force.  That lens has shifted and I hope it is now more child-centred in its focus.  That was part of my thinking.  I acknowledge there have been some very positive initiatives, such as the free preschool year.  The report card since the issuing of the programme for Government shows that initiatives start off well because they are exciting and there is a new commitment, and positive statements are made.  However, our experience, reflected across the report card, is that when it comes to implementation, it becomes hard for us to see the progress year on year.  The commitment when structures and programmes are set up initially is greater than that associated with the actual delivery.   This is the nub of the problem in many other sectors also.  I echo the comment that we need a clear national strategy, a vision, a budget and the political will to stay focused on this issue.  The challenges are very significant if we are to get it right.  This is an area in which we really need a seismic shift if we are to get things right for children.<\/p> <p>  The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 has yet to be commenced.

If those who are making policy do not have the luxury of benefitting from that policy, it speaks volumes.

I will make a couple of points by way of general background before turning specifically to Laois-Offaly.<\/p> <p>  Since its inception, Tusla has been engaged in a process of consolidation of best Irish practice and reform and this has not been without its challenges.  I would be doing all of my colleagues a disservice if I did not record at this committee the extremely challenging context in which they work with limited resources.  I refer to front-line services, support for front-line service delivery and establishing a new agency.  This is a new legal entity established from scratch. <\/p> <p> Since it was established in January 2014, the key priorities for Tusla service delivery has been the implementation of the service delivery model and the implementation of the reform programme.  These initiatives were designed to deliver greater consistency across Ireland and better quality service.  As the process has been taken forward, the evidence shows that where the reform has been followed, the service has improved, confidence is up and the regulators note that.  In the first instance, a single line of management has been developed for all services in order to ensure an integrated approach to child welfare and child protection.  In tandem with this development, there has been the introduction of a system for the measurement of service activity in order to ensure a consistent national approach to services.<\/p> <p>  When the agency was launched, I said it was time to act.  In respect of accountability, consistency and transparency, we are getting there but there is work to be done on the aspect of consistency.  What I tell my colleagues is that I do not like the use of the term \"waiting list\" because it implies in people's minds that the length of time is all that matters.  What is going on is much more sophisticated than that.<\/p> <p>  I have two other introductory observations.  Following detailed consultation with staff and their trade union representatives, we decided there should be a single area-wide management structure covering the following areas: duty and intake, that is, the front door in terms of the information we receive; child protection and welfare; children in care; support for fostering; and family support.  This model is based on the international best practice and designed to best suit the Irish context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#DD00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1842,"content":"<p>I note for Senators that there is a division in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#DD00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430987400,"counter":1843,"content":"<p>Put simply, this is a model of practice which ensures there is efficient throughput of referrals based on prioritisation from the duty team to a social work team in as responsive and effective a manner as possible in proportion to the needs of children and based on the strength of families.  <\/p> <p>  The second aspect of this is what we term \"measure the pressure\".  Alongside service reform and against a background of restricted resources, it was vital to develop a consistent measurement of service pressure to ensure that every piece of information we receive is prioritised and cases are monitored.  This measurement of intake or front door activity called \"measuring the pressure\" is undergoing review by the director of quality assurance.<\/p><p>He has recently conducted a national review to ascertain if thresholds were being applied consistently to ensure that intake effectiveness, and pressures because of resource deficits, were being monitored.  This was reported to the board on 24 April and the report found that in 88% of cases thresholds were being applied accurately, good but not good enough.  It recommended there should be a flexible intervention resource to assist where there were backlogs to raise quality and check monitoring of cases not yet allocated from duty.  In responding to events in Laois-Offaly we have taken that approach forward and that is what we are piloting as response.<\/p><p> We still operate in 17 areas.  Laois-Offaly is part of the midlands area, along with Longford-Westmeath.  In the process of restructuring the midlands area, a newly appointed principal social worker reported concerns about the number of files, and a number of figures have been going around but the best phrase to use is, \"the status of which was unclear\".  Not knowing is a failure and I regret that.<\/p><p> I was informed by the director of quality assurance of these particular concerns on Friday, 24 April 2015.  Following discussion with him it was agreed that the Department and HIQA should be informed of the concerns which were being investigated by Tusla staff.  In particular, as a consequence of the April introduction of a central intake team in Laois-Offaly, it was noted that there were at least 1,200 files or referrals or pieces of information, the status of which was unclear.  There were also 822 unacknowledged Garda referrals.  It was unclear whether this represented merely \"a failure to acknowledge\", which unfortunately has historical precedent, or whether these files and information remained unassessed.  That was a matter of concern and is being addressed by staff with the assistance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> The service director responsible for the midlands area, along with the director of quality assurance, met with HIQA on Monday, 27 April.  HIQA was informed in full detail of the nature of the concerns and it was agreed that we would provide by 1 May, that is the end of that week, a copy of our ongoing action plan.  The Department was informed on that Monday evening and requested an initial or draft report.  The position was still becoming clear.  This was provided on the morning of Tuesday, 28 April and a meeting was subsequently held with the Minister and his senior officials to provide an account of matters to date and to report on information being sought by Tusla senior management and the action that was being taken. <\/p><p> I regard these findings as a matter of very serious concern for Tusla and no doubt for this committee.  I have assigned a team of experienced social workers to review the situation, ascertain the extent and nature of the problem, and take immediate action where required.<\/p><p> Screening of the files has been almost completed and the urgent allocated.  Cross-checking is now being undertaken.  This work and the case management to follow are being conducted by staff external to the area.  This will allow local staff, under new leadership, to concentrate on today&rsquo;s pressures and not to allow the backlog to recur.  If the only focus was the backlog, as can happen, then the fundamental issues could remain unresolved.  The detailed action plan to deal with the backlog including the case management of issues that come through to establish a robust duty and intake referral system and for the director of quality assurance external to the area and region to undertake an investigation, existing management and reporting processes and practices, will be closely scrutinised.<\/p><p> Screening of the backlog began with the immediate scrutiny on 29 April of several files.  Additional staff have been brought in and the process of screening all the referrals and information, pulling it into our care and database of files is almost complete.  I express my gratitude to our colleagues in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have assisted Tusla staff in reviewing Garda notifications in order to ensure that none of the unacknowledged Garda notifications related to an urgent case or one not already known to the social work service. <\/p><p> The safety of children is the priority for Tusla.  It is important that Tusla as an organisation has the integrity to stand over its commitment to put children first.  I am determined that Tusla will set standards for being open, accountable and a reforming organisation, with staff who are strong in their commitment to children and courageous in identifying and addressing practices where failures have been identified. <\/p><p> Across the country, management, accountability and service delivery are improving.  I understand the impatience with the progress, which is sometimes slow as a consequence of resource and demand issues.  This work is challenging.  It seems extremely difficult at times but the reform under way needs to continue.  Too many children were failed in the past as a result of institutions which did not acknowledge and address failings.  I wish to assure this committee that a comprehensive review of all factors which led to this situation will be undertaken so that Ireland&rsquo;s children and families can be assured of a good quality service.  I shall be happy to take points of clarification and questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#DD00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1845,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Jeyes.

I am sure Mr. Jeyes has the information but committee members do not.<\/p> <p>  In preparing for the meeting I was trying to put the matter in context.  I had asked the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs a question in February.  From the reply, we could see the number of social workers was not necessarily going to go up, but we can see the increase in the number of referrals.  While there is pressure on the agency, we do not necessarily see resources being provided.  The figures I was given in February were to the end of November 2014 and are the latest ones I have available to me.  They made me think of Donald Rumsfeld's \"known knowns, known unknowns and unknown unknowns.\"  At the end of November 2014 we knew that 8,451 cases had not been allocated to social workers.  Of the \"known unknowns\", we know that 2,844 cases were classified as high priority, children at immediate risk of harm, including being abandoned, beaten or sexually abused.  In the case of Laois-Offaly we are talking about 1,200 files, the status of which is unclear.  I am trying to understand the age range and types of case involved.  Does Mr. Jeyes have anything to tell us about what we are looking at?  <\/p> <p>  As regards the 822 unacknowledged Garda referrals, does that mean the Garda did not acknowledge them, or were they referred to the Garda which did not refer them back to the Child and Family Agency?  Will Mr. Jeyes explain to me what is meant by the term \"Garda referrals\"?<\/p> <p>  Does Mr. Jeyes have any idea of the percentage of files that involve retrospective disclosure of abuse of adults?  Members of the committee are obviously concerned about the issue, but I am trying to understand the figures.  If the report will be available tomorrow, I wonder why we are meeting today without all of this information being available.  I am searching in the dark not knowing exactly what the figures are.  From the recent HIQA report, we know that the Child and Family Agency had difficulties in investigating retrospective adult referrals and that some are not being investigated.  I have questions in that regard. <\/p> <p>  People have contacted me about how we can ensure that when children are referred, the pathways will be absolutely clear.  One example concerned referrals to the CAMHS.  This can only be done by a GP, which makes the pathway difficult.  Headstrong and Jigsaw, for example, have a consultant psychiatrist among their staff, yet a GP must refer a child or young person to the CAMHS.  By the time he or she gets to the CAMHS which I know does not come under the Child and Family Agency, although it should, the case may have been referred to other services.  People have asked me what happens at 5.30 p.m. when one knows a child at risk needs help.  What out-of-hours service is available?<\/p> <p>  My colleagues have mentioned resources for the constituency of Laois-Offaly, but are there children in other corners?  Where are the dark places where the spotlight is not shining?  Nobody wants to be in this position, but we want to know what the figures are.  My difficulty is that I cannot grasp them.  I am hearing the right words, but how will I know when we have achieved success in order that we can applaud Mr. Jeyes?  How will I know when I need to ring the alarm bells, when we should all be shouting from the hilltops that children are at risk?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#FF00700","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1854,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Jeyes for his submission on what is a very serious matter.  In his opening statement he spoke about the newly appointed principal social worker who had reported their concerns.  Whoever they are, they should be commended for expressing their concerns.  Who was the principal social worker before this new appointment was made and where are they now?  <\/p> <p>  Some 800 files do not fall out of the sky on a Monday morning.  There has obviously been systematic evasion or distortion of what is coming through the duty system, if files are unacknowledged.  From my time in the service, referrals come through the duty system and are dealt with either by the team leader or at a team meeting with the principal social worker.  They are directed in a particular way because sometimes there will be a network check and a case may be closed off.  We are not even sure how many, but the number of referrals seems to be in excess of 800, particularly from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which generally does not make referrals lightly.  When garda&iacute; make referrals, it is often because of the absence of a social worker after 5 p.m. if it is an emergency.

I am not a member of the committee but Mr. Jeyes will understand my concern.  It is sad that this situation has arisen and it is good that it has been highlighted.<\/p> <p>  Last week, in his statement, Mr. Jeyes mentioned 700 unidentified files.  Now he says there are 1,200 on which the status is unclear.  The basic question I want answered is, what are Mr. Jeyes's staff numbers in the Laois-Offaly area and the average case load, how many of the full complement of staff there are on leave for a variety of reasons, including administrative leave, perhaps arising from this issue, and how many vacancies for staff are there?<\/p> <p>  I noted from Mr. Jeyes' opening statement that the procedure is what he terms \"prioritisation from the duty team to a social work team\" but that a principal social worker identified this as a problem.  What happened the duty team that they did not identify the problem and that it took the social worker, who was probably picking it up from some other areas, to identify it?<\/p> <p>  This is the saddest part of this.  I am a Deputy in Laois for quite a few years and I had substantially given up on the service.  I did not think this service exists because various garda&iacute; have said to me over the years when they made referrals to the child service, both before and since Tusla was set up, that they never heard anything back.  They had no faith in hearing back.  School principals have said the same to me.  When cases came to their concern, they sent them in to the building in Portlaoise and heard nothing back.  Public health nurses have also said the same to me.  The garda&iacute;, school principals and public health nurses have said this to me over a period of time.  These staff, the most senior State officials in other public bodies, had not faith in Tusla's system.  As a result, I did not even go chase those queries.  I was asked why by some constituents.  We all had given up on the system it was so bad.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Jeyes mentioned in his opening address that in Laois-Offaly he was \"piloting\" something.  Is this merely the start of a process for the 17 other areas, because that word was used here earlier?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#GG00700","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430987400,"counter":1862,"content":"<p>I will take Deputy Ciara Conway's point of clarification.  As part of the reform, we want to make lines of accountability clear.  In a integrated system, they were not always.  The principal social worker reports to area managers, and there are 17 of them.  The area managers report to four service directors, who reported previously to me and report now to the chief operations officer.  Principal social workers are four steps away from the staff the members have before them.  There are clear lines of accountability now.<\/p> <p>  I will answer in order as best I can but clearly there were some overlapping questions which we will address as we go along.  I have seen the IMPACT letter.  I choose my words with care.  Unfortunately, I take the Donald Rumsfeld reference - not knowing is the greatest failure - that is occurring here.  The status of this information was not clear.  There was insufficient system and overview and, therefore, numbers move around.<\/p> <p>  For the unions to say some of this was known is correct but we must move beyond the tradition of there being a risk, therefore I tell you there is a risk and as a result the risk gone.  Those concerned are supposed to monitor the risk, ensure that work is prioritised and ensure that those who cannot be allocated immediately are reviewed on a regular basis because things change.  With the committee's permission, we will come back to the issue of where we are in terms of what we have always openly reported - the cases that are waiting full allocation.  That was one point the unions made.<\/p> <p>  The second was about resources.  I confirm what they say that, in line with many other parts of the country, the social workers had said this is a resource issue and we do not have enough resources.  The contention would be this is not a matter solely of resources.  We are charged by the Government and the D&aacute;il to make the most efficient and effective use possible of the resources made available to us by the Irish taxpayer.  I am very disappointed by Deputy Sean Fleming's remarks, which underpin what we see, and from which we cannot duck, that in other areas the resources were being far more effectively managed.  In other areas, the instruction we were given was being followed and we now have evidence that as a consequence services improved, and that was not happening here.<\/p> <p>  The most constructive discussions are in their proper place and we will continue the discussions with the union.  What their letter does not mention is that there are also protracted discussions stating that there needs to be a change in the way in which services in the midlands - Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath - are managed and that we were prepared to invest in that.  Instead of only having two geographic principal social workers in charge of each of the two halves, there should be three.  Duty and intake are connected with the role of social workers.  The principal social worker referred to was the principal social worker who, in April, took up for the first time responsibility for a centralised intake, which is what happens across the country.  In the midlands, that had been resisted with union support and, therefore, there was no consistency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#GG00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1863,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Jeyes saying that none of the cases were notified to senior management?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#GG00900","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430987400,"counter":1864,"content":"<p>I am not saying that.

That is why I used the phrase, \"the status of which was unclear\".  We need to pull all of that together and cross-refer it.  They are saying that staff had raised resource issues and they had, but the resourcing in Laois-Offaly is no better or no worse than anywhere else.  I would contend that was also a third aspect connected with the union, which was not in the letter, which is that we have been discussing with staff and with the union the question of reform, improvement and investment through redirected resources in how they are supported.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Troy, of course, the word \"file\" is loose.  We are pulling all of the information together.  Often it can be pieces of information about the same children.  They all have been screened but I cannot yet report the figures to the committee because they are still being cross-referred.  Clearly, many of the 822 Garda notifications will be the same as those of school principals or staff from the health service.  Clearly, not being a responsive service, as Deputy Sean Fleming described, is unacceptable.  I do not wish to be too technical in terms of language, but they have only been screened and they have not been assessed.  A number of them have been deemed urgent and they have moved on.  A number of them will now be assessed.<\/p><p>We talk about staff coming from outside the area so that the casework can be dealt with.  I readily acknowledge that they have come from other tasks and that is not sustainable.  It is sustainable for this because it has to be dealt with.  If we did not do it, and the new duty team and others dealt with this, they could deal with the backlog and lo and behold another backlog would emerge.  There are things going on in parallel.<\/p><p> I referred to pilot work.  What I want to do, and I will be making a business case to Government, is to have a flexible resource that can go in when an area is in difficulties because of staffing or whatever and sort it out while we stay apace with the 15 referrals from Portlaoise that come in on a daily basis.<\/p><p> I agree that being as unclear as we were is unacceptable.  There are practice and management issues.  I take guidance from the Chair.  I need the discussions to be objective and constructive.  There are ongoing processes.  People will be held to account.  However, in terms of fair process, it is not appropriate to discuss that here.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Troy, as I have already stated, fundamentally, there should have been a better service in Laois-Offaly - again, I look to Deputy Fleming's testimony - irrespective of the resources.  There are resource limits.  We report on a monthly basis on the measure of the pressure.  The report on the measure of the pressure in February stated that there were 7,920 cases awaiting allocation.  These cases are held in that monitoring way across the country.  We believe that a number of these cases could have been closed or that the thresholds had not been fully applied.  The director of quality assurance has concluded a review and that is where we get the figure of 88%.  The remaining 12% should not even be in the system.  They do not register as needing social work assistance.  Some within the 88% could be diverted to other community organisations, such as Barnardos, the Daughters of Charity and so on.  That is our model of work.<\/p><p> Important points have been raised by Senator van Turnhout about historic abuse cases, which require different skills and perhaps we should be looking at developing specialist teams.  Within our overall cases that have not been fully allocated, there are several hundred such cases.<\/p><p> In regard to the actual number of cases being held by duty teams and not allocated, we believe the number is just over 5,000.  <\/p><p> I want to face members on the issues of Laois-Offaly, which was not just a resource issue.  I am on record as saying we have done well.  Following the start-up costs and insufficient additional investment, although our budget increased, it did not meet last year's expenditure.  Some budget adjustments are still going on.  There are budget pressures of two sorts - first, by international standards what we invest in children services is less than elsewhere and second, we have set up from scratch a brand new organisation without additional resources.  It was necessary to do this because the country does not have many resources.  We are talking about moving from survival to sustainability and that requires modest investment to make our efforts sustainable.  We are going in the right direction.  We need support.<\/p><p> Some 13 of the 17 areas have had a child protection inspection from HIQA.  Some four inspections still have to happen, one of these is the midlands.  We have done national audits.  We have good knowledge.  We have implemented the service framework and we have restructured elsewhere.  The discussions in this instance were protracted.  I want to get to the stage where we are a learning organisation that self-evaluates.  We are having a consultation about quality assurance.  The worst thing that can happen after a HIQA inspection is to be surprised.  We should know our services better than anybody else.  I have confidence in the director of quality assurance to do this.  I can understand that Deputy Troy might not have confidence in him.  I fully respect that the Minister, as he informed people, reserves his position.  HIQA will conduct an inspection or an investigation shortly.  I am in no doubt about that.  It would be foolish not to share everything transparently because it will see it anyway.<\/p><p> Those are the issues of resources.  The staff, including their share of the Ryan posts, is just over 80.  There are 79 staff and one vacancy.  There are some on leave, including in the manner referred to.  The experienced additional staff are to ensure we can go forward.  We are getting staff, who know how to screen, from other areas.  I agree this is not sustainable, but I think we can learn from that and see if we can set up a capacity to intervene elsewhere.<\/p><p> We work with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on notifications.  The garda&iacute; are now our most effective partners.  They apply the guidelines on Children First extremely well and they have the PULSE system.  They can give us more detail.  I am looking for their support for that.<\/p><p> We need a system here.  It is not the lack of IT that has caused this but the lack of IT has not helped.  There has been no IT investment in the midlands, with shared desktops and lack of databases.  It is a paper and pencil system, which gives rise to particular risks.  We got no transfer of resources or a revenue budget for IT.  We are still dependent on the HSE, which has its own priorities and reforms.  We fall to the bottom of the queue.  There were 270 IT staff in the HSE and none transferred to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#GG01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1870,"content":"<p>Who monitors the IT system of Tusla?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#HH00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430987400,"counter":1871,"content":"<p>The HSE provides Tusla with a service but we have not got to a stage for the shared services where people are given their budget-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#HH00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes"},{"type":"speech","time":1430987400,"counter":1872,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Jeyes explain what he means by shared services around the IT system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015050700002#HH00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430987400,"counter":1873,"content":"<p>The service we get in terms of revenue support for IT is as if we were a continuing part of the HSE.
