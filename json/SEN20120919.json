I hope we will play our part in the budgetary process and thank the Leader for agreeing earlier today that we would have proper and reasoned debates in advance of budget announcements.  Up until now, to take the example of the proposed property tax, there have been no proper discussions.  There have been soundbites on radio and rumours as to what the rate of this tax will be, how it will be charged, who will pay it and how much they will pay.  During the course of the debates it would not be unreasonable for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, to introduce the actual proposal of the Government on the property tax.  Is the rate to be 0.25% of the valuation of the property?  If that is the case, for the standard house in Dublin one will pay in the region of \u20ac750 per annum.  We are asking people to do this in a context where more than one in five mortgages is in arrears, 50% of households are in negative equity and disposable income for more than 1.8 million people is less than \u20ac100 per month.  This is the type of property tax the Government seeks to introduce, but we should be looking at alternatives.  The only way in which they can be looked at is if a proper and reasoned debate takes place in advance of the budget.  My party colleagues and I will use these opportunities to bring forward reasoned and costed alternatives to the measures the Government wishes to introduce.  In particular, I put the House on notice that we will vociferously oppose the property tax as it appears to be constituted, namely, as an anti-urban, anti-Dublin tax.  People will not have the ability to pay it.<\/p><p>I welcome the announcement today by the Minister for Children, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on the 31st amendment to the Constitution, the children's rights referendum that will be held on 10 November.   Following my party's meeting earlier today, I confirm to the House that we will support the referendum.  We await the publication of additional documentation in due course.  I thank the Leader for allowing an appropriate amount of time next week to debate this very important issue.  Within this and the other House, we can make all the laws we want to protect children, but unless the resources are available to protect them, laws mean nothing.  As part of this debate we must consider how we can better structure State services in order to better meet the needs of all children.  Laws are one thing but action is another.<\/p> <p>In the context of the matter to which I refer, I use the example of the 75 social workers who were supposed to have been appointed under the programme for Government in order to deal with issues relating to children.

This should enable greater participation by young people and students in particular.  I also welcome the announcement that Fianna F\u00e1il will be supporting the referendum.  That is good to hear.  What is proposed will be of immense practical significance for the many hundreds of children who are in care and cannot be adopted by their foster parents as a result of the existing wording in the Constitution.  As a result, the referendum is going to make an immense difference to the lives of children in a very clear, practical and concrete way.  There will also be significant improvements to the child protection system.  Had such improvements been made previously, judges would have been able to apply very different criteria in the Baby Anne case, the Roscommon incest case and other cases in order to ensure earlier intervention in the best interests of children.  The country has an abysmal record in child protection.  Recent reports have highlighted the failure of the religious orders and the State in this regard.  What is proposed in the referendum will be another step in the direction of providing better protection for children.<\/p><p>I remind colleagues that the Private Members' motion tabled by the Labour Party Senators relates to the regulation of charities.

During the summer I reflected on the extent to which we had achieved this goal.  In that context, I asked myself what the House had done to be innovative and imaginative and improve its sense of connectedness with ordinary people.<\/p> <p> To make that assessment, it is necessary to consider our record of innovation in the past year.  The Seanad Public Consultation Committee was established and its first consultation, on the rights of older people, successfully concluded with the presentation of a report to the Minister.  A similar consultation process is now under way on cancer and lifestyle issues.  A former President, Mary Robinson, and former Senator, Dr. Maurice Manning, addressed the Seanad, as did a representative of the Orange Order last July.  These are welcome developments but are they enough?  Is the standing and relevance of this House any better in the eyes of ordinary people than it was at the commencement of this Seanad in May of last year?  At this challenging time in our country's history, have we made a genuine effort to ensure this Chamber is an open space wherein people from all walks of life can be drawn into public discourse - people whose experience makes them well placed to assist us in framing formative and pioneering debates on a range of issues?<\/p><p>It could be argued that such debate is the role of the various committees of the Oireachtas, but I do not accept that point.  Committee meetings can be adversarial and, rightly or wrongly, attending delegates often feel they are being asked to justify or defend their position.  By contrast, the Seanad affords an opportunity for an expansive, reflective and informative exchange which creates a sense of involvement and empowerment for those who engage with us.  To clarify, I am not saying this type of engagement should be an opportunity to petition.  That would be entirely wrong.  Rather, it is an opportunity to inform.<\/p><p>This and more can be achieved without a requirement for any legislative change.  At most, it would require minor changes to how we do our business.  Facilitating this type of engagement would allow this House to make a more valuable contribution to public debate while also creating a cohort of ambassadors and advocates for the worth of the Seanad at a time when its future is uncertain.  I commend the Leader on the welcome initiatives already taken.  As we resume business, I ask him to invite all Members to make suggestions as to how we can bring further innovation and imagination to bear on the business of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900004#C01500","speaker":"1168","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348062600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Ba bhre\u00e1 liom mo dhea-mh\u00e9in a chur in i\u00fal do mo chomhghleacaithe freisin agus muid ag teacht ar ais.

As we begin a new term, there are mixed messages coming from the Government on the issue of reform.  The proposed wording for the referendum on children's rights is a positive development.  We have work to do in the coming weeks in examining that proposal, and I hope we all do so with open minds.  It is a welcome initiative which seems to me to contain much that is good.  The Government's text represents a major improvement on the wording produced by the all-party Oireachtas committee.  In particular, it strikes the required balance in its recognition that the State ought to intervene in exceptional cases but should always do so in a manner that is proportionate.  That is a rich word - I acknowledge that it was included in the draft produced by the committee - and it is right and proper that it should be in our Constitution.  Here is a real and welcome effort to honour the position of children in our society.  Moreover, there is innovation in the specific reference to the need to consult with children in an age-appropriate manner in order to ascertain their views.  We are set for a very positive debate.<\/p><p>I consider it appropriate to take the opportunity in this Chamber, just as I took the opportunity in the media today, to voice my hope that the Government's commitment to the protection of children will prove consistent in the coming weeks and months.  I say this with specific reference to the work of the expert group that is considering our response to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the A, B and C case.  It is vital that we cherish and protect children at all stages of their lives.<\/p> <p>A good step has been taken today with this proposed referendum wording.  I expect to see consistency from the Government in the commitment to protecting children's welfare at all stages.<\/p><p>I would be grateful if the Minister for Justice and Equality could attend the House for a debate in early course on prisoner releases.  There is much talk, rightly so, about the release of one particular notorious murderer from prison after serving a term of 30 years.  It is very unsatisfactory if the notoriety of a particular convicted person is a significant contributory factor, or a factor at all, in determining precisely how long that person spends in prison.

It is important that we pass the Bill, try to make some savings and remove some of the embarrassment for the Government parties.  I am going to help to do this in the interests of patients.<\/p><p>The Labour Party is going to have to make a choice with the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.  Senators Marie Maloney, Denis Landy and James Heffernan regularly drive by the Minister's mansion in County Offaly and are going to have to decide whether they are with the rich man in his castle or the poor man at his gate.

The Taoiseach and his Ministers, while apparently committed to abolishing one of the institutions of governance in the State, nevertheless have a responsibility to ensure the people get value for money by utilising this Chamber as much as possible to deliberate on the most creative and robust ideas to transform Ireland.  That is why it is great to hear that the Leader has already organised three debates, among many others, especially on the financial front.  Will he arrange as part of one of the budgetary debates for a member of the Economic Management Council to examine the policies for growth that it hopes and intends will become integral to the upcoming budget?<\/p> <p>In his book, <i>End This Depression Now!<\/i>- some of my light summer reading - Professor Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, outlines extensive economic research that demonstrates how austerity policies in advanced countries were followed by economic contraction and higher unemployment.  While we are all painfully aware of the requirements of the bailout programme for the upcoming budget, this does not relinquish the Government of its responsibility to bring forward a number of ideas for a fiscal stimulus to add jobs to the economy, encourage and support financially a creative entrepreneurial spirit and lead us beyond the dominant negative culture in banks and financial institutions which is strangling opportunities for growth.<\/p><p> I ask the Leader to confirm the date on which the Minister for Social Protection will come to this Chamber for a debate on the long overdue gender recognition legislation.  I will conclude by asking him about political reform.  Will he raise with the Taoiseach the question of when the chair of the constitutional convention will be appointed?  When the Government came to power, it promised fundamental reform.  Although the agenda for the convention is a considerably constricted version of what was originally indicated, it continues to offer great potential for people and politicians to work together to reignite this living document.

I hope we are all energised, enthusiastic and ready for the forthcoming session.  The summer may have been one of the wettest on record - the rain was unrelenting throughout Ireland from May until August - but it was spectacular for sport and it is not over yet.  If I get two tickets for the all-Ireland final, I will be cheering for Donegal.  In the final week of our last session we wished our Olympians and Paralympians the best of luck in London.  They and other sportspeople made the summer of 2012 a spectacular one.  We are familiar with the exploits of Rory McIlroy, for example.  Having spent some time in the United States over the weekend, I know that everybody there is talking about Rory.  I congratulate our Olympians and Paralympians and will mention a few obvious names.  Senators do not need to be reminded of the exploits of Katie Taylor who won a great gold medal in boxing, double gold medalists like Jason Smyth and Michael McKillop and the inspirational Darragh McDonald and Catherine Walsh.  The recent games marked a turning point for the Paralympic movement, not just in Ireland but all around the world.  London pulled off a spectacular games.  The police, the organisers, Sebastian Coe and the volunteers were all tremendous.<\/p><p>Many of our young athletes have dealt with setbacks in their careers.  I recall an event at Athlone Institute of Technology at which Mark Rohan and I spoke.  When I introduced myself, I mentioned that one had to decide whether to turn right or left when one faced a crossroads in one's life.<\/p> <p>He got up after me, when he was being inducted and said he was honoured to be there with myself, Sonia O'Sullivan and Barry McGuigan.  He said that I had talked about turning right or turning left but that he missed both the left and right turns and ended up hitting a tree and was paralysed from the waist down for the rest of his life.  The inspiration these athletes are to themselves, their families and to Ireland has to be admired.  I asked during the last Seanad session if we could bring some of these inspirational people to the House so that we can hear their stories.  I call on the Leader to congratulate these wonderful athletes who represented Ireland and to invite them to the House, if appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900008#G00800","speaker":"1165","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348064100,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I join previous speakers in welcoming everybody back after the summer break.  I also welcome the publication of the wording for the children's rights referendum, which my party will support.<\/p><p>Senator McAleese made a profound contribution when he spoke about the relevance of this House and the role we can play.  There is no doubt that over the past year or so, this House had done a lot of positive work.  In my view, however, the most important thing this House can be is relevant on the issues that are affecting people in the here and now.  In that context, there is no doubt that access to core public services, unemployment and emigration are the key issues facing the State at this time.  Recently, we got a glimpse of the two Irelands.  In one, the services to people with disabilities, older people and those being cared for were cut back.  The unemployment figures indicate that there are more people out of work now than when the Government came into office.  We also had the threats to young people that they will not receive their third-level grant if their parents have not paid the household charge.  That is what is happening to the citizens in one Ireland.  Then there is an entirely different Ireland where wealthy people are still not paying their fair share and where a bond of \u20ac1 billion will be paid out next week on an Anglo Irish Bank debt.  People see the unfairness in what is happening whereby taxpayers' money is being wasted and squandered right across the whole system while core public services are not being delivered to people who need them.  <\/p><p>I welcome the fact that we will have a number of debates on the formulation of the budget, which I called for consistently in recent months.  However, we must go further than that and analyse all of the ideas that are circulating with regard to how we can turn the economy around.  I agree with Senator Zappone that we need to see ideas on how to grow the economy and encourage investment.  They are the key issues affecting the country and will assist us in the dealing with the unemployment crisis.  Once again, I take this opportunity to welcome the fact that we are going to have a number of debates leading up to the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900009#H00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1348064100,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I welcome all of my colleagues back to the House and also welcome the beginning of a session during which we can make a major difference to many people's lives in this country.  I am referring to the forthcoming referendum on children's rights.  Right now there are 1,500 children who have been in care for more than five years.  Children of married parents who are in care for various reasons, including neglect or abuse, cannot be adopted in this country.  This referendum, if passed, will give such children, for the first time,  access to a family to which they can belong.  Approximately 95% of children in care are in foster care but as the law currently stands, they must be approximately 17 years old before they can prove abandonment by their birth family in order to be able to be adopted.  I welcome the publication by the Leader of the dates for the debates in this House on the referendum and the proposed adoption legislation.  I call for a sensitive and caring debate on these matters in order that all our children can be treated equally as they try to have a happy childhood.  They have a right to a happy childhood and a right to feel protected and safe.  I compliment the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on publishing a wording which shows that the rights of the family and the rights of the child can coexist. That is highly commendable.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader for an urgent debate on sick pay.

It is a very good service.<\/p><p>  I commend the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, for publishing the wording for the referendum on Saturday, 10 November.  It is an excellent piece of work.  It is based very much on the work of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, chaired by the former Minister, Mrs. Mary O'Rourke.  The Minister was previously a member of the committee.  She was generous in her recognition of the work done by the committee and by the former Minister of State, Mr. Barry Andrews.  It is a good start to the campaign.  We are very pleased and delighted on this side of the House.  We had a parliamentary party meeting this morning and we have endorsed the wording of the referendum.  The party leader and spokespersons had a briefing this morning on the referendum wording.  The campaign has got off to a very good start.  I am delighted that Sinn F\u00e9in is also on board in this regard because it is very important that no party would for some reason or other try to come up with a reason not to support the amendment.<\/p><p>  Following on from what Senator Healy Eames said, when one thinks of the number of children that have been deprived of the option of being adopted since the 1937 Constitution, it is frightening to conclude that at this stage approximately 2,000 children born in wedlock cannot legally be adopted.  There are many who want to be adopted and who have been fostered for years by loving foster parents but they have been deprived of the chance.  That is the most fundamental part of the amendment.  One would wonder why it has taken so long to address the issue, not just in recent years when much detailed work was done, but since the measure was first included in the Constitution.  It was a different world and Ireland was a different country then and if people knew then what they know now they would not have allowed such a measure to go into the Constitution.<\/p><p>  It is important that the financial resources are provided to ensure it is not just a case of fine words but that action is taken to implement the referendum when it is passed.  I have no doubt the referendum will be passed on 10 November.  I do not think the wording prepared by the former Minister of State, Mr. Barry Andrews, was published because it was at the end of the previous Government.  The previous Government had the intention of bringing forward this constitutional amendment but it was involved in such a crisis in the financial services that it must have been pushed aside for a few months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900010#J00200","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1348064700,"counter":70,"content":"<p>The Senator is way over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900010#J00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1348064700,"counter":71,"content":"<p>The main change is that instead of the word \"may\", the word \"shall\" has been inserted.

One aspect of concern to me relates to the media.  Because of the McKenna judgment, various media organisations must give 50% coverage to both sides of an argument.

I was very impressed by these efforts and the number of programmes the State supports, such as Springboard and JobBridge, to help people find work.  The main concern people have is uncertainty.  We should do everything we can to avoid uncertainty for the person who is thinking of investing.  In the middle of all this, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, stated that her sick pay scheme, as referred to by Senator Healy Eames, may not apply to employers who employ fewer than 100 people.  That was great news for the SME sector until, a week later, the Department stated that was not what the Minister meant.  This is uncertainty and it causes great concern for all employers.  If we are going to switch to a sick-pay scheme whereby the employer must pay the first 28 days for anybody who is sick, it will be an enormous imposition and one that had not been anticipated.  Potential employers who are thinking of investing in employment will hear there is uncertainty in this regard.  I accept the suggestion of Senators Healy Eames and O'Brien, namely, to call on the Minister to make the situation very clear.  A debate in this House would be the right thing to have in this regard.<\/p><p>It was announced yesterday by Eric Pickles, a British Government Minister, that in order to encourage the building of conservatories outside homes, small conservatories will not need planning permission.

It is important to state at this point, as will be repeated in the ensuing debate, that this measure applies particularly to children who are in exceptional situations.  It is not for every child or every family.  Families will be recognised equally with children in the Constitution.  This Article will refer to children from birth to the age of 18 and will be the sole focus of the referendum.  I am glad there will be political support from all sides for this referendum, which is very important, and I look forward to the debate.

Senator D'Arcy also mentioned this point when he referred to the PayPal issue.  The teaching of languages across the education system is a matter on which we should focus.

Will he request that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, come before the House to discuss the dearth of information available to PRSI subscribers in the context of their entitlements, particularly in respect of what will be the ultimate level of their pensions?  I do not refer here to what will be the amount of their pensions - there has been much speculation from the Cabinet with regard to decreases in this regard - rather my point relates to the fact that it is virtually impossible for an individual to discover, in the context of PRSI, what will be his or her pension entitlement at some point in the future.  If an individual has a private pension scheme with any of the investment houses, he or she may contact the relevant organisation and seek an estimate - in view of the fluctuations, etc., it is only possible to issue estimates - of what will be his or her pension at age 65 or whatever.  Such an individual can also seek advice on how he or she may further enhance said pension by increasing his or her level of investment, etc.  It is not possible to obtain such information - on a one-to-one basis - in respect of one's PRSI pension.  One will instead by referred to a multiplicity of websites.  I have visited many of these and I am aware that one would need a doctorate in actuarial science in order to be in a position to understand the information on offer.<\/p><p>  Last weekend, the <i>Irish Mail on Sunday<\/i>  published a very good article by Mr. Colm Rapple in which this matter was highlighted.  Given that people are so worried about both their futures and the amount of money they are going to have available to them, it is important that any individual who is paying a particular amount from his or her wages each week be in a position to know what additional contributions he or she should be making.  It is possible to make such contributions.  If a person loses his or her job or if he or she is self-employed, he or she can make payments on a form of credit basis.  I have met a number of people who have retired and who informed me that if they had known they could have made X amount of additional contributions, they would now be in receipt of full rather than half-rate PRSI pensions.

The latter is an important consideration for people who work away from home - in Dublin or wherever - and who will be able to return there to vote.  I hope that we will continue to hold referendums, etc., on a Saturday in the future.<\/p><p>My main point relates to Revenue and the collection of VAT.  During the summer, a national debate took place on radio in respect of Revenue and its attitude to the collection of VAT.  It was stated that Revenue uses very heavy-handed tactics in respect of those who do not pay VAT.  I have been approached by a number of people who owed what I would consider to be small amounts to Revenue and who were employing others.  A very heavy-handed approach was taken to these individuals.  In one case, the sheriff arrived and sought to seize certain things from a person's premises.  That is unacceptable.  In another case, a small company which employs ten or 12 people and which normally made its VAT return on a two-monthly basis was obliged to defer its payment.  It did not make its VAT return for six months.  For whatever reason, perhaps as a result of the fact that some companies went under in the past without making their returns, Revenue decided to take action.  Where jobs are at risk, Revenue should take a sympathetic approach to people who may be experiencing short-term difficulties in the context of cashflow.  These individuals should be given a chance.<\/p><p>As my party's spokesperson on agriculture, I join Senator Barrett in offering my condolences to the Spence family in respect of the terrible tragedy which occurred on Saturday evening last.  There is a system for monitoring the gas in slurry tanks.  In that context, we should consider making the relevant equipment available to those involved in farming who might have slurry on their premises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900012#L00300","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1348065600,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom tac\u00fa leis an m\u00e9id a bh\u00ed le r\u00e1 ag an Seanad\u00f3ir Zappone maidir le c\u00farsa\u00ed eacnama\u00edochta.

I wish to refer to a recently published report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development which should be debated in the House.  The report to which I refer states that fiscal austerity and wage compression have damaged the potential for economic growth in many countries across the globe that are employing those types of economic policies.  It also says that in many European states, including Ireland, austerity is not working and argues in favour of a different economic model which would reduce the gap between income and wealth.<\/p> <p>This report justifies the stance taken by Sinn F\u00e9in in recent years and time should be given in the House to debate its findings.<\/p><p>I welcome the publication of the text of the referendum on children's rights as a positive move forward in our efforts to protect the welfare of children in this country.  However, I take this opportunity to draw Members' attention to the plight of the scores of children currently residing in the Lisbrook direct provision centre in Galway, all of whom are facing a very uncertain future.  Residents of the centre were told two weeks ago that they were to be moved without delay and scattered to the four corners of the island.  Fortunately, following public pressure and a great deal of media attention, a stay of execution was granted by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter.  These children are living in what is essentially an open prison.  They have no rights and face the threat of being taken out of their communities and schools and away from their support structures at any moment.  With a few notable exceptions, public representatives have turned a blind eye to the issue.  My party intends to organise a presentation on their behalf and we are calling for a debate in this House on the system of direct provision.  Before the last election, the current Government parties were in agreement that it was an intolerable and disastrous way of dealing with asylum seekers.  What we have seen is the privatisation of a system which should never have been introduced in the first place, yet, despite the fact that the Government has been in place for 18 months, there has been no change in this area and no indication that any will take place in the foreseeable future.  Will the Leader invite the Minister to the House to discuss this issue without delay?  The way these people are being treated is appalling.  If our citizens abroad were treated in the same way, there would be a massive public outcry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900012#L00400","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348066200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I wish to be associated with the comments made by Senators Sean D.

It seems the benchmark in this regard is the statement by the former Supreme Court judge, Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness.  As an historical footnote, it is my understanding that at the time the latter made her remarks, the Children Act 2001 had not yet been implemented.  The reality is that a large body of legislation was introduced by both the rainbow coalition Government and by successive Fianna F\u00e1il Administrations in the past two decades.<\/p> <p>In fact, four significant Bills were introduced which have gone an extraordinarily long way to protect children's rights.  What is at issue in this particular referendum, which we will have an opportunity to debate, is specifically the question of adoption as well as the right of hearing in court.  There is already a significant body of legislation in this regard.<\/p><p>I pay tribute to former Ministers with responsibility for children.  Fianna F\u00e1il introduced the concept of a children's Minister.  Deputy Brendan Smith had responsibility for it in the early 2000s while the late Brian Lenihan was the first dedicated children's Minister.  He initiated much of what we are debating today and was followed by Barry Andrews.  As my colleague, Senator Leyden, who is our party spokesperson on this issue in the Seanad, said earlier the wording of the referendum with slight alterations was ready to go to Cabinet in January 2011.<\/p><p>While I welcome today's announcement about a children's rights referendum, it was churlish of the Minister's speechwriter \u2013 I do not believe it is her style \u2013 to be tempted into having a go at previous Fianna F\u00e1il Administrations incorrectly and erroneously.<\/p><p>I am amazed at the deafening silence from the Government benches concerning the decisions taken by local authorities across the country to deny the right of those who want to send their children to university to access grants from local authorities if they have not paid the household charge.  Earlier, Senator McAleese referred to the effectiveness of this Chamber and spoke in positive terms about parliamentary democracy.  Parliamentary democracy means the consent of the people must be there whenever legislation is passed.  It is plainly evident that almost 40% of the people in this republic have withdrawn their consent to the payment of the household charge.  It is incumbent on the Minister to clarify to the House what is going on with local authorities in this regard.  The local authorities themselves have been put to the pin of their collars by the threat to withdraw moneys for essential front line services.

Perhaps by the time the Bill returns to the D\u00e1il they might be acceptable to her.  <\/p><p>  In terms of the actual amendment,180 days seems an inordinate amount of time to consider an application.  If manufacturers apply for substitution, they may have to wait six months.  What if one was dealing with Tysabri or some wonder drug?  There is a strong rumour circulating, for example, that there is a wonder drug on the way for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, with near curative powers.  The process begins when the manufacturer applies and then, within six months, we have an answer.  What we are saying in our amendment is reasonable.  Surely 90 days, or half of what the Bill proposes, is ample time to deliberate.  Apart from the value for money aspects of this legislation and the fact that we all want cheaper drugs to be available, as the aim is to make newer, potentially more effective drugs available to patients, surely we can reduce the turnaround time.  Depending on the conditions being treated, patients may worsen considerably over a six-month period or avoidable fatalities may occur in that timeframe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900017#Q00800","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1348068300,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Section 5(2) provides that the IMB shall have a maximum of 180 days after receiving an application from the authorisation holder of a medicinal product to determine whether it will add the medicinal product to a specified group of interchangeable medicinal products or refuse to add it.

If we are introducing a regime where the lowest cost product within a group is offered to a patient then we must be certain that it does what the branded product does and has the same kind of effect.  The process does not have to take up to 180 days but, if necessary, and in order to get sufficient scientific information and all of the other information that is required to adjudicate on it then the IMB should be allowed to do that.

The first category includes criteria applicable to medicinal products, the second comprises criteria applicable to medical devices, foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses and dietary foods for special medicinal purposes, and the third sets out the general overarching criteria to which the executive shall have regard in making a relevant decision under section 18.  In other words, Schedule 3 already provides criteria covering a broad range of issues which must be taken into account before a decision is made in terms of adding or declining to add an item to the reimbursement list.

There is little or no transparency for patients in regard to decisions as to whether or when a product will be made available.  This is particularly distressing for patients when the decision is that a particular treatment is not to be provided.  That is why we sought, in amendment No. 4, to ensure there would be clear criteria in this regard.<\/p><p>I accept that there must be some boundaries and parameters and some level of discretion for the executive.  That is merely common sense.  However, section 20 defines protocols in regard to the supply, quantities and periods of availability of medicines as well as restrictions on the purposes for which they can be prescribed and the classes of prescribers.  This means, for example, that a situation could arise whereby only consultants in St. Vincent's and St. James's hospitals are permitted to prescribe a particular treatment.  While I accept that such a scenario is highly unlikely, that type of vast power is being given to the executive under this section, without any recourse for patients or stakeholders.  To reiterate, we support the legislation and have not tabled an amendment to this section.  We are arguing, however, that in the interests of patients, a clear process should be defined which would ensure transparency in the matter of access to drugs.  Patients should not be left in fear that by way of some obscure and secretive decision-making process, they will be denied access to treatment.<\/p><p>One of my amendments was ruled out of order on the basis that it would involve a cost to the Exchequer.  However, the entire Bill is concerned with costs to the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>My concern is that while we all want cheaper drugs for patients, somewhere in the provisions in section 20 the health of the patient will be sacrificed in the interests of saving costs.  When one sees the pressures on the Department, the default position for the decision maker will be to find an angle so as not to make a certain drug available.  What protocols will be put in place?  Will it be like the joke in that a certain drug will only be available to all people accompanied by both parents over 90?  Will there be terms and conditions for particular drugs which happen to be expensive so that it will only be available in a few scenarios?<\/p><p>There are previous examples of this with drugs such as ipilimumab.  After patients highlighted how it was not available on the Joe Duffy show and had the Seanad up in arms about it, the Government said it would ultimately make it available.  The buck needs to stop with the Minister.  While difficult decisions have to be made \u2013 the Minister is no stranger to this \u2013 we need to have a starting point that all drugs are available but the health service can opt out of a drug\u2019s availability based on proper and reasonable criteria such as pharmoeconomics and those contained in the Schedule.  The new drug for treating cystic fibrosis which is rumoured to be very effective should be made available in Ireland subject to terms and conditions which are reasonable.  <\/p><p>In fairness, this Bill does not provide a process for stakeholders or the patient directly to get involved in the process.  Where is their recourse?  Will they still have to go the Joe Duffy route or lobby Oireachtas Members to get the provision of a certain drug on the agenda?  Rather than providing the Health Service Executive, HSE, with a set of tools to opt out of the provision of a drug due to financial pressure, maybe we should examine a process whereby all drugs are available and there will be opt-outs as is necessary.  There certainly has to be an opt-out clause on costs and other criteria.

The criteria are set down clearly in Schedule 3.  The overriding consideration has to be patient safety.

These are all set out in the Schedule.<\/p><p>To have some kind of feedback on the process involved where a decision is taken whether to sanction a product or otherwise is a reasonable suggestion.  I am happy to examine this before we take the Bill to the D\u00e1il.  In the interests of transparency, it would be helpful if there was a determination and people had access to the basis for that determination.  I take issue, however, with the Senator\u2019s suggestion of making every drug available and then withdrawing items.  The reality is that new medicines are extremely costly.  Every action taken in the health service has a reaction because there is a limited budget.  We do not even have a fixed budget but a diminishing one.<\/p> <p>If a decision is taken to approve a particular drug which is very expensive, it means the money must come from elsewhere in the health service.

These are difficult decisions to take and we need a good deal of data on various aspects of the drugs to feed into them.<\/p><p>This is part and parcel of the situation relating to the overall drugs bill, which, at approximately 16% of total health spending, is not sustainable.  I have stated previously that if we are to make room for new and expensive drugs coming on the market and we want to make these available to people as quickly as we can, space must be provided within the drugs spend, which means reducing the cost of existing drugs.  That is the reality.  There is no easy way out of it and there is no pot of money that we can dip into.  There are direct implications in respect of the limited funding available for the health service generally.  I take the point and I am happy to consider it before we bring the legislation to the D\u00e1il to determine whether we can have feedback and greater clarity about why the HSE comes to the decisions it does in respect of some of these products.

We welcome the deal struck with the Irish pharmaceutical industry in respect of branded drugs but we believe there is still scope for savings in respect of generic drugs, which are often rather expensive.

A deal has been struck in respect of branded drugs, which is welcome, but we are somewhat surprised that the Minister has said it will save between &#8364;30 million and &#8364;40 million because last year the projections were between &#8364;60 million and &#8364;70 million.  I am unsure why there has been a reduction, but none the less a considerable saving will be made.  The question arises as to why this has not been extended to generic drugs, because they too are costly.  A survey by <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i> showed that HSE patients here were paying up to 12 times what patients under the UK National Health Service were paying for the same drugs.  Clearly issues arise that relate not only to branded drugs but to generic drugs as well.  We must do more in respect of savings on drugs.

The price decay graph is a trade term used in the case of generic drugs.  Typically, the graph flattens out at approximately 20% of the original brand price, representing an 80% reduction, which would be welcomed by the Minister of State and everyone in the House.  This appears to be much larger than any figure mentioned.  I regret that there was no regulatory impact statement with the Bill because this would have allowed us to know the extent of these savings, which would have helped the Minister of State in her quest to drive them.  In her speech on 19 July when she introduced the Bill on Second Stage, the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, referred to a saving of \u20ac34 million in 2011 from a bill of \u20ac2.3 billion.

I hope we are moving in that direction.  The pricing regime for medicines in this country has traditionally been complex.  It is difficult to understand, frankly.  As Senator Barrett has said, in many cases generic substitutes are no more than marginally cheaper than the branded product.  All of that is covered by earlier agreements.  It is impossible to understand how those agreements came about in the first place.  For that reason, the substitution rate is extremely low.  There is no incentive to substitute if there is no significant saving.  That needs to be addressed, obviously, especially as a number of big branded drugs that are widely used are coming off patent in the coming months.<\/p><p>The agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association that was mentioned by Senator Cullinane is an interim one.  Discussions are under way to reach a final agreement.  We are hopeful that significant progress will be made in that area.

I appreciate the Minister of State coming to the House as she has a busy schedule and has come straight from the other House where she took Priority Questions.  I commend the T\u00e1naiste for his insight and excellent choice in appointing the Minister of State as director of elections for the Labour Party for the forthcoming referendum.  One could not have a better advocate on one's side.  We call on her to use her powers of persuasion, experience and bring her influence to bear on the Government to implement in full the Charities Act 2009.  <\/p><p>  There is no intention to cast aspersions on any charity or disparage anyone or the excellent work conducted in Ireland and abroad by those involved in the fantastic charity sector and the vibrant voluntary sector that makes a significant contribution across a range of areas and services on a daily basis.  What we seek is greater accountability and transparency which will underpin rather than undermine the important work done by the charity sector.  There is substantial evidence that guidelines, voluntary codes of practice, even with the best of intentions, self-regulation and light touch regulation, as we have found to our cost, do not work.  This has been proved time and again across all strata and sections of society.  If we are to learn anything from the mistakes of the past, it is that a hands-off, fingers crossed, <i>laissez-faire<\/i> approach is a recipe for disaster where everybody ends up paying a high price for the sins of a few. <\/p><p>  The Charities Act 2009 is good legislation.  It took the best part of ten years to get it through the Oireachtas following widespread consultation with stakeholders in the charity sector, a number of whom are in the Visitors Gallery.  No one who is responsible and none of the key players and stakeholders within the sector is impeding implementation of the legislation; on the contrary, they are appealing to the Government to implement it.  We are trying to give impetus to their endeavours to ensure their good work is not impeded by doubts about how funding is utilised.  There is far too much at stake.  <\/p><p>  I acknowledge the assistance provided by the Library and Research Service in preparing for the debate.  It provided the data and information which formed the basis for the motion.  I thought I knew a little about what was going on in the charity sector.  While many of the players are small operators, there are 7,800 charities registered and recognised by the Revenue Commissioners.  I was astounded to find through a multiplicity of sources - philanthropy, donations from a generous public and State aid by way of grants and supports provided by the taxpayer - that the estimated resources available to the sector on an annual basis was &#8364;6 billion, virtually half the budget of the Department of Health which is experiencing its own difficulties, as the Minister of State is aware.  There is a high level of scrutiny across all sectors of public expenditure, rightly so.  <\/p><p>  Some of the cutbacks in the health sector are difficult to bear and hard to fathom.  I have in mind home helps, personal assistants and carers.  Last week in County Laois two respite homes were under threat of closure.  Given the cutbacks, we would be negligent in our duty if we did not ensure we got the best value from all resources and reserves.  At a time when the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive are agonising daily on service provision it cannot follow that there is not the same level of scrutiny, transparency and accountability and the best value is not achieved, as brought to our attention regularly by Senator Sean D. Barrett, from the significant investment and resources made available to the charity and voluntary sector.<\/p><p>  We are not having a go at the Minister for Justice and Equality who is responsible for implementation of the Charities Act 2009.  I understand he is being curtailed and restricted by his Cabinet colleagues, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, who say it would be too expensive and not cost effective at this time to establish what some have incorrectly characterised as a new quango in the office of a charity regulator.  That is false economy and ill-judged; it is penny wise and pound foolish.  If there was the political will, a way would be found to implement the Act in full and establish an office of regulator, without it becoming a monstrosity, to serve the charity sector, assist it in its work, underwrite its bona fides<i><\/i>and ensure public money is well spent.<\/p><p>  It has been stated there is a danger one could tar everyone with the same brush, but that is not the purpose of this exercise, as the vast majority of charities operate to the highest standards and are pushing for implementation of the Act.  All it takes is one bad egg or a few bad apples to give the entire sector a bad name, undermine public trust and the entire funding process begins to unravel and the good work is damaged indefinitely.  Given substantial annual funding of &#8364;6 billion, it would be foolish to think that without scrutiny by an office of regulator that in every instance we would be afforded good value.  There is substantial duplication and an overlap.  I question the idea that one should be able to set up a charity and call it after oneself by having a few open buckets to start collecting and expect the public to believe it is all hunky-dory.  This is not just my view but a sentiment echoed recently by the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner, Ms Emily O'Reilly, who said the rules of good governance and ethical behaviour should apply to small charitable institutions as much as they did to large banks.  She went on to say that the day would come when a largely uncritical and undemanding public that contributed to and supported charitable causes would begin to demand a larger say in how one went about one's business.  Therefore, I have tabled the motion in good faith and with the best of intentions.  An Act that took a long time to get through the Houses of the Oireachtas should not be left languishing on the shelf to gather dust but put to good use in the interests of the charity sector to recognise the generosity of the people and ensure we get the best value for money and that if there are persons who are unscrupulous, it might help to weed them out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900026#FF00200","speaker":"1143"},{"type":"speech","time":1348071000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I welcome former Senator Kathleen O'Meara.<\/p> <p>Ms O'Meara works for the Irish Cancer Society.  I see Mr. Hans Zomer from D\u00f3chas who has been very strong in his efforts to establish a governance code for charities.  Well done to him.  I am pleased to participate in the debate and to second the Labour Party group&#8217;s Private Members&#8217; motion on the Charities Act 2009.  This is important legislation which, when it takes effect and is enforced, will place obligations and responsibilities on trustees and directors of charities and the charities themselves.  The soon-to-be enforced legislation will also result in increased transparency and accountability for charities operating in this country.  As a sector that benefits to the tune of millions of euro per annum from the Government and the public alike, it is imperative that the Government, as custodian of taxpayers' money, ensures the sector is regulated as we have learned, unfortunately, in other sectors of society that lack of regulation or enforcement can present us with significant problems.<\/p><p> I am a fervent supporter of the great work many charities do in this country.  I recognise the important role they play locally, nationally and internationally.  As a public representative I have engaged with many charities and their services on behalf of constituents.  Their readiness to help and their impact must never be underestimated.  They are of critical importance in every small town and village in the country and their tentacles stretch as far as delivering services in health, social services, education and emergency relief.  From an international dimension we must not forget the part Irish charities play in helping to keep Ireland's international reputation right up there among the greatest benevolent countries in the world.  This cannot be underestimated<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">when it comes to alleviating crises in war-torn and hunger ravaged countries.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> With 11,700 organisations in Ireland, they also play a significant role in the socialisation of this country given the large numbers engaged in various humanitarian causes.  In 2009, more than 100,000 people were employed by charities, with 560,000 volunteers and more than 50,000 people directly involved with their governance as directors.  Furthermore, the combined turnover of these organisations is &#8364;5.75 billion which accounts for more than 3.25% of national income, which is not an inconsiderable amount.  However, we must put the issue in the current context.  Our economic climate and the financially straitened times in which we find ourselves present many challenges for charities.  These pressures have had a detrimental impact on fund-raising at a time when most charities are experiencing an unprecedented demand for their services.  In particular, almost 60% of organisations have experienced a decrease in income in the past three years, while two thirds of non-profit organisations have seen an increase in beneficiary numbers over the same period.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> The Charities Act 2009 was passed on 28 February 2009 and represents a watershed for how the community and voluntary sector in Ireland will operate.  As a consequence, all charities will have to comply with the new regulatory framework.  The legal obligations and responsibilities pertaining to employees and management of charities is fully defined within the Act.  Its principal aim is to acquire higher standards from the charities themselves and the main thrust of the Act is threefold.  It seeks to achieve the following: ensure greater accountability for charities; protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud; and enhance public trust and confidence in charities.  To that end the following measures will be introduced: a new charities regulatory authority will be set up to secure compliance by charities with their legal obligations; a new register of charities will be introduced and all charities operating in the State must register; it will be a requirement that the annual activity reports by charities be submitted to the new authority; the law relating to fund-raising and in particular to collections by way of direct debits will be clarified; a new charity appeals tribunal will be set up; and consultative panels will be introduced to assist the authority in its work and to ensure effective consultation with stakeholders.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> These are all very important reforms, not least because charities in Ireland are the last sector in Irish life enjoying a high degree of unconditional trust from the public.  As a lawyer, I am more than familiar with individuals making bequests to charities upon their death, something that can very often be the lifeblood of not-for-profit organisations.  With Irish people readily contributing to good causes a greater focus is required for the achievement of maximum value for money for every cent spent - with clear accountability and measurable results.  It is imperative that we make our decisions to donate based on knowledge of the percentage of funding trickling down to the coalface and targeting those who need it most.  In that regard, one of the most important provisions of the Act is that all charities will be required to provide the authority with annual activity reports which I presume will be accessible to a charity's donors.  However, we must be mindful that in the absence of the enforcement of the legislation we may very well usurp the trust that has been built up between the public and charities alike.  To that end we must ensure that the entire sector and the goodwill it gets from the public is not decimated as a consequence of a financial scandal raising its ugly head.  That is something we should be keen to avoid so that all genuine charities working hard for their respective causes can continue, safe in the knowledge that their sector is properly regulated and free from such risks.  It is vitally important that we uphold the highest possible standards when it comes to charities.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> While I have focused up to now on the pioneering rules about to be enforced, I take the opportunity to acknowledge and laud the great work done by organisations such as D\u00f3chas and The Wheel, among others,<\/font><font color=\"#8242FF\"><\/font><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">which have endeavoured to voluntarily change the standards applicable to the not-for-profit sector.  They have shown great initiative in their own individual endeavours and the spearheading of a governance code for community, voluntary and charitable organisations is a wonderful feat.  While their efforts go some way towards initiating a charter for charities, if one likes, it is now imperative for us as a Government to help complement their efforts with the enactment of effective legislation.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> While I acknowledge we are now in different times and in a different economic space, we are beginning to emerge from the abyss.  Recent years have been difficult for the Government which means it has been hard to make a case for setting up a charities regulatory authority and an appeals board at a time when the country is trying to get off its back and bridge the current budgetary deficit.  The cost associated with implementing the central tenet of the legislation is something we cannot afford when we still have the troika in the country.  Its presence is not expected to be perennial.  However, it does remain a specific and unique challenge facing the Government.  While I know and understand that it is the intention of the Government to implement the Act in full, as resources permit, let us prioritise it when we are back on our feet.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this issue and hope some of the issues raised by me and my colleague, Senator Whelan, among other group members, will be taken on board by the Minister.  It is imperative that the Government and the not-for-profit sector work together in solidarity to achieve the same goals of transparency, accountability and value for money.  That is the only way we can move forward together.  I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  I was so anxious to make my speech that I was unaware the Minister of State was sitting in front of me.  I apologise for the oversight.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900026#FF00300","speaker":"1173","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348071600,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and compliment the Labour Party Senators on tabling this motion because it gives us an opportunity to express our appreciation to the charities sector.  The 2009 Act should be viewed in a positive way.  If one studies the sections of the Act it is exceptionally clear that an effort is being made to preserve the good name of the charities sector.  It is also clear that existing charities will automatically be able to go onto the register.  At the same time it is clear in the legislation that smaller charities that might wish to register will not be overawed or daunted by documentation.  All of those messages are particularly important in case the message is going out in some way that we are endeavouring to undermine or make more difficult the work of charitable organisations in this country.  It is clear that this country has a particularly proud record when it comes to responding generously to various causes.  Good causes are exceptionally prevalent, yet each time we hear of a new charity, requirement or necessity whether at home or abroad, on a <i>per capita<\/i> basis this country must be top of the league in terms of donations.<br \/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  If we are fair to the organisations that currently exist - it is particularly true and probably amplified in many ways at present - the charitable organisations are the reserve troops in a time of urgency and necessity in combatting the effects of poverty and other issues.  One can only surmise and imagine - we all know what the answer would be - what Irish life would be like and also what the terrible emergencies that exist internationally would be like if we did not have those same organisations who take up the challenge on our behalf.<\/font><\/p> <p>I do not know how other people feel but those of us who have some little bit of finance to spare in our lives always feel grateful to the charities for being there to accept our contribution and being able to use it in a professional and direct way.  We wonder how we ourselves might do this.  Would it be a matter of giving some money to a person on the street who needs it?  I will not be sanctimonious and say we should not do that but the important thing is that when there is an organisation in place to take one's contribution, one that is accountable and held responsible for its work, then we feel comfortable.  In many ways it motivates us to give further contributions when necessary.<\/p><p>I regard today's debate as a good news story.  Many of us have to sit through all the different debates in the House and listen to the topical issues that arise on the Order of Business.  It takes great strength of character to overcome the sense of negativity and defeatism which comes out of those debates, although I do not suggest they should not take place - of course they must.  However, this is a good news story, because legislation would not have been needed in 2009 if it were not for the proliferation that had taken place in the charities sector.  One certainly could not point a finger at 99% of them.  It only takes one, however, to dilute the real charitable work in this country.  The public are made aware of this when some issue or other occurs.  I am not thinking of any particular organisation or incident but when one hears something negative it makes one pause a little in regard to the contributions one makes.  Such cases are few and far between, but are most unfair to the vast majority of charities that do their work in the right spirit and with a sense of professionalism, accountability and responsibility.  It is most unfair when anybody detracts or distracts from that work.  That was the basis of the legislation, which may have sent a kind of ripple through the entire sector - such was the feeling I got at the time.  Having taken part in the debate when the legislation was introduced, I did not believe there was any need for alarm bells, because I knew that one had to study each section of the legislation and look at it in its entirety in order to see that ultimately it would help the charity sector in this country.<\/p><p>It is important that another message goes along with this legislation, namely, that the State values the work being done by the charity sector.  I am always amazed at the work being done by charitable organisations outside the country and at what they have to go through and put up with.  When the former President, Mary Robinson, visited one of the stricken countries her emotion was overwhelming.  At the same time, for the people going abroad who do that work on the ground all the time, not only is it emotionally draining, but there is also danger involved.  Tonight, because the Labour Party Senators have tabled this motion, we are able to say to this sector that we appreciate its work and want to see its workers feeling comfortable and confident in regard to the involvement of the State.  In addition to the legislation, which has its own aim of regulation, the State should take any opportunity it finds to make the work of those organisations easier and should give whatever support it can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900027#GG00200","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348072500,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  As outlined by previous speakers, the Charities Act 2009 is positive legislation.  From speaking to people in charities and the various managers who came to meet me recently when investigating other matters, I am heartened to see that there is support for the legislation within the sector, which is welcome.  I commend the Labour Party Senators for bringing forward this motion and that the progression of this legislation is continuing to get attention both in this Chamber and in the media.  It is important legislation which I hope to see implemented in the near future.<\/p><p>One of the more important aspects of the Act, namely, the creation of the charities regulatory authority, is a vital step and I hope it will be established soon.  The preparatory work has taken place in that regard and I hope the resources will be available soon to put it into practice.  In 2011, most of the Act, including the establishment of the authority, had to be deferred as a consequence of the perceived need for staffing and financial resources which were not available.  At meetings I have had with various charities and organisations the importance of the establishment of the authority is reiterated constantly and it is something of which we must be mindful<\/p><p>A related aside is the recent closing down of the Irish Nonprofits Knowledge Exchange, INKEx.  It provided a useful function as an over-arching body which produced data in the charitable sector.  I was sorry to see that service having to shut its doors this year and I hope a similar service will take its place as it serves a useful function.<\/p><p>Another important aspect of the legislation is the reserve power in the Charities Act regarding the Minister for Justice and Equality having the capacity to introduce statutory regulations relating to the manner and conducting of fund-raising.  That is absolutely necessary.  I have spoken on numerous occasions both in this House and in the media on the issue of on-street fund-raising or &quot;chugging&quot;, as it is informally known.  Many jurisdictions are now bringing in binding rules of governance for that practice.  For those Members who are not aware of &quot;chugging&quot;, it refers to the people who locate themselves sometimes on four different corners of the same street where one cannot avoid them.  They want people to sign up to direct debits.  Many jurisdictions are bringing in binding rules to govern that practice such as a limit on the number of people engaging in the practice on a particular street or in a particular town, a limit on the number of steps they can follow somebody and such other measures.<\/p><p>While I am aware that the guiding principles for charitable fund-raising state that the charity will take care not to cause unreasonable nuisance or disruption in its fund-raising efforts, to date the voluntary code of conduct has not been particularly effective.  In private briefings with a number of other charities it is clear they believe they are being tarnished by association, and they are seeking a level playing field with clear rules and established boundaries for all.<\/p><p>While aggressive fund-raising on streets can provide a short-term financial hit, it can also provoke brand damage in the long term, as some charities are now seeing, with noted decreases in the number of hours being put in by volunteers in instances where they are also paid as street fund-raisers.  In terms of the rationale, why should people stay on the street with a bucket trying to raise money for a charity when they can raise money for the same charity and earn some money for themselves at the same time?  The charities will need to put in place a level playing field in that regard and it is something that should be examined.<\/p><p>I am supportive of this legislation for the reason my colleagues and I have outlined, namely, that it is necessary.  I commend the Senators for bringing forward the motion and thank the Minister of State for her attendance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900029#JJ00100","speaker":"1153"},{"type":"speech","time":1348072500,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I welcome the motion and I am supportive of the initiative taken by my colleagues.  I agree with the sentiment but would go further and say there is an urgent need to implement the Charities Act to provide for regulation and supervision.  I have a concern about the words &quot;resources permit&quot; in the motion because I believe the Charities Act must be implemented in full.  I had a genuine reservation about the tenor of the press release Senator Whelan published last week but I note his words earlier in that regard.<\/p><p>  I must be frank with the Minister.  The delay in the implementation of the Charities Act is not on the side of the charities; it is on the side of this and the previous Government.  When the Charities Act was being written, developed and eventually came into place in 2009, I was working in a charity and we, like many other charities I know, undertook a dedicated review of the way we operated.  We took legal advice.  We amended our memorandum of understanding and articles of association.  My heart was broken trying to ensure we fulfilled the requirements in the Charities Act.  We examined our financial accounting and our reporting to ensure we fully complied with the Charities Act.  We examined our governance structure.  We made sure that we were ready for the Charities Act.  That was done at a cost to the organisation in terms of time, money and resources, which we were happy to bear for better regulation of the sector.  The work we did was replicated by many organisations in anticipation of the Act coming into effect.<\/p><p>  The motion refers to &quot;resources permit&quot;.  I would argue that the delay in implementing the Act is costing the taxpayer money.  We are all aware there are organisations on the charities lists availing of charitable tax exemptions which are not operating as what we would deem to be charities under the Charities Act.  Proper and effective regulation will see a number of organisations removed from that list and liable to paying tax.  In that sense implementation of the Act will pay for itself.<\/p><p>  In addition, in the absence of the full implementation of the regulatory provisions in the Act, many charities are being forced to divert their often scarce resources away from front-line service provision.  For example, thousands of small charities are forced to incorporate as companies limited by guarantee because there is no alternative source of regulatory scrutiny to satisfy funders' requirements.  It is actually costing organisations not to have the Charities Act in place.<br \/><i>The Irish Times<\/i> recently reported that in the most recent year for which data were available from the now, regrettably, defunct Irish non-profits database - it is a shame that is not in place - 8,000 Irish non-profit companies with public benefit purposes had spent almost &#8364;17 million on audit fees alone.  For the very smallest of these, where total annual revenue was less than &#8364;50,000, this amounted to an average cost of about &#8364;1,200, which is more than 7% of their annual turnover.<\/p><p>  I am a staunch supporter of disclosure, transparency and accountability across all sectors.  I am also concerned when I hear reports about high salaries, commissions and high administration costs in some charities but it is vital - I urge caution to my colleagues - that we do not tar the entire charity sector with the same brush.  I have worked in and with many charities whose staff work for modest salaries and others that operate with staff, as they are called, but who are 100% voluntary; they do not receive any payments.  I am still involved with a number of charities - I assure my colleagues it is all on a <i>pro bono<\/i> basis - as are many citizens across this country.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, not all of the 7,800 listed charities receive State funding.  Some receive none while others, and this particularly irks me, receive multiple funding lines across a number of Departments.  That must be examined.  Currently, the Government cannot provide one list showing the total amount that goes from the State to an individual charity.  To do that one must go through every Department&#8217;s and agency's funding schemes.  How do we know if the State is funding the same organisation to do the same thing through multiple Departments?  Where is the governance?<\/p><p>  We are all aware of the decision taken by Barnardos last month to suspend its operations and put its staff on one week&#8217;s unpaid leave as a cost cutting measure to ensure it could continue to provide essential services for vulnerable children and families.  That is because the fund-raising capacity and environment for many charities is at its most difficult.  We have had cumulative cuts for organisations.  We can all make small cuts in life but when one has to do it year after year, it gets very tough, and Barnardos is not on its own.  These cost cutting measures are being replicated across many charitable organisations.<\/p> <p>On some occasions staff in the children's sector have, at their own expense, taken up to two months unpaid leave in order to ensure front-line services are protected.  I could provide examples of staff in several organisations who have done this.<\/p><p>It would be wholly inappropriate if we failed to mention the outstanding work being done by charities.  I have worked with many organisations and I am of the view that the delay in fully implementing the Charities Act is costing the State money and has the potential to damage the reputation of charities which are operating effectively and have sound governance measures in place.  I thank those organisations - D\u00f3chas, The Wheel and the ICTR - which are making great efforts to promote the work of governance within charities.  I thank our Labour Party colleagues for tabling the motion.  However, greater urgency is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900029#JJ00200","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348073100,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I call Senator Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900030#KK00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1348073100,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Senator Barrett is being very kind by allowing me to contribute to the debate in his stead.<\/p><p>I am extremely glad this motion has been tabled because it again draws attention to the need to implement the Charities Act 2009 in full, if only to ensure the charity sector will be regulated more efficiently and to close some of the loopholes.  Transparency in charities can help to increase much-needed revenue.  It seems Ireland is almost unique in not having a regulator to oversee activities in the charity sector.  In view of the fact that the State gives so much money to charities, there is scope for Departments to play a greater role in the auditing of their accounts.<\/p><p>I take the opportunity to apologise to the Minister of State.

We need to know the impact of a charity's work.  In other countries the Internet is widely used to better inform consumers.  The website run by the non-profit organisation Charity Navigator evaluates charities in the United States and rates them on a zero to four star basis.  A similar system should be in operation in this country because it would provide an in-depth analysis for the customer, namely, the person who is donating.<\/p><p>  I wish to comment on one charity with which I was personally involved and which is very close to Ireland.  The said charity was the subject of debate in the House and I tabled an amendment in respect of it.  My amendment was accepted and this led to the relevant Bill being returned to the Lower House.  The Bill in question which related to the George Mitchell scholarship was passed by the D\u00e1il and brought before this House, including a reference to money to be spent in the State.  However, George Mitchell scholarships are awarded to US students who wish to come to Ireland to study courses relating to peace in many cases.  Under the terms of the legislation to which I refer, these students would not have been covered if their studies took them north of the Border.  I argued with the then Minister who informed me that there was a problem.  However, my amendment was accepted on Report Stage and the Bill was subsequently returned to the Lower House.<\/p><p>  I am enthusiastically in favour of the charity involved in this regard, the US-Ireland Alliance, but I was stunned when Charity Navigator gave it a one star rating.  Overall, it was awarded 39.9 points out of a possible 70.  In terms of accountability and transparency, it was awarded 30 points out of a total of 70.  Charity Navigator also states audited financial accounts prepared by an independent accountant were not provided by the charity.  In addition, no key staff of the US-Ireland Alliance are listed on the charity's website.  For the financial year 2012, it received almost $3 million in revenue.  The charity has expenses of approximately $1 million and net assets of over $7 million.  Over 17% of the organisation's expenses goes towards paying the salary of its CEO.  I do not want to go off topic, but this is an organisation which sends just 12 American students to Ireland every year to study.  It is very easy for the customer to analyse whether this is value for money.  A similar organisation, the Asia Foundation in California, received a four-star rating from Charity Navigator.  I would be interested in obtaining the Minister of State's views on whether she is of the view that the US-Ireland Alliance offers value for money.  Perhaps other Members might examine this and similar cases.<\/p><p>  In the context of the salaries of CEOs, there is further murkiness.  A report in June indicated that four charities which shared millions of euro in State funding each year had refused to reveal how much their chief executives were paid.  Senator Jillian van Turnhout highlighted this fact.  While greater transparency will, I hope, mean more donations in the long term, some charities must move away from the murkiness that surrounds them.<\/p><p>  A website in the United States, <i>DonorsChoose.org<\/i>, allows people to donate to projects in American schools, which is extremely interesting.  The organisation in question collects proposals from teachers and makes them available to public schools through its website.  Individual donors can then select projects and contribute as much as they can afford to them.  <i>DonorsChoose.org<\/i> then purchases necessary supplies and ships them directly to the schools.  All donors receive photographs of the project and a letter from the teacher.  Donors who contribute $50 or more to a project also receive a package of hand-written thank you notes from the students involved.  This is a smashing idea, particularly as it is imaginative.  Websites such as <i>DonorsChoose.org<\/i> are thriving because they provide charitable donors with information on the use to which every cent they receive is put.  The establishment of a similar, Government-run, website in this country would be a step in the right direction.  Without transparency, charities here are placing themselves at a real disadvantage.<\/p><p>  From the perspective of the private sector, would it be possible for the Government to give further encouragement to businesses to donate to charities?  Working with charities can bring benefits which businesses may not have contemplated.  When I was involved in the supermarket business, we discovered that customers much preferred bread which was only a couple of hours old.  We took two steps, namely, putting in place little clocks on the shelves to show how old our bread was and making the decision not to sell bread that was over four hours old.  Our accountants went berserk because each night we were obliged to give any bread that was over four hours old to various charities.  However, our customers were extremely happy because they could only buy very fresh bread.  In addition, we did very well because we sold much more bread.  The charities also did very well.  As our shops closed each night, representatives of local charities queued to obtain the bread to which I refer.  That was a real win-win.  Many similar opportunities could be seized by those who are minded to take them.  I strongly encourage the Government to help to ensure retailers and restaurants are in a position to give away leftover food to local charities for distribution to those who are most in need.  The Government could set an example by ensuring all leftover food from the canteens and restaurants in Departments, Government agencies, etc., is given to charity.<\/p><p>  I am delighted that we have been given this opportunity to comment on the activities of charities.  This area must have the cloak removed from it in order that we might see what is happening.  Such a development would ensure charities, those who donate to them and the nation as a whole would benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900030#KK00500","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1348073100,"counter":192,"content":"<p>On each occasion I come to the Seanad I am obliged to thank everyone for the welcome afforded to me.

In that context, I have been considering a few things.  I am here in the absence of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, who, unfortunately, cannot be present and has asked me to convey his apologies to the House.<\/p><p>As previous speakers stated, charitable organisations play a vital role in our society.  There is probably no aspect of Irish society that is not enriched by the involvement of charities and the tireless efforts of those who work and volunteer on their behalf.<\/p> <p>From the largest international charities working in developing countries around the world to the smallest community group where everyone knows each other, the spirit of charitable work and charitable giving is evident and worthy of support.<\/p><p> The Charities Act, enacted in 2009, was underpinned by an understanding of the vital role played by charities and a desire to support them in their work.  A fundamental objective of the Act is to enhance public trust and confidence in charities and increase transparency in the sector.  Given that many charities receive a portion of their income from public donations, the issue of public trust is of crucial importance to them.  The provisions of the Act are intended to ensure greater accountability and protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud.  In this way, the trust placed by members of the public in the charities they support can be protected.  When Ireland is assessed on the basis of international comparisons, it is invariably shown, as Senator Feargal Quinn observed, that Irish people contribute more per head than their counterparts in other countries.<\/p><p> Since the enactment of the legislation, five sections of the Act have been fully commenced and a sixth partially commenced.  This has been done by way of two separate commencement orders, namely, SI 284 of 2009 and SI 315 of 2010.  These orders were primarily technical in nature, with their substantive provisions relating to regulation of the sale of mass cards and the allocation of powers to the courts to grant relief to charity trustees from personal liability for breach of trust in certain circumstances.  The key provisions of the Act, to put in place a new regulatory framework for the charitable sector, have yet to be commenced.  These provisions are linked to the establishment of a new independent charities regulatory authority, as provided for the under the Act.  Because the legislation vests the powers to regulate charities in the new authority, it is not possible to commence further sections of the Act until that authority is set up.<\/p><p> The Minister for Justice and Equality assumed responsibility for policy relating to the regulation of charities in May of last year, following the reorganisation of Departments.  Shortly thereafter, in the context of the urgent need to reduce Government spending and restore stability to the public finances in line with the EU-IMF programme, all Departments conducted a comprehensive review of expenditure aimed at identifying areas where savings could be achieved.  In this context, the establishment of a charities regulatory authority was deferred, with the Minister for Justice and Equality undertaking to examine how progress might be made towards the objectives of the Charities Act in light of the changed circumstances since its passage.<\/p><p> As the Minister made clear at the time the deferral was announced last November, the decision to defer the full implementation of the Charities Act was taken for budgetary reasons.  It did not indicate a change in Government policy with regard to the fundamental objectives of the legislation, including the desire to provide for better regulation of charitable organisations.  In light of this, the Department of Justice and Equality is examining how the objectives of the Act can be progressed in the current circumstances.  The charities sector is engaging with the Minister to find a resolution to this difficulty.  The Minister intends to continue this consultation process in the coming months and looks forward to the informed engagement of the Seanad as part of that.  It is rarely a quick or simple matter to go from the passage of legislation establishing a new statutory agency to the point where that body is fully established and exercising its functions in line with its parent legislation.  Nevertheless, it was not envisaged that there would be such a lengthy delay in the establishment of the charities regulator.  The Minister accepts that this is a source of concern to many in the charities sector and shares their eagerness to see the matter progressed in line with available resources.<\/p><p> It is important to remind the House that not everything depends on having a dedicated charities regulator.  In fact, there is already a broad range of regulatory oversight measures that can apply to charities.  Many, for example, are already subject to scrutiny by various State bodies.  Moreover, large numbers of charities receive significant levels of Government funding through grants, contracts for service delivery and so on.  As such, they are subject to the oversight of the relevant grant-making or contracting Departments and agencies in regard to how they use and account for these public funds and, where appropriate, to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Revenue Commissioners have granted charitable tax exemptions to almost 8,000 charities and have significant powers to ensure they are compliant with tax law.  A full list of these charities is available to the public at <i>revenue.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p> Many charities are companies limited by guarantee and, as such, are also subject to the provisions of company law and are generally required to provide certain information to the Companies Registration Office under the Companies Acts.  This information can then be accessed by the public.  Such charities are also potentially subject to scrutiny by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Charities that take the form of a trust are subject to the provisions of trust law.  In addition, any business entity is subject to general criminal and fraud legislation.<\/p><p> In common with the Members who have put forward this motion today, I look forward to the full implementation of the Charities Act and the dedicated regulatory framework it will provide.  However, it is important to recognise, as I have outlined, that the charities sector is at present far from unregulated.  To suggest otherwise would be misleading and would fail to acknowledge the value of the effort invested by many charities in meeting existing regulatory obligations.  The motion before the House this evening not only points to the benefits of statutory regulation of charities of the type provided for in the Charities Act but also recognises the role and responsibility of charitable organisations themselves in enhancing the transparency and accountability of their sector.  Voluntary, sector-driven approaches to better practice are an essential part of a strong and accountable charity sector.  Statutory regulation is a complement to this, not an alternative.  As progress is made on the implementation of the Charities Act, the Government hopes to see a continued drive from within the charities sector itself for improvements in transparency and accountability where necessary.<\/p><p> The motion refers to levels of remuneration and administrative costs, an issue that is of genuine concern for many people who make donations to charities.  Greater transparency in this regard has real potential to incentivise best practice among charities and, in so doing, enhance the public's trust in them.  Fund-raising is another area in which sector-driven efforts to encourage best practice can play an important part, and the Government continues to support certain initiatives in this area.  These include the promotion of a statement of guiding principles for charitable fund-raising which were developed by the charities sector itself under the leadership of the voluntary charity umbrella body, the Irish Charities Tax Research Group.  These guiding principles, at the core of which are respect, honesty and openness, aim to provide a set of agreed and accessible standards for charitable fund-raising strategies and projects.  The Department of Justice and Equality is providing grant support for this initiative.  The Minister has encouraged all charities to sign up and adhere to these principles, which represent a simple yet demonstrable commitment on the part of charities to better accountability and transparency.  To date, however, only modest numbers of charities have formally signed up to the principles, which were launched in March 2011.  The Department continues to support this initiative with the aim of increasing the share of fund-raising which conforms to the principles.  However, such an initiative requires the support and participation of charities themselves in order to<i><\/i>be meaningful and the Minister urges all charities that carry out fund-raising to sign up.  Organisations wishing to find out more should visit <i>ictr.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p> As I outlined, the deferral of the establishment of a charities regulatory authority is a budgetary and not a policy matter.  I assure the House that the decision to defer statutory regulation was not taken lightly.  Despite the changed circumstances with respect to the public finances and the wider economy, it remains Government policy that the relevant legislation will be fully commenced and a charities regulatory authority established in due course and in such a way as available resources permit.  During 2012, therefore, the Department of Justice and Equality has kept the decision to defer under review in the context of resource allocations, and has examined ways of making progress towards the objectives of the Charities Act.<\/p> <p>This process is ongoing and the Minister for Justice and Equality intends to consult on options in the coming months.  The charities sector is vibrant, diverse, innovative and enriched by the goodwill and confidence of its members and of the public at large.  It is in all our interests to keep it so.  The Government is determined to work to this goal in partnership with the charities sector.  I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900030#KK00800","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348074300,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Senator Moloney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900032#MM00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1348074300,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I know she is particularly conscious of the value to society of the charities and non-governmental organisation sectors.  I commend my colleagues, Senators Whelan and Higgins, on whose initiative we have put forward this motion.  I also welcome the stakeholders in the Visitors Gallery, Mr. Hans Zomer of D\u00f3chas, the former Senator, Ms Kathleen O\u2019Meara of the Irish Cancer Society, Ms Patricia Quinn of the Irish Nonprofits Knowledge Exchange and others.<\/p><p>We bring forward this motion in the spirit of wishing to be constructive and I am delighted it has cross-party support.  All Members are agreed on the merits of the full commencement of the Charities Act 2009 and we are all grateful to the Minister of State for setting out the Government\u2019s commitment to its full commencement.  As she made clear, as has the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, it is for budgetary rather than policy reasons that the full implementation of the Act has been deferred.  They referred to the cost of the establishment of the new statutory authority envisaged which none of us can pretend is not a significant factor.  We know the Government is committed to reducing numbers in the public sector and there is an embargo on recruitment.  However, it would seem, as Senator Whelan has said, that it might be more cost-effective to introduce some form of statutory authority in this area through the transfer of existing public servants rather than recruiting new public service members.  We believe it would save money in the long term and enhance the immense good work that charities do, as well as the public trust and confidence in them.<\/p><p>We know if the Act were fully commenced it would provide for the establishment of a charities regulatory authority, mandatory registration of charities and require them to make information on their finances available to the new authority and, therefore, to the public.  It would allow for greater transparency and accountability in charities.  The current position is that we have large numbers of charities of which approximately 8,000 are registered with Revenue and the Companies Registration Office as companies limited by guarantee.<\/p><p>This may only be a small portion of the not-for-profit sector.  Trinity College\u2019s Centre for Nonprofit Management has estimated there are approximately 24,000 non-profit organisations if one includes schools, trade unions, local Tidy Towns committees and so forth.  Many of these smaller organisations will not be incorporated or have any corporate status.  This is unsatisfactory, as is the fact that charities can be set up in several ways.  The only effective State regulation is through Revenue when these organisations apply for charitable status, the CHY reference number.  However, this means there is no ongoing monitoring that would be necessary to ensure greater transparency in the financial management of charities.<\/p><p>As other Members have said, I do not mean in any way to impugn the good work charities do.  We must acknowledge, however, this sector employs large numbers of people and in which large amounts of money are involved.  The Irish Nonprofits Knowledge Exchange found recently that non-profit organisations receive between \u20ac5.7 billion and \u20ac6 billion annually and may employ more than 100,000 people.  I am grateful to Ms Patricia Quinn of the Irish Nonprofits Knowledge Exchange for pointing out the cost to the charities sector, and therefore society, of the lack of a uniform regulatory system, compliance with company requirements and so on.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State stated, it is not that charities are non-regulated as they are subject to regulation under the Companies Acts but they are regulated inappropriately and not sufficiently nor effectively.  This is the point of this motion and we look forward to working with the Minister in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900032#MM00400","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1348074300,"counter":200,"content":"<p>While I do not wish to repeat what other Members have stated, I extend my support to the commencement of all the provisions set out in the Charities Act 2009.  Having been passed into law in February 2009, it is imperative that we wait no longer and that all aspects of the Act be put into practice so that proper regulation and accountability in the sector can be enforced.  The charities sector needs to be more open and transparent while we need to protect our society against rogue charitable organisations undoing the great work of well run and well organised non-profit organisations.  With full implementation, we will enhance public trust and confidence in charities which is so important as many charities have seen a marked decrease in monetary support for several years.  The good, hard-working charities need to move on and concentrate on doing what they do best, namely, assisting and supporting so many people locally, nationally and internationally.<\/p><p>The workforce, as Senator Bacik said, is large, with the sector employing over 100,000 people, three quarters of whom are women, as well as involving over 560,000 volunteers.  It needs to be protected, nurtured and supported.  One way this can be done is by commencing the full regulations set out in the Charities Act.  Non-profit organisations are a supplementary means of delivering a wide variety of public services in health, social services, education and emergency relief.  They create an untold amount of public good in culture, recreation, social justice, civil and human rights.  The sector deserves full commencement of the Charities Act 2009 so that the public\u2019s trust can be maintained.

The work is unquantifiable in monetary terms and it is often said that much of this community and voluntary work, such as the work done by carers, saves the State much money.  We need to recognise the work done by this sector at every level.<\/p><p>I thank Mr. Ivan Cooper of The Wheel, the umbrella organisation for the charitable and non-profit sectors, for kindly providing information on this issue which illustrates the significant contribution made by the charity sector.  In 2009, there were at least 11,700 organisations employing over 100,000 people as well as involving over 560,000 volunteers and managing a turnover of \u20ac5.75 billion.<\/p><p>Sinn F\u00e9in has long supported the need to have charities registered.  The 2009 Act, long promised and overdue, was widely welcomed by community and voluntary organisations when it was introduced.  Until then the charities sector was largely unregulated.  It is in the interest of charitable organisations to have proper regulation of the sector.  The establishment of a charities regulatory authority is necessary as is the fact charities would be obliged to register.  This is vital to ensure accountability and to protect against the abuse of tax-related exemptions granted to charities or fraud by those purporting to be charities.  The sector itself also wants this.<\/p><p>Sinn F\u00e9in would amend the Charities Act to provide for the recognition of human rights promotion as a charitable activity.  The Act was passed into law in February 2009 but it still has not been brought fully into effect.   Earlier in the year my colleague in the Lower House, Deputy P\u00e1draig Mac Lochlainn, queried why the legislation has not yet been implemented.<\/p> <p>Those sections that require charities to provide financial information to a new charities regulatory authority, which will, in turn, make such information available to the public, have not yet been commenced.  This motion arises from the view of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, that it is not possible to proceed with the full implementation of the Act for financial reasons and that it should be deferred.  This is deeply regrettable.  I commend the Labour Party Senators for introducing this motion.  I call on the Government to implement this legislation in full.<\/p><p>The full regulation of charities will bring a high level of accountability and transparency to all aspects of the work of charities, including their advocacy work.  This is needed by the charitable and non-profit sector.  Mr. Ivan Cooper has highlighted the financial difficulties currently being faced by many charities.  Almost 60% of charitable organisations have experienced a decrease in income over the past three years.  In 60% of those cases, there has been a decrease in income of between 11% and 25%.  I hope the Minister of State will agree this is very significant.  Many organisations are not fully aware of the ramifications of the Charities Act 2009.  Some 20% of non-profitable organisations continue to be unaware of the existence of that legislation.  Just 60% of those organisations that are aware of it are prepared for its requirements.  The awareness of the need to prepare a statement of guiding principles for fundraising is split three ways, with 37.2% of organisations indicating that they are aware of it and 32.6% not aware of it.  The remaining 30% of organisations do not raise funds directly from the public.  These organisations are held in high esteem by us all and by the community.  If they are not properly regulated, that trust will be undermined.  A small minority may abuse this system.  We owe it to the charity sector not to allow this to happen and to regulate to that effect.<\/p><p>I will conclude by making a few brief remarks about charity.  We all accept that charity is necessary.  We all accept that charities do good work.  Many charitable organisations would make the point that as a consequence of the policies that are currently being pursued in this country, they are having to fill gaps in order to meet the social and economic needs of many citizens.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul, for example, helps some of the poorest people in our society, including those who do not receive the supports from the State that many of us believe they should get.  While it is important to have a strong charity sector and for people to make private contributions, it is critically important that charities are not having to fill gaps in the provision of services needed by people that should be filled by the State.  It needs to be clearly and robustly stated that the test of any republic is how it treats its citizens, including its most vulnerable citizens.  The key responsibility of any state is to vindicate the rights of its citizens.  That should be what a government and a state do.  We know that the charity sector has stepped into the vanguard by providing services in cases where rights are not being vindicated.  We are familiar with the significant work they do.  Obviously, we want to limit the need for people to avail of charity in the first place.  That cannot happen in the absence of good social planning and good economic policies, such as progressive taxation.  It is critically important that the charity sector is supported.  It will always play an important role in society, regardless of the economic model being implemented by the Government of the day.  For that reason, it needs to be properly regulated.  That is why we support the Private Members' Bill that has been tabled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900032#MM00600","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348074900,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and the visitors to the House.  I commend those who have proposed this important motion.  It is important for us to continue to implement the Charities Act 2009.  I commend the previous Government for introducing it.  As the Minister of State said, however, just five sections of it have been activated.  Much more of the Act needs to be implemented.  The aim of the Act is to achieve a public benefit.  As we know, the charitable sector has an important role to play in our society.  The 2009 Act defines a \"charitable purpose\" as \"the prevention or relief of poverty or economic hardship\" or \"the advancement of education\".  The thousands of different charitable groups in this country are doing a multitude of works.  One of the objectives of the 2009 Act is to enhance \"public trust and confidence\" in charities.  One of the ways of accomplishing this objective is to increase transparency and accountability in the sector.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State said, certain sections of the 2009 Act have not been commenced.  The essential point, as she noted, is the resource implications of further advancements in this regard.  It is like the chicken and the egg.  The regulations said that a regulatory authority should be established; and the Act cannot be implemented without such an authority being established.  The way the Act was drawn up means we have to find a way of doing much of the work that should be done, in line with the spirit of the Act, in the absence of a regulatory authority.  I ask the Minister of State to consider how that might be done.  As she said, it is a deferral rather than a cancellation.  How long will it be deferred for?  We should be doing something in the meantime.  This deferral should not obscure the pivotal role of the charity sector itself in increasing transparency and accountability.  It is self-evident that the remuneration packages should be made public, for example.<\/p><p>There is clear potential for voluntary codes to play a constructive role in advancing transparency and accountability.  I know the voluntary sector is very active in providing that transparency voluntarily.  A statement of guiding principles for charitable fund-raising has been developed by the Irish Charities Tax Research group.  The Minister of State should examine how the existing voluntary code of principles and practices can be enhanced.  Perhaps it could be amended to make it more user-friendly and to entice more charities to sign up to it.  There might be a case for introducing regulations or legislation to make more charities register with the voluntary guiding principles.  Perhaps the provision of funding could depend on registration with the voluntary guiding principles.  That might be a tiny step forward.  The Act provides a comprehensive statutory regulatory framework for Irish charities.  The commendable drafting of the original Bill and passage of the eventual Act coincided with a time of extraordinary growth in the economy.  We do not have the economy we had at that time.  I suppose I understand why the Minister of State has suggested we need to cut our cloth according to size.  Given that there are two ways to skin a cat, however, perhaps we should consider strengthening the voluntary element of the regime in the meantime.<\/p><p>I do not know if the Senators who proposed the motion have costed the whole thing.  I would not expect them to have done so because as Senators, we do not have the requisite research facilities.  The Department should examine what it would cost.  It might not cost that much.  The establishment of another quango - the regulatory body - might concern some people.  As Senator Bacik said, however, it might be possible for staff from other bodies to be transferred to the regulatory body to allow it to do its work.  The dedicated regulation of Irish charities would be a welcome development.  Charities provide many important services.  There is a huge social dividend from what is done by Irish charities and their thousands of volunteers.  At a time when there is a great deal of discussion on the remuneration that is paid to people, we should be commending the charities' volunteers who give so generously of their time.  I have come across many of them during my time in public life.  I was a director of a charity - the South Dublin Pakistan Earthquake Appeal - that is now closed down.  It is not easy to set up a charity.  One has to go through hoops in order to meet the regulations laid down by the registration office, etc.  I thank Mr. John Ellis and Ms Geraldine Brogan who worked tirelessly on registration and compliance.  Many people err on the side of caution by going over and above what they have to do to comply with the Act.  The Act has been implemented in full by many charities that are not required to do so.  We have to examine those charities that have not done so.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to reflect on the governance of the whole charitable sector in Ireland, which is an issue that was raised by Senator Quinn.  There is a great deal of duplication of charitable exercises in this country.  Perhaps people are running around the wheel backwards and meeting each other coming forward.  They might be doing the same thing without doing it in the most effective and efficient way.  Barnardos, which is a great organisation, had to shut down for a week because of a funding shortfall.  Are there other charities that might have to do the same thing?  We should not think that charities are not worthwhile.  They are significant.  We should consider how we can eliminate duplication in cases where seven, eight or nine charities are doing the same thing.  Each of them has to furnish its office and employ its staff.  I accept that the good people in question are committed and I appreciate that each charity was established for a specific reason.  As the Cathaoirleach is looking at me, I will conclude by saying that the charitable sector is close to my heart.  Those involved in it have to be commended for the work they are doing, much of which is voluntary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900033#NN00200","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1348075500,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and hope she enjoyed her summer break.  I would also like to welcome our guests.<\/p><p>As other speakers have said, charitable organisations do fantastic work in this country and have been doing so for years.  We have all bought into the concept of charity work.  Personally, I have been involved in various organisations since I was a child.  Unlike Senator Whelan, I even had my head shaved for charity on one occasion.  There is anecdotal evidence, however, that charities are setting up overnight, functioning for very short periods of time and disappearing again without any accountability or governance.  <\/p><p>I wish to focus on the area of voluntary housing and its charitable status.  Currently there are 700 voluntary housing bodies in this country which have, so far, built 25,000 housing units.  These bodies have overseen housing developments of between 20 and 3,000 units.  In 2012, funding for capital schemes was \u20ac70.7 million, which is a serious amount of money in one year.  The figures for annual rental from the tenants of these voluntary housing units are not known.  That is an area of governance that concerns me greatly.  <\/p><p>Many of these organisations are limited companies with charitable status but we need to put a regulatory framework in place for this sector.  Any regulation is voluntary.  This situation must be improved.  In March this year, Deputy Bernard Durkan raised the issue of governance with the Minister of State at the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, in the Lower House.  Her response on that occasion was that efforts were afoot to develop key governance and management structures to facilitate the expansion of the remit of these organisations and to provide independent scrutiny and validation of such bodies and their competences.  <\/p><p>A voluntary survey was carried out in 2009 of all of the voluntary housing bodies in the country for the purpose of examining the governance structures that were in place at the time but, unfortunately, only 18% of the organisations participated.  That survey showed that there were high levels of corporate governance in relation to meeting procedures, the appointment of directors, the preparation of accounts and so forth.  However, there was also evidence, in some cases, of infrequent meetings and poor information flow to the directors and trustees which did not assist them in making proper decisions within the organisations.  Obviously, there is great scope for supervision of this sector in terms of good governance and so forth.  <\/p><p>As outlined by previous speakers, the implementation of the legislation that was enacted originally by a Fianna F\u00e1il Government in 2009 is essential.  Senator Whelan has suggested that perhaps we are being penny-wise and pound-foolish in this instance.  I fully support that view.  There has been much negative commentary in some quarters about the Croke Park agreement but that agreement has been positive on a number of fronts.  It has shown the ability of public sector workers to work more efficiently with fewer people, to save money, to transfer from one section to another and so forth.  The agreement has shown that many things can be done despite the massive decrease in the number of public sector staff.  Surely it would not be beyond the scope of the current Government to find some mechanism within the Croke Park agreement to free up staff in order to set up the regulatory body that is necessary to ensure the implementation of the legislation.<\/p><p>I commend my colleagues, Senators Higgins and Whelan, for initiating this motion within the Labour Party group and I am happy to support it fully.  I have a specific interest in the voluntary housing sector and am grateful for the opportunity to discuss it here.  I hope the Minister of State will bring the message from here to the line Minister involved that we want to see the legislation implemented as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900034#OO00200","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1348075500,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and those in the Visitors Gallery.  I also commend my colleagues, Senators Higgins and Whelan, for proposing this motion, which has been soundly supported by all Members of the House.<\/p><p>In an ideal world, charities would not exist but in almost every town and village throughout the world, there is a small charity set up for the purpose of helping people who are less well off.  As well as that, there is a social side to it for those communities who get together and do something for themselves.  I recently read that in the last 30 years the London Marathon had raised over \u00a3500 million and possibly more, given that some funds were not recorded.  There is a two-way street there whereby people get involved in walking or jogging and participate in a community event while also delivering funding to various charitable organisations.  In an ideal world, as I have said, none of us would need to help charities, but we do.  When people donate to charities they feel it is a more direct way of helping than, for example, paying more tax in the community and that tax being directed to various charities.  <\/p><p>People involved in charities know how difficult it is to raise money in a recession.  As a director of the Simon Community in the north west, I learned how difficult it is to set up a charity.  I did not realise how long it took for a charity like Simon to set up in an area, between regulation, setting up a company and so forth.  Any money collected in a charity is well spent.  There are so many small charities throughout the country that are running very hard to stand still.  In these difficult economic times they are suffering much more than others.<\/p><p>Senator Noone said she was not in favour of the chuggers but we are all chuggers in this House.  We could be called political chuggers.  I have no problem with the chuggers on the street because when I look at them I think they could be my son or my daughter and they are working hard to collect money, mostly through the setting up of direct debits.  Generally they are friendly and they are doing a job that nobody else wants to do.  If they get paid for it, good luck to them because if they convince somebody to set up a direct debit, the money is much easier to collect than going to a donor's door every year.  I would not criticise chuggers.  Sometimes they might get in my way but what they do is no worse than knocking on doors during a general election campaign.  In fact, we would be more badly received than the chuggers.  Chuggers should keep going and work as hard as they can.  It is not an easy job to collect money or to look for votes.<\/p><p>Lately I have noticed - I am sure others have too - charity organisations or sports clubs with collection buckets at traffic lights or roundabouts.  I have no problem with that because those involved are doing it in good faith.  However, in other countries, the box or receptacle for the money is actually a sealed pouch where the money goes in and is locked and can only be opened by the charities.  It is a massive temptation to have buckets of money floating around anywhere, whether coins or notes.  I tend to empty my pockets of change into the buckets and am delighted to do it.  However, I am wary of the temptation that such collection methods represent.  It was in France or Germany that I saw the sealed receptacles which would make people feel more secure about giving money.  I am sure the charities also felt more secure because they knew that the people donating their money could be assured that their money was going directly to the charity.  That option should be considered here.<\/p><p>The thrust of the motion is that we must get more regulation.  Senator Whelan referred to the fact that there are 7,000 registered charities in this country, which is a very large number.  I do not know how many are operating profitably.<\/p> <p>We do not want to reach a point at which charities are funding themselves and the money does not leave the charities as they may be trying to secure jobs that have been set up.  All the money collected should go to the cause specified on the box or ticket.  At the same time, there is a realistic expectation that it costs money to collect efficiently.  The more efficient the organisations that run charities the better, but we have to play our part in regulation.  That the Act has not been implemented for budgetary reasons is not a good excuse and the charities we represent today are waiting for us to do the job.  I look forward to hearing the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, say when it will be implemented because it is important for all charities.  As we are all in the political chugging game, I have no problem with charitable chuggers.  Good luck to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900034#OO00300","speaker":"1144","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348076100,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I do not want to over-egg the pudding or delay proceedings any longer than is needed.

The charity sector, the Seanad and the Minister are at one on this matter.  We are preaching to the converted.  <\/p><p>I am heartened by the intent of the response from the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, that a regulatory authority will be established and that we are only discussing the timeframe.  We have made a persuasive case that there should be no undue delay.  While it has been said that the delay is on cost grounds, I believe that is a false economy.  If the Government says we cannot afford to establish the regulatory authority at this juncture, I suggest we cannot afford not to because the sector needs the authority to underpin its good faith and trust with the public.<\/p><p>I thank colleagues for their constructive contributions.  The entire burden of establishing the regulatory authority and the regulator's office should not fall on the charitable sector, which is already hard-pressed to make ends meet, raise funds and provide services.  It is in the State's interest to ensure we get the best value for money, and therein lies a solution.  The regulatory authority could be co-funded, with the State playing its role - in the interests of the taxpayer and of ensuring value for money - by providing some resources to establish the authority.  Perhaps the sector could put its best foot forward and through a levy or registration charge co-fund a cost-effective and cost-neutral regulatory authority.  It is vital that the charitable and voluntary sector nurture and retain public trust and confidence, because if this is lost, as Senator Harte said, it would be difficult to restore and there would be a slippery slope to cynicism.<\/p><p>Senator Feargal Quinn mentioned the American website Charity Navigator, which states that under international best practice it is possible to achieve a level of administration and salary costs to the tune of 10% of the turnover of the organisation.  That is the benchmark we should strive to achieve.  In some instances, small as the organisation may be, there is evidence that the cost of administration is significantly higher, perhaps in excess of half of what the organisations spends.  That is not acceptable.<\/p><p>I will go off-script to mention an issue that has occurred to me, for which I may not be thanked in some quarters.  We make such a play, particularly in the Labour Party, of the need to separate church and State; it is high time political parties stopped conducting church-gate collections.  It is hypocritical of them.  They should leave that space, particularly at this time, to the charitable and voluntary sector.  If one preaches separation of church and State one should practise it.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for her constructive response.  I thank my colleagues for their support and I am grateful for the constructive contributions from all sides of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900035#PP00200","speaker":"1143"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1348076100,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1348076100,"counter":209,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900035#PP00400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1348076100,"counter":210,"content":"<p>At 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20 September 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900035#PP00500","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Adjournment Matters","time":1348076100,"counter":211,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900035#PP00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","time":1348076100,"counter":212,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900035#PP00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1348076100,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Shane McEntee, to the House.<\/p><p>The matter I wish to raise concerns the need for the Minister for Education and Skills to review the band rating for the proposed new accommodation for Scoil Mhuire primary school, Clarinbridge, County Galway, consistent with prior agreement given in 2007.<\/p> <p>Five of the local primary schools were classified at the time as being at the same stage.  These other primary schools have all advanced, but this school has not, which has caused much grief for the principal, board of management, parents and children.<\/p><p>To provide the background for the Minister of State, Scoil Mhuire is a ten-classroom school catering for 272 children in the Clarinbridge area.  It has six portakabins on site, some of which are 11 years old.  During the summer the porch fell off two of them, while the floor fell out of one of them.  They are deteriorating by the day, as is apparent from the description of recent damage.  In addition, there are five internal classrooms which date back to 1959.  They are mostly small without en suite toilet facilities.  They are becoming unsuitable for the delivery of the revised curriculum, given the need for space for active teaching methods, as is acknowledged in the whole school evaluation that took place last January.  The main recommendation made in the report by the inspectors which I have to hand concerned the need for permission for a new school to be granted.  No recommendation was made on curricula, methodology and parental involvement, other than on the need for a new school.<\/p><p>The school first lodged an application for new accommodation in 2001.  Following various surveys and communication with the Department, a new school building was approved five years ago in April 2007, prior to the election.  A meeting was called at the time which was also attended by representatives of the other five local primary schools.  However, the project for Clarinbridge national school did not proceed to architectural planning, unlike the projects for the five neighbouring schools in similar circumstances.  The school has been informed since that it remains on the band rating of 2.1.  It is a source of grievance to the school that the other schools that were at the same stage at the time - I have the names and can give them to the Minister of State - have all moved to the band rating of 1.1.  <\/p><p>Those involved in Scoil Mhuire are magnanimous and reasonable.  They do not expect to be included in the current capital programme, although obviously everyone would like to be, as they understand the financial constraints within which we operate.  However, come 2016, when the current approved capital programme runs out, they want to be included in the next programme.  To be sure of this the school needs to have a band rating of 1.1.  They feel aggrieved and the core issue is fairness.  They have put the question many times in the past five years as to why the other schools, some of which have less need, that were on the same band level in 2007 have moved to the band rating of 1.1 and Scoil Mhuire has not.<\/p><p>I do not yet know what the response of the Minister of State will be, but I put the question formally a year ago to Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Foghl\u00fa before he became the new Secretary General in the Department.  The school has put the question many times and been dissatisfied on each occasion with the response.  I urge the Minister of State to advise me on how I should proceed if the school is not satisfied with today's response.  Perhaps we might arrange a special meeting to ensure the matter is resolved.<\/p><p>The whole school evaluation report, dated January 2012, recommended that the board pursue with all vigour the further upgrading of accommodation facilities.  In particular, it recommended that the board review as a matter of urgency the accommodation arrangements for pupils with special educational needs.  Every time the principal, Mr. Holian, goes to the Department to speak about the deteriorating state of the prefabs the Department indicates it will replace through the emergency grants scheme any purchased portakabin that falls apart and that it will continue to fund the rented portakabins, in addition to new ones to meet special needs.  The principal wants to know whether anyone in the Department recognises the incredible waste such a policy yields in a poor, temporary and unhealthy standard of classroom for pupils and staff on a daily basis.  He believes it is time to stop and rethink the approach.  In fairness to the Minister for Education and Skills, he has started a policy of replacing single prefabs with a permanent building.  However, a school such as Scoil Mhuire that has five to six prefabs seems to be left in the lurch.  The core issue is the band rating and how we can advance it in order that the school will be ready in 2016 and 2017.  I look forward to the response of the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900035#PP00800","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348076700,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

There are four band ratings, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and band 4 the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on the Department's website on <i>education.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>  The board of management sought a review of the band rating on a number of occasions and more recently sought a further review as it remains of the view that the band rating should be 1.1.  The main criterion which applies to a band 1.1 project is that the school is serving a rapidly developing area where either there is no existing school or where the existing provision is unable to meet the demand for places.  The application for Scoil Mhuire does not meet the band 1.1 criterion and, having considered the matter, it is deemed that the band rating of 2.1 is still applicable.  The school was advised of the outcome of the most recent review earlier this month.<\/p><p>  The Senator may find it helpful if I set out the context within which the accommodation needs of schools must be considered in the future.  Total enrolment is expected to grow by approximately 70,000 students between now and 2018 - by more than 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post-primary level.  Second level enrolment is expected to continue to rise until at least 2024.  The five year programme which the Minister announced earlier this year will provide more than 100,000 permanent school places, of which more than 80,000 will be new school places.  The remainder will involve the replacement of temporary or unsatisfactory accommodation.  To ensure every child has access to a school place, the delivery of projects to meet the increasing demographic demands will be the main focus for capital investment over the duration of the plan, in particular in those areas where it has been identified that most demographic growth will be concentrated.  While Scoil Mhuire has experienced growth in pupil numbers since the application was submitted in 2000, the level of growth is not considered significant in the context of the projected numbers outlined above and it is in that context that the project has not been included in the five year plan.  Given the scale of demand for capital investment to meet demographic growth, it has not been possible to appoint design teams for all projects announced in April 2007.  An indicative timeframe for the progression of the project for Scoil Mhuire cannot be given at this time.<\/p><p>  Recently the school advised the Department that it had temporary accommodation that was in poor condition.  The Department has advised the school that it would be prepared to consider an application from it, should it require additional mainstream or special needs accommodation, or the replacement of temporary accommodation which is beyond its useful life.  I, again, thank the Senator for allowing me the opportunity to outline the position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900036#QQ00400","speaker":"1077"},{"type":"speech","time":1348076700,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I know the school will be disappointed with the answer.

I tabled this Adjournment matter before the unfortunate and tragic events in Hillsborough at the weekend.  I wrote it and was ready to submit it before the previous term ended.  We often get bulletins and updates from different farming organisations, as I am sure the Minister of State did when he was a Deputy.  I went through one of these bulletins one night in my office and saw that farm accidents had increased by up to 35%, with the number of fatalities on farms also increasing.  That, coupled with an accident that had occurred in County Clare the previous week, prompted me to table this motion in order to give the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, an opportunity to outline what the Government has been doing and its plan or strategy in the matter.  Given the events of the weekend the subject has now become focused.  On my behalf and that of all Members I wish to express my sympathy to the Spence family.  It is unbearable and unthinkable that three members of the one family lost their lives.<\/p><p>We have a responsibility and a role to play in heightening awareness.  Similarly, farm organisations have an important role to play, as do schools and the education system.  I would like to see a working group set up between the Minister of State's Department and the Department of Education and Skills to roll out a one-day awareness campaign in all primary and secondary schools in farming communities throughout the country.  We may have a chance of improving awareness among children, who in turn may have an influence on their parents.  Unfortunately, we are all guilty of bad habits which develop over a lifetime of working.  Perhaps young people have some chance of influencing their parents in terms of improving standards and eliminating bad and dangerous habits.<\/p><p>The Minister of State may not have reflected on this suggestion, but perhaps an interdepartmental working group could be set up, in association with the farming organisations, to try to reverse this trend.  Any loss of life is unacceptable and no life should be lost unnecessarily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900037#RR00300","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1348077300,"counter":223,"content":"<p>The Senator noted he had tabled this motion long before the tragedy of the past week.  I have just returned from the funeral in question.  I believed it was my duty to attend, and not merely as a farmer and person involved in agriculture.<\/p><p>Most accidents of this kind that occurred during the past 12 months have been horrific and cruel; this was a silent one.  We have talked about extending the time allowed for slurry spreading, and we have fought for this and that, but we never mentioned the dangers concerned.  The funeral today had the strongest showing among all the funerals I have attended.  It was a funeral in a different religious tradition but as it went on, and the longer it went on, the stronger people became in their voices and their singing and their support for the family.  It was said of Graham, Noel and Nevin Spence that they &quot;were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.&quot;  Any person from a farming background would know what happened.  They had no chance.<\/p><p>On my way in, I met a man called Sean Reid from Collon in County Louth who, as one involved in the Cookstown dairy service, had built a milking parlour for that family to accommodate 180 cows.  I hope the Senator does not mind me talking about this for a minute, but in my view this is crucial.  He said the Spence family were model farmers - everything on the farm was perfect and done right.  This was the one thing that went wrong.  It appears that earlier in the day the pit had been agitated and, because it was a calm day, the methane gas that had built up over the summer because of the bad weather remained inside the shed all day.  It is a heavier gas than most and when the Spences went in, one by one they were suffocated.  Coming back today I heard on the radio their sister and daughter Emma speak about her family - about her father and brothers, each in turn.  I do not know how she was able to do it but it is something that everybody in this end of the country should listen to at some stage.  It was a fantastic speech by a person who has lost so much.<\/p><p>This subject has not been mentioned in the past 12 months, either in Northern Ireland or in the South.  There have been conferences; I have been at them.  This kind of accident happens every two or three years but we never mention it.  It is our loss and our mistake.  Whether North or South, all the dangers of farming are not laid out.  We can have all the seminars and do all we like but there is no better way than speaking on the radio.  As a Government, we have a responsibility, as do the farming organisations.  Anything to do with farming can be lethal - it all depends on how one treats it.<\/p><p>It was a sad day, yet the people at that service celebrated the lives of those three men.  There was a complete family wipe-out.  There are 180 cows; they can be dried up and that will suffice.  A whole farming community and entire farm is involved.  Mr. Spence started with three cows but now there is nobody left to perform the necessary duties.  I like to think we all pay our respects to the family.  It is appropriate on the day that Senator Conway has raised this matter.<\/p><p>As I see it, we are all late on this question and must take much responsibility for that.  There are issues concerning dry shafts, or PTO shafts, which is serious matter.  Farmers give out about inspections but if one saves a life, one saves a life.  This kind of incident must be shown in posters on walls.  Somebody must come up with a system for it.  A person who does not know about this can walk into death.<\/p><p>Senator Conway is on the relevant committee.  Rather than talking about it, I ask him to raise the matter there.  As one who was involved in road safety issues, I know the incident that happened last weekend is of a type that we had all forgotten about, even though it has happened in many places.  <\/p><p>I will not read out my script.

Sailing was one of the great success stories for Ireland in the London Olympic Games, with eight Irish competitors taking part.<\/p> <p>Annalise Murphy, a 22-year-old student, put in the best performance of the lot.  Indeed, she put in the best performance for an Irish sailor since the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games.<\/p><p>I raise this issue with the Minister to put the proposition to him that it would be great if the legacy of that success this summer was a Government commitment to help open up access to the sport of sailing to ensure more men and women of all backgrounds can take part.  <\/p><p>Sailing is a fantastic sport, one of the few in which the breakdown between male and female competitors can be quite even.  It is a sport in which people of all ages can take part.  One can be just as successful participating in one's 60s as one can at 16 and people of all ages can compete against each other.  <\/p><p>Sutton Dinghy Club in my constituency of Dublin Bay north has submitted an application for this year's sports capital grants.  I take the opportunity to draw the Minister of State's attention to the fact that the club has been working hard over a long time to open up access to the sport of sailing.  It is a sport that can often be seen as elitist or difficult to break into if one does not have a high income.  The cost of equipment in terms of having a boat is very high and some clubs have expensive joining fees and membership fees, which can be off-putting, but Sutton Dinghy Club has made a point of trying to keep access to the sport as affordable as possible.  It does not charge an entry fee and it has made an effort to keep the annual membership fee as low as it can, particularly for children.  It provides a wide range of courses for non-members and last year more non-members than members - 1,200 people of all ages - took part in its training courses.  Groups that have used the club include the local schools, the Ballymun Women's Resource Centre, the Central Remedial Clinic, Pearse Street Night Time Tours drugs awareness group, and Youthreach programmes, to name just five.  The Minister will be aware from that mix of groups that it caters for people who are trying to overcome drug problems, people with disabilities and those who have dropped out of school.  They are using the sport of sailing to give those people an opportunity to take part in a sport, exercise and enjoy themselves, which they would not have done otherwise.<\/p><p>The success of the club's training programmes, in terms of the number of non-members it can bring through, is largely based on the fact that over the years it has acquired sailing boats for the club.  This ensures that boats are on-site to enable those who want to do training courses to complete the Irish Sailing Association level 1 and 2 courses without the need for any equipment of their own and the course fees are quite low.  Its problem, however, is that it does not have the boats it needs to enable people do courses of level 3 and above.  Its application for the sports capital grant is to secure the funding it needs to buy boats to enable people to do such courses.  If funding is granted it will be of benefit to the entire local community and to a wide range of socioeconomic groups in different clubs, as I have mentioned, as well as to men and women equally, which is something the Department has tried to incentivise in previous years through the women in sport initiative and through prioritising applications from clubs promoting equal access to sport for women.<\/p><p>I am glad to have the opportunity to draw the Minister's attention to the club's application.  I am aware he has hundreds of them on his desk from people across the country.  I appreciate that resources are limited but the club is seeking only \u20ac25,000, which is a reasonable amount, but one that will make a difference in that it will open up access to a sport in which many people would not otherwise have an opportunity to partake.  I hope the legacy of the success we had in sailing this year will inspire the Minister to take this opportunity to open up access to the sport to ensure more people can enjoy sailing and compete for us in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900037#RR00800","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348077900,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Before I give the Senator the official response, I want to say that my heart is with her on this issue and I will give her an example in that regard.

It is an area that would not have the wealth of many other areas in the county or the country, yet a man has set up an organisation in Bellacragher which is involved in the activity about which the Senator spoke.  He has second-hand boats and great support from the national sailing federation.

I have asked the Irish Sports Council to review the Olympics and the Paralympics to determine where we did well, where we could do better and where our strengths lie, particularly in the high performance areas.  We need to target those areas.  People talk about how well we did in boxing.  The reason we did well is that the Government put money into the high performance areas.  In all the other events, the Government has put money into high performance areas and it has worked very well.<\/p><p>I will give the remainder of my reply and if the Senator has any questions following that I will try to answer them.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  Senators will be aware that the sports capital programme is the main channel of Government support for developing sports facilities and purchasing sports equipment for sports clubs and organisations across Ireland.  This programme aims to foster an integrated and planned approach to developing sports and physical recreation facilities throughout the country.  In particular, its objectives are to assist voluntary and community organisations, national governing bodies of sport, vocational education committees and local authorities in developing high quality, safe, well designed and sustainable facilities in appropriate locations and in providing appropriate equipment to help maximise participation in sport and physical recreation; to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports facilities; and to encourage multi-purpose use of local, regional and national sports facilities by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport.<\/p><p>On 28 March this year I launched the first round of the sports capital programme for four years.  The launch of the first round of the programme since 2008 demonstrates the Government's commitment to encouraging more people to take part in sport.  Every pitch drained, every sports hall refurbished and every piece of equipment purchased allows more people to participate in sport to their maximum potential.<\/p><p>The deadline for applications has passed and my problem is that 2,350 applications have been received, seeking almost \u20ac230 million in funding.  Only \u20ac30 million is available for allocations under this round of the programme.  It is clear that the level of demand for grants far outstrips supply.  This shows great enthusiasm for the sports capital programme, but it means we will be able to allocate only a fraction of the funding sought.  It also means that the assessment process is particularly difficult and it will be much later in the year before we are in a position to announce the allocations being made under this round of the programme.  It is beyond doubt that assessment of the applications is a very difficult task.  That has always been the case, but this year it will be more difficult than ever.  This is the first round of the sports capital programme since 2008 and clubs and community groups have been waiting for this moment with much anticipation.<\/p><p>In every parish in every county there are people giving their time and energy to sporting activities and many of them are working very hard to provide or improve facilities that are fit for purpose and accessible.  We would love to support every deserving project, but the harsh reality of life is that there are limits to what we can do.  That is the reason expectations have to be realistic.  The outcome of this process is that there is a huge demand for funding and while it is great to have secured funding of \u20ac30 million, when that funding is allocated there will be a large number of disappointed applicants.  That is the problem with which we are faced.<\/p><p>Regarding the application referred to by the Senator, the position, as with all other applications, is that there is a process under way whereby the applications are being assessed by departmental officials against assessment criteria.  The process aims to target the projects with the most merit while also achieving a geographical spread of funding, as well as a fair spread of funding across different sports.  I want to ensure the funding goes across all sports.  When the assessment process is completed later in the year, the assessments will be submitted for ministerial approval.  That was also the process in previous years.  In that context, it would be inappropriate to comment on the merits or otherwise of any one particular application.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900038#SS00400","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1348078500,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and unscripted remarks.

I appreciate the fact that he is present to deal with this matter which relates to Sutton Dinghy Club and hope he will consider favourably the club's application which meets all of the criteria relating to disadvantage and equal gender access to sport, etc.  He referred to the need to spread resources around.  In that context, I am sure he will have many applications from other sports but not that many from sailing.

I cannot comment on the particular application to which she refers, but given that she asked an honest question, I will give her an honest answer.  As we have received 2,350 applications, the assessment process is going to take somewhat longer to complete.  A management board meeting is to take place tomorrow and I have already given the Senator information that I will be imparting to the management board when I meet its members.  The position is that we are hoping to be ready to proceed by the middle of November.  I want the allocations to be issued by the end of that month because this will give clubs an opportunity to begin planning for the works they wish to carry out in 2013.  That is the up-to-date position.  The decrease in staff numbers in my Department has also lengthened the applications assessment process.

The three main sports always seem to do better.  That is natural enough because they have more organisations and clubs.  However, we must also consider the position of minority sports.

If he had been in west Waterford during the month of August, he would, in the aftermath of the heavy rainfall, have needed a boat to make his way around certain parts of the area.  This matter relates to the impact of said rainfall on the roads in west Waterford.<\/p><p>On 12 August extensive damage was caused to roads in the Lismore electoral area and west Waterford in general.  Over 40 millimetres of rain fell in a four hour period and this resulted in roads being washed away, mudslides, debris being washed onto roads and extensive surface damage on many local roads.  As the Minister of State will appreciate, there was heavy rainfall for the remainder of August and it continued into the early days of this month.  This led to the problem being exacerbated.  Waterford County Council estimates that the cost of repairing the damage will be \u20ac2.5 million.  It has written to the National Roads Authority and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport seeking assistance in repairing the damage.  The National Roads Authority has advised that it has no additional funding available and that the council should reallocate its specific improvement grants.  In fact, the council has already done this, but it only enabled it to free up \u20ac600,000.  That amount will only allow it to repair a small number of the roads on which work will be required.<\/p><p>I am aware that many roads throughout the country, even those in the Minister of State's constituency, require repair.  However, in this instance, I am referring to serious damage that has been done to many local roads, a  large number of which remain unusable and those who live on them are badly affected because there are often no alternative routes for them to take.<\/p><p>As stated, the estimated cost of the repairs is \u20ac2.5 million.  Waterford County Council has submitted to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport an extensive list of the roads involved, the nature of the repairs which must be carried out and the cost of these repairs.  I have a copy of the list in my possession and can give it to the Minister of State if he so desires.  It shows that the county council has already assessed repairs requiring the allocation of \u20ac1.8 million, \u20ac1.3 million of which relates to repairs on local primary roads.  As stated, many such roads are currently impassable.  The council simply does not have the means available to it to carry out the necessary repairs.  Like other local authorities, its budget has been continually cut during the past four years.  In addition, road maintenance grants have been cut in the past four or five budgets.<\/p><p>Many of the roads in County Waterford to which I refer are in a bad state of repair.  The director of services with responsibility for roads in the county is very concerned that if the repairs are not carried out now, the cost of making them next year will be much higher.  The State would actually save money if the necessary funding was made available now to allow the roads to be repaired.  Remediation works should be carried out now because otherwise some of the roads to which I refer will be either washed away completely or will decay into an even worse state of repair.  This is a serious issue which must be addressed.<\/p><p>It is unusual for very senior officials of local authorities to lobby Oireachtas Members and other elected representatives.  Those in County Waterford have gone to that extraordinary length as a result of the serious nature of the problem.  I ask the Minister of State to give genuine consideration to this matter and ascertain whether extra funding might be made available for the repair of the roads to which I refer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900039#TT00500","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1348078500,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this very important and serious issue in his constituency.  I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to address it in the House.<\/p><p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads are the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on these roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants paid by my Department.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for local authorities.  The Minister announced regional and local road grant allocations for the current year on 30 January last.  A total of \u20ac376 million is being provided under the regional and local roads investment programme this year.  From that allocation, Waterford County Council is being provided with over \u20ac9 million.  The level of grants allocated to individual local authorities is determined having regard to a number of factors.  These include the total funds available in a particular year; eligibility criteria for the different road grant schemes; road pavement conditions; length of road network; the need to prioritise projects; and competing demands from other local authorities.  In determining the annual grant allocations, the overall objective remains to supplement the resources provided by each local authority in a fair and appropriate manner.<\/p><p>Last month Waterford County Council wrote to the Department seeking additional funding of \u20ac2.5 million for the repair of roads in the Lismore area which had been damaged as a result of extensive rain and flooding.  The council was informed that my Department would facilitate any revision it wished to make to its 2012 specific improvement grant allocation in order to accommodate rehabilitation works on roads damaged by the recent bad weather and floods and the deferral to 2013 of less critical works.  The council was also informed that the 2012 regional and local road grants had been fully allocated.  Given the current financial position, there are no further funds available from which an allocation for these works could be made.  It should be noted that the Department's current and capital expenditure is ahead of profile and that it is highly unlikely there will be any savings or unspent funding by the year end.  Capital expenditure is actually \u20ac46 million ahead of profile, while current expenditure is \u20ac48 million ahead of profile.<\/p> <p> Between 2002 and 2012, Waterford County Council spent more than \u20ac168.7 million on regional and local roads.  Of these moneys, 76%, or \u20ac128.2 million, was provided through State grants, with the remaining 24%, or \u20ac40.5 million, coming from the council's own resources.  In view of the current economic difficulties, it is vital that local authorities prioritise increased expenditure from their own resources on their roads programmes.  Each authority must carefully reassess its provision in light of the impact of the weather on road networks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900039#TT00600","speaker":"1074","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348079100,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  The reality, however, is that local authorities will find it very difficult to raise the extra money locally given the constraints on their already limited revenue streams, including rates.  The bottom line is that they require the support of central Government, particularly in respect of their roads programmes.  I accept that the Government has a limited pot of money, but we are dealing here with exceptional circumstances.  Roads have effectively been washed away as a result of unexpected volumes of rainfall.  Local authorities cannot plan for such situations and there is a responsibility on the Department to do what it can to assist them.  Will the Minister of State raise this matter with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport with a view to providing further assistance for Waterford County Council?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900040#UU00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1348079100,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I certainly will bring the difficulties the Senator has outlined to the attention of the Minister and will also raise them at tomorrow's management board meeting.  As the Senator knows, when the allocation for local government is made, there is an expectation that some local authorities will not draw down the full amount and that the surplus arising as a result can be reallocated to those authorities which may require it as a consequence of circumstances such as he has outlined.  As it stands, we are looking at a \u20ac2 million overrun and are hoping that some funding will not be drawn down by other local authorities.  As a member of a local authority for many years, I am in complete agreement with the Senator that there will always be unforeseen events and emergencies.  In Mayo, for example, we often had to deal with floods, landslides and so on.  An option that might be available to Waterford County Council would be to reallocate any funding that has not yet been drawn down for identified roadworks in order to deal with the current crisis.  The departmental officials have confirmed to me that the situation there is very serious, with roads in very poor condition.  I agree that something must be done and will convey that view to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012091900040#UU00300","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1348079100,"counter":242,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 7.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20 September 2012.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
