Ireland is working with our EU colleagues on the new partnership framework for Ethiopia, one of our key partners in Africa, which will draw on all EU policies and instruments to achieve desired results.  Much of Irish Aid&rsquo;s work in Ethiopia addresses poverty and underdevelopment which are amongst the root causes of much of Ethiopia&rsquo;s migration.<\/p><p>Insofar as Afghanistan is concerned, European Union-Afghanistan cooperation in the area of migration is addressed in the <i>Joint Way Forward on Migration<\/i>(JWF), which was signed in Kabul on 2 October this year.  The JWF allows for a high level dialogue between the EU and Afghanistan on migration issues; it is not, however, a formal agreement and creates no legal rights or obligations under international law.<\/p><p>The JWF provides for cooperation in the fight against smuggling and people trafficking, information and awareness raising.  It aims to provide for a &ldquo;smooth, dignified and orderly return&rdquo; of those Afghan nationals who do not fulfil the conditions for remaining in the EU after &ldquo;consideration of all relevant international law and legal procedures&rdquo; and who &ldquo;cannot be granted international protection status&rdquo;.  The JWF further provides for reintegration assistance, and specific humanitarian consideration for vulnerable groups, including women and children. <\/p><p>The EU and the Afghan Government have agreed to implement this in full respect of their existing national, international and UN commitments when considering individual cases, including the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 New York Protocol, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.  This was a key concern for Ireland and I am pleased that the Joint Way Forward makes this commitment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112300103#WRA03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112300103#WRA03900"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[36324\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112300103#WRA04000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has received reports from the Irish embassy in Morocco concerning the recently well publicised death of a fisherman in Hoceima; his views on the police&rsquo;s role in the person's death; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1254","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>I am aware of the tragic death of the fish trader in Hoceima, and the protests the incident sparked.

Notwithstanding the changing political context in the United States, the Government&rsquo;s commitment to these objectives remains constant. <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach availed of his recent separate telephone conversations with President Elect Trump and Vice President Pence to raise our concerns in regard to immigration matters.  The new Administration does not take office until 20 January and the process of considering and announcing nominations to its senior posts is ongoing.  Nevertheless, during the transition period, the Government will avail of all opportunities for contact with the incoming Administration to sensitise them to our concerns and interests in regard to immigration reform, and the the plight of the undocumented in particular. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has raised the issue of immigration reform with US interlocutors &ndash; including at the highest levels &ndash; on many occasions.  It will continue to use high-level visits to and from the US, as well as Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic representation in the United States, to advance these aims.  The Embassy in Washington has worked closely with members of the US Congress - in both the House of Representatives and the US Senate, and on both sides of the aisle &ndash; to advance progress on this matter and will continue to do so.  We are fortunate to be able to draw on the assistance of the Friends of Ireland in Congress and the many representatives of Irish America who share our commitment to immigration reform.<\/p>  <p>  I most recently raised the question of immigration reform, including relief for undocumented Irish citizens in the United States, during my meeting with US Secretary of State, Mr John Kerry, on 30 October.  In September, I had the opportunity to meet Irish community leaders in the United States, to discuss with them the prospects for achieving immigration reform and to reassure them of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the issue.  In addition, Minister of State McHugh met representatives of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers, representing a broad group of Irish centres across the United States, in New York on 20 September.  Last week in Boston, he had further discussions with representatives of Irish immigration centers and raised the issue in formal meetings with the Mayor of Boston and the Governor of Massachusetts. <\/p>  <p>  Conscious of the challenges that may lie ahead, the Government will continue to support, through my Department&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme, the work of the Irish Immigration Centres across the US, who do so much to help undocumented Irish citizens in the US.

In addition, our Ambassador in Washington DC intends to convene a meeting of immigration stakeholders in the Irish-American community in the first half of December.<\/p>  <p>  The Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our Embassy in Washington continue to work closely with Irish-American community leaders in actively pursuing all viable opportunities to advance immigration reform.  A new Administration and a new Congress will take time to settle in.

I am assured by the Commissioner that Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with the overall policing arrangements and operational strategies are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of resources and the best possible policing service is provided to the general public.  I am advised by the Commissioner that as of the 30 September 2016, the latest date which figures are readily available, the strength of the Traffic Corps stood at 688 members. <\/p>  <p>  I have also been advised by the Garda Commissioner that the Assistant Commissioner for Roads Policing and Major Event\/Emergency Management has carried out a review of the current Garda Traffic Corp strength and that this is currently being examined by Garda management in the context of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 which sets key strategic objectives for Roads Policing and will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s road policing plans over the next 5 years<\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  In furtherance of this I recently announced that the Government has approved my proposal for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  No doubt the Traffic Corp, like all Divisions and policing activities will benefit from this accelerated recruitment which is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p>  <p>  Insofar as road traffic enforcement is concerned generally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Roads Policing Operations Plan 2016 incorporates a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies, and is being implemented by each Regional Traffic Superintendent.  The focus of the Plan is on the most vulnerable road user categories of motor cyclists, pedal cyclists, pedestrians and learner permit holders.  Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including speeding, driving while intoxicated, and use of a mobile phone.<\/p>  <p>  Road traffic legislation is also enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both targeted and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.<\/p>  <p>  I have requested the specific information sought by the Deputy from the Garda Commissioner and I will forward this information directly to the Deputy when it is to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112300104#WRB05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Applications","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112300104#WRB05700"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[36582\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112300104#WRB05800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will ensure that a person (details supplied) will be granted citizenship in view of the fact they have been here nearly 14 years.","asker":"1305","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the processing of the application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy is ongoing and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  <\/p><p>It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.

It is important to note that 80% of schools are not oversubscribed. <\/p>  <p>  - The Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion while including provision for single sex schools and denominational schools to reflect, in their admission policy, the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation.  <\/p>  <p>  - The Bill\u00a0includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school's arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction. <\/p>  <p>  - The Bill contains a provision prohibiting the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions for an application for admission to a school or for the enrolment or continued enrolment of a student in a school. <\/p>  <p>  - The Bill also provides for the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) to designate a school for a child with no school place and for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to designate a school for a child who has no school place for reasons related to the child&rsquo;s special educational needs<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112300105#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":144,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[36431\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112300105#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department will publish standard guidelines on opt outing of faith formation in order that all schools can use them as a template and in order that they can be in accordance with the requirement under the Education (Admissions to School) Bill 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[36484\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112300105#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department will publish standard guidelines on opt outing of faith formation in order that all schools can use them as a template in order that they can be in accordance with the requirement under the Education (Admissions to School) Bill 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1243","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 87 together.<\/p>  <p>  Article 44 of the Constitution and Section 30 of the Education Act 1998, provides that parents have a right to have their children opt out of religion classes if they so wish.  The manner in which any school ensures that the right to opt out of religion classes is upheld is a matter for the school concerned. <\/p>  <p>  Each individual school must determine the particular arrangements which are most appropriate in its individual circumstances having regard to local issues such as available space, supervision requirements and how the school concerned organises classes etc. <\/p>  <p>  The Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the primary school sector (2012) recommended steps that could be taken to ensure that the education system can provide a sufficiently diverse number and range of primary schools to cater for children of all religions and none. <\/p>  <p>  A paper, entitled \"Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector: Progress to Date and Future Directions\", which took account of the public consultation, was published in 2014.  The paper outlined good practice and options for promoting diversity in schools in a number of areas, including the right to opt-out of religious classes.<\/p>  <p>  The paper gives an overview of current practice in schools in relation to the right to opt-out of religious classes and acknowledged that each school should arrive at solutions that suit its own particular context and to engage in dialogue with parents about the arrangements to be put in place before the child starts school.  Schools are encouraged to develop their own practices and policies in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently, the Catholic Schools Partnership (2015) developed a resource for Catholic schools entitled &lsquo;Catholic Primary Schools in a Changing Ireland: Sharing Good Practice on Inclusion of All Pupils&rsquo;.  It gives suggestions on developing polices and sharing best practice with regard to inclusion of all pupils, which gives practical suggestions to schools in how to engage positively in inter-cultural dialogue.<\/p>  <p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, which passed second stage on 17 November 2016, also includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school's arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction. <\/p>  <p>  I believe this is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has also been working on draft legislation to provide for replacing the current Section 28 of the Education Act, 1998.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

The policy defines the types of income to be taken into consideration when assessing eligibility for social housing support.

The complexity and cross-cutting nature of global challenges demand a coordinated approach, in particular at the international level.  Ireland&rsquo;s support for a fairer, more just, more secure and more sustainable world through our development programme, human rights policies, peacekeeping, disarmament and security policies, finds expression in our active engagement in the development of the European Union&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy and our participation in the work of the United Nations.  Regional organisations are also playing an ever more important role.<\/p>  <p>  As I have said many times, these crises will continue if the root causes of conflict - political instability, inequality, and poverty in countries of origin - remain unresolved.  Ireland will continue to play its role in responding to crisis and emergency situations, while not ignoring the underlying factors.  Investment in conflict prevention and an increased focus on post-conflict reconciliation and other forms of peacebuilding demonstrate Ireland&rsquo;s more nuanced approach to achieving sustainable peace.<\/p>  <p>  Promoting stability and supporting efforts towards peace and security in parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East continue to require and receive major international attention.  UN-authorised peacekeeping missions have a major role in stabilising former and current conflict zones throughout both regions and in protecting vulnerable populations.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has a long-standing tradition of contributing to UN and EU peace-support missions.  Ireland currently participates in seven UN peacekeeping missions.  The majority of the 548 Irish UN peacekeepers currently deployed overseas are serving at the three UN missions in the Middle East while smaller numbers are deployed to missions in Africa and Eastern Europe.<\/p>  <p>  The EU also takes a leading role in peacekeeping operations, conflict prevention and in the strengthening of international security in support of the United Nations, through the Union&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).  Crisis management missions are established under the CSDP in order to prevent the initiation or renewal of conflict and to help societies or fragile states to recover from violent conflict.  At present, the EU operates 17 CSDP missions across Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been a strong supporter of the Common Security and Defence Policy since its inception.  We currently deploy both military and civilian personnel to a total of 8 CSDP missions across Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.  My Department currently seconds 11 Experts to 6 civilian CSDP missions.<\/p>  <p>  The UN is very active in the area of child soldiers, particularly through the work of the UN Secretary-General&rsquo;s Special Adviser on Children and Armed Conflict, Leila Zerrougui.  Since the launch in March 2014 of the &lsquo;Children, Not Soldiers&rsquo; campaign, significant steps have been taken toward the goal of ending and preventing recruitment of child soldiers. <\/p>  <p>  The United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325, on Women, Peace and Security, and seven subsequent bolstering resolutions, have brought increased focus to issues such as sexual violence in conflict, and women&rsquo;s participation in decision making.  Ireland&rsquo;s second National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security reflects the importance of these issues and has ensured that gender perspectives have been incorporated in Ireland&rsquo;s work in humanitarian and development aid, peace-keeping, post-conflict activities and interventions.<\/p>  <p>  Almost 65 million people are now displaced globally, half of them children, and the great majority of them living in situations of conflict. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to these emergencies, this year the El Ni&ntilde;o effect has also had a significant impact in many countries, most notably in Africa, leading to threats to food security and a spike in humanitarian need.  UN Agencies and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, or CERF, are key in providing humanitarian assistance.  Ireland is currently the eighth largest donor to the CERF.  The EU also has mechanisms to respond to the crises through the European Development Fund and the EU humanitarian budget.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to working with a range of partners including non-governmental and UN organisations, and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.  The development of Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Initiative, established to support the broader Humanitarian Reform Process in 2006, is an operational tool to supplement these efforts.  The Rapid Response Initiative consists of two key elements - the Rapid Response Corps, a roster of highly experienced and specialized personnel for deployment at short notice to emergency situations; and stockpiling, the pre-positioning and transportation of essential relief supplies into crises through the UN Humanitarian Response Depots (UNHRD) network.  Over 350 tonnes of supplies were airlifted into crises so far in 2016, and 37 rapid responders have been deployed as surge capacity to UN partners&rsquo; emergency response operations this year.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland pursues a strategic and comprehensive approach to countries in Africa facing challenging humanitarian, conflict, or human rights situations.  Informed by the Africa Strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and One World, One Future, our policy for international development, this approach encompasses political and diplomatic engagement, humanitarian assistance, support for peacekeeping operations, and development cooperation programming.  Engagement at the international level, in particular through the UN, regional bodies and within the EU, is at the heart of this approach.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to supporting the recovery efforts and successful transition of countries emerging from conflict or significant and protracted humanitarian crises.  The announcement in 2013 that Sierra Leone would become one of Irish Aid&rsquo;s key partner countries is a testament to this commitment.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s total humanitarian assistance to global crises reached some &euro;140 million in 2015, and four of the five countries receiving the largest share of this aid were in Africa. This level of funding will be maintained in 2016, in response to unprecedented levels of humanitarian need.  When the first ever World Humanitarian Summit took place in Istanbul earlier this year, President Higgins, who led the Irish delegation, spoke passionately on Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to humanitarian action.  In addition, my colleague, Minister of State McHugh, made 35 specific commitments on Ireland&rsquo;s behalf to achieving more sustainable and effective humanitarian action. <\/p>  <p>  Disarmament and non-proliferation are a major focus for Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and the issue of illegal and irresponsible transfers of weapons to conflict regions is a very serious one.  For this reason the successful negotiation of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) which aims to end such transfers has been a major focus for Ireland over the last few years and I welcomed its early entry into force in December 2014.  Successful implementation and universalisation of the ATT remain the best means of ensuring that the flow of arms transfers to conflict areas should decrease in the future.  Ireland therefore will continue to prioritize and use every opportunity to advance the ATT and its aims, including in our bilateral contacts.  The ATT is also a priority for the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112300106#WRD05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Peace Process","counter":255,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112300106#WRD05700"},{"type":"question","counter":256,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[36550\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112300106#WRD05800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which ongoing efforts remain to encourage re-engagement in the peace process in the Middle East; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":257,"content":"<p>Ireland remains active and engaged on the objective of trying to achieve a two state solution in the Middle East; few European countries are as consistently engaged on this issue as we are.

Under the delegation, there is\u00a0sanction\u00a0to recruit and promote in grades up to and including Principal Officer or equivalent, subject to remaining within overall pay ceilings, allowing sectors\u00a0to respond to staffing pressures as they arise, including those related to demographics.<\/p>  <p>  The prioritisation of frontline public service provision since the crisis allowed the numbers employed in the education sector to rise to 96,678 (Whole Time\u00a0Equivalents or WTEs) by Q2 2016, an increase of 1,654\u00a0WTEs\u00a0over employment level in the sectors at the end of 2008.\u00a0 Similarly, employment in the Health was back to pre-moratorium levels, at 105,755 WTEs at end Q2 2016.<\/p>  <p>  As far as the\u00a0position in the future is concerned, Table 5\u00a0on page 31\u00a0of Expenditure Report 2017 includes increases in Ministerial Expenditure Ceilings for\u00a02018 and 2019 to meet the cost of certain demographic\u00a0pressures in education, health and social Protection.\u00a0 The specific allocations to particular sectors for 2018 and 2019\u00a0are informed by an analysis carried out by\u00a0the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service\u00a0(IGEES)\u00a0within\u00a0my Department.

The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.

The Company must submit a separate application to extend a treatment to a new cohort of patients.  Each application is considered separately on its merits and in line with the 2013 Act.<\/p><p>In reaching its decision, the HSE examines all the evidence which may be relevant in its view for the decision (including the information \/dossier submitted by the Company) and will take into account such expert opinions and recommendations which may have been sought by the HSE at its sole discretion (for example, from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics). <\/p><p>In considering an application, the HSE will also have regard to Part 1 and Part 3 of Schedule 3 of the 2013 Act.  Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:<\/p><p>1.  the health needs of the public;<\/p><p>2.  the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;<\/p><p>3.  the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;<\/p><p>4.  the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;<\/p><p>5.  the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item; <\/p><p>6.  the clinical need for the item or listed item;<\/p><p>7.  the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;<\/p><p>8.  the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and <\/p><p>9.  the resources available to the HSE. <\/p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Ivacaftor, brand name Kalydeco, for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients aged 2 years and older weighing less than 25kg.  In March of this year the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment of the applicant&rsquo;s economic dossier on the cost effectiveness of this treatment.<\/p><p>The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation in October 2016.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.<\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at<i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> www.broadband.gov.ie <\/font><\/i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area:<\/p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.

The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids.  In addition, bidders need adequate time\u00a0to get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further on timelines at this juncture, given that discussions are on-going in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. <\/p><p>During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline\u00a0to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July,\u00a0I\u00a0established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague\u00a0Minister Humphreys\u00a0to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.

The management of radio spectrum is a statutory function of the independent regulator of the telecommunications sector, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  I understand that licences issued by ComReg impose terms and conditions on mobile network operators &ndash; including minimum population coverage obligations.  ComReg monitors compliance in this regard by means of biannual drive tests.  However, given ComReg&rsquo;s independence, I have no statutory function in the matter of auditing mobile coverage.<\/p>  <p>  I am critically aware of the frustration currently being experienced across Ireland, where mobile networks are not always delivering the services people expect.\u00a0 Mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  The rate of demand for data services has however increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally. <\/p>  <p>  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government, a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  In July, I established the Taskforce, together with Minister Humphreys, which aims to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services.  The Terms of Reference of the Taskforce state that it will identify and recommend practical actions that can be taken to improve mobile reception and broadband access.  The Taskforce has already met sixteen times, with a number of helpful initiatives emerging in the areas of planning, local authority engagement, and consumer information and engagement. <\/p>  <p>  The Taskforce involves Government Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with ComReg and telecoms operators.  I anticipate that we will bring a report to Government next month, on foot of its work.  This report will set out proposed timelines for the prompt delivery of the recommendations and actions.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Programme for Government, Minister Humphreys has also established two regional action groups to work with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies in helping accelerate the rollout of broadband and mobile services at local level. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, to provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. <\/p>  <p>  In my Department's estimates for 2017 I have secured an &euro;8m provision for RT&Eacute; to allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band.\u00a0 ComReg in turn will make plans to auction this spectrum, to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland, and particularly in rural Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  In parallel, the National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland, through private investment and a State intervention in areas where commercial investment have not been fully demonstrated. <\/p>  <p>  The procurement process is underway and the three bidders in the process have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution for rural Ireland.\u00a0 Intensive dialogue with bidders is ongoing, with a view to putting in place contract(s) that will deliver the NBP network and put Ireland to the forefront internationally in terms of connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112300110#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Disposal Charges","counter":508,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112300110#WRH01100"},{"type":"question","counter":509,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[36501\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112300110#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if his Department, or a body under its aegis, has considered any proposals for improving pricing transparency\u00a0in the domestic waste collection sector; and his views on whether the opacity of pricing in the sector has a negative impact on the competition between providers and cost of waste collection for households.","asker":"1217","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":510,"content":"<p>The charges applied by waste management companies are a matter between those companies and their customers, subject to compliance with all applicable environmental and other relevant legislation, including contract and consumer legislation.<\/p>  <p>  A mandatory pay-by-weight charging structure for household waste collection was due to be introduced in mid-2016.

In order to support a user-friendly process, this online system will involve linkages to Revenue and Department of Social Protection IT databases which should enable automated verification of income data and automated approval of applications in a large number of cases.  To facilitate this approach, the income assessment will be based on the most recent available tax year, while the applicant&rsquo;s &lsquo;work\/ study&rsquo; status will be determined by way of self-declaration.

This draft report highlighted concerns in relation to infant mortality and the arrangements for the placement of children during the period when these homes were in operation.  The speculative nature of any conclusions that were being drawn from this initial review was recognised by the author&lsquo;s acknowledgment that the report&rsquo;s findings remained a matter of conjecture until such time as a more forensic examination of the home&rsquo;s records could be undertaken by the HSE. <\/p><p>As these matters were outside the direct remit of the Magdalene Laundries Committee, the HSE advised that these wider concerns would be examined separately by the HSE.  At that time my Department advised the HSE that any findings of concern from this separate process should be appropriately communicated by the HSE.  My Department is not aware of any subsequent reports supplied by the HSE in this regard.<\/p><p>The Department of Children and Youth Affairs became actively involved in responding to the concerns relating to Mother and Baby Homes following the publication of information on the former Bon Secours Home in Tuam around mid-2014.  The then Minister was subsequently tasked by Government with leading its response to these significant matters of public concern and an Inter Departmental Review Group was set up to assist deliberations on the terms of reference of a Commission of Investigation.<\/p><p>The Inter Departmental Group Report on Mother and Baby Homes, published in July 2014, cites a number of reports from relevant authorities which expressed concerns with undesirably high death rates during the times these institutions were in operation.  It also references academic literature which clearly indicates that the role and purpose of these institutions was the subject of attention, report and debate since the early years of the State.  So it is important to avoid suggestions that concerns in relation to mother and baby homes were unknown, or ignored, prior to or since 2012.<\/p><p>This work culminated in the establishment of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related matters in February 2015.  The Commission&rsquo;s terms of reference include specific matters related to infant mortality rates, the reporting and recording of deaths, and arrangements for placing children &ndash; whether in Ireland or abroad.  Importantly, the Commission will examine exit pathways &ndash; including any illegal practices &ndash; that may have formed part of the system of ad hoc arrangements in place prior to the introduction of the 1952 Adoption Act.<\/p><p>The more extensive process of assembling and investigating all relevant records now forms a very significant part of the Commission&rsquo;s work.

As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I am concerned by the indications from reports based on these records and I want to see these matters fully investigated.
