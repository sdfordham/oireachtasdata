I offer apologies on behalf of Ms Kavanagh from Arnotts, as she got called away at the last minute.<\/p><p>  Retail Ireland is the representative body for the entire retail sector.  It numbers 3,000 shops, including department stores, DIY shops, electrical retailers, fashion and footwear retailers, supermarket groups, symbol groups and specialist retailers.  We are a division of IBEC.  Through that connection, we have close links with the Small Firms Association, which represents a number of small and independent retailers.  Some of our members operate in out-of-town stores and town and city centres.  Many operate in both.<\/p><p>  These meetings are timely, as the recently established retail consultation forum, of which we are supportive, is due to discuss this matter.  I hope that progress can be made between these hearings and that forum.<\/p><p>  It will not be news to any of the members that retail has been at the sharp end of this recession.  Sales are down by a quarter and 50,000 jobs have been lost.  The number of vacant units has increased.  However, we are a sector with significant potential.  Our Strategy for Retail 2014-2016, copies of which I will leave, tells two important stories.  First, we are the largest private sector employer in the country bar none, with a footprint in every town and village.  Some 75% of retail businesses are located outside Dublin and a similar number are SMEs.  Second, we have forecast that, if retail sales can in the first instance stabilise, as seems to be happening, and begin to grow by a modest 3% to 4% from 2016, we have the potential to create 40,000 new jobs by the end of the decade.  Town centre rejuvenation is undoubtedly a part of that growth strategy.<\/p><p>  The issue of the need to rejuvenate town centres has been at the centre of public debate for some years.  The recession and the growing number of vacant outlets in or close to the centre of towns and cities has sharpened minds.  A number of opinions have been expressed and industry representatives, politicians, economic operators and others have all made their views known.<\/p><p>  Central to our approach is a recognition that out-of-town shopping is a reality in the Irish retail space.  It brings with it benefits to retailers and consumers.  Town centre rejuvenation does not, as some might suggest, have to come at the expense of the shopping centre or out-of-town retail experience.  We believe in a truly national policy.  It is vital that everyone concentrate not just on Dublin city centre but also on other major cities, including Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  Further, smaller towns should not be neglected in the effort to breathe new life into the heart of city centres.<\/p><p>  Policy formulation in this area falls into four broad themes from which individual policy recommendations may flow: measures focused on making city and town centres better places to visit; measures to make town centres more attractive to consumers; measures to tackle crime and improve safety; and measures to improve business conditions for retailers.  If these four areas can be properly addressed in a timely fashion, major strides will be made.  Mr. Sealey and Mr. Parker will discuss their experiences as practising retailers in a few minutes, but I will go through some of our policy suggestions.<\/p><p>  Regarding measures focused on making city and town centres better places to visit, we have a number of proposals.  As recommended in the British report \"High Streets at the Heart of our Communities: The Government's response to the Mary Portas Review\", the Irish Government should identify pilot towns and cities where new partnerships involving retailers, landlords, local authorities, representative groups and so on could be formed to establish targets and achieve demonstrable improvements in town centre locations.  Building on the success of the Dublin business improvement district, BID, other towns and cities should establish, where demand among retailers and other businesses is present, their own BIDs to drive footfall.  I advise the committee to hear from the Dublin BID as part of this process.  That group can share its experience of Dublin city centre and describe how the BID system can be carried into other cities and towns.<\/p><p>  Planning presents an issue.  Specific measures should be taken in the planning process to make town and city centres attractive places to shop.  By necessity, this may involve a change in the location of certain services, such as drug treatment clinics and homeless facilities.  The importance of the provision of these services is not in doubt.  Instead of being centrally located, however, they should be located closer to where those who are in receipt of them live.  This will ensure a greater geographical spread of such services and allow for towns and cities to once again become vibrant centres of commerce.<\/p><p>  When making town centres more attractive to consumers, there are a number of issues to consider.  Public policy to date has focused on the need to encourage the use of public transport when travelling to city and town centres in order to reduce traffic congestion.  While this is a worthy aim, it discourages consumers from travelling into city centres to make bulky and often more expensive purchases.  It is obvious that a free-for-all parking system is not viable.  However, consideration should be given to allowing those travelling into city and town centres for periods of two or three hours to park for free.  Such a system could, for example, allow those who wish to park between the hours of 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. to park for free for two hours, thus giving city centre retailers their custom while avoiding any contribution to rush hour traffic congestion.<\/p><p>  The Your Dublin, Your Voice survey, which was conducted some years ago by Dublin City Council, found that only 32% of respondents felt that the city was clean and tidy.  Such a situation will not entice customers to come into a city or town centre.  The Tidy Towns initiative has worked well for smaller towns and villages and has helped to instil local pride and respect for the surroundings in which people live and shop.  Consideration should be given to how to instil such pride and respect in larger urban environments.<\/p> <p>On measures to tackle crime and improve safety, the Your Dublin, Your Voice<i><\/i>survey also found that fewer than one in three respondents felt safe in the city centre at night time.  This must be improved on.  To achieve greater safety at night, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should prioritise garda&iacute; on the beat during the hours of darkness and local authorities should ensure streets are properly illuminated.<br \/>Retail Ireland believes much of the policy consideration to reduce crime and anti-social behaviour in urban environments and the towns in which retailers operate has already been carried out and the policy now needs to be implemented.  To this end, we recommend full implementation of the National Crime Council&rsquo;s A Crime Prevention Strategy: Tackling the Concerns of Local Communities<i>, <\/i>which advocates, among other things, an integrated crime prevention strategy involving all relevant Departments, the development of community policing structures, a reduction in recidivism through work with ex-prisoners and greater investment in youth work at community level.  We also fully supported the establishment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s theft from shops prevention strategy<i><\/i>and continue to play a role in its implementation.<br \/>Measures to improve business conditions for retailers are crucial.  The report High Streets at the Heart of our Communities highlights the importance of local authority rates and their interconnectedness with the viability of retailers&rsquo; businesses.  Mr. Sealey and Mr. Parker will expand further on this issue.  Retail Ireland urges root and branch reform of local authority funding in order that less of the burden for this funding falls on retailers.<br \/>The huge difficulty of upward-only rent reviews, UORRs, for retailers is well documented and well known.  Notwithstanding the constitutional difficulties encountered some years ago on this issue, action must be taken to address it now.  Retail Ireland recently joined a number of other bodies in calling on the Government to allow Senator Feargal Quinn's Bill on this matter which has been passed by the Seanad to pass through the D&aacute;il in order that the President can decide whether to refer it to the Supreme Court.  We again take the opportunity to call on the Government to take that brave step.  Where rents are high and footfall is low, it is crucial that other costs are also addressed.  In Ireland the costs for retailers of labour, water, gas, electricity and professional services are far too high and must be addressed.  If addressed, many town centre businesses will be saved and the opportunity for growth will present.  Shopping is an integral part of the tourism experience in cities around the world.  Retail Ireland believes F&aacute;ilte Ireland and other bodies charged with encouraging tourists to visit the country should concentrate more on this aspect of the tourist offering.<br \/>Deputies and Senators will be aware that there is a particular issue with vacant retail units throughout Ireland.  Research from the CBRE shows that while retail activity has picked up a little in the past few months, vacancy rates in key towns and cities remain high.  In quarter one in 2014 Athlone had a vacancy rate on its high street of 21.6%, an increase on 18.2% on the figure for quarter three last year.  The vacancy rate on Patrick Street in Cork is up from 13% to 14.3%.   Sligo's high street vacancy rate stands at 12.5%, unchanged from last year.  The rate in Limerick also remains unchanged at 16.3%.  On Henry Street in Dublin there is a vacancy rate of 12.8%, up from 4.3%.  There are improvements in parts of the country, with high profile areas such as Grafton Street showing reduced vacancies and Cork's Opera Lane development fully let.  However, the overall picture highlights the continued problems of the sector.  A key problem is the high level of local authority charges such as commercial rates.  It is vital to remember that a recovery in the retail sector will reduce vacancy rates, increase the rates base and ultimately provide extra funding for local authority services.  A key way to make that happen is to reduce rates for retailers and offer rates holidays for retailers that take on a vacant unit.  In that way we can breathe new life into towns and cities.<br \/>We need action on many fronts.  We need to make town centres attractive, clean and safe places in which to do business and shop.  We need to encourage retailers to take up vacant units.  We need an appropriate retail tourism strategy and to address anti-social behaviour.  With a joined-up approach, we can start a new chapter for towns and cities.  The committee will now hear from retailers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Lynam","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403012400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I am managing director of Brown Thomas which operates four department stores located in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway and four BT2 stores, one located on the north side of the city, another on the south side of the city, one in Dundrum shopping centre and another in Blanchardstown shopping centre.  As such, we have a fair method for taking the temperature in the retail sector in these locations.<br \/>I would like to speak about technology.  It has made so many things easier for us.  With our tablets and iPhones we now have access to the whole world of commerce.  We can pay bills, move money around, book holidays and shop online.  The point I am making is that technology has opened up alternative ways of doing things.  It has opened up choice.  We no longer need to go into town or the bank to shop or pay bills s we can now do this from the comfort of our sofas, on the bus, train, tram and so on.  Most of the merchandise we sell in Brown Thomas can be purchased online from retailers in the United Kingdom, elsewhere in Europe or the United States.  To state the obvious, customers who buy in our town and city stores are putting money back into the economy.  Customers who buy online from overseas retailers are effectively siphoning money out of the economy.  <br \/>My job is to make Brown Thomas a place where people want to shop, thereby sustaining the 2,000 jobs across our stores.  The competition online is only going to get greater.  Brown Thomas is increasing the amount of product it sells online.  Our research shows that in five years 30% of what we sell through our stores will be sold online.  To my mind, for towns and cities to survive, they must be an attractive choice for customers.  Customers have choice and do not need to go into towns and cities.  To my mind, to make our towns and cities attractive, they must, first, be safe - customers must feel relaxed and at ease - second, clean and free of odours, litter and graffiti; third, easily accessible, including by the customer's mode of choice, be it the car, bus, bicycle or on foot and, fourth, there must be easy and affordable parking.  To my mind, our cities, particularly Dublin, do not satisfy these four essentials.  Dublin city centre suffers from anti-social behaviour of all sorts.  The Dublin Business Improvement District, BID, monitors finds of needles and other drug-taking paraphernalia, beggars and rough sleepers.  I regret to say the city centre is a hot spot for this activity and we need to address it urgently.  Clearly, it is a complex issue involving resource allocation and planning issues.  However, unless these issues are addressed, the city centre will not be a destination of choice and will decline inexorably.    <br \/>We need to address the issues within our control or that of the city councils.  I read in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times <\/i>that Owen Keegan plans to introduce a new cycle land on the north side of the city.  The article states: &quot;...restricting the road space available to cars was essential as part of a sustainable transport system ... and it is not something that we have to apologise for&quot;.  I have a couple of points to make.  First, we know from our own research that customers who travel by car spend 30% more than those who travel by other means.  It is not difficult to accept this because a person who wants to buy a heavy or valuable product will probably choose to travel by car.  Second, delays or congestion will drive customers to other destinations.  Shopping centres like the one in Dundrum provide a clean and safe environment, with easy access to parking.  Data from our sales indicates that customers are voting with their feet.  As I said, we operate in Dundrum and Blanchardstown shopping centres.  Last year our store in Dundrum recorded a substantially higher growth rate than our store on Grafton Street.  In fact, growth at the Dundrum store increased almost 12 times faster than at the store on Grafton Street.  The rate of growth at the store in Blanchardstown was seven times faster than at the Grafton Street store.  Data from our loyalty card system indicates that customers are choosing to shop where it is more convenient for them and that, increasingly, they are choosing to shop in the shopping centres.<\/p> <p>I love cities and relish their variety.  I love the one off little shops, the bars, caf&eacute;s, galleries and restaurants for a quick bite to eat or a special occasion.  I believe that if we can satisfy my four essentials, we will have a sound base on which to build business in our towns and cities.  We must stay focused on making them places where people want to be, places that are safe and convenient.<\/p><p> I know I am on my own in making the following point.  I am not asking for lower rates for Brown Thomas.   I would like to receive better service for the rates I pay, but I am not asking for a reduction.  However, I am asking for a reduction for small shops, the little one off traders who play a vital part in adding interest to the city centre.  I do not ask for Brown Thomas because I know services have to be paid for.  If I felt I got value for money and had a clean, safe and attractive city centre, I would be happy to pay rates because I would see the money go straight back on the bottom line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Sealey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403013000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sealey.

For fear of repeating what members have already heard, Mr. Sealey and I, more often than not, are in great competition on a weekly basis for a share of the consumer spend, but we agree on many things.  Without repeating verbatim what he eloquently said, the sector is about giving consumers choice, having a blend of retailers available for them from which to choose and giving them a reason to get out of their armchairs and stop doing what they normally do, that is, shopping on the Internet or ordering over the telephone and travel into city and town centres.  In order to get them to travel there must be a reason.  City and town centres must be clean, safe and provide a choice and the right blend of services, be it retail stores or restaurants.  As store director in the iconic Clerys, we are at the very front in seeing where that happens, but, more importantly, where it does not.  My plea is for a complementary approach to regenerating town and city centres.  We compete with each other day in, day out and may the best man win.  However, we need a complementary approach to everything ranging from ease of usage, cost of parking, choice of retailers to the environment.  Let us look at O'Connell Street, for example.  It has a very cold environment and I do not see a caf&eacute; culture or a reason to dwell in the area.  I do not see a reason for tourists to leave their hotels and stop on the street to take stock of its beautiful architecture, history and culture and then decide who will get their tourism euro.  We seek a level playing field, a complementary approach and a safe environment.  <\/p><p>  I must give credit where credit is due.  There have been a number of policing initiatives such as Operation Stilts and Operation Spire.  My colleagues in the store and I have felt much safer in the environment because the initiatives deal with anti-social behaviour and substance abuse, etc.  However, I fear that the measures have displaced the individuals concerned and that Mr. Sealey can now feel some of the impact on the southside.  However, credit where credit is due, the operations have made O'Connell Street a safer place to visit and in which to trade.  However, there is still a perception that the O'Connell Street area is a very unsafe place to visit.  Statistics from the surveys conducted by Your Dublin, Your Voice indicate that one in every three people do not find the area to be a safe place in whcih to shop during daylight hours, while two out of every three do not feel safe in the area at dusk and night time.  Even as late as last Saturday night we had a very serious incident under the clock at Clerys in which two tourists were assaulted and needed to be hospitalised.  <\/p><p>  I thank the committee for its time.  I hope I have reinforced the points I needed to make.  Mr. Sealey is not on his own in his comments on rates.  Clerys does not seek a rate reduction either, but it does want value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700005#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bob Parker"},{"type":"speech","time":1403013000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the delegation for attending and giving us its insights.  There is not a lot with which we can disagree in the presentations.<\/p><p>  I wish to make a point on Mr. Lynam's reference to a 25% decline in the retail sector because it mirrors a substantial decline in spending power.  During the past six years people's incomes have been sliced and there is debt to be serviced.  Where does Ireland fit in in terms of the decline internationally?  Is the rate of decline in Ireland much higher than in countries of a similar size? <\/p><p>  I am glad that Mr. Sealey dealt with the issue of online shopping because it strikes me as the biggest challenge facing retailers.  He has made the point that money spent in that way is lost to the country in terms of VAT paid and sales.  Therefore, we must look at the issue of taxing online purchases.  Will the delegations suggest a strategy in this regard?  <\/p><p>  Reference was made to the differences between Dundrum shopping centre and Grafton Street.  Has either delegation drilled down into research?  Are there focus groups?  Have people said why they prefer to visit Dundrum in bigger numbers than Grafton Street?  Is there an age difference?  Is the age profile of customers on Grafton Street higher than in Dundrum or Blanchardstown, for instance?<\/p><p>  We all support Senator Feargal Quinn's Bill on upward only rent reviews, but we know what will happen to it, unless the new Minister has a change of heart and attitude.  With respect to her, she is expected to make many changes, but I am not sure we will see this one being made.  Has Retail Ireland has received any legal advise or assistance to guide us on this matter?  There is legal advice available to the Government which states it can proceed.<\/p><p>  My next questions are to Mr. Lynam.  What is the position for retailers on servicing debt, including legacy debt?  Does it affect their ability to grow their businesses and, in turn, town centres?  Is it a serious problem in the retail sector?<\/p><p>  I mean no offence to Mr. Lynam, but my final questions are to the two retailers, Mr. Sealey and Mr. Parker.  Have people told them the direction in which the retail sector is moving?  What will be offered to customers who enter through doors of their establishments in five and ten years time?  How different will the service be from what is offered today?  One can have all the nice streets and streetscapes imaginable - I endorse the comments made - but Mr. Parker is right that O'Connell Street is not very attractive.  However, I disagree with some of the reasons he gave for this, but I do agree that there is something cold about the area.  What will bring customers through the doors of these establishments?  What will encourage them, as he said, to get off the couch?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700005#E00400","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403013000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>On the 25% decline in retail sales, we are the worst in the European Union.  I do not have the league table with me, but it might interest Deputies and Senators to know that even if we were to see a 3% to 4% increase in retail sales in the next two to three years - that is the most we are going to see - we would only reach the pre-crisis peak or see a rally in 2017.  Therefore, one is looking at a lost decade, similar to the one experienced by retailers and every other business in Japan.  I am perfectly aware that the same applies to many other businesses in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Senator Feargal Quinn is present.  I do not want to put words in his mouth about the Bill dealing with upward only rent reviews, but it is my understanding its provisions are transitional in nature and would fall within five years; therefore, it would not run contrary to the Constitution.  The Government's legal advice was that action on the legislation would be unconstitutional, but there are conflicting views.  The Bill, however, has been accepted by one House of the Oireachtas.  Notwithstanding the advice the Government received in 2011, the fact that the Bill has been passed by the Seanad has advanced the debate on the issue.  All we ask is that the D&aacute;il be free to vote on it and that the President make up his mind on whether it should be referred to the Supreme Court.  If he does not do so, I am sure - I am sure Senator Feargal Quinn agrees - it will be challenged by someone else and one way or the other we will find out.  If it does not go our way, we will accept the decision and move on.  We have a possible answer and it would be remiss of us not to try to avail of it.<\/p> <p> Debt and servicing of legacy debt is another huge issue.  The difficulty is that there is a dearth of data, but we are aware of many retail businesses that would be perfectly solvent and completely sustainable if only the debt issue could be temporarily parked and, as a corollary to this, if there was a line of credit to allow them businesses to invest and grow.  I would like to able to say I could get more information on this, but there is not a great deal available.

We started our online journey in October 2013.  We put beauty products online, a large slice of our business, and they are doing reasonably well.  We have added other categories such as shoes, sunglasses and accessories which are also showing good promise.  Our initial investment was &euro;1 million and I have decided to invest a further &euro;1 million in accelerating our presence online.  My ambition is that by October this year half of the products we sell in the store will be available online.  We are fighting the offshore Internet retailers, but I am confident that we can succeed because we can offer a better delivery proposition than they can.  If one orders online from the United Kingdom, delivery typically takes three or four days.  By this autumn we will be able to offer same day delivery for a premium charge or a next day delivery charge.  We are fighting and must own that space.  Coming to it late was not bad because we have the latest technology.  It is fully responsive and works on the telephone and every device and, of course, we can learn from where other people have failed.<\/p><p>  With regard to Dundrum and Blanchardstown shopping centres, what I would call our lower middle market sales are going there.  The top of our business, the designer business, is only available in Dublin, although we would be happy to ship pieces to Dundrum.  The middle market is a very successful and growing part of our business and the demographic is typically the 30 to 40 year old, people who have a young family and are choosing to shop in the shopping centres.  It is an easier and more convenient experience for them.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about our strategy.  It is to make our store an absolute destination.  I should be charging a consultancy fee for this, particularly as my colleagues are present.  As a first step, we are in the middle of a spend of &euro;8.5 million on the ground floor of the store to refurbish it and open new boutiques for luxury brands.  Many of these brands are only available in Ireland through Brown Thomas; therefore, one need not travel to London or Paris but come to Brown Thomas and buy them from us.  We must then think of what we must do into the future.  Our view is that we should invest more in services, things one cannot get online.  We have a big beauty business and one can do a great deal in developing it further in terms of services, spa treatments and so forth.  The other thing we can offer is innovation.  Not a day goes by when we do not have a buyer on an aeroplane going somewhere to look at something new.  It might not just be a new brand of clothes; it could be anything.  We must look to the future.  We start stocking various technology items before Christmas which are not products we normally trade.  We must add excitement in a never ending quest for newness.<\/p><p>  To sum it up, it involves investment, making sure we are a destination, looking to services and experiences that cannot be replicated online and relentless innovation and newness all the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700006#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Sealey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403013600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>There is not much to say by way of differential.  As experienced retailers, we are very much aware of what is happening in the marketplace.  Clerys is a little late to the market in terms of online transactional websites.  We have just completed a feasibility study and are now looking at funding to get us off the mark in that regard.  In our strategy we clearly believe there is a place for clicks and bricks.  There is ease of purchase online, but there is still a tactile requirement when one is purchasing certain products.  One cannot beat good, old-fashioned service, friendliness and a nice environment.  We have recently refurbished the store and our environment is very fresh and welcoming.  We receive many positive comments about it, but it is about one's people.  It is about investing in one's people, their service and product knowledge - the things one cannot get online or about which one is not sure.  It is about making sure there is a reason to come into the store and wish to purchase.  When people are in the store, it is about the blend and range of services of which they can avail, be it a restaurant, coffee shop, pit stop or a service such as a foot or a beauty treatment.  It is about maximising and giving people a reason to stay in the store, feel good about the service and the treatment they receive when they are in and treating customers as if they are one's friends.  One cannot do this online.  One can have ease, convenience and perhaps price but one cannot beat good, old, honest to goodness service.<\/p><p>  The age profile in our business is historically ageing.  Our strategy is to attract the mum, the mum-to-be, the daughter and the grandmother and to have a story for life in wishing to visit Clerys.  That is the strategy we are pursuing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700006#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bob Parker"},{"type":"speech","time":1403013600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il le Mr. Lynam, Mr. Sealey agus Mr. Parker as a gcur i l&aacute;thair.<\/p><p>  The Government has a big role to play in this issue.  The under-funding of local authorities has pushed local authorities to obtain their funding from two areas, business rates and car parking charges.  These often kill the goose that lays the egg in the first place.  It is important that the Government play its role in this regard.  We believe in the necessity to have a progressive rate, which might fit in with what Mr. Sealey said.  While the rate should reflect the size and type of business, it should also reflect the profitability of the business.  It should not be so high that it makes a successful business uncompetitive but allows for businesses that are struggling, especially at present, to fight another day.  Also, the flat taxes introduced in recent times have had an effect on retailers.  Property charges made a dent in people's disposable income and I have heard much anecdotal evidence that the current talk about water charges is lowering expectations of disposable income into the future.  They are, therefore, making allowances for them now also.<\/p><p>  I realise Retail Ireland represents both out-of-town and town centre businesses.  If we want to get people back into the town centre, a carrot and stick approach is required.  It must be incentivised which is sometimes a zero sum experience.  It is hard to please all representative groups.  Are the car parking spaces in out-of-town centres subject to rates?  Obviously, a major competitive advantage for Dundrum shopping centre as opposed to businesses on Grafton Street would be the availability of car parking spaces.  We brought forward a Bill on upward only rent reviews, but the Government did not accept it.  I believe Mr. Lynam is correct in saying it is important it be tested constitutionally.<\/p><p>  Local authorities have a massive role to play.  In the North local authorities will provide merchandising and market training for businesses; they will provide mystery shoppers and do their utmost to ensure town centre retailers are fully tied up.  Approximately &euro;3 billion is spent on online sales, of which two thirds leaves the island.  That figure will only increase in the future.  Local authorities and especially the local enterprise offices, LEOs, have a massive role to play in training retailers in town centres in how to provide for online marketing at least, if not a step up to online retailing also.<\/p><p>  Providing a cycle path on the north side of the city is a matter of life and death.  People will die in the next couple of years if a cycle path is not provided.  Buses continuously cut off cyclists.<\/p> <p>While there might be a reduction in the net spend per individual, the challenge is to make sure the cycling leads to a reduction in congestion.  That will lead to more people being in the town centres, which will offset that reduction in the net spend per individual.  <\/p><p> I commend the analysis done by Retail Ireland of the number of vacancies in main streets because the \"shutter island\" experience is real, particularly in areas outside the M50.  Some of the figures Mr. Lynam gave us show a dramatic increase from 2013 to 2014.<\/p><p> Mr. Lynam mentioned rates holidays.  Many incumbent retailers have problems with rates holidays because they believe a competitive advantage is being given to a \"newbie\" in the particular market, which takes money from one and gives to the other.  It is similar to the Government's attitude with regard to grants - one does not displace business that already exists.  I ask that we would try to square that circle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700006#F00500","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403014200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>On the taxation point, whatever one's view on property charges, water charges and so on, from a business point of view the shame is that there has been a rebalance in terms of the way local authorities are funded yet businesses, be they retail or otherwise, have not seen a reduction on the other side.  Retailers who are completely dependent on consumer spend are being continuously squeezed in terms of their own costs while their consumer base has less money.  Where we go from there I do not know, other than to say that a chicken and egg situation may arise whereby if we freeze rates, and we will be advocating cuts in personal taxation in the next budget, that will in and of itself spur economic activity and hopefully lead to changes.<\/p><p>  On Internet sales, the data we have is much worse.  We understand that in 2012, the online market was worth &euro;4 billion and in 2016 will have quadrupled to &euro;16 billion but - and this is where the negativity comes in - 75% of that &euro;4 billion went to stores with a physical presence in this country.  People spending online is not in and of itself a problem for this country.  The problem is that so little of that online spend goes to Irish retailers, and by Irish retailers I mean retailers who employ people here.  The trick is to ensure that more of that online spend goes to retailers based in towns and cities around Ireland.  I will let the gentlemen take the other questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700007#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Lynam"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403014200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>With regard to the rates holiday question, by all means we need to square the circle but if rates holidays lead to a better blend, better occupation and a more complete offering in our towns and city centres, as a retailer I would welcome that.

It keeps us having to continuously improve upon our service levels and makes us sit back and think, and not get complacent.

I was in New York some time ago where Columbus Circle has the Time Warner shopping centre, which they describe as a shopping experience.  Clearly, both Brown Thomas and Clerys are trying to create all those flavour enhancers for customers who go into their department stores but we must face up to the reality that whether we like it or not, many of us are buying goods online, and more of us will buy them online.  We cannot buy our meal in a restaurant online but we buy other goods.  That is a tough square to circle.  We cannot get away from that but it is a question of how far behind we are, as retailers.  I refer not just to the witnesses, but the smaller retailers.  We have representatives from two major department stores before us but I am concerned, as I am sure are other members, about our local towns, which became grey during the recession.  The retailers in those towns are fighting just to have some sustainability, and some have been better than others at coming up with solutions.<\/p><p>  I am conscious that Mr. Sealey represents members from out of town centres also and it would be particularly important for him to answer my next question on which there are different points of view.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n might have touched on it earlier.  It concerns the variation in rates, an issue I have raised in recent years.  Our planning guidelines state that towns and villages are at the heart of our retail sector yet we have allowed out of town retail units to be built to beat the band, which has been detrimental to our local towns and villages.  Is it not the case that if we want to enforce planning guidelines, the rates should reflect the guidelines?  If we want to keep the heart of retail in our towns, villages and big cities, that must be reflected in the way we charge rates.  I refer to the competitive advantage a retailer has in Dundrum shopping centre or a large Tesco store which has other ancillary services and multiple car parking spaces.  I believe they pay for those spaces through development levies, which answer was given earlier.  They do not have them for free, so to speak.  I believe they pay for them somewhere along the line.  If we want to reinforce our guidelines and make our towns and city centres the heart of retail, should we not have a variation in rates to reflect that?  I accept it is complicated but should we not have what has been done in the North?  Essentially, it would be something like a Tesco tax, to use that name.  That is the major question to which I would like an answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700007#G00600","speaker":"1023"},{"type":"speech","time":1403014200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>It has been very interesting to listen to the gentlemen.  I have been in business for a long time and many of the issues we concern ourselves about now are not unlike those we were concerned about 50 years ago.  We complained about newcomers coming in.  When I first started there was Lipton's Home and Colonial, Leverett &amp;amp; Frye and a half dozen others in Ireland yet there were Irish companies that succeeded, and such companies did not always succeed.<\/p><p>  I believe the resolution to this problem will not come from on high or from the Government doing anything in particular.  It will be individuals doing exactly what Mr. Parker spoke about, namely, concentrating on the personality, or what Mr. Sealey mentioned.  I am very disappointed in Brown Thomas because I went into the store the other day and my wife fell head over heels for it.  It will cost me a great deal of money if Mr. Sealey continues doing what he is doing.  It seems to me that the results will be exactly what the two representatives spoke about.  <\/p><p>  I travelled around the country a good deal recently with a television show and one sees individual shops doing very well in towns that are not doing very well.  The answer will depend on the individuals but what they can do in the towns is get together with their competitors.  Some towns are dying a death.  One can see the number of empty shops but one can also see that the town has not got together to do something to attract more business.<\/p><p>  I was in Glasthule recently.  Glasthule is a small area but it did not have one empty shop.  There were no big international shops.  They were all individual traders but as we left Glasthule and drove into D&uacute;n Laoghaire, we saw empty shop after empty shop.<\/p> <p>It seems the people in Glasthule did something like the people in Malahide and Howth - the places I know - because they seem to have been able to work together and make something of their location so people would shop there.  The solution will rest in the hands of the individual retailers to a very large extent but that does not mean Retail Ireland cannot do a great deal.  I am appreciative of the supports of Retail Ireland and the 12 associations that have got together to say the upward-only rent issue can be solved.<\/p><p> I am convinced that the huge problem Mr. Stephen Lynam mentioned regarding upward-only rent reviews can be solved.  Even if the Government is doubtful about whether the legislation will work, the answer is to get it through the D&aacute;il.  The President will say he will not sign it until he gets the answer from the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court will say either \"Yes\" or \"No&rdquo; and then we will know where we stand.  The answer involves doing something like that.<\/p><p> Many more people will be shopping online in the future.  A couple of years ago in Estonia I went into a comparatively small shop with two or three employees on the floor.  I was taken upstairs by the boss where there were 11 people working on Internet sales.  I suppose they were selling to everywhere but certainly to eastern Europe.  I mention this because the owner of the small shop discovered he would not do sufficient business over the counter in his shop and that he could do something about it.  The matter is in our own hands.  It is in our hands to do a great job at exporting.  If we are complaining that Irish consumers are importing from abroad without having to pay the taxes they might otherwise have to pay, we must realise it is an advantage for us in that we can do exactly the same thing by selling abroad.  That is what we have got to do.<\/p><p> There are some very interesting smaller companies that are succeeding very well.  I am thinking mainly of Dublin, which has Donnybrook Fair, Fallon and Byrne, Morton's and Avoca.  These retailers are thriving, succeeding and doing very well.  Therefore, let us not talk ourselves into saying all would be well if the Government or local authority did something; let us make sure we do it ourselves.  That is the main message we can get out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700007#G00700","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403014800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates.  Yesterday I was involved in the peace process in Belfast.  I returned from Belfast using the airport bus, whose final stop was at the Gresham Hotel.  I had a very pleasant journey on the beautiful bus and there was beautiful countryside all the way down.  It was very therapeutic but I will never forget the shock I got when I got to O'Connell Street.  To me, shopping has to be about a good experience but O'Connell Street is filthy.  We are all familiar with the various reports.  The three delegates have a huge problem on their hands.  I will never forget what I saw and I am not exaggerating.  I felt like ringing up Joe Duffy but I said to myself I should mind my own business as I have enough to do.  A fortune has been paid on the redesign of O'Connell Street and there are beautiful buildings that afford an historical experience but I do not know what the delegates are going to do about the problem I describe.  I went into Clerys.  While the litter on the street is disgusting, the pavements are filthy.  They need to be washed down regularly.  Disregarding the Luas works &mdash; it is tremendous that we are to have that connection &mdash; the pavement at the bottom of Grafton Street was filthy.  I just could not believe my eyes.  I believed the condition would improve farther on but it was actually dirty outside Allied Irish Banks.  I am ashamed because when I was in Belfast there was a beautiful pristine atmosphere.  I am not blaming the three delegates.  They spoke about value for money in rates, etc, and consequently I hope to God they will be able to address the problem.<\/p><p>  I was in Dundrum Town Centre this morning at the ATM.  There is constant cleaning taking place there.  Cleaning must be constant, not once off.  I met a man on O'Connell Street who had a tiny little cleaning gadget but in Dundrum under Mr. Nugent there is constant cleaning.  One never enters the shopping centre without seeing somebody cleaning.  With all the talk about online competition and the various reports, I really feel the delegates have a crisis on their hands.  I do not want to go back down the street again.  I cannot talk about drugs &mdash; I have no experience of that &mdash; but I can state the street is dirty.  What the hell have the delegates got to say about it?  I am not blaming them.  If they want people to shop on our main street, O'Connell Street, how will they make it a pleasant experience?  People will not go there as it is.  In Dundrum, Mr. Nugent is particular about what he wants.  After the hassle of this place, I go to Dundrum Town Centre just to relax.  It is so beautiful and clean that it makes you feel good.  It is a beautiful environment and it is kept clean all the time.  O'Connell Street is dirty and littered and the pavements have ingrained dirt.  I am upset about it, to be honest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700008#H00200","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1403014800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Many of the points have been covered so I will not repeat them.  I welcome the group.  There has been much talk about O'Connell Street.  I do not believe O'Connell Street has been the same since they cut down the nice trees, but that is just a personal view.  I used to come from the west and see the nice trees.  Anyway, somebody made the decision.<\/p><p>  Online trade was mentioned.  Coming from Galway, it would be remiss of me not to mention Kenny's Bookshop in Galway, which was the second bookshop in the world, after Amazon, to have an online presence.  This occurred in the mid to late 1990s.  Irish retailers just missed the boat in terms of online sales.  Either they did not see this coming or, if they did, did not do enough about it, notwithstanding what the delegates said about it.<\/p><p>  The discussion is very Dublin orientated.  There is a big world outside Dublin.  Some 50% of the Irish population live in the Leinster area, and they have different issues.  As a committee, we have visited places in the west, including Castlebar, Ballinrobe and Ballinasloe, to learn about the issues those substantial towns are facing, including the issues of parking charges and out-of-town multiples.  Not many in the west would be concerned about the struggle of Arnotts, Brown Thomas or Clerys in that they regard themselves as struggling because of reducing populations and emigration.  This discussion is very Dublin-centric.<\/p><p>  People make choices, including retail choices.  I was watching a documentary on Sky about the big freeze in the United Kingdom in 2009 and 2010.  We had it here also.  During that period, there was a huge spike in online shopping, for the obvious reason that people could not get out of their homes.  There is still a desire for people to go out and feel and touch the products.  If people go into a shop to buy one product, they end up buying a number of products.  The better the retail experience, the more likely it is that customers will return.  Do the delegates believe that if people have particular tastes, there is not a lot that the Government can do to change them?  Although the councils can make places look nice, after that it is a question of the retail experience the customer can have.  At home one often hears people say they do not want to go into Galway because they will not get parking at a particular time of the day or on a Friday evening, for example.  It is understandable that people will opt for what is convenient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700008#H00300","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1403014800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates.  As with Deputy Kyne, I believe this discussion is very Dublin city centre orientated.<\/p> <p>I remember getting my rear end kicked when I was very much in support of an outlet shop in Goffs in Kill.  Local traders could see the damage that was going to be done to them on a long-term basis as a consequence of traders coming from Grafton Street.  I am talking about rural towns, including my town, Naas, and also Celbridge, Maynooth and Leixlip, all of which are on the periphery of Dublin.  I include also the Chairman's town, Navan.  These are all close to attractive shopping centres along the M50.<\/p><p> Senator Quinn referred to making towns a better place to visit.  I heard what the witnesses said in this regard.  I like the idea of town teams whereby a town works as a team to generate its own identity and purpose.  Down through the years, Naas has become a good environment for high-end ladies' fashion retailers.  We should be building on this.  Perhaps we could develop this approach in other towns.<\/p><p> I disagree with the sentiments on parking.  There has to be some parking charge or people will park all day.  A charge is a necessary evil to ensure parking spaces continue to become available.  I have a problem with clamping, which mostly occurs in private car parks.  A Bill to come before the D&aacute;il will be very strong on not allowing clamping in private car parks.  They should use barriers because people can get detained elsewhere.  Ladies, in particular, can get caught in nice fashion boutiques for a little longer than expected.

Some days ago I called into a little boutique in Naas that has been established for about a year and a half.  I asked the proprietor how she was doing and she said she was flying.  She told me she has a good clientele who must come to her shop to pick up what they buy online.  I realised any town could do this.  Instead of posting out goods, one could require the customer to come to collect them.  One could link in with other shops.  If in Naas one cannot get a suitable pair of shoes in one shop, the shopkeeper will tell one there is nice boutique elsewhere in the town with nicer shoes.  The retailers work as a town team, as was mentioned.<\/p><p>  I do not give up hope.  We must reinvent ourselves and put forward new ideas to attract people.  There are so many other attractions nowadays, including lazy options on the television.  The retail industry is undergoing a complete change and it must embrace this rather than fight it.  The changes present a real option for small retailers.<\/p><p>  With regard to rates, the centres of small towns should be given some sort of rates relief or compensation to reinvigorate them.  This would compensate for the loss of business caused by the out-of-town units with big car-parking facilities.<\/p><p>  The issue of upward-only rent reviews in small towns is not relevant.  It is only relevant in big towns because most premises in small towns are privately owned or owned by an individual for whom it is more important to have a tenant rather than none as a consequence of increasing the rent.

It is an issue we raise quite a lot, but the good news is that there will be a Bill before the House before the end of the year to transfer responsibility for deciding on rates from the commissioner to the local authorities.  As one knows, for years responsibility rested with the town councils in various areas.  This platform is to change in the near future.  We have a challenge but it is one that we should embrace because there will be options for everybody.  It should not be all about what the Government does.  More work must be done through people coming together to reinvigorate the industry.  There is a great opportunity for Irish stores to sell abroad, as Senator Quinn stated.

There were many questions but the common theme was online retailing.  Those who said we should regard online retailing not as a threat but as an opportunity are correct.  There are barriers specific to the market that stop small, medium and large Irish operators from going online.  In our strategy for retail, we have committed to a body of work to assist Irish retailers in going online.  Annually, we survey members on their existing online presence and plans to develop it.  Last year, we identified that two thirds of Irish retailers intended either to establish or improve an existing online presence.  We have identified specific barriers to online trading.  For example, the cost of postage and delivery is one.  There is anecdotal evidence that it is cheaper to send a product to Newry and have it re-sent through the Royal Mail than it is to use our postal service.  That will not encourage any Irish retailer to go online, particularly where there are different economies of scale.  However, I accept Senator Quinn's point that every Irish retailer is now a potential exporter with a much bigger market, the world market.<\/p><p>  We are working with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation through the retail consultation forum, which we lobbied intensively to establish, to come up with proposals.  Retail Ireland and IBEC operate the biggest skill net for retailers in the country.  A specific body of work in this regard is to assist small and medium retailers in getting online, obtaining the expertise to maintain an online presence and building on it.  Getting online is not just about creating a website and leaving it there; it is like having a whole new store.  It is that intricate and intensive.  It does not happen overnight, particularly for small businesses and the businesses mentioned by members.<\/p><p>  I said at the start that we need a national approach, not just one for Dublin.  That is certainly the case.  What will work to rejuvenate Dublin city centre will not work to rejuvenate Castlebar, Portlaoise and Navan.  Therefore, we need a nuanced and specific set of proposals, depending on the particular problems in particular towns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700009#J01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Lynam"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403015400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>For me, retail is about experience, be it the purchasing environment, efficiency, price, the speed with which an order is processed or, when in a store, what one touches, what one feels and how one is served.

It includes their experience on the bus, Luas or train right through the external environment to the internal environment in the retailer's store.  Retailers can control the internal environments in our stores, which are constantly changing as we seek to provide better experiences.  We rain check, sense check and conduct exit surveys on what we are doing.  However, we need help, support and joined-up complementary thinking about the external environment, whether it be the blend of retailers, the environment, hardscape or softscape required to create the experience in Dublin or my home town of Nenagh.  Once one is a retailer, one does not shop in other towns with a different head on.  One shops as a retailer and looks at the experiences and difficulties people are having.  In many ways, they are a microcosm of what we experience.  It is about a joined-up approach under which we all work hard to get the right result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700009#J01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bob Parker","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403016000,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I clarify that I am not coming here asking the Government to do a load of stuff.

Retail Excellence Ireland is Ireland's largest retail industry group, with more than 1,000 member companies operating 11,000 stores across the country in our villages, towns and cities.<\/p><p>  To kick off, I would appreciate it if we could go back a couple of years.  In 2012, we felt towns were under tremendous pressure.  Even in the adversarial setting of upward-only rents, those giving out the most were smaller retailers in smaller towns and villages.  The reason was the retail mix.  The offer that was the town centre was depleted, diminished and, in some cases, derelict.  Mr. Cormac Kennedy came to chair a committee and we carried out the largest ever assessment of what citizens wanted from their towns.  We were delighted that the Independent News and Media group contributed &euro;400,000 in advertising, and we undertook a significant national campaign.  We interviewed 17,000 citizens and found that there were a number of key drivers in bringing people to town centres.<\/p> <p>The first was proximity.  Obviously, if a person lives closer to a town, they are more likely to visit it.  The second was the retail mix.  Car parking was sixth.  The point that came across very clearly to us is that one can pay people to go to certain towns and cities and if the retail mix was not right, they would not come.  There was too much discussion about car parking charges whereas the fundamental point was that the retail and hospitality mix had depleted and was not engaging people and thus they were getting in their cars and going up the road to Kildare Village or Dundrum or wherever.  <\/p><p> In 2013, we designed a framework for managing the town which we published through Chambers Ireland and lots of business associations and groups to advise people on how one manages a town.  The best thing we did during that year was establish a national town management executive chaired by Mr. Kennedy.  It involves the County and City Managers' Association, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Chambers Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and NAMA.  We came together and said that we would work together as a national group to assist smaller towns and cities around the country.  <\/p><p> In that regard, we opened an invitation to become a pilot town to work with us over the coming 12 months.  Limerick and Carlow won that competition.  We were overawed by the number of applications.  Today we continue to work with Limerick and Carlow.  We are doing three things in both locations that will work anywhere.  The first is getting the infrastructure right so we have established town teams.  This includes every single stakeholder, not just local government and chambers of commerce, but voluntary groups, tidy towns groups and educationalists - young and old.  We have put together a plan with three simple pillars.  <\/p><p> The first is retail and hospitality investment which is filling the boxes and looking at innovative use for those boxes.  In some cases, we broke the law and convinced the local authority to offer some kind of rates incentive, which they now do in the form of a grant - obviously, they are not allowed to provide for any rates discount or waiver - and that has worked.  The second thing is citizen engagement.  What we did was remind citizens that it is their public realm.  In those locations, they put together events, occasions and promotions to bring people back into their towns.  Next week is Dine Out in Limerick, the following week is Fashion Week and the following week is Outdoor Cinema Night.  It aims to reacquaint people with their civic space.  The third thing we did was implement street auditing - street standards and safety.  Retailers and all the stakeholders come together, sign a statute of behaviour and say they will keep a town or city clean and get behind all these promotions and that together they will succeed.  <\/p><p> That brings us up to today.  In recent weeks, we have proposed to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government the establishment of a town centre management academy.  I am not being adversarial but we feel that local authorities, which have been very giving and supportive through the County and City Managers Association initiatives, need to be retrained away from sewerage, roads and infrastructure towards Don Nugent's approach - what Dundrum does in this scenario.  It is pleasing that we have agreed a strategic relationship with the Association of Town and City Management, ATCM, in the UK which has been doing these things for 21 years.  With that, I will hand over to my colleague, Martin Blackwell, to explain.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700010#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Fitzsimons","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403016600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fitzsimons for that very positive news.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700011#L00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403016600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be here.  As Mr. Fitzsimons said, we have been doing this for over 20 years.  About 25 years ago, four people came together who had the job title of town centre manager.  They met in a pub and decided they ought to talk to each other more often.  That became this association that now represents 600 places around the UK and a handful in Ireland.  Over those years, we have learned an awful lot about what does and does not work.  The key things about any change one wants to make is that it must be done in a genuine partnership.  That is a word that is often over-used and misunderstood.  It has been really instrumental for us in doing some work over the past couple of years.  Town teams was a phrase invented by a lady called Mary Portas who was invited by David Cameron to undertake a review of town centres.  Mary Portas did that and we helped and supported her.  In the past couple of years, the government has formed something called the Future High Streets Forum.  I sit on that forum, which is chaired by a Minister for town centres.  We have been carrying out work over the past couple of years with these new groups that have been established called town teams.  The government ran a competition and we ran some workshops around England to help places put a good application together.  We were all stunned when they got 400 applications from places that wanted to be pilots for some of the ideas in the Portas Review.  Over the past two years, we have been commissioned by the government to work with these new town teams and establish them as new groups.<\/p><p>  What has been really interesting is that the relationship between town centre management as we know it and town teams is pretty much the same.  The same process applies.  Town centre management is a process.  It is about getting the right people around the table to work together - the key stakeholders.  That must be the public sector - local government - the business community and the people.  It is a matter of getting those people to come together and work together to establish a vision for what they want their place to be, a vision that will be different in different places.  Dublin is very different to many other places.  We have just awarded a purple flag, which is our evening and night time economy programme, to Killarney.  Places like Bray and Ennis also have that status but they are very different.  The evening economy in Killarney is really important to it, much more than in other places.  Once one gets that vision to which everybody can sign up, one then develops a strategy to deliver that vision and finally an action plan.  The action plan will be different in different places.  <\/p><p>  We have a number of programmes to support those action plans.  One of them is around the evening and night time economy.  A total of 50 places around the UK and Ireland now have purple flag status.  When the Portas Review came out, I was asked to go and see the Minister at the time.  He asked what I thought about the review and I said that we liked some bits, as one does, but were not quite so sure about others.  I asked him whether he realised that the motor industry in the UK was worth &pound;10 billion.  He gave me a strange look and I said that the fashion industry was worth &pound;20 billion and the telecommunications industry was worth &pound;30 billion.  If one adds it all up, it does not come to the value of the evening and night time economy, which is worth &pound;60 billion, but Mary Portas did not mention it.  While retail is really important, it is not the whole story.  One needs to be able to trade 24-7.  Earlier today, I was talking to Richard Guiney who is the manager of Dublin City BID.  He thinks that up to 30% of the turnover in Dublin now takes place after dark.  One ignores that at one's peril.  <\/p><p>  The Digital High Street is another one of our other programmes.  Earlier witnesses spoke about the importance of online business.  We are now delivering a programme to train SMEs and small retailers on how to take advantage of the digital economy.  Research in the UK suggests that less than 2% of small retailers are using social media to connect with their customers.  We have three basic programmes - three training days - on how to think about getting one's business online.  The first one helps people ask the right questions.  We hear stories of people spending &pound;20,000 or &pound;30,000 building a fantastic all-singing, all-dancing website that does not do any business because they did not need it.  It is about making the right decisions about what is good for one's business in terms of digital.  <\/p><p>  Another one of our programmes is about opening pop-up stores where young entrepreneurs who possibly have an online business and are doing well want to open premises.  We are beginning to see things coming back the other way.  Two or three years ago, the rhetoric was \"the Internet's going to kill the high street.\"  The rhetoric I now hear is \"the smartphone's going to save the high street.\"  I do not believe either is true but finding ways to work with all of that community and to bring everybody together to collectively decide how they want to take their place forward must be the way forward for us.  We have got the experience and tools to enable people to do that for themselves.  We certainly do not do it for them.  We just help and support people and give them the tools and the opportunity to do it for themselves.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700011#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Blackwell"},{"type":"speech","time":1403016600,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Blackwell for that.

The way one must approach things in a town centre is no different from the way one would approach them in a shopping centre such as the one in Dundrum.  A shopping centre would have a marketing manager and a facilities manager to run the premises, taking charge of the lettings, landscaping, security, cleaning and so forth.  One particular person would lead the charge.  Towns need to adopt the same practices and procedures.  They need to assess their cleanliness regimes.  They also need to analyse their tenant mix to determine if there are gaps and then target potential tenants to fill the gaps and make a difference.  Hospitality is a key area of advantage for towns.  Typically people would prefer to go to a town centre for hospitality and leisure activities rather than to a shopping centre.  This is true of both night-time and daytime trade.  In order for all of this to work, one needs professionals to manage it.  Towns need a town management academy which will train people in managing town centres, similar to the way shopping centre managers are trained to manage shopping centres.  If we do those simple things, they could make an enormous difference in terms of driving jobs and revenue back into town centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700012#M00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Kennedy"},{"type":"speech","time":1403017200,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation from Retail Excellence Ireland, an organisation which talks but also acts.

Six months ago I was invited to Letterkenny to talk about the town team concept and incredibly, it has done just that.

A guy who runs an Eason franchise in the town invited me to speak at a conference attended by the local authority and many others.  We formed a town team which now has &euro;80,000 in the bank.  The team has advertised for a full-time town centre manager.  The local authority - fair play to it - gave the town team &euro;50,000 to get going and a town plan is in place which is based on common sense.  Part of that common-sense plan is a secondary street in the town that is rent- and rate-controlled where only indigenous local businesses can operate.  The multiples are not allowed to operate there.  That is a common-sense approach to using urban space to allow for new entrants to the market.  The emphasis on the high street is also on local supply and local retail.  Carlow and Kilkenny will soon launch similar initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700012#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Fitzsimons"},{"type":"speech","time":1403017200,"counter":54,"content":"<p>This is very insightful.  Oftentimes one hears the large theory but not the detail.  I have always been of the view that the retail sector has been ignored by the local authorities and the enterprise development organisations.  While the county enterprise boards were generally good organisations, they did not play a role in the retail sector at all.  In my experience, there was no relationship between retailers and local authorities.  Indeed, each viewed the other with both caution and scepticism and considered the other as nothing more than a cost centre.  Even when one tried to bring them together, the lack of a proper structure meant that it did not really work.<\/p><p>  I worked as a business consultant seven or eight years ago.  In Northern Ireland, town centre retailers were given training in marketing, including through the internet, merchandising, mystery shopping and so forth, which was of enormous benefit to them.  <\/p><p>  Often the hands of retail organisations are somewhat tied because they represent both out-of-town and in-town retailers.  I believe a carrot-and-stick approach is needed to bring retailers back into the centre of towns.  One of the competitive advantages of out-of-town centres like Blanchardstown is free parking, which a town like Navan cannot offer.  It might be worth rating parking spaces.  In that way, the parking spaces would become a cost to the large out-of-town retailers, who would then have to charge for them.  That would go some way towards equalising the playing field.  However, there is no doubt that such a suggestion would be very unattractive to out-of-town retailers.   We also need to have a more progressive rates system that takes into account the profitability of businesses.  That would ensure that small businesses can compete against larger companies such as Tesco, even if only for an initial three-year period.  <\/p><p>  Is the blueprint that Retail Excellence Ireland used for pilot towns such Carlow easily accessible to other non-pilot towns that might wish to run with it themselves?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700012#M00400","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403017200,"counter":55,"content":"<p>It is readily available<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700012#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Fitzsimons"},{"type":"speech","time":1403017200,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Is it available online?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700012#M00600","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403017200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Yes.

I went to New York to listen to one of the largest property developers in the world.  He took the stage after George Bush and said that in 2006 the largest shopping centre had been built in the United States, but now shopping centres are no longer fit for purpose in terms of people's need for social engagement.  The Deputy spoke about online retailing, which represents a huge opportunity for town centres in the future.  We will all be at home tapping away on our PCs but will desperately need social engagement and community connectivity, and town centres are best placed to provide that.  That means providing an urban space that is beautiful, which is what this guy does.  He puts in waterfalls, seating areas where people meet and mix and so forth, and they come.  There is no problem because people feel like shopping and eating there.<\/p><p>  The solution is not to apply a rates increase to out-of-town retailers because that would not make societal or commercial sense.  What does make sense is taking the needs of town centres seriously.  Giving rates breaks to retail types in which a town is deficient is one solution.  A town might have more than enough telecommunications outlets or charity shops but not enough fashion outlets.  It should be able to go Zara, H &amp;amp; M or Pamela Scott and let them set up for free.  <\/p><p>  The rates revaluation process that is sweeping the country - ongoing in Dublin, Waterford and Limerick at the moment - is a tax on town centres because there is now a direct link between the rates set and the rent in the market.  The highest rents are in town centres and not in secondary locations or business parks.  I was  in Waterford City to hear the announcement of the rates revaluations and I feared for the safety of the guy from the Valuations Office.<\/p> <p>It was incredulous.

I gave evidence to a business innovation schools committee at Westminster and said business rates, as they stood, were no longer fit for purpose.

This is the reason companies such as Starbucks buy their coffee beans in Switzerland because they find a way to get around the property based taxation system.  I do not pretend to know what the answer is, but if we want to bring new businesses through, we have to find a way to support them.  Tax breaks are interesting, but we probably need to look at the wider picture of the cost of operating in a town centre.  It is generally more expensive; it takes longer to get permission to do anything and it is more difficult to do anything in a town centre than in an out-of-town centre.

Sometimes the conversations are about car parking and rates, but this is probably an unwinnable argument to a certain extent because there needs to be a charge to run the town, but nobody wants to pay for it.  As a retailer organisation, we would be in the same boat as anyone else, not wanting to pay that charge, but it must be paid for somewhere along the way.  The focus should be on how to get retail and hospitality businesses to set up in towns.  One attracts businesses to a location by creating the nice environment Mr. Fitzsimons described and following the examples Mr. Blackwell gave from the United Kingdom.  Retailers will follow each other.  If a large retailer moves into a town, other retailers will follow because they will feel the confidence behind them.  If a large retailers leave a town, other retailers will leave also.  It operates very much on herd instinct.  The focus needs to be on this rather than other issues.  I am not taking from the very important points made, butit would be of greater benefit to focus on the other side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700013#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac Kennedy"},{"type":"speech","time":1403017800,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Ideally one would like to grow the retail economy to a level that fills the town centre and provides a good living for out-of-town businesses.

Dishwashers and washing machines that are more than five years old use 26 litres of water every cycle, whereas new washing machines and dishwashers use six litres.  We are working on a document for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan to consider, on equipment that is more energy and water efficient.  We want to try to have some incentive scheme to get old machines off the market and are also working with WEEE Ireland to get in new stuff.

Mr. David Fitzsimons kindly came to Charleville and worked with retailers.  They set up a town team and the local council provided training.  It has had a significant effect and does work.  Charleville is a small rural town; it is not the prettiest town in Ireland, even though it has very good architecture.  Signage was a major issue.  One of the ideas that came from that experience was that towns that did very well in the Tidy Towns competition also did very well in the retail sector.  I do not necessarily agree with all the talk about rates because rates need to be paid.  I used to run my own business and would rather see money being invested in making towns prettier than rates being cut.  We also need to look at signage.  We have a great many plastic signs that are very tacky looking and give a bad impression.  We have all spoken about retail offerings as being an experience.  We need a range of retail offerings in towns; we need to have creches, nice parks and places where one can sit down, coffee shops and places to which one can go for lunch.  As I remember from Mr. Fitzsimons's talk, during the week one buys for convenience but at the weekend one buys from experience.  One needs to have a range of shops.  In the small town in which I live we have a very well known butcher shop which brings a lot of people to the town.  We have just spent &euro;80,000 on refurbishing the square and planting new trees.  One can see the effect on the town; it does work.  That is where we should concentrate our efforts as opposed to discussing taxes.  We have to pay taxes, whether it be water charges or property tax or an increase in income tax or some other tax.  We should focus on seeing what we can do in towns rather than talking about the things we cannot do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014061700013#N00900","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speech","time":1403017800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I apologise for having to leave for a few minutes as something urgent arose.<\/p><p>  I know the team very well and about the work they do.

I do not know what the solution is to the problem of car parking.  The main problem is that shopkeepers and their employees are the major offenders, if one does not have a charge.  One probably has to charge for car parking.  I think having a 15 minute charge is better than a two hour charge because it means that people can drop in and buy a newspaper, but it also means that if they are there for two hours, they can add another 15 minutes.

We have circulated a lengthy statement and I will synopsise it for the purpose of this discussion.<\/p><p>  Significant progress has been made to date in the introduction of the housing assistance payment, HAP, involving the transfer of long-term rent supplement recipients to housing authorities.  The framework for this is provided for in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014, which will be before the House again this evening.<\/p><p>  The key parts of the Bill provide for a new procedure to replace section 62 of the Housing Act 1966 that will enable housing authorities to recover possession of their dwellings from households in serious breach of their tenancy agreements, including engaging in anti-social behaviour.  An incremental purchase scheme for existing houses is also provided and that will replace the 1995 tenant purchase scheme.  There is a legal framework for the housing assistance payment, which will include provision for a direct deduction of rental contributions from welfare payments.<\/p><p>  In essence the new housing support mechanism will facilitate the transfer of responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to households with a long-term housing need from the Department of Social Protection, from which it is currently provided through the rent supplement scheme, to housing authorities.  Following the introduction of the housing assistance payment, rent supplement will continue to be operated by the Department of Social Protection for households in the private rented sector which in the main will support people who have become unemployed and therefore require short-term income support to pay their rent.  A key feature of the new payment scheme is that those in the scheme will be allowed to remain in the scheme following their return to employment, thus removing a significant barrier to employment.  The roll-out of the scheme on a pilot administrative basis has been in place since the end of March in Limerick city and county where it began.  The intention is to extend it to six further local authorities following enactment of the Bill.<\/p><p>  As the Chairman has said, the main issue we will discuss is meeting social housing demand.  The budgetary provision for the Department's housing programme, at more than &euro;587 million in 2014, is effectively maintained at 2013 levels.  This is a change from the pattern of recent years in which we faced reductions in allocation.  In the region of &euro;273 million of our budget is allocated to housing.  Compared to 2008 when close on 8,500 new social housing units were delivered at a cost of more than &euro;1.1 billion, we now have to explore alternative housing supply routes to address housing needs.  The Minister has signalled a return to modest levels of new housing construction with an announcement last months of 1,000 new starts during 2014-2015.  The intention is to build on this by way of a rolling programme as the State's finances permit.  Around 6,000 social housing units from various sources will be provided during 2014.<\/p><p>  The 2014 Budget Statement included a special provision of &euro;50 million to fund infrastructural investment primarily in the housing area.  Some &euro;15 million of this is being set aside to support the social housing construction programme.  During the next two years, an investment of &euro;68 million in a local authority house building programme will deliver some 442 social units for families in need of housing.  <\/p><p>  As part of the Government's &euro;200 million stimulus package announced in May, a further &euro;50 million will be provided for social housing delivery.  Some &euro;20 million of this will go towards new local authority construction and &euro;20 million will be used to fund the refurbishment of an additional 1,000 vacant units and &euro;10 million will be used for the acquisition of properties in the Dublin area to meet urgent homelessness needs.<\/p><p>  We are targeting voids.  A sum of &euro;15 million was ring-fenced for a new initiative aimed at returning vacant and boarded-up houses to productive use.  It will cost approximately &euro;16,000 per unit and in unit cost terms this is very good value for money.  It will be possible to retrofit some 952 properties to a high standard which will become immediately available to families on waiting lists.  This is one of quickest and most cost-effective ways of increasing the housing stock.  It has positive spin offs in terms of local employment and improving the quality of neighbourhoods around the country.  The additional stimulus funding of &euro;20 million will enable the refurbishment of a further 1,000 vacant properties.  We hope that up to 900 of the properties will be completed before the end of 2014.  A priority is that people with a disability and older people will be accommodated and &euro;10 million of the budget day stimulus fund has been allocated to grants for older people and people with a disability.  The schemes have been reviewed and are now targeted at certain groups.  Funding is up 12% on last year's allocation and we would expect an additional 800 households will benefit in the coming year.<\/p><p>  Other lines of spending contribute to meeting demand and includes the capital assistance scheme, which provides funding to approved housing bodies.  Approximately &euro;30 million will be available this year to fund projects that are under way and to progress new ones and we expect that 350 new homes will be delivered during 2014-2015, including almost 200 units for homeless people.  In addition, and as a result of a special initiative to address homelessness, funding of more than &euro;10 million has been allocated for the acquisition of 66 units in the Dublin city area.  The role of the approved housing bodies, AHBs, has expanded greatly in recent years and will continue to be very important in the years ahead.<\/p><p>  Regeneration remains a priority.  The most significant regeneration programme ever undertaken in the country, Ballymun, is now nearing completion and since 1999 some 2,000 new social homes have been provided and almost 1,400 new private homes and a new main street, public parks and community projects have been funded.  The capital provision for regeneration this year is &euro;70 million.  The wind-down of Ballymun will facilitate the expansion of regeneration activities in Dublin city, Cork city, Limerick city and elsewhere.<\/p><p>  The Government is committed to addressing homelessness in a holistic and comprehensive way to end involuntary long-term homelessness by 2016.<\/p> <p>A policy implementation team is in place at senior level to drive the implementation plan, recently approved by Government.  The team will report on a quarterly basis to the Cabinet committee on social policy.<\/p><p> Recently the Government produced a strategy for the construction sector which is designed to tackle the various issues to which the chairman alluded, which present in terms of the housing market generally and the delivery of housing supply.  Within that the Department has a particular focus on the social housing space and is mandated by the construction strategy to produce a social housing strategy by the end of quarter three this year.  Obviously we have commenced work on that already.  The strategy will contain clear and measurable actions that are to be taken to increase the supply of social housing where it is most needed and, most important, reduce the number of people on housing waiting lists in the next five years.  Our priority, therefore, must be to match housing supply with demographic factors and to provide social housing supports in an affordable and sustainable way.  It is essential that the State continues to put in place the basis for a significant and continuing supply of accommodation for social housing purposes and to address housing need in a flexible, co-ordinated and diverse way.  It cannot be the one-size-fits-all solutions we were in a position to afford in the past.<\/p><p> The Government's 2011 housing policy statement outlines that the priority for Government is to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support and that must continue to be the case.  After my colleague has made her statement we will be happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014061700003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Layde","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403015100,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it.  I will speak about the role of the Department of Social Protection's rent supplement scheme.  In any discussion of rent supplement, it is important to be clear that the purpose of the scheme is to provide short-term income support to people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  More than &euro;344 million has been provided for the scheme in 2014.  Currently, there are approximately 76,000 rent supplement recipients, of whom more than 50,000 have been in payment for more than 18 months.  The Department provides relevant details of these long-term claimants to the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government with a view to transferring them to the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.<\/p><p>  Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Limits are set at levels that enable eligible households to secure basic suitable rented accommodation and the maximum limits are generally reviewed every 18 months.  The most recent review was completed in June 2013.  Despite pressures on the social protection budget, the last review saw rent limits increase in line with market rents in some areas including Dublin and Galway with Dublin limits increasing by a weighted average of some 9%.    <\/p><p>  A new rent limit review has commenced and will feed into the budgetary process.  This review will involve a comprehensive analysis of information from a range of sources including rental tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, the Central Statistics Office rental indices and websites advertising rental properties to ascertain both the costs and market trends for private rented accommodation.  The Department will also be seeking the views from a number of stakeholders including the local staff administering the scheme and NGOs such as Threshold, Focus Ireland, the Simon Community, Society of St. Vincent de Paul, and so on.<\/p><p>  In some areas, particularly in Dublin, prospective tenants, including those seeking access to rent supplement, are finding it increasingly difficult to secure accommodation due to reduced availability of private rented accommodation. <\/p><p>  I avail of the opportunity to assure the committee that Department of Social Protection officials have considerable experience in dealing with customers of the scheme and continue to make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.  Staff in the Department&rsquo;s community welfare service have discretionary powers to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant, for example, when dealing with applicants who are homeless or who are at risk of losing their tenancy.  That approximately 76,000 people are currently in receipt of rent supplement proves that a significant number of landlords are accommodating applicants of the scheme and that rent supplement recipients are being accommodated. <\/p><p>  The Department also provides support to persons towards rent deposits under the exceptional needs payments, ENPs.  This form of assistance is very important to those on low incomes who rely on the private rented market to meet their housing needs.  Last year, some 4,300 people were assisted with rent deposits at a cost of &euro;2.1 million. <\/p><p>  In addition and in view of the current supply difficulties, the Dublin local authorities in conjunction with voluntary organisations have finalised a protocol with the Department in order that families at risk of losing existing private rented accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf.   This initiative was launched this morning.  These cases will be assessed on an individual basis having regard to the individual circumstances and families requiring additional support will receive the necessary assistance.  In effect the Government has two initiatives to deal with long-term reliance on rent supplement.  One is the rental accommodation scheme which is in operation since 2004 and the more recent housing assistance payment scheme.  <\/p><p>  At the end of March 2014 local authorities had transferred a total of almost 48,900 households from rent supplement on to the rental accommodation scheme.  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to transfer responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need to local authorities under HAP.  Officials in the Department of Social Protection are working closely with those in the lead Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and the local authorities in piloting HAP on an administrative basis in Limerick City and County Council which will be followed by further roll out of HAP to selected local authorities during the remainder of the year. <\/p><p>  The household budget facility, operated by An Post on behalf of the Department of Social Protection, will be used in the early stages of HAP to provide housing authority tenants with the facility to deduct rents directly from their weekly social welfare payments.  Legislative amendments specific to housing authority rents were introduced by the Department in January 2014 to increase the effectiveness of the repayment system.  One of the key benefits that HAP will bring is the removal of barriers for people, perceived or otherwise, currently in receipt of rent supplement in returning to employment which is consistent with the Government's commitments under the Pathways to Work programme.  This represents a significant improvement and will facilitate the approximately 33,100 rent recipients currently on the live register in returning to full-time employment.  When HAP is fully in place, rent supplement will over time return to its original intention of being a short-term payment. <\/p><p>  I trust the presentation is of assistance to the committee and I look forward to assisting with any questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014061700004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Faughnan"},{"type":"speech","time":1403015100,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Helen Faughnan.

This meeting comes in the context of the housing Bill which is going through the House.  Many issues are arising about which we are worried, one of which is that there are 76,000 people in receipt of rent supplement.  There is a proposal under the HAP project which is being piloted in Limerick to bring it under the control of local authorities.  One of the fears is that the Bill counts this as adequate housing.  I tabled an amendment to say that it is not adequate housing but it was firmly resisted by the Government.  This could mean, similar to what happened with RAS in 2011, that people could be taken off the housing list because they would seem to be housed.  I do not know what is the opinion of the witnesses on that issue.  That could mean that tens of thousands of people could be taken off the housing list if that was to happen.  I would like to hear what the witnesses have to say on that matter.<\/p><p>  It was stated that the staff have discretion when it comes to rent supplement.  They may have discretion sometimes, some give deposits and some do not.  There is terrible inconsistency across the country in respect of rent supplement.  We know the limit has been increased but there have been huge problems in dealing with the welfare officers on the issue and with landlords.  When this is transferred to HAP we will see the real cost.  Irrespective of whether we like it, many people have been topping up with landlords on a large scale.  I am not sure what that will show up when it is transferred to the local authority.  <\/p><p>  The homeless situation is at crisis point.  I have never seen it so bad.  There are approximately 200 families in hotels each night, incurring a cost of &euro;16,000 per day.<\/p> <p>Yet at the same time more people are becoming homeless.  I know an instruction has gone out to local authorities to house as many homeless people as they can.  The danger in all of this is that those on the current housing lists will end up the next homeless as a result.  If we are trying to reach the 2016 target, we may actually be creating more problems.<\/p><p> The Supreme Court has ruled on section 62 of the 1966 Housing Act.  I am happy that this is being dealt with.<\/p><p> Since 2008, over &euro;1 billion has been cut from the housing budget.  Now, it is being brought close to 2013 levels.  Most social housing provision seems to be moving in the direction of the voluntary housing sector.  I believe local authorities should be the main agents in dealing with housing.  Could local authorities borrow on the open market for housing provision without being tied to the troika or otherwise, based on their housing stock, just as the voluntary housing sector can?  The Minister claims it can be done but local authorities claim it cannot.  Can someone tell me otherwise?<\/p><p> Should the PRTB include local authority tenants too in dealing with disputes and so forth?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014061700004#E00500","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403015700,"counter":91,"content":"<p>On the demand for social housing being met when a person enters the HAP scheme, the principle exists already in the RAS.

Generally, people going into HAP will have sourced their own accommodation.  However, it will be required to meet appropriate housing standards and will be inspected by the local authorities to ensure it does.  The intention is that accommodation provided under HAP will be comparable to, if not better than, accommodation available under other social housing delivery mechanisms.  We would contend it represents parity of treatment in that sense.<\/p><p>  Top-ups are a source of concern.  One of the advantages of HAP is that it will strengthen regulation within the sector.  One of the things we would wish to counter would be any suggestion of illegality.<\/p><p>  We have an implementation plan to deal with homelessness.  The situation in Dublin with homeless families is of particular concern and will be a particular target for us.  Under the implementation plan, Dublin City Council is preparing a specific action plan to deal with the concentration of the problem in Dublin.  This will be available in the coming weeks.  Already today, we saw the launch of a prevention policy and initiative to prevent families from falling into that position.<\/p><p>  The reduction in house building is a consequence of the overall national macroeconomic situation.

It has the capacity, as Deputy Ellis said, to borrow off-balance-sheet.

It is important that we continue to engage and debate the important issues around housing.  There is a genuine concern on the ground that there is a real threat of a full-blown housing crisis affecting not just major urban areas but smaller local authority areas which have long housing waiting lists.  Much action is needed on several fronts.  It was not today or yesterday when many of these problems arose.  Many years ago, when the property boom was in its heyday, government policy and local authorities abdicated their responsibility for building housing units for people with genuine housing needs.  We now have to catch up in rectifying these policies that have gone wrong.<\/p><p>  While some are critical of RAS, I believe there is a place for it, provided it is managed well and is properly resourced to ensure that private accommodation is quality-assured.  Will the officials explain to me the resources that go into inspections of private rented accommodation?  How regularly are these inspections reported to the Department?<\/p><p>  There is much criticism of local authorities for no longer building social housing.  We all know from our constituencies that a number of local authority units are left vacant not just for months but for years.  An attempt was made recently to address this by allocating moneys to local authorities to deal with these units.<\/p> <p>I believe more needs to be done in turning around vacant units in order to let them again as soon as possible.  I acknowledge that the officials may be looking outside the box in some respects but have they considered involving SOLAS, the new training body in place of the dissolved F&Aacute;S, to use apprentices and redundant tradespersons to refurbish these vacant units?  Thinking outside the box, could the trade unions and local authorities play a role in having these houses refurbished?<\/p><p> Has the option of relocation been considered to deal with the demand for housing?  I accept there is significant pressure on housing in Dublin; however, there may be private sector units available down the county that would be suitable for families, if they were willing to consider relocation.  I think that happened in the past.  I am not suggesting that people should be forced to relocate, but should families have the option of being housed in a unit down the country at half of what it would cost in Dublin?  Is this option considered when families are desperate for a house and need a new start?<\/p><p> Deputy Ellis mentioned the families who are living in hotels and B&amp;Bs and I agree that it is a scandal that families would have to reside in a hotel bedroom.  We must do all in our power to address that.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the role the voluntary housing associations play.  Only for them we would be in deep trouble.  Is it only local-authority-approved projects that are considered for financial support or can community-led projects be considered for support?  I am aware that the very proactive community in Dunhill, County Waterford, bought land to build social housing and repopulate this rural area.  This project is down the picking list of the local authority because Dunhill is not a large urban area.  The community could build 12 to 20 units in a beautiful area of County Waterford but because they are not prioritised they are off the radar.  These houses could be built at a competitive rate compared to the cost of building in a city.  Can we not think in terms of community-led initiatives that can build on the services available in the community?  The community in Dunhill have been proactive and they are looking for support to build housing units.  Why can we not support more of these types of initiative rather than depending on the local authority to provide housing in larger areas?<\/p><p> These are some of the ideas that I would like to put to the officials.  I see that a crisis is pending if we do not act soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014061700005#F00800","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403016300,"counter":99,"content":"<p>We have less than five minutes to address this issue.

We already have a Government policy statement on housing from 2011.  This will be elaborated on and it will become a very detailed social housing strategy with measurable outcomes.  The aim is to make significant inroads into waiting list and to address housing need.  That is a key priority as identified in the construction strategy.<\/p><p>  When replying to Deputy Ellis on the quality of rented accommodation, I said that local authorities will be responsible for ensuring that where the accommodation is State-funded it will reach the appropriate standard.  Of course, legal requirements also apply in the private rented sector, whether or not the local authorities are involved in direct funding.  As I pointed out, the PRTB is responsible for that.<\/p><p>  Specific dedicated funding is provided to the local authorities from the registration moneys collected by the PRTB.  I would be happy to provide the Deputy with full details of the inspection programme, the amount of money expended in recent years and the number of inspections carried out.  We will provide that to the members of the committee.<\/p><p>  As I mentioned in my opening statement and as the Deputy rightly points out, it is completely unacceptable that significant numbers of local authority properties should be vacant for a very long time, given the level of demand we face.  I mentioned that the additional funding available to us now will allow us to get upwards of 2,000 units back into service in the coming months and the balance next year.  It will be absolutely crucial to maintain that position. <\/p><p>  I understand that one homeless family has relocated outside Dublin.  We will be looking at the potential of offering people the option of relocating, but clearly it must be a voluntary scheme.  It is clearly unacceptable that people should be accommodated in hotels and B&amp;Bs, even on a cost-benefit basis, leaving the human aspect to one side for a moment.  It does not make sense and we do not want to see it continue.<\/p><p>  The focus of the implementation plan on homelessness is housing-led.  We are focused on finding long-term housing solutions for people who are homeless or are in danger of becoming homeless.  The option of being accommodated in a hotel is not sustainable.  This was something that Dublin City Council had to do in the short term to deal with the considerable increase in the number of homeless families presenting.<\/p><p>  The Deputy raised the question of community involvement.  Any community group can seek to become an approved housing body.  The prioritisation issue works on the basis that housing authorities have a statutory responsibility in each area.  There are now 31 local authorities.  The Department requests the local authorities to prioritise funding based on local need and local analysis.  We hope that useful projects do not miss out as a result of prioritisation, but the funding is finite and there must be prioritisation.  The Department relies on the housing authorities to advise it in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014061700006#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Layde"},{"type":"speech","time":1403016300,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Some 50% of the 90,000 people on the housing waiting list reside in six local authority areas - Dublin city, Fingal, South Dublin, Kildare, Cork city and Cork county.  Homelessness is now emerging as a significant issue outside the capital.  One solution is being proposed in the short term, but only in the Dublin area.  Just this week a dozen people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness called to my office.  Eleven of the 12 who called have children.  When they turn up at the local authority offices they are told to find a couch somewhere.  One individual is sleeping in her car.  There is no solution outside the capital.  I could not be more critical of the limited approach of what is being proposed.  It is of course a short-term measure, and it is welcome that there is some initiative, but the fact that it is so exclusive, given that the homelessness problem is demonstrable, means that it absolutely must be revisited as a matter of urgency.<\/p><p>  I understand that Kildare is the lead authority for the mid-Leinster region.  The local authority had an allocation of &euro;80,000 for HAP in Counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow but ran out of money in March.  There is no provision for additional staff in the local authorities to administer the HAP scheme.  There will be ongoing engagement with landlords, and this will demand time.  It cannot be done without staff.  The staffing ratios in local authorities are very different depending on the region.  I have highlighted this to the Minister on numerous occasions.  Meath County Council has 620 staff for a population that is 30,000 higher than the combined population of Limerick city and Limerick county, while Limerick County Council has a staff of 1075.  There is no capacity in some local authority areas, especially in areas that are encountering the most contact from people in difficulties.  These local authorities do not have the staff to deal with it.<\/p> <p>What landlord will come forward and offer his or her house for less than the market rent or the amount he or she would receive under the RAS?  That is what is proposed.  Landlords are pulling out of the RAS and the committee was informed about this by county managers recently.  They will receive a lower amount under the HAP scheme than under the RAS.  They will not participate in the RAS, but they will participate in the HAP scheme.  The only positive aspect from their perspective is that they will be paid directly rather than by the tenant.<\/p><p> This scheme represents a fundamental shift in social policy whereby somebody will not be housed but will be given funding to rent somebody else's property.  It is a short-term initiative in most cases.  The rental market comprises accidental landlords who own one or two houses.  Following this shift in social policy, it may well be that the standard of accommodation will be reasonable because much of the stock is modern and will be inspected, but three or four months after the inspection, somebody may have to seek a lease for another year because there tends to be a short-term approach to the leasing of private rented accommodation.  The scheme will not work because landlords will not come forward.  It is a dangerous change in social policy, particularly where children are involved.  There will never be security about where they will go to school, live, make friends and generally be socialised.  That is the big failure in this proposal.  In the context of regeneration, there were failures in the past.  I predict that this will be one of the greatest failures.<\/p><p> It is welcome that the Departments are examining alternatives in drawing down the large sums available from the EIB and pension funds.  That is necessary and I would like local authorities to have an involvement.  I do not mind the ramping up of the voluntary housing sector.  However, security of tenure is the most important issue.  People must be enabled to make homes rather than being continually on the move.<\/p><p> Of the 6,000 houses to be supplied this year, 3,700 are designated for the RAS.  Are they being taken on or are these numbers being rolled over from last year?  Are they additional houses?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014061700006#G00400","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403016900,"counter":103,"content":"<p>On the homelessness policy, I stress that it is a national policy and that the national implementation plan is precisely that.  I have mentioned that Dublin City Council has a specific action plan which it is finalising, but it comes in the context of the overall implementation plan and is designed to apply the principle specifically to Dublin where the problem is concentrated.  However, it is recognised that homelessness presents as an issue in other areas also and the implementation plan reflects this.  The composition of the high level group overseeing the plan reflects this, in that while the DCC chief executive officer is a member, one of the local authority chief executive officers from outside Dublin is also a member.  The HSE representative is based outside Dublin; therefore, it is very much a national plan.  The prevention campaign launched earlier today is a particular initiative of Dublin City Council in collaboration with the Department of Social Protection.  Obviously, there is the potential to consider extending it elsewhere.<\/p><p>  On the specific issue relating to Kildare, the funding arrangement that applies to the regional homelessness groupings is that each grouping enters into a service protocol with the Department and funds can then be drawn down.  This has yet to be finalised with Kildare County Council and once it has been done, the requisite funding can be made available.<\/p><p>  With regard to the resources available for the HAP, clearly it is a major undertaking by local authorities.  We are working very closely with them and the County and City Management Association to ensure the necessary resources are in place.  The work taking place in Limerick on a trial basis which will extend to the other local authorities in the latter part of the year will allow us to test this in the field and ensure the necessary resources are available.  As the Deputy pointed out, the availability of resources varies from local authority to local authority, as does the volume of customers; therefore, we need to ensure the necessary resources are available.  We will keep the matter under continuous review.<\/p><p>  The HAP represents a significant change in how we deliver social housing.  We believe it is progressive.  It is an evolution from the RAS which has been in place for a number of years and worked successfully.  It is not the case that the private sector providing the accommodation will be in any way unregulated.  The contractual arrangement will be between the local housing authority and the landlord.  The tenant will pay a differential rent to the local authority and there will be a clear relationship which will include a quality control and standards relationship between the local housing authority and landlords, be they large landlords, of whom there will probably be more in the future, or landlords who own one or two properties, to whom the Deputy alluded.<\/p><p>  We seek to promote security of tenure.  The important point is that once somebody is deemed to be eligible for social housing and has an established social housing need, there is a continuing obligation on the local authority to ensure it is met even in circumstances where, for whatever reason, their existing accommodation becomes unavailable. <\/p><p> On the specific question of the RAS, it will continue this year in terms of the roll-over of customers already in it and with provision for approximately 2,500 further transitions under the scheme from rent supplement in the current year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014061700007#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Layde"},{"type":"speech","time":1403016900,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I welcome the officials.

Will an adjustment to the limits be ready for introduction in the budget in October?<br \/>I refer to the HAP and the shift in social policy, as it was described by Deputy Catherine Murphy, <i>vis-&aacute;-vis<\/i>the housing of applicants by local authorities.   Has anybody consulted an applicant on a housing waiting list about this?  Up to now, people applied for a local authority house to become a local authority tenant to live on a local authority estate and aspire to buying that house and using it to move or to make their family life in it.  It seems the Department has proposed the opposite.  A scheme is being introduced which will not provide security of tenure for participants and which will take no account of the fact that landlords sign up to timescales that suit them.  Many of them have mortgaged houses and if the market picks up, they may sell them, which would mean the tenant no longer having accommodation.  What does the scheme provide for tenants in improving their quality of life?  That is an important issue.  <br \/>I welcome the provision of mechanisms in legislation to deal with serious breaches of tenancy agreements.<\/p> <p>I would also like to ask about how it will operate in the local authorities.  All town councils are gone as of 1 June.  With regard to all of the local knowledge that was in those town councils across the country, how has that been transferred to the county level, which now deals with housing, or has any work been done on it?  I have made inquiries and done some research on this at national level only to discover that, in many cases, the people who dealt with housing at town council level have not been consulted and there has been no handover process of a massive volume of local knowledge.  How are we going to handle that?<\/p><p> I want to refer to the pilot project under way in Limerick.  The last line in the paragraph states that the lessons learned from the pilots will be vital.  Have we learned any lessons yet?  If so, will the witnesses give us some detail on that?<\/p><p> With regard to the tenant purchase scheme which is imminent, we are awaiting further information.  Will the witnesses give us what information they can on the detail of the tenant purchase scheme?

That is one cautionary point.<\/p><p>  In terms of the benefits to the tenant of moving to HAP, there is sometimes a perception among people on the live register in particular that they will lose rent supplement when they go into full-time employment.

Not only that, it would seem there is an increased shift to the private sector.  My question is how it can be considered value for money for the taxpayer that &euro;344 million was paid out, and more the previous year given it was cut last year, rather than using that money to build social and affordable housing.<\/p><p>  I have some additional questions with regard to HAP.  I note that page 2 states there will be a mandatory direct deduction facility to recover rent contributions so, in other words, people will have to give permission that their social welfare can be taken, even if they do not have rent arrears - that is what I am reading here.  I believe that is a shocking invasion of people's privacy.  There are many people who go into rent arrears because there is austerity raging out there in society.  Rich people do not have such a facility that their rent or mortgages will be deducted by the State and I do not see why council tenants or people on HAP should either.  It does not even give a timeframe for the arrears so this will literally be taken.  It is also a huge reflection on the social tenant.<\/p><p>  How can it be said that HAP is parity, which I believe is the word that was used?  The key ingredient missing is security of tenure.  If a person has children in a school, that person could lose the property a year later, or if the landlord decides to sell the property, the tenant has to move somewhere else and is on the trail again.<\/p> <p>It is pretended that there is something in this for people on the waiting list.  People want to live in communities; they do not want to live in transient situations.  <\/p><p> The other question is how long the HAP leases will be.  I am struggling to see what the difference is between this and the RAS.  The RAS is utterly defunct; no landlord wants to go near it.  It was mentioned in the second presentation that payments have kept up with increased rents, but they have not.  In my own area of Fingal, the maximum payment that one can get is &euro;950.  One will not find a house in Fingal for &euro;950; the going rate is &euro;1,300 for such a property.  The payments are 50% behind what one could be asked to pay.  <\/p><p> I do not agree with the State making those payments to private landlords.  My position is that there should rent controls in the Bill.  It is a huge opportunity missed that there is not.  It is claimed that people move out very quickly, but as the witness said, 65% of people on rent allowance are on it for 18 or more months.  It is not just a temporary thing; it can be very long term.  I wonder why the Department has chosen to launch a privatisation when no private landlords are available to take part in it.  How high will the HAP payments to landlords go?  Is there a limit on them?  Is that public information?  The tenant or the HAP participant has to pay a differential rent amount, so how much is the State paying?  <\/p><p> On house building, 6,000 housing units are spoken of to come on stream, but it is disappointing that only 700 of them will be constructed or acquired.  RAS is still being looked down on.  I cannot see 2,500 properties coming on stream, or 1,200 for leasing.  I am not sure whether developers have a stock.  The 1,800 refurbished properties are not new stock, so they should not be counted as increased provision.  This is a Housing Bill with no houses.  That is the disappointing thing for the 100,000 families who are stuck in this situation.  It is disappointing to see taxpayers' money being shovelled over to private landlords rather than used for the construction of houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014061700008#J01200","speaker":"1195","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403018100,"counter":118,"content":"<p>On the mandatory rent deductions, part of the issue with local authorities is the large number of arrears that tenants have built up over time.

They were the subject of a review by the Comptroller and Auditor General and were found to represent value for money.<\/p><p>  It is important to consider leasing in the context of the public funding that is available to us, which is obviously significantly less than was available in the years when the economy was thriving.  By using that money to lease properties rather than to build or acquire them, we can produce more properties more quickly, with the same amount of money, to address social housing need.  It still needs to represent value for money and, as I have said, it has been the subject of a formal assessment by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who found that, on balance - and these things are always on balance - it represented value for money.<\/p><p>  The intention behind the direct deduction facility, as my colleague said, is to assist people in ensuring that they do not develop arrears.  Local authorities are facing the challenge of combined arrears approaching &euro;60 million, which is clearly an issue.  Social housing is provided by the State, as are welfare payments.  Those welfare payments include resources for people to meet their accommodation needs.  Social tenants pay a subsidised rent which is linked to their income.  The Government has decided that it is appropriate that direct deduction should apply in those cases.<\/p><p>  On the security of tenure issue, people who are accommodated in the private rented sector, whether or not they are receiving State support, are obviously in a position where their tenancy can legally be terminated and properties can become unavailable, but, the point on that that I made earlier is a valid one.  If one compares that person's position today with the position that they will be in when they enter HAP, one sees that they will have moved from a situation of being entirely within the private rented sector and relying on income support to maintain themselves to one in which they will be within the social housing support structure under a housing authority, with that housing authority having continuing obligations to that person.  They will have the facility then to move ultimately, if they have a continuing need for social housing, within the social housing space to other forms of social housing and even to purchasing a property through the incremental purchase schemes. <\/p><p>  The Bill does not address the issue of rent control as such, but the Minister with responsibility for housing and planning has asked the PRTB to carry out some research, particularly in the Dublin context but also more broadly, on the issues that are now presenting in the rental market and the upward pressure on rents.  It has been asked to report by the end of this month so as to inform the development of proposals in the social housing strategy around how issues in the private rented sector impact on social housing directly or indirectly.<\/p><p>  On the additional 6,000 units being provided, some 1,200 by leasing, we believe that that target is realisable.  NAMA is one source, but local authorities lease properties from a variety of landlords around the country.  On counting refurbished units into that total, those are units that have been out of service for a very long time and, but for this investment, would remain out of service, so we think that it is legitimate to regard them as, in effect, new, additional opportunities for people on waiting lists to be housed.<\/p> <p>The Housing Bill is about housing, not houses.

The motivation on the other side of the coin in the context of Part 5 was in part to provide social housing units but also to ensure commercial developments included social housing.  In the same way, in applying that rationale to large concentrations of units becoming available through NAMA, there was a concern not to replicate the mistakes of the past when very large social housing estates were built on greenfield sites in isolation from other communities and services.  Local authorities and NAMA are looking at this issue and certainly in the context of the social housing strategy we will look at it again.  We will try to maintain the principle; it is of no benefit to people in social housing or the wider community if there is a process of concentration, of which the 500 units in Tallaght are an example.  With the local authority, NAMA and the housing agency we are looking at ways in which we might be able to use these units creatively.  There have been a number of initiatives.  For example, one of the approved housing bodies has a scheme whereby it lets both on a social and commercial basis.  In other words, it took a block of units from NAMA, some of which were let commercially and some as social housing such that there is a mix of tenures.

My first question was on the 500 units available there.  Having listened to the delegates, I want a statement from the housing department.  Obviously, there is a social mix of 20%, which is stated policy.  If we are to be creative, we always have to bear in mind that we do not want to go back to what happened in the past.  People in Tallaght are worried out of their minds.  It is a great place in which to live.  It has great facilities, including the Luas, the hospital, educational facilities and so on.  I seek an assurance that social integration will be provided for in any policy on NAMA units, wherever they are located, particularly where 500 units are to be brought on stream.  The social cohesion of society must be prioritised.  I want to have the up-in-the-air vision out of the way in terms of the 500 units in Tallaght being automatically transferred en bloc for social housing.  <\/p><p>  My second question is on homelessness.  I welcome the provision of the extra &euro;10 million.  Taking account of the special purpose vehicle in the various housing bodies coming together with provision for ERDF funding of 25% and the 50% loan from the finance agency, that leaves the Government with a figure of only 25%.  Is the special purpose vehicle being used to put a housing block in place for homeless persons?  How many units have been started and how many will be provided as the ERDF is the only vehicle available to draw down funding which is badly needed?  There are more than two ways to skin a cat and get money from the European Union.<\/p><p>  My third question is on succession.  Obviously, people have a right to buy local authority houses, but this only applies to those who can afford to do so.  If older people living in rented accommodation die and if grandchildren are attending school in the area, can their families inherit the property?  Perhaps the delegates might make a statement on how this issue could be addressed better?<\/p><p>  It is welcome that persons returning to employment will not lose the HAP.  I understand the scheme is being rolled out to a further six local authorities.  When is it envisaged that it will be rolled out to all local authorities?  It has been stated by various Senators and Deputies that people who are included in the HAP and removed from the housing waiting list are worried that they may lose their place on the list.  If one is homeless, one badly needs a home.  If one is living in  poor accommodation, one also badly needs a home.  If a person is in included in the HAP scheme or the RAS, he or she has a roof over his or her head, but he or she wants to look forward to a time when he or she will have permanency.  Is there a methodology in place to ensure a place on the list is not lost for those who transfer to the HAP?<\/p><p>  I welcome the new tenant purchase scheme, but I have not seen any reference in any of the documentation to those included in the shared-ownership scheme.  The delegates can correct me if I am wrong; perhaps I missed it.  They are a group who were the new poor when property prices went sky high.  They had some money for a deposit and entered the shared ownership scheme with local authorities, but now they are carrying the can, as local authorities take over properties.  Can anything be done for such persons who are in negative equity?  Something is being done for people who are in negative equity under every other scheme.<\/p><p>  I would like to see a minimum lease term to ensure security of tenure, as happens in Germany.  Perhaps we might receive a statement on that issue.  Ireland is the only country in Europe in which people are afraid to rent.  In every other country it is common practice.  People are not scared out of their wits because they have rights that secure tenure.   <\/p><p>  Is provision made for persons who wish to self-build in a case where a family gives them a site?  This was provided for in the past, but I do not know if it still applies.<\/p><p>  I welcome the regeneration schemes.  Being an ex-councillor in south Dublin, it was one area that prided itself on not having many vacant units, although there were some.  The allocation of &euro;20 million is welcome to ensure voids are upgraded and work is speeded up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014061700011#M00300","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1403019300,"counter":140,"content":"<p>The Senator's time has expired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014061700011#M00400","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403019300,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I will try to answer the various questions raised by the Senator.

I have been engaged in researching the area of effective tax rates over a considerable time period.  My initial research was conducted for a PhD thesis submitted to the London School of Economics in 1985 and subsequently published as a book.  I would like to briefly describe my research approach because it illustrates a number of issues that arise in measuring effective tax rates.  First, the concept itself is relatively simple.  The tax rate paid on corporate profits for an individual firm can be defined as tax paid divided by pre-tax profits.  When we try to measure this empirically, abiguities immediately arise.<\/p><p>  The tables included in my circulated opening statement include an illustration of the foregoing in respect of an Irish public company.  Table 1 shows pre-tax profits and other data for the most recent three-year period and also shows three possible measures of effective tax rates.  Measure 1 shows the effective tax rate defined as the tax charge in the profit and loss account divided by pre-tax profits, again taken from the profit and loss account.  This measure is described in company accounts as \"the effective tax rate\".  Measure 2 shows the tax actually paid divided by pre-tax profits.  Cash actually paid is set out in the cash flow statement.  When I did my research initially, one had to calculate this, but it is now regularly produced in all cash flow statements of public companies.  The aggregate of tax actually paid is the number shown in Revenue statistics for corporate tax receipts in any given year.  If one aggregates that across the entire corporate sector, one should have the number shown in Revenue statistics, allowing for timing differences.  Measure 3 is similar to measure 2, but includes provision for accounting depreciation in the tax base - the denominator.  The reason for this is that accounting depreciation in contrast to other measures of depreciation such as accelerated depreciation is not a tax deductible expense.  We have a wider definition of the tax base and could make our other adjustments as well.<\/p><p>  Table 1 sets out the difference in the effective tax rate for 2013 across the three measures being 12.5% under measure 1, 4% under measure 2 and 2.7% under measure 3.  Measure 3 is often used in academic studies to estimate effective tax rates while measure 2 appears to be the measure of individual tax rates used in studies by the US Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, or PSI, in its various reports.  In almost all cases of which I am aware, the tax paid in the cash flow statements is less than the tax charge.<\/p><p>  Broad-based measures of effective tax rates may be estimated by first of all calculating individual tax rates for each firm.  Measures of effective tax rates for the economy as a whole can then be calculated by summing the data for individual companies across the entire economy.  This could be done by treating each firm as a separate observation and equally weighted, and calculating means and other distribution statistics.  In addition, averages could be calculated by aggregating data across all firms.  In this latter case, average effective tax rates will be dominated by firms with the largest profits and tax rates.  The bigger the firm, the greater the weighting it has in the aggregate data.  US Bureau of Economic Analysis data uses this latter approach.<\/p><p>  In an earlier study which I referred to, I estimated effective tax rates over the 21 year period 1964-1984 for all Irsh non-financial plcs treating each firm as an individual observation and then aggregating them in various ways.  However anomalies can arise.  Rather than paying corporation tax, a firm may receive corporation tax because of overpayments in previous years.  Hence the numerator will be negative resulting in a negative effective tax rate.  A firm could both receive tax payments in the current year and report losses in the current year.  In this case, both numerator and denominator are negative, -T\/-P, resulting in a positive effective tax rate.  A firm could pay tax even though losses were reported.  This could arise because corporate tax payments are paid in arrears.  Hence, the measure of effective tax rates is negative.  This is less likely to occur than in previous years because lags in corporate tax payments have been reduced.  A firm could report small positive tax payments but report low profits, resulting in a very high measured effective tax rates.  In large data sets all these problems arise.  One solution is to estimate effective tax rates over a running three year period.  However, anomalies will still remain.  A more usual approach is to estimate effective tax rates for only those firms reporting positive profits.<\/p><p>  It is likely that these issues are endemic to Irish data.  Table 2 in my presentation shows that for 2011, 1% of firms - 433 firms - account for 81.1% of corporate tax payments.  It is quite likely in fact that 50 firms account for in excess of 50% of total corporate tax payments.  I note that 76.8% of all firms account for 3.56% of corporate tax payments and 38.8% of firms report zero or negative net trading income.  Reporting zero or negative net trading income is not due to having zero taxable profits and tax payments on foot of being able to afford expensive accounting and tax advice, but because companies are making losses.  We have come through a very severe financial crisis.  Firms that report losses in one year are likely to report losses in succeeding years.  They may eventually close.  Finally, reported losses by banks will have had a major impact on corporate profitability in Ireland and measures of effective tax rates.<\/p><p>  I will say something briefly on aggregate data.  National accounts in Ireland are currently based on what is described as the income and expenditure approach and in future an output approach will be incorporated into the GDP compilation process.  It will be interesting to see what change that makes on the big numbers.  Aggregate data, such as profit estimates from the national accounts, ignores issues relating to the inclusion of firms making losses.  What one really wants is a measure of the effective tax rate on those firms making profits.  Aggregate data cannot be interpreted as indicating effective tax rates for the median or typical firm.  For this reason, empirical studies of measures of effective tax rates in the finance, accounting and taxation literature use data from accounting records - either publicly available or from surveys of firms which report their own accounting records as in the US Bureau of Economic Analysis data - rather than aggregate data contained in the national accounts.  I found in an earlier study of US Bureau of Economic Analysis data that the effective tax rates using such data on one measure was 2.2% while it was 3.8% on another measure.  That is for US companies incorporated in Ireland.<\/p><p>  In addition in Ireland, particular issues arise from the likely underestimation of profits arising in the IFSC.  The IFSC had over &euro;3 trillion in gross assets in 2011.  If we assume a net rate of return net of all expenses of 1%, that is &euro;20 billion.  However, it is very difficult to find those kinds of numbers in the national accounts.  The exclusion of those firms that are incorporated in Ireland but regarded as resident for corporate tax purposes in another jurisdiction poses another difficulty in estimating effective tax rates using aggregate data.<\/p><p>  I turn to the issue of company location.  The Department of Finance argues that these firms should be excluded from Irish data as they are not located within Ireland for corporate tax purposes albeit that they are incorporated here.  If a firm is incorporated in Ireland, the auditor must be located in Ireland by law.  If a company is registered in Ireland, the books of account must be maintained in Ireland.  Several of these companies that claim not to be tax resident in Ireland have employees here and hence are liable to pay employers' PRSI.  It is not then true that they are exempt in Ireland because they are tax resident in Bermuda.  If they have employees here, they must pay PRSI.  Several of these companies are liable for VAT and hence satisfy the requirements of residence for VAT purposes.  I acknowledge that those residence requirements are different from those for corporation tax purposes.  The European Court of Justice has ruled that the place of incorporation is key to where the central management and control exists.  Place of incorporation is therefore very important for corporate law purposes.  EUROSTAT regards brass plate firms with no fixed assets or employees as being located where they are incorporated, a rule which is likely to be followed by the Revenue Commissioners regarding the various brass plate firms located in the IFSC.<\/p><p>  In conclusion, estimating effective tax rates is best done using data extracted from company accounts.  Estimating effective tax rates from national accounts is likely to produce an underestimate of effective tax rates because of the inclusion of firms making losses as well as for other reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014061700003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Jim Stewart"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403014200,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I thank the Vice Chairman and members for their invitation to appear before the sub-committee on the issue of effective corporate tax rates.  We appreciate that it has invested much time in this issue and that others have made contributions to this module and the general public debate on effective tax rates.  The Irish Tax Institute has not published a specific report on effective corporate tax rates.  However, I hope our experience, knowledge and research will offer some insights and bring a greater understanding to an issue that is complex, detailed and very often difficult.<br \/>The debate on effective tax rates is part of the wider debate on international tax issues.  There is much attention focused on the matter in Ireland, given the high level of foreign direct investment, in particular by US companies.  The fact that US tax residence rules differ from the tax rules of most other countries has led to many of the tax complexities or issues at the centre of the tax debate globally.  Before talking about attempts to measure the effective corporate tax rates of a country, I would first like to focus on the principles of an effective corporate tax rate regime in a company, as that will help to bring some context to our discussion.<br \/>The effective rate of tax is generally understood to refer to the tax arising for a company as a percentage of the profits of the company.  The effective corporate tax rate factors in the various deductions and reliefs a company is fully entitled to claim before it applies the 12.5% rate in Ireland&rsquo;s case in trading income, the 25% rate on investment income and the 33% rate on gains.  The majority of studies indicate the effective corporate tax rate here is generally very close to 12.5%, as there are few deductions and reliefs within our corporate tax regime.  We have built our corporate tax strategy on having an attractive low transparent 12.5% rate which is simple to understand and administer for companies operating in Ireland and subject to tax here.  In principle, the calculation of an effective corporate tax rate is somewhat akin to the calculation of an effective personal tax rate.  A person could pay tax at the standard tax rate, yet his or her effective tax rate will be somewhat lower.  Under Irish tax law, a person will see his or her overall income tax bill reduced when he or she factors in medical expenses, rent relief, mortgage interest relief, tax credits and many other items.  It is the same in principle with effective corporate tax rates, albeit a more complex process.<br \/>Some of the negative<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>coverage of the Irish tax system in recent times has held the suggestion Ireland has an effective rate of tax of around 2%, implying that global companies in Ireland can secure, so to speak, a 2% effective corporate tax rate if based here.  The difficulty and confusion surrounding the effective tax rate issue come from the mixing of legal rules on incorporation with tax rules.  If a global company is legally entitled to be incorporated in a country such as Ireland, it does not mean that it is taxed on all of its global profits in Ireland.  It is only liable to be taxed in Ireland on the activities subject to Irish tax under rules recognised and accepted not just in Ireland but also by other countries and the OECD.  A company may be incorporated in Ireland, but the management and control of that company may be located elsewhere, which means that under Irish tax law the company is not liable to Irish tax on foreign income.  Ireland&rsquo;s residence rules have been in place since 1922 and would not be regarded as being unusual but rather consistent with those of many countries and the model OECD treaties.<br \/>A global company based in Ireland that has its origins in the United States and is US-owned could have operations in 20 countries and derive its sales income from 70 countries worldwide.  Incorporation in Ireland does not automatically mean tax residency in Ireland and does not mean entitlement to the profits from these 70 countries.  Where a company is not Irish tax resident, Ireland can only legally lay claim to the tax that arises from relevant activity in Ireland.  Taking an Irish incorporated company&rsquo;s total global tax bill and dividing it by its total global profit in an attempt to estimate an Irish-based effective corporate tax rate from it is incorrect and distortionary.  Trying to extrapolate an overall effective Irish corporate tax rate from these company figures is also distortionary and incorrect.  The effective corporate tax rate of a company is a mathematical computation arrived at by virtue of the activity of a company and the application of the tax rules relevant to that exact activity in each jurisdiction in which the company operates.<br \/>In my comments so far I have dealt with the principle of calculating the effective corporate tax rate of a company, but calculating the overall effective tax rate for a country, whether Ireland or anywhere else, is very complex.  There is no agreed definition of what a country&rsquo;s effective tax rate means or how to calculate it and, for this reason, it is open to many interpretations.  The Department of Finance's technical paper of April 2014 has reviewed eight approaches using three model types.  There is no single, internationally agreed methodology in calculating the effective rate of corporation tax for a country.  As a result, we have seen a variety of conflicting answers where different methodologies are applied to different data sources.  While acknowledging that there is no agreed definition of a country&rsquo;s effective corporate tax rate, the paper concludes &quot;that the approaches based on national aggregate statistics are the most suitable&quot;.  It cites the work on effective tax rates on the &quot;net operating surplus&quot; and &quot;tax due&quot; as a proportion of taxable income, approaches Nos. 3 and 5 in the report, which deliver an average effective corporate tax rate of 10.9% and 10.7%, respectively.  Companies operating globally can have a combined low global effective tax rate, but one cannot attribute that rate to any one country or say it is its effective rate.<br \/>US Bureau of Economic Analysis, BEA, data suggesting a 2% effective rate for Ireland are incorrect.  For example, the US BEA data provide a combined global tax rate for companies that are incorporated in Ireland and US-owned but operate in dozens of countries.  In reviewing this data the Department of Finance concluded &quot;the BEA data does highlight the ability of certain US companies to achieve very low effective rates for the foreign tax paid on their non-US sourced profits arising from their operations across multiple jurisdictions (including Ireland) but cannot give an appropriate measure of the effective corporate tax rate applying on their Irish profits&quot;.<br \/>I acknowledged that the debate on effective corporate tax rates was part of a far wider debate on international tax rules.  This is what the OECD&rsquo;s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, BEPS, project is about and the Government is playing its part in the process.  Last October we issued an international tax strategy setting out our position on international tax and emphasising the three key strands to our corporation tax strategy - rate, regime and reputation.  We have a separate Irish consultation launched by the Department of Finance on the BEPS in an Irish context.  The institute is also very engaged in this work.  We highlighted many of the issues concerned at our global tax policy conference held last October in Dublin, made several submissions to the OECD and met Mr. Pascal Saint Amans, director of the OECD's Centre for Tax Policy and Administration at the OECD's headquarters in Paris last month.<br \/>I appreciate that there are many views on the international tax rules applied and corporate tax issues in general.  The OECD, through its BEPS project, is working with member countries on its action plan to address what are accepted as outdated rules which have not kept pace in an increasingly globalised and digitalised world.  The Department of Finance's consultation gives Ireland and its stakeholders a forum in which we can make a real and honest assessment of all the issues involved relating to the BEPS and the impact on Ireland and its future.  Global investment is highly competitive and will always remain so; we must be acutely aware that other countries will look to fiercely highlight their own competitive tax advantages if there are perceived weaknesses among others.  There are many strands to Ireland&rsquo;s overall tax strategy, from the regime to rate and reputation.  They must all receive the attention warranted if we are to play our part in the BEPS process and also if we are to make the best decision for Ireland and its future.  I hope this presentation and discussion will help to shed light on some of the issues involved in that process.

It did not restrict its analysis to the operations of companies that are tax resident here.  Can he explain the rationale behind his findings?  He put a lot of emphasis on the US data which, in my view, is not a fair commentary on Ireland.  The key issue which determines where a company's profits are taxable is where it is resident.

The US Bureau of Economic Analysis data uses this latter approach and its data relates to subsidiaries incorporated in Ireland.  The US data is very useful because it looks at US data, by survey, across 53 different countries which means anomalies are removed.

It is only if one is owned by another company, outside of Ireland, that an ambiguity arises and then all these rules come into play.  For example, one must ask where is central management and control or where is the permanent establishment located.  Unfortunately, as we know, and as Revenue guidelines state, where central management and control arises can be very ambiguous.

What I am picking up from large companies and multinationals is that Ireland is beginning to lose out in investment decisions.

As the Department of Finance's study of most other taxation methodologies implies, the base is very broad and the rate for Irish activities is very close to the 12.5% standard rate.  The difficulty is that tax policies are designed for domestic audiences, on which each country has focused in designing its tax policies, but during the years businesses have become more and more international.  They are operating across borders and can achieve lower tax rates globally, not in a particular country, because of the differences between the tax policies of different countries.  The policies are not designed to knit neatly together, which is why we need to undertake the Base Erosion and Profit Sharing, BEPS, project.  I do not think anybody is looking at the Irish corporation tax regime and saying there is a problem with it <i>per se<\/i>.  Pascal Saint-Amans of the OECD has acknowledged that our regime is one of the broadest and most transparent in operation.  The issue is not with the Irish regime but with the way it interacts with other tax rules, particularly those of the United States of America because of the very high level of US foreign direct investment here.

It is based on the fact that if one looks at the accounts of some US multinational companies, two jurisdictions are identified - the United States of America and Ireland.  The tax these companies pay in the United States is shown, as is the tax they pay outside it.  One can see that even though most of their sales occur outside the United States, a tiny fraction of the tax is paid outside it.  A lot of countries, for which I have some sympathy, are not happy with this state of affairs.  They do not like the arrangement whereby companies can operate in a country and not pay any tax whatsoever.  This is particularly the case in the digital economy and it has become a serious problem in that context.  Part of the issue is actually determining where companies are located, where their sales take place and so forth.  The growth of the digital economy has made it possible for some companies in the corporate sector to avoid paying both corporation tax and value added tax, but, as we all know, countries need to raise tax revenue.<br \/>There are also issues of unfair tax advantages at play.  To give the Deputy an example, he can buy a book from a certain company which appears to be coming from Luxembourg where VAT rates are very low.  In fact, we know that the book is being shipped from a warehouse in the United Kingdom.  This particular bookseller has an unfair tax advantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>other booksellers.

The issue which is the subject of the inquiry and the ruling given to the particular multinational seems, from media reports, to relate to transfer pricing.  This goes to the heart of the issues we need to be discussing in terms of general principles.  Transfer pricing is a way of setting a price between legal entities in the same group to make sure that where there is no market value for something, it is pinned as close as possible to what a market value would be.  That is a huge part of what the BEPS project is about.  In fact, five of the reports due next year on the BEPS will deal with transfer pricing issues, including intangibles, interest, risk and capital, transfer pricing documentation and so forth.  There is certainly an issue around the rules of transfer pricing that need to be looked at.<\/p><p>  Regarding advance opinions, as we refer to them in the profession, this is a situation where one has a set of circumstances and is seeking clarification from Revenue.  This is an option open to any Irish taxpayer, large or small, corporate or private.  One outlines one's circumstances to Revenue, sets out what one intends to do, how one intends to treat income and work out one's tax and asks Revenue whether it is in agreement.<\/p> <p>To be clear, it is not a binding ruling.  If for example, the taxpayer sets out a set of circumstances and then it turns out that he or she does not abide by the circumstances or something changes, the Revenue Commissioners are not bound by that ruling and are perfectly entitled if they wish to take it as a case and argue the point.  We do have advance opinions but they are not the same as binding rulings.  It is an administrative practice that arises in most countries and it is intended to try to bring certainty to somebody who wants genuinely to get something right and does not want to have an audit in a few years and a look back and find he has applied the wrong ratio or the wrong price.

The problem is that companies could do something.  That is the real issue here.  We are trying to strike a balance between our good reputation and good citizenship, on the one hand, and our competitive regime, on the other.  The reason the BEPS process is multilateral in nature is that the issue is not about one country or company but about moving together.  If countries move together, the process will have a much better chance of succeeding.  Changing the rules internationally to the extent that there are mismatches has a much better chance of resolving such mismatches.  The position is that, on the one hand, behind the scenes one has as a motivating factor a US tax policy that effectively allows for deferral of non-US income and, on the other hand, a BEPS project on which consensus has not yet been reached and which awaits full roll-out.  If, in such circumstances, one decides to act unilaterally before either of these processes has been concluded, the question will be what will companies do.  That is the great unknown.<\/p><p>  There are mechanisms and offerings in so many other countries that if we take some action here and nobody else moves, companies may reorganise their structures and move elsewhere.  The problem is that once one loses part of one's pipeline, it is very difficult to get it back.  The ongoing consultation process is extremely important for this reason.  For this reason, we and others need to contribute to process to ensure we have a proper, grown-up discussion on deciding where one draws a line between rate and reputation and the potential consequences.  We also need to discuss how we can set ourselves up positively. <\/p><p>  One of the great aspects of our corporation tax system is that the 12.5% rate is only available to companies that have substance.  A company cannot avail of the 12.5% rate on trading income if it does not have substance.  That is a condition of the rate.

Giving a low tax rate is irrelevant to them.  Capital grants are very important, as are access to credit and a range of other issues.<\/p><p>  There is a difficulty in trying to work out how multinational companies respond to tax incentives.  Are they here because of linkages with the country?  While some multinational companies have extensive linkages and are embedded in the economy, others, unfortunately, do not have strong linkages.  The problem is that if we set up a very attractive tax regime, we will attract firms for which tax is very important and these are likely to be the very firms which have low linkages and are not well embedded in the economy.  In short, they are here because of the tax system.  If there is a change in tax regimes abroad - a change in the European Union, the United States or elsewhere, which has nothing to do with us - they may move on.

In the case of Apple, one of the major multinationals with operations in this country which we want to keep here, its chief executive officer gave written evidence to the United States Senate hearings that its effective tax rate was calculated by the Irish authorities at 2%.  He gave this evidence voluntarily to a committee that was examining tax rates.  He put these words on paper, although, after being contacted by the Department, he withdrew the claim.  It is the age old issue of a particular company using one method to calculate its effective tax rate and the Department using another.  There seems to be little prospect at this time of figuring out a universal way of doing it that would be acceptable to all parties.<\/p><p>  We ran out of time earlier before Professor Stewart could answer my question about the BEPS process, which will push us and every other jurisdiction in a certain direction.  His view seems to be that where firms are incorporated is where they will pay tax.  I understand the United States is the only jurisdiction in which that arrangement currently applies; therefore, it will be a radical shift.  If we are going to be manoeuvred down a certain path in agreeing collectively to this at a global level, how do we stay ahead of the curve?  It is not just about what the BEPS decides.  Professor Stewart is saying we should focus on industrial policy, with which I am in complete agreement.  There is a concern, however, about the fragility of our tax base and our reliance on some &euro;4.2 billion in corporation tax which could be taken away from us through the BEPS process, albeit there is a possibility that it could be enhanced.  Even if the BEPS does not take us down the road of incorporation, we could choose to change our own tax law if we so wished, with all of the risks that would entail.  If the position is that a firm is incorporated here if it is tax resident, there will be a consequence.  As we have discussed, the US companies in question are bringing in some $100 billion and paying an effective tax rate of 2.2%.  If they were all tax resident, as a result of being incorporated here, the entirety of their earnings would be taxable here.  In that context, we could apply an effective tax rate across all companies - that is, every single company registered in Ireland - of, say, 4%, and still take in more in corporation tax than we currently are.  In other words, we would be better off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52014061700012#L00900","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403019000,"counter":315,"content":"<p>One of the problems is that we are seeking certainty where we cannot have it.  It is all very well saying industry wants a certain tax environment, but that is not in our gift.  To attain certainty where there is uncertainty is very difficult and I have no real answer to it.  Regarding the potential to raise additional tax revenues, we can say for sure that we would not, in fact, raise that level of revenue because we would see tax strategies changed.  The large accounting firms already have six strategies up their sleeves to cope with this eventuality.  One of the questions to consider is whether our tax base would fall even more or if we might receive a little more in tax.  Certainly, there is no way we would get anything like 5% of the $100 billion to which the Deputy referred.

How are we going to structure our regime - just as other countries are structuring their regimes - to be an attractive place in order that if multinationals restructure in the aftermath of the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, exercise, the benefit of some of those activities and some of that substance will come to Ireland and not go somewhere else?  The United Kingdom changed its rules on incorporation and specifically introduced a patent box because it was not getting any of this business and the authorities there could see it was very valuable business.  In itself, that measure has issues because, as I stated, the European Commission is examining patent boxes.  There is not an easy answer to it but we must be focused on trying to be competitive and it must be substance-based.  This will be the environment that will exist when BEPS is over.

This will allow us to outline our very serious and substantial concerns arising from the latest proposals from the HSE under the Haddington Road agreement.  I stress that none of our concerns arises from industrial relations issues; they all have their origins in the questions of safe care, safe practice and equality of patient outcomes.<\/p><p>  As members of the committee will know, the Haddington Road agreement, to which I will refer as the HRA, runs for three years, commencing on 1 July 2013, and represents the second phase of efforts to reduce public expenditure in these difficult economic times.  In particular, it provides for health service staff to work additional hours for the duration of the agreement, a review of rosters and skills mix to ensure optimal deployment of staff and other measures aimed at ensuring an efficient and effective but quality assured and safe public health service.  <\/p><p>  At the outset the INMO ask the committee membership to note that it is formally acknowledged by management that nurses and midwives and all other staff in the health service are fully compliant with their obligations under the HRA.  At this time there are no serious disputes in any workplace or location with regard to the implementation of the various measures sought by local management under the agreement.  Notwithstanding this level of compliance, on 13 May, HSE senior management at the health service oversight body - a body established to monitor implementation of the agreement - brought forward, without prior consultation or engagement, additional measures to save a further &euro;80 million.  This is in addition to the &euro;212 million already saved under the agreement.  All of these measures are targeted to impact on front-line staff, particularly those working on the 24-7 cycle, and were presented without any impact or risk assessment or safety audit.<\/p><p>  In response to these measures which are detailed in a document entitled, Stage 3 Implementation Plan, the INMO immediately indicated its grave concern at the impact of the proposals on the ability of professional staff on the front line to deliver safe care to their patients and clients.  The organisation has written to the Minister for Health, the two Ministers of State at the Department and the director of quality and safety in the HSE asking for immediate engagement on these issues, leading to a comprehensive review of what has been proposed.<\/p> <p>In that regard I would ask the committee to note that we are due to meet with the director of quality and safety and the director of nursing-midwifery services, in the HSE, on next Monday, 23 June 2014 and a meeting has been arranged with the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly for Tuesday, 21 July 2014.  However, in the interim, the HSE continues to work to implement these flawed measures and that is why we have asked for this urgent meeting with the joint committee.<br \/>In its latest implementation plan the HSE has stated it intends to initiate a number of further measures, all of which will impact upon front-line staff and services, in pursuance of a further &euro;80 million worth of savings.  We wish to reiterate that despite the fact that nurses, midwives and health service staff are fully compliant with the agreement, these proposals have been brought forward, in complete breach of the Haddington Road agreement, without any consultation, discussion or any level of engagement.  In specific terms the INMO has grave concerns over the following measures: (i) the further reduction in frontline staff numbers; (ii) staff substitution; (iii) alteration to skill mix; (iv) replacement of public health nurses, PHNs and community RGNs with new graduate nurses under the graduate programme; and (v) reduction in nurse management grades in the care of the older person-disability services.<br \/>The HSE has indicated, both in the latest implementation plan and in its annual service plan for 2014, that it intends to reduce, by a further 3,400 posts, staffing within the health system.  Under the latest implementation plan it is quite clear that no nursing or health care assistant post that falls vacant, in the front line, will be filled other than by graduate nurses or intern staff under two specific programmes within the HRA.<br \/>We would respectfully point out to the committee that this is an untenable manpower policy as it fails, completely, to recognise the need for specialist staff, in many critical areas in the frontline of the health system, the required mix of experienced and new staff and the need to ensure adequate and appropriate skill mix in all areas of the health system.<br \/>A blanket ban on recruitment, other than through two intern schemes, is fundamentally flawed, injurious to patient care and will certainly negatively impact upon patients'-clients&rsquo; welfare, and, ultimately, outcomes.<br \/><b><i><\/i><\/b>The recent proposals explicitly state that all qualified nurses, midwives and trained health care assistants should be replaced by interns, under the support staff internship programme, without any reference to patient acuity and dependency or, indeed, any input from the director of nursing or midwifery responsible for the service.<br \/>This measure, which was again brought forward without consultation, will severely compromise the statutory obligations of every director of nursing and midwifery both under their code of practice, as a registered, regulated nurse or midwife, and, under the various standards, laid down by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  It is not tenable to suggest that all vacancies that arise, in acute-continuing care disability services, can be filled by staff, notwithstanding their excellence and commitment, recruited under the support staff intern programme.  To suggest that this can lead to best patient outcomes is, quite patently, false and nonsensical.<br \/><b><i><\/i><\/b>The latest plan explicitly states that the health service, in relation to care of the elderly and disability services, will move, without reference to any stated dependency tool, to a 40:60 skill mix, that is 40% registered nurse and 60% support staff regardless of patient-client acuity or dependency.<br \/>On this measure we would ask the committee to note the following: The Haddington Road agreement does not stipulate that there should be, as a maximum, a 40:60 skill mix ratio in any service.  The agreement stipulates that <i>&ldquo;All staff will co-operate with measures to achieve the most cost effective skill mix and staffing ratios to meet service needs.  An intensive engagement process will begin immediately to review existing skill mix and staffing ratios to ensure that these identified needs are met&rdquo;.<\/i><br \/><i><\/i>The previous stated policy was a mix of 50:50.  No consultation or engagement has taken place, with regard to this fundamental change in policy.  Furthermore, as of today, the INMO has not been informed as to what dependency tool has been used, to arrive at this 40:60 policy, nor is there any commitment to engage in discussions on this pivotal issue.  The implementation of this measure, in the front line, arising from this central diktat has the effect of removing, from directors and assistant directors of nursing and midwifery, all of the autonomy they need to ensure staffing levels and skill mix are appropriate to meet the full needs of the patient-client population.<br \/>Our experience and feedback to date, from directors and assistant directors who have been subject to review under this latest plan, has been that they have been told they must introduce the 40:60 skill mix without delay; this must be done through the replacement of all staff, who are absent for whatever reason, with interns under the intern support programme; failure to implement this measure will lead to the closure of that public facility and do they want responsibility for that to lie on their conscience; and failure to deliver the 40:60 skill mix will see them lose their authority to recruit agency staff.<br \/>This diktat, from central management in the HSE, also compromises the statutory and related obligations, of a director or assistant director, under the following standards and codes:the National Quality Standards for Residential Care for Older People in Ireland; the National Standards for Residential Services for Children and Adults;the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare; and their obligations as a registered and regulated professional under the Code of Practice laid down by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI.<br \/>The committee must note that it is not open, to a director or assistant director, to ignore his or her obligations under these standards.  However arising from the latest HSE proposals he or she will be placed in an impossible situation which cannot be left outstanding.  It is a simple fact, proven and reaffirmed by reports of adverse incidents in this country, similar reports in other jurisdictions and international research, that the local director or assistant director of nursing must have the authority, and autonomy, combined with accountability, to maintain safe services.  This cannot be done if she or he is subject to such absolute direction from the centre.<br \/>The latest HSE proposal explicitly provides that all vacancies, arising from the departure of PHNs and community RGNs working in the community, must be filled by new graduate nurses employed under the graduate programme.  This is again a fundamentally flawed measure which will gravely impact, upon already overstretched primary care services, for the following reasons:  No one should expect a new graduate to have the experience or competence to work, as a lone worker, in the community immediately following registration.  It is worth noting that during the four year undergraduate programme, there is one week only of community placement and sometimes that community placement can be in an environment such as sheltered employment and not necessarily on home visiting.  Yet this plan states that all vacancies from October will be filled by newly graduated nurses.  It is a well accepted standard that health professionals must have three years experience, post initial registration, before they can work alone in community services.  It is also a requirement, under the HRA, that all graduates, recruited under the graduate programme, will have adequate mentorship and support and this is simply not possible if they are working in community locations; and it is also worth noting, but admittedly from a different perspective, that any graduate nurse, employed in this capacity would have to have their own transport.  In view of the salary that applies to the graduate programmes, I think the members of the committee would have to acknowledge that the purchase and running of a car, to provide services for the HSE, is abject nonsense.<br \/><b><i><\/i><\/b>It is worth noting that the only mention of management grades, in the entire HSE implementation plan, is when it states it is intended to further reduce the number of nurse management posts in the care of the elderly and disability sectors.  There is no mention, in the document, that other areas will have the number of management grades reduced or de-layered.  In view of this we would ask the committee to note the following: all international experience and research indicates that when nurse management grades are reduced, with a resulting increase in the span or areas of responsibility for the remaining management grades, one reduces standards and compromises care.  The same evidence suggests that properly empowered nurse and midwife managers, who also hold high levels of accountability, ensure best practices, best policies and best outcomes for patients.<br \/>The national standards which exist, particularly those brought forward by HIQA, explicitly require that a person in charge, PIC, be nominated, by the HSE or provider, who will hold responsibility for standards and environmental factors in that location.  It is not possible to fulfil this stipulation, laid down by HIQA as a statutory body, if one does not have a designated person in charge, in the form of the director or assistant director in each work location.  However, notwithstanding this reality, the latest HSE plan quite clearly stipulates that the person in charge will not be resident or located, in the individual workplace, but will still have overall accountability.  This is simply an impossible task.<br \/>In the view of the INMO the latest HSE plan represents further attacks upon front-line services and, by extension, the quality of those services which will be available to patients or clients.  All of the proposals, geared at saving a further &euro;80 million, are specifically, and solely, targeted at the front line.  No cost saving measure is identified, from any other area of the health system, with the result that only the 24\/7 services are carrying the total burden.<br \/>It is also worth noting, and this is a particularly critical issue, that the HSE is saying, in its plan, it must further reduce its agency spend.<\/p> <p>However, when considering this issue, we ask the committee to note the following: the HSE only incurs a high volume of agency spending because of the ban on recruitment into direct employment laid down by government policy; in order to overcome this policy while still living within their employment control numbers and maintaining a safe service, local managers are having to recruit agency staff to fill absolutely essential vacancies - they have no other option if they are to protect patients and provide the range of services that are being demanded by the community and by Government; and by definition, a sizeable proportion of this agency spend will, therefore, be on the front line, representing nursing, midwifery, medical or support staff costs.  Therefore, it is fundamentally unfair and unjust to expect the grades in which this agency cost is incurred to carry the full burden of cutbacks and contraction whenever further money is to be saved.  Front-line staff do not make Government policy regarding recruitment and therefore they should not be asked to shoulder in an unfair, onerous and unjust manner the consequence of an initially flawed policy which has to be ignored to some extent by local managers in order to maintain safe care.<br \/>In presenting our concerns to the committee, we are acutely aware that they can be portrayed as self-interest by a vested interest.  In that regard, it is appropriate to remind the committee that a significant body of accepted research findings both nationally and internationally confirms the benefits to patients of safe and adequate nurse staffing levels in clinical areas.  In that regard we attach to this submission a paper entitled Safe Staffing - The Evidence, which critiques the research done in this area in a concise and focused manner, and the RN4Cast survey, an overview of research evidence.<br \/>With regard to Ireland, the most recent research, which is underpinned by similar work in the European Union, is the RN4Cast report published in<i>The<\/i><i>Lancet<\/i>earlier this year.  This research found the following: every one-patient increase in patient-to-nurse ratios was associated with a 7% increase in deaths; and a 10% increase in bachelor degree nurses, which is the standard qualification in Ireland, is associated with a 7% decline in mortality.  In commenting on the Irish results of this European-wide study, the renowned expert and academic in this area Professor Anne Scott, deputy president of Dublin City University, commented:<blockquote>Our results suggest that the assumption that hospital nurse staffing can be reduced to save money without adversely affecting patient outcomes may be misguided, at best, and fatal at worst.  This is crucial information for hospital managers given the significant reduction in nurse staffing in Irish hospitals since 2008 and particularly in light of the ongoing moratorium on staffing.<\/blockquote>We also feel it necessary to remind the committee of other reports in Ireland, particularly recent reports from HIQA such as those into accident and emergency department overcrowding at University College Hospital Limerick and hygiene in Wexford General Hospital.  Both reports highlight staffing levels as a factor in the potential lowering of standards in the care delivered to patients.<br \/>The INMO contends that general management, when attacking the front line to make savings, are simply repeating the mistakes of the past both in this country and in other jurisdictions.  It makes no sense, either economically or in terms of health outcomes, to have poor staffing levels, an inappropriate skill mix and inadequate front-line management structures when one is seeking optimum levels of patient care.  The current HSE plan, therefore, represents a tried, tested and failed model of financial containment in our health system and must be reviewed.<br \/>It would be remiss of us in presenting our views if we did not remind all members of the committee of the journey that has been travelled by the health system over the past six years.  In summary, the following facts are now known: the reduction of more than 20% in health expenditure over the past five years is unprecedented in the context of OECD countries; there has been an overall reduction of 9% in staffing levels in the health system since 2009; however, in the same period, there has been a 13.5% reduction in nursing and midwifery staffing, which confirms the disproportionate impact upon the front line arising from the recruitment embargo; in the same period, there has been an 11% decrease in support staff numbers, again hitting the front line; and the continued insistence by Government that the health service must lose a further 5,000 staff, leading to a total of 95,600 by the end of 2015, represents an impossible request and only serves to apply further pressure upon an overworked and overstretched public service.  We welcome the recent reported statements from both the Minister for Health and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, that the health system has carried an undue burden of cuts and cannot sustain any further cutbacks while maintaining services and meeting demand.  We ask the committee to consider all of these facts when analysing the impact of the latest HSE plan upon front-line services and, ultimately, patient or client care.<br \/>In presenting its views, the INMO is not oblivious to the financial challenges that continue to face this country and, by definition, the provision of public services.  However, we cannot accept that the latest measures are appropriate when one takes into account the pressure on front-line services, the workloads that are being carried by nurses and midwives every day, the flexibility being shown by all grades of staff on the front line and the complete implementation of staff-side obligations under the Haddington Road agreement.<br \/>Against this background we have called for, and are still calling for, the following: that the HSE agree to suspend the implementation of all current measures contained in its most recent plan that have an impact on front-line staff; that the committee ask the HSE to explain the rationale behind its recent proposals, and, in particular, why it is seeking to implement skill mix substitution and other arrangements not covered by the Haddington Road agreement, which go against the findings of national and international research; that the committee ask the HSE why it has not engaged with staff representative organisations, in a time-limited manner if necessary, to consider such issues as skill mix and staffing levels; that the committee seek confirmation from the HSE that it does, and will, respect the professional judgement of every registered nurse or midwife and accept that it cannot implement measures it believes will negatively impact upon patient or client care; that the committee ask the HSE what weight is being given to the expanding body of research, both national and international, which confirms the positive impact on patient outcomes of an adequate nurse staffing workforce; that the committee ask the Minister for Health and the two Ministers of State how they reconcile the latest HSE plan with their stated concerns that the health service cannot carry any further cutbacks or contraction; and that the committee consider recommending the adoption of the standards recently introduced in the UK with regard to public information on staffing levels in wards and minimum nursing numbers in care settings.<br \/>In conclusion, we sincerely thank the Chairman and all members of the committee for attending and listening to our presentation.  We will gladly take questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Doran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403007000,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Claire Mahon, INMO president, Ms Geraldine Talty, second vice-president, and Ms Grace Murphy, who represents undergraduate student nurses.

The agreement provides that all staff must work two additional hours per week.  What is the best way to implement this change, not only in the context of the impact on INMO members but also with regard to the impact on patients, outcomes and productivity?  If two additional hours were done every week in, say, 20-minute slots, as opposed to a system under which everyone works an additional day every now and again, better outcomes would probably be achieved in respect of health services and productivity, but it would have an impact on INMO members.  What are Mr. Doran's views on how best to implement the additional hours?  We have to accept that the Government is limited in the amount it can put into health services.  As an Opposition Member, I would like more money to be allocated.<\/p><p>  Every day we look at the trolley counts and the numbers of people waiting in accident and emergency departments throughout the country.<\/p> <p>We also look at the fact HIQA has brought forward reports which leave a lot to be desired in terms of patient safety in emergency departments throughout the country, the impact that is having on the provision of safe care and also the stress and pressure that INMO members are working under.<\/p><p> When I hear talk of comparatives, I am always a little confused because, in comparison to other countries, on one matrix, we have very good representation in terms of the nurse-to-patient ratio but, on another matrix, we have a very poor representation.  Are we always identifying the same number of allied health professionals and nurses so we are comparing like with like?  Could the witnesses suggest a country where we would be exactly comparing like with like in order to see how we perform in terms of the ratio of nurses to patients?  Any assessment would show that the more nurses there are, the better the patient outcomes, as has been acknowledged in the detailed research on this issue.<\/p><p> On another area highlighted by Mr. Doran, when professionals say they have concerns about patient safety, they should be listened to.  This is an area where I find that, very often, we do not listen.  Consultants have said they are concerned about patient safety due to pressures in hospitals, including communicable diseases, overcrowding and many other associated problems.  INMO members have known for quite some time that there is a major concern.  Why is there not a more vocal outpouring from INMO members?  I do not mean from Mr. Doran personally, because he is fairly good at that, in a positive way.  However, is there some fear of reporting among INMO members?  That is what I am trying to get at.  INMO members are front-line staff on the wards of our hospitals throughout the country and they see issues they are concerned about.  There is a reporting mechanism in place whereby they would fill out a form and relay that to management.  Is there a fear or a concern that, if they do report, it could damage them in a professional capacity?  Is there loose intimidation or a threat hanging over them that would explain why they are not coming forward in the numbers they should be, in view of what we know is happening in our health services?  I would be interested to hear Mr. Doran's observations on that issue.<\/p><p> The Haddington Road agreement, industrial relations and what flows from that are for another ministry, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, the Department of Health also has a key role to play in this area and it cannot completely absolve itself from industrial relations.  If the Department of Health does not provide enough funding through the Vote, it then falls to INMO members to make extra sacrifices to ensure the health services can continue.  While many of us suggest more resources are needed, there seems to be an obsession with the Department of Health carrying an excessive cut that is over and above what would be deemed normal, even in extraordinary times, particularly given that an extraordinary figure of &euro;4 billion has been taken out since 2007.<\/p><p> Has the INMO a view on the number of front-line staff versus administration and management?  We cannot always just throw staff at a problem and there has to be a time when we prioritise the use of staff.  When one considers the ratios in the HSE, there seems to be a lot of administration and management, yet the cuts seem to be falling on the front line all the time.  I find it hard to understand why we consistently pare back the front-line services and staff before we look at the whole administration apparatus.  We know it is a legacy issue from the amalgamation of the health boards and all of that, although my memory of the creation of the HSE was that the first question on everybody's lips, from all sides, was whether the Minister could assure people there would be no job losses.  This is an area of concern.  I would be grateful if Mr. Doran could address those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700004#C00700","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403007600,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Before I call on Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I should acknowledge the presence of Oona Sugrue in the public gallery.

I want to thank the Cathaoirleach and the secretariat of the committee for accommodating this at the earliest opportunity.<\/p><p>  On that point, I note the INMO wrote to us on the same day it wrote to the Minister and the director general of the HSE.  Has it received substantive replies from either the Minister or Mr. O'Brien?  What is the status at this point in time of its request for a meeting with the Minister?  The letter to Mr. O'Brien indicated a willingness, as always, to meet and engage.  Will the witnesses advise where that might stand one full month later?<\/p><p>  Without question, the members of this committee had a shared concern in regard to the situation Mr. Doran outlined.  We regarded it as something that threatened grave consequences for patient care and safety, which would be one of the primary areas of concern in this committee.  Having heard the INMO submission this morning, I have to say I am as alarmed as I was when I first read its communication.  We are talking here about reductions in front-line staff numbers on top of all the reductions that have been imposed, particularly in the nursing sector, since 2008.  We are looking at a situation of a reduction of the level of care for older people by trained nurses with substitution that has no basis in consideration, never mind agreement, it would be fair to say.  This is totally unacceptable.<\/p><p>  As a D&aacute;il Deputy, I have no doubt the experience is replicated in the story of any of us here, Deputies or Senators.  We are being exposed to the detail of very poor situations presenting, with not only poor outcomes but poor experiences, which are not a reflection on the professional commitment of those who are giving the service in a variety of hospital and other settings.  However, it is indicative of the absolutely impossible situation that such a significantly reduced cohort of people are being expected to cope.  That is the great difficulty and it will only be exacerbated by the measures the HSE has indicated, which will spell further misery for patients.<\/p><p>  Mr. Doran said he would not accept it, which is good, because somebody needs to take a stand.  We are at a very serious point.  There are serious matters under address by risk advisers at various hospitals up and down the country, including in my own back yard, on a scale that might never have presented in the past but is presenting today.  These cause great concern and worry in terms of public confidence.  If the proposals are proceeded with, it will have a further negative impact on public confidence.<\/p><p>  How do the INMO representatives see the practical outworking of the HSE proposals, if that is the right phrase to employ?  For example, in hospital wards predominantly occupied by older people, how will this transpire?<\/p> <p>What stance will the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, take to ensure this plan does not develop?  The representatives of the INMO are here today but what plan of campaign do they have?  The seriousness of the situation must be impressed upon those involved and they must know the INMO will not countenance this.<\/p><p> I am interested in the response of the witnesses to the letters of 15 May.  I hope to speak again at the end of this meeting but I wish to indicate that this meeting is only an opportunity for a hearing.  I hope the joint committee acts appropriately at the conclusion of this meeting with the INMO.  Depending on Mr. Doran's reply to my first set of questions, I think we should take appropriate unified action as a committee to urge the appropriate responses from the Minister and the director general of the HSE.

The submissions answered many of my questions by outlining a problem and drawing attention to different areas.  We are all concerned about reductions in front-line staff and staff substitutions.  I was particularly concerned by the alterations that have been made to the skill mix, as was outlined.  I read the note circulated by the witnesses and see that policy has changed from a 50:50 division to 40:60 and this refers to a maximum so the figures can be even lower.  This especially applies to services for the elderly and disabled.<\/p><p>  The Chairman has outlined the process of these discussions so I will also ask the following question of the HSE.  Who set this policy and how is it determined?  Having visited many different centres I know that the needs of patients vary as does the mix of patients.  How is any figure set, be it a 50:50 division or a 40:60 division?  It seems like an arbitrary process when some centres do not require a significant mix of skills sets and others may have many high-dependency patients that need a specialised skill mix.<\/p><p>  I spoke to some nurses I know prior to this meeting and they all raised the issue of the moratorium on recruitment and the difficulty it has created.  As a consequence, there has been significant spending on agency nurses.  We all know this is an issue so I wonder why the moratorium continues.  Is it the case that if the moratorium was lifted flexibility to adapt the skill mix would be lost?  I think this issue should be faced.<\/p><p>  Another matter regularly raised is the increased administrative burden imposed on nursing staff by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and others.  Everyone stresses that the changes are welcome but repetitive form-filling takes nurses away from patients and this has increased in recent years.  Professional staff are being taken away to do repetitive administrative work when other areas could be examined in terms of savings.  I would welcome the views of the witnesses on this because it is a view I have heard.<\/p><p>  The study presented by the witnesses on safe staffing raises issues such as length of stay and poor care and these issues must be examined as they are interrelated. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700006#E00300","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1403008200,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I thank Senator van Turnhout and I will now call Mr. Doran.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700006#E00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403008200,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I will answer questions in the order in which they were asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Doran"},{"type":"speech","time":1403008200,"counter":347,"content":"<p>If members wish to intervene they should do so but we must leave this committee room by 1.30 p.m.  Perhaps Mr. Doran could keep his answers short as he was given latitude with the opening statements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700006#E00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403008200,"counter":348,"content":"<p>The latitude of the Chairman knows no bounds.

This is about the quality of care people receive at 6 a.m., 2 p.m. and 11 p.m.  Will the right person be<i>in situ <\/i>to look after the needs of those people?   We will not turn this into an industrial relations dispute because we must turn the ship around through professional persuasion and so on.<br \/>All nurses and midwives are obliged to work 1.5 extra hours under this agreement and they are doing so in a manner that was agreed by local management.

I believe the system has been anaesthetised so that it is difficult now to understand the plight of individual people.  Some 5,900 people were on trolleys in the first four months of this year and this is down 15% on last year, which is good.  It is down 24% on the figure from two years ago and that is even better.  However, this year's figure is up 27% on that pertaining to 2007, when trolley overcrowding was called a national emergency.  I make this point only to show that everything is relative.  We made these points with regard to the emergency department, ED, in Limerick every year from 2005 to 2012, inclusive.  We welcome the latest HIQA report but why did it take so long to address an area that is patently unsafe for patients and staff and is replicated in other emergency departments around the country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700006#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Doran"},{"type":"speech","time":1403008200,"counter":349,"content":"<p>If that was the case five years ago and Mr. Doran's remarks are correct then this issue is not just a matter of resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700006#E00800","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403008200,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Not if \"resources\" refers only to staff.  There are major issues relating to areas such as bed capacity, step-down facilities and primary care.  The problem in Limerick was exacerbated by the reform programme that remodelled facilities in Ennis and Nenagh without educating the public on how to use them.  Due to this members of the public are still filtered to Limerick although their minor injuries and so on could be dealt with in Ennis or Nenagh.  The preparatory work was not done.  The reconfiguration was done in haste and patients are repenting, though not at their leisure.<\/p><p>  A good point was made on nurse staffing and the irony of the situation in which we find ourselves.  I will raise a compare and contrast scenario for the committee.  On the Friday of our recent annual conference the Secretary General of the Department of Health attended on behalf of the Minister for Health because he was ill.  He announced that the Department is to establish a workforce on nurse staffing.  This is to be the first step in the collective agreement to stabilise the nursing workforce and is to be in tandem with the military workforce forum that was established after the Portlaoise tragedies to stabilise the military workforce.<\/p> <p>We had that announcement on a Friday about nurse staffing, and we had the midwifery workforce up and running.  The following Tuesday, the HSE produced this plan to replace nurses with interns and community nurses with new graduates, or else to downsize nurse management structures and care of the elderly.  The organisation is therefore fully entitled to make the point to the committee - and the newly appointed chief nursing officer has stressed it, too - that we had the potential to arrive at a stabilised nursing workforce underpinned by best evidence and correct utilisation of the nurse-patient ratios. We had a 12-month timeframe in which to do it and were all committed to it, and then, four days later, the HSE announced its plan, which had no engagement, uses no known dependency tools and rips up everything that currently exists.  That is what we find frustrating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700006#E00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Doran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403008800,"counter":352,"content":"<p>Is it safe assume that there was joined-up thinking between the Secretary General at the Department and the HSE?

I was not at a meeting between the Department and the HSE about the workforce and nurse staffing, but I can suggest with fair confidence that it was aware that the announcement was going to be made.  That was completely contradicted and turned upside down three days later by the statement.  It is very hard to cite two countries where the skills mix and professional matrix for registered nurses at degree level are comparable. For example, what qualifications are required? Is there a second licensed nurse? Is there a qualified HCA? What level of qualification is needed? It is very hard to compare like with like, but we were trying to grasp that nettle in a proper way over the next 12 months.  This plan rips it asunder.  We wanted the stability of being able to do that in 12 months, but the HSE came along and announced all the cuts in the here and now.  It renders questionable how valuable that exercise will be.  We will participate fully.  Midwifery is in very bad order in terms of numbers and we need that to be addressed.  We will always turn up and participate, but it breaks one's heart to turn up and participate over here and the HSE is initiating draconian cuts without engagement over there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Doran"},{"type":"speech","time":1403008800,"counter":354,"content":"<p>Has that process commenced?

Registered nurses and midwives are reticent about coming forward and voicing their concerns.  They are beaten up by the workloads they carry.  We encourage our people to put in disclaimer forms where they believe that the system is such that they cannot provide the full range of services required by the patient if there are delays, for instance, in medication rounds, after-care procedure or post-operative mobilisation.  If they are being compromised by shortages of staff,  one has to document them.  It does not happen as much as it should and that is because there is a sense among nurses that they will be put upon if they highlight such concerns.  <\/p><p>  The contradiction in all this, and it was mentioned by another member of the committee, is that documentation, which is the heart scald of nurses and midwives at the moment, is being received all the time, but the problem is that, when something goes wrong, the system looks only for the written word.  If it is not written down, it did not happen.  That is the bottom line of measurement of patient interaction.  Everything that one now has to do might be subject to subsequent investigation.  Therefore it has to be written down.  HIQA insists on a strict regimen of forms and, because nurses are in the front line and are there 24\/7, they are the profession that has to do it.  However, no account of that is taken by those who would staff up the system to ensure that it was all done in a timely way. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700007#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Doran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403008800,"counter":356,"content":"<p>Nurses' decision-making is often overruled by others and, on occasion, that can be by non-qualified clinical personnel.

That person is always the senior nurse in the house.  There are many reports where the person in charge is named in a manner which seems to say he or she is an unfit person to be the person in charge.  However, that same person in charge will have a paper trail as long as one's arm pointing out that environmental factors and staffing numbers short-change patients and investment is required.  That does not come from the area, general or sectoral managers - it is the nurse who is named in an external report.  The registered provider, the HSE, is a corporate entity and the only person who is identified as having failed is the person in charge, who is the registered nurse.  Nurses have had their autonomy taken away slowly in recent years but this document completely robs them of it because they must move to 40:60, they must substitute with the intern programme etc.  That is patently wrong.  They cannot do both things; they cannot live with the HSE instruction and at the same time deliver safe care through the exercise of their professional judgment.  We might not agree with every director of nursing's professional judgment - we might say it should be even better - but they call it and each registered nurse under that director is entitled to express concerns, fears or whatever.  That is the code of practice laid down by the statutory body and that is completely disregarded by the HSE which does not seem to understand that a registered, regulated professional has obligations to his or her employer but also to his or her professional body to maintain best practice for patients.<\/p><p>  This point is important to put on record.  We wrote to the HSE; we received a letter last Friday from the director general who has indicated total satisfaction with the proposals, that they were subject to scrutiny, he was happy with the scrutiny and that patient care is central to all of the HSE's decision making and the plan stands.  He also said if we had difficulties they could be processed through the Haddington Road structure.  Obviously that was a disappointing letter.  We met yesterday under the Haddington Road process.  I raised the subject of the letter and again the HSE advised that this is being driven by various sectoral, divisional directors and that it was satisfied that patient care was not being compromised by the proposals etc.  That is where that matter lies.<\/p><p>  As I outlined in our document, we are due to meet the Minister on 21 July on the back of our letter and we are to meet the director of quality and safety with the HSE next Monday because we are anxious to find out what involvement that directorate had with the drawing up of these divisional plans.  We know that nursing and midwifery in the HSE had no involvement in that, which again poses a question about scrutiny, how they were quality assured and safety assessed.  We will continue to examine that.  <\/p><p>  On the development of the campaign, the INMO has an absolute view that what is required to stabilise our health system in a quality assured way that maximises patient outcome is to stabilise the front-line workforce.  There is absolutely no floor at the moment below which management feels, because of financial constraints, it should not go.  I state that clearly.  There are no norms; what is acceptable at one level is unacceptable at another.  We are striving to reach a position that we have norms and that regardless of whether one is in Letterkenny, Cavan, Kilkenny or Bantry the same broad skills mix and staffing levels apply.<\/p> <p>It is the only way we can do this and it must be informed by international evidence and fair comparison.  That is what we thought the workforce would do, but while we are trying to do that, this is cutting at the front line.<\/p><p> We have already met the Irish Patients' Association and will meet other patient groups, disability groups, support groups and the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies.  We are trying to mobilise and get collective about it.  I am not being smart, and I do not mean to be injurious to anybody.  Last week, Stephen McMahon of the Irish Patients' Association said publicly that the report on University Hospital Limerick and the patient journey being experienced there requires the same prioritisation by the Government as the medical card issue.  The problems with our health system do not begin and end with the urgent need to address the medical card issue but begin with capacity, bed numbers, access, primary care and staffing.  We will mobilise on this campaign, trying to highlight the deficits that already exist that would be further exacerbated by the proposed changes.<\/p><p> The changes on the community side are inexplicable.  The Department suggests that from 1 October we will have earlier discharge from hospital, maintenance of independent living at home and maximisation of the independence of the individual, but then says all public health nurse, PHN, and community registered general nurse, CRGN, vacancies should be filled by new graduates who have had one week of experience during their four-year undergraduate programme.  They will become a significant minority in the public health and community nursing work force.  That is not right.  It is not a question of INMO's opinion.  It is fundamentally flawed, and whoever drew it up knows nothing about community nursing services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700007#F00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Doran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403009400,"counter":361,"content":"<p>Up to now, what experience did a nurse need before taking up such a post?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700008#G00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403009400,"counter":362,"content":"<p>A public health nurse has the registered general nurse, RGN, qualification, probably five years' experience and a higher diploma in public health nursing, which is a full-time course including a work placement.

The impact of it beggars belief at a time when we want to try to shorten patients' length of stay and maintain independent living, which requires more experienced people in the community who will assess not just the physical presentation but the psychological and environmental factors.  We want more PHNs to do this, not graduate nurses entering the system.<\/p><p>  Senator van Turnhout asked who sets the policy on the skill mix.  I would like to know.  Under the Croke Park agreement, the Department of Health and the HSE produced a document that said it should be 50:50 in care of the elderly.  Suddenly, on 13 May, it became 40:60.  Because we were not involved in any discussions, and are unaware of any nursing or midwifery involvement in them, I cannot answer the question.  I agree that in any proper approach to this the skill mix cannot be set in stone.  I could have a house with very mobile people who are independent in daily activities, and the mix could be 30:70, while in another house it could be 70:30 if they are all very acutely ill.  We want to work with the HSE to achieve a situation whereby the nursing workforce in care of the elderly facilities perform a much wider, expanded range of duties, such IV fluid balance, blood transfusion and first-dose antibiotics.  They all need to be done to minimise the unnecessary transfer of elderly people into acute environments where they will be disoriented.  We will work towards that, but it cannot be done looking down the barrel of a cutbacks gun which says the ratio must be 40:60 and we are lucky to get it.  We do not know who sets the policies.<\/p><p>  Much is said about management grades in the health system.  We want to be very clear.  There is not an oversupply of front-line clerical administration posts in our health system.  We need the front-line staff - administrators, ward clerks, reception staff in emergency departments, medical records people - because if they are not there, nurses have to pick up the slack, further taking them away from the bedside.  The middle and upper management layers of the health system have become very maze-like and complicated for the senior nurse-manager to navigate through to get to the people who might free up the purse strings and address the clinical issues.  Directors of nursing would be driven to dementia trying to weave their way through the matrices at the higher level of the system.  The front-line grade 3 and 4 staff do pivotal work at ward level, such as medical record administration and emergency department and outpatients administration, and if one does not fill those posts, nurses have to pick up the slack, which is a poor use of a nursing resource.  Last week, HIQA criticised the management of Wexford General Hospital for postponing infection control and hand hygiene training because a nurse went on maternity leave and could not be replaced.<\/p><p>  There is no quick fix.  We have travelled a terrible journey in the past five years, but what they propose for the next 12 months will take us to a place to which, with the greatest respect to everybody, the INMO cannot go quietly.  We must highlight it and challenge the system.  Today is an excellent opportunity for us to do that.  We are not quoting industrial relations and we will never get into that because this is about care, patient outcomes and the empowerment of the nurse, who has accountability for money and everything else, to do the right thing in the right place at the right time.

I have 12 questions, and while they may seem antagonistic, I do not mean them to be.  It is a great pity we do not have the other people here so that we could put opposing questions to them.  With respect, it is an IR issue, because all the concerns the witnesses raised existed when they sat down to take out the first &euro;213 million that some mad loony agreed to take out of health under Haddington Road last October.  While the issues may be exacerbated when we seek to take out the extra &euro;80 million, they are not new.<\/p><p>  Due to my ignorance, I have many questions on the research.  Compared to other EU or OECD countries, Ireland has one of the largest proportions of nurses per 1,000 people.  I have great respect for Professor Anne Scott, who is a neighbour in my village.  She stated that to increase the patient-to-nurse ratio in the field of service would increase mortality by 7%, but, although we have done that in the last number of years, through no fault of the witnesses', our mortality rate has not gone through the roof.  It is not very much different from other countries which have fewer nurses per 1,000 patients than we have.  It all boils down to the skills mix.  Mr. Doran said he would love to know where the plan is because he does not have the evidence.  Somebody, somewhere must have the evidence of best practice in skills mix.<\/p><p>  We spend much more than everybody else but still complain about it.  Pick a country that spends a relatively decent amount of money on its health service, gives a good service and has a good skill mix, and put it in a matrix to compare it to ours.  Please tell me somebody, somewhere, has done that.  When the witnesses meet at the beginning of the year they should all have the same sheet of paper that says the best practice is, say, 10:1, the INMO wants it to be 11:1 and the HSE wants it to be 9:1, and they can argue over it and meet in the middle.  I am hearing that there is no such piece of paper, and, therefore, the discussions about where to pare off the &euro;80 million are done with no statistics, analysis or evidence of best practice from an international or OECD perspective.  If that is the case, how do the parties negotiate with no starting point?<\/p><p>  As a patient, if I did not understand the difference between a nurse in a white uniform and a nurse in a green uniform I probably would experience no difference in care because of the superb quality of care given by undergraduates, trainees or nurses with 20 years' experience.<\/p> <p>Is the skills mix we are trying to achieve to secure the best value for money such that we would not need to have a ratio of ten patients to one nurse, that we could have, say, a ratio of 12 patients to every nurse as long as the nurse had a trainee nurse working with him or her under supervision?  I do not fully understand it, but is that the process Mr. Doran would have been trying to achieve in the negotiations that would have taken place in next 12 months which obviously have now been thwarted by the letter he received?  If at the end of that 12 months negotiating process the same outcome was put before him that they are trying to achieve today, would he be happy with it?  On what is he basing his organisation's best practice data?  Are they on the basis of what his organisation's members are telling him, or are there other best practice analyses from Australia or elsewhere?  I ask him to point me in the right direction.  I cannot even find reports on the web because the OECD material is very confusing in that it appears one country can get away with having five nurses per 1,000 population, whereas we have a ratio of 14.5 nurses.

Unfortunately, I had a prior engagement which was arranged more than two months ago and I could not get out of it.  I apologise for missing Mr. Doran's presentation.  Following on from his replies to earlier questions, on the management structure in the HSE, we have seen it happen in the private sector during the past two to three years where, for example, one organisation reduced its seven grade management structure to three.  Does Mr. Doran consider it is time to examine this in the HSE and are there certain grades that are not needed?  One of the concerns I have about the management structure - I spoke to the Minister and the Taoiseach about this recently - is that many jobs are now being filled on a temporary basis.  Staff are in temporary positions for two to three years and then suddenly find they are permanent.  Once there is a vacancy, they are moving up the line without going through an interview process.  That is the information I have received and it is an issue about which I am extremely concerned.  My first question is does Mr. Doran believe we need to consider reducing the number of layers in the management structure?<\/p><p>  The second issue I wish to raise is the cost of agency staff.  I have consistently raised this issue during the past three years, particularly when it was focused on junior doctors, and we have now moved on to consultants and nursing staff.  We have an overall figure, but does Mr. Doran have a breakdown of the cost of agency nursing staff?  I may be incorrect, but I understand agency staff costs in January alone were &euro;10 million.  Does Mr. Doran have an idea of what the total cost of agency staff will be in 2014?   <\/p><p>  The third issue I wish to raise is that of maternity hospitals.  It is one about which I am very concerned, as are the delegates.  I understand nursing staff in Portlaoise hospital had been filing their concerns consistently, not for a number of months but for a number of years, and no action has been taken.  I have compared the position in Portlaoise hospital to that in a school.  A toal of 1,000 babies a year were being delivered in Portlaoise hospital and that number increased to 2,000, but the hospital had fewer rather than more staff to deal with the increase.  If we compare this to the position in a school in which the enrolment has increased from 1,000 to 2,000 pupils, all hell would break lose if it were to be left with the same number of teachers to deal with the increased number of pupils, but we seem to have accepted this position in the case of hospitals, especially maternity care services.  We have a further report this morning on Cavan hospital on access to a theatre.  We have a number of problems in maternity hospitals, especially the 11 smaller units around the country as regards the provision of adequate support, especially nursing staff.  <\/p><p>  To return to Portlaoise hospital, why was someone not forced to take action once nursing staff had filed genuine complaints and concerns?  Where does the buck stop?  Who did not take action when it was clearly indicated that it was urgently required?  I understand a large number of genuine complaints were filed by nursing staff in the hospital and also in other units where no action has been taken.  Where does the buck stop?  If it is not with the hospital manager, where along the line does it stop?

As an aside, one of the pressures on the HSE this year is that the medical agency spend has increased by  more than 100% because of EWTD compliance.  That is a further drain on resources and the burden is having to be carried by others.  I point out to the Senator and colleagues that we tried to make this point in our initial submission.  Our heart is broken by the fact that the agency spend has been targeted by the HSE for a reduction, but then it targets the grades that its argues are incurring the spend.  They are only incurring it because local management has decided that while it cannot fill a post directly, it has to fill it to maintain patient care.  It is a decision made by local management, not by nurses on a ward, but now they are having to pay the price, as it were, because a budget has to be tackled.  It is a flawed policy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700009#H01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Doran"},{"type":"speech","time":1403010000,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Will the spend in 2014 be &euro;84 million?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700009#H01200","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403010000,"counter":372,"content":"<p>No.  The figure was &euro;84 million from April 2013 to April 2014.<br \/>In regard to maternity services, the Senator and other members of the committee are correct in that the public record shows that in 2006 every single midwife in Portlaoise hospital had raised concerns about the unit.  They wrote to local Deputy who was Minister for Finance at the time.  They also wrote to the head of the HSE at the time.  Investigations were undertaken but nothing changed.  The birth rate went up.  The numbers did not decrease, <i>per se<\/i>, rather they were maintained, but the birth rate had increased.  However, numbers were not increased to monitor it.  We reached a situation in 2009, 2010 and 2011 where the numbers were very poor.  The ratio was 1 midwife to 55 births at the beginning of this year and in March it had increased to 1 midwife to 70 births.  These are the HSE's figures, not ours, lest anyone decides to question them.  The norm in the United Kingdom, accepted in its Birthrate Plus programme, is one midwife to 29.5 births.  In the North the current ratio is one midwife to 26 births.  The current national average here is one midwife to 40 births.  No hospital has a ratio of 1:29.5; the best is Holles Street and one other where the ratio is 1:32.  The ratio in Portlaoise hospital is 1:55.<\/p> <p>We are trying to address that with active recruitment.  The problem is, and this is not meant to be an excuse to anyone, we have to grow our own midwifes.  One cannot just snap one's fingers and have them appear.  It takes four years to train a midwife or we have to get them back from abroad.  There is not a surplus of midwives abroad who can come back.  In the absence of a manpower plan, we are climbing a mountain to try to stabilise the situation with reference to an accepted tool, namely, the birth rate plus of one midwife to 29.5 patients.<\/p><p> The Deputy made a valid point in that our hearts are broken in regard to the nurse to population ratio.   The OECD refers to a ratio of about 14.5 or 14.8, with reference to the total number of nurses on the live register maintained by An Bord Altranais as compared to the population.  It is not with reference to the number of nurses working or employed.  In its reports, the Department of Health has acknowledged this and says the more accurate number is about 10.2:1,000, which is slightly below average within the OECD because the others are maintained by the numbers who are not nursing.  A fair point made by the Deputy is that we have only one qualification for nursing while some other countries which have ten would have a second-level nurse in the form of a licensed nurse or vocational nurse who would undertake a shorter course.  We chose not to do that and I think we are right, with respect.  We have excellence.  This country is world class in how it trains and educates undergraduate nurses to graduate level.  Ms Grace Murphy is going through a world class course but we do not fully utilise them.  We help them to qualify and let them emigrate but we are about the norm in terms of the average.  What we hope to do is begin the process of stabilising the nursing workforce with reference to international best practice and norms.  With that mix of staff, one rate of qualification of nurse, a HCA, FETAC level 5, our hope was to bring them in and agree job description for surgical, medical wards to begin with and spanning it later.  We genuinely thought that was the beginning of finding the floor.  <\/p><p> We have a campaign about nursing hours per patient day similar to New South Wales, Australia. That would be our preferred model and we will bring that process to the table.  That counts for nothing if, in the real world, staff are not replaced or, when they are replaced, they are replaced with interns on the support staff programme, which is what they are going to do here, regardless of its impact.  The negative impact on patients is often a slow burner.  It is not my cost base.  I might discharge a patient in a shorter time, the patient might have a greater level of cross-infection but there are drugs, so that the cost base increases in ways which are hidden but my staffing cost goes down, so I am a good boy.  That is the way the system is run much too frequently.  We are not looking at quality patient outcomes, level of readmission and the cross-infection rate.  The HIQA report on University of Limerick hospital group is sobering to anyone who has a belief in a public health system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700009#H01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Doran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403010600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>If the merit in that process is seen by all, and Mr. Doran definitely sees it, and obviously so did the HSE, otherwise it would not have started it-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700010#J00200","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403010600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>With respect it was the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Doran"},{"type":"speech","time":1403010600,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Sorry, what of the sledge hammer?

There are many questions about skill mix, staffing numbers, registered nurses, health care assistants, costs, agency spend and so on.  As a registered nurse and as a ward sister or ward manager, what I see is that the HSE is cutting incorrect priorities such as targets, money and cost savings.  That the HSE puts those priorities before the needs of patients is detrimental for the public.  I am a taxpayer and as such I am entitled to a good public health service.  We must place quality of patient care and safety before any other aim.<br \/>Deputy Billy Kelleher asked a question about fear.  There are nurses who go to work every day in fear and go on night duty in fear that they will not be able to provide adequate safe care for patients because there are not enough of them.  It is unfair to patients and it is unfair to all of us.  The irony of all this is that the HSE is trying to save &euro;180 million but yet it is wasting money on providing services with agency nurses and other agency professionals when it will not allow us hire nurses directly.  It is absolutely insane.  This plan will cost money and lives.  It will cost nurses their registration because we are being forced into making mistakes.  A 2013 report from Mid-Staffordshire stated that good people can fail to meet the needs of patients when their working conditions do not provide them with the conditions for success.  This is the problem we have at present.  The HSE, my employer, is forcing me to make a mistake at work and forcing me to provide poor care for patients because there are not enough nurses because it is putting targets and costs before patient safety and patient care.  That is detrimental.<br \/>On the issue of registered nurses and health care assistants, another irony is that the better the nurse and the better qualified the nurse is, the less likelihood there is of the patient or the client noticing what has actually happened.  If I am a really good registered nurse and walk into a ward I can see in ten seconds what is wrong with a patient, what are the problems and a deterioration in the patient's condition.  That is what Ms Grace Murphy is learning but she cannot tell that at the moment and any health care assistant will never be able to do that.  That is the difference and that is how it will cost us money<b>.<\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700010#J00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Talty"},{"type":"speech","time":1403010600,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I call Ms Claire Mahon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014061700010#J01000","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403010600,"counter":383,"content":"<p>Just briefly, the RN forecast was mentioned.  It is clear from page 4 of the document provided to the committee that there is a wealth of international information which proves the benefits of higher ratio of nurse to patient.  I would like to relate this to the patient at the bedside.  We all have to think of how we want to be cared for.  Do we want to be cared for by somebody who is overworked, stressed, over-burdened, anxious, upset and distressed or by professionals who know what they are doing and are working in a diverse skill mix?  We do that every day of the week but in a trained skill mix that has the knowledge and is regulated when it comes to our nursing graduates and qualified nursing staff.  To put an ill-qualified nurse in a situation where she feels unsafe does harm to patients, not just to the nurse.  We are being forced to do that.  We all have to think seriously about the social dynamic of how we want to be cared for across all our care environments because currently they are not safe.  We have said this previously.  We appeared before the committee in November 2012 and presented a staffing survey, carried out by an independent person, Dr. Keith Hurst, from the UK, which showed we had on average six fewer staff per shift in Irish hospitals wards than in the UK.

Expressions of interest may not deliver the best person for the job, which is a further weight upon the health service.  We all want to be led by leaders and those who challenge us every day.

I am here today because the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has asked me to serve a second term as chairman of the authority.  I thank the committee for the invitation to present an overview of my professional background and the key challenges facing the authority in the next few years.  I look forward to answering any questions after my brief presentation.<br \/>I qualified as a pharmacist in 1982 and obtained a master's degree in business administration from University College Dublin in 1993.  In recent years I have completed a number of modules in the director of development programme at the Centre for Corporate Governance at UCD.  I also regularly attend courses provided by the Institute of Directors which focus on corporate governance, board dynamics and the duties and responsibilities of a chairman.<br \/>I have spent practically all of my career working in safety-critical environments.  From 1982 to 1987 I worked in retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesaling.  In 1987 I joined the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, a trade association that used to represent all of the rapidly growing chemical, pharmaceutical and allied industries in Ireland.  In 1994 the pharmaceutical part of the business, which supplies medicines to the health services, became the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association.  I was appointed the first chief executive of the association in July 1994.<br \/>It would be worthwhile for the committee if I briefly touched on the work of the IPHA and the sector it represents.  In common with aviation, the sector is highly innovative and creates a large number of high-quality jobs.  For a country this size, we have an immensely vibrant pharmaceutical sector which employs more than 25,000 people directly and as many more in support services.  Between 2011 and 2013 more than &euro;1.7 billion was invested in the sector, which led to the creation of an additional 1,500 jobs.<br \/>In addition to my role as CEO of the IPHA, I have served on the board of the Irish Medicines Board for ten years and the board of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland for six years, and I have also served as chairman of their respective audit committees.  I was a member of the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, which regulates pharmacists, for four years.  I also served nine years on the Irish board of the Smurfit Graduate Business School.  I currently serve on the board of the Association of the European Self-Medication Industry and the executive committee of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations.  I am an assistant professor and lecturer in management science at the school of pharmacy at Trinity College Dublin.<br \/>In July 2010 I was appointed as the fifth chairman of the IAA, having first been appointed to the board as a non-executive director in 2006.  Collectively, my experience as a senior executive in the pharmaceutical industry and as a board member of three regulatory authorities, along with my academic qualifications and my 27 years of experience in the FICI and IPHA boardrooms, have enabled me to effectively and positively discharge my duties as chairman of the IAA.  I am truly delighted to have been asked to serve a second term, as we have commenced a number of key strategic projects, alliances and commitments.  I would very much like to be part of the IAA during this very exciting time and as these strategic initiatives come to fruition.<br \/><b><\/b>I shall give a short overview of the Irish aviation industry.  It is important to contextualise Ireland's role in the global aviation industry as well as its impact on the Irish economy.  I know the committee is aware that the aviation sector is hugely important to Ireland, because other IAA chairpersons who have attended the committee have underlined that point.  Our island status means that we are far more dependent on aviation than many of our continental neighbours and trading partners.  The sector contributes just over &euro;4 billion to our GDP, of which &euro;1.9 billion comes from aviation directly, &euro;1.3 billion comes through the supply chain and the remaining &euro;900 million comes from associated spending by people employed in aviation.  The sector supports 26,000 jobs directly and a further 16,000 in the supply chain.  Ireland's tourism industry, which is hugely dependent on aviation, accounts for a further &euro;5.3 billion contribution to GDP and 180,000 jobs.<br \/>As the committee will be aware, aviation is a highly competitive and global business.  It is marvellous to see Ireland play a leading role in the industry.  Ireland punches well above its weight in the global aviation industry thanks to the pioneering efforts of its predecessors, who were able to turn dreams into reality and capitalised on Ireland's collective determination and world-class skill set.<br \/>There are approximately 20,000 large aircraft such as Boeing 737s and Airbus 320s in operation globally at this time.  As many as 8,000 of them are leased, of which 4,300 are managed out of Ireland.  This represents a quarter of the world's entire fleet.  This business all started under the late Dr. Tony Ryan through GPA, and now nine of the world's ten largest aircraft leasing companies are located here.  They employ more than 2,000 people directly and indirectly in challenging, satisfying and well-paid jobs.<br \/>We have achieved a leading position in the air finance and leasing sector.  We are seen as a global powerhouse in that area.  We also have a number of highly successful and much-admired international airlines which between them carry a staggering 112 million passengers on nearly 700,000 flights around Ireland and Europe and to the US.  There were 12,000 more flights in 2013 than in 2012, which marks 12 consecutive years of consistent growth for this sector of the Irish aviation industry.  Due to the successful leasing industry and the size of some of our airlines, there are more than 1,200 aircraft on the Irish register, including 750 large aircraft.  As a result, Ireland is Boeing's single largest customer outside of the USA, a truly phenomenal position.<br \/>Furthermore, the Irish aviation sector is comprised of many entities and activities beyond the more familiar areas such as airports, successful airlines and leasing companies.  For example, Ireland has a very strong tradition and reputation in the aerospace sphere.  In particular, the maintenance, repair and overhaul sub-sector plays a vital role in supporting the wider aviation sector in Ireland, including airline and airport activity, aircraft finance and leasing activity and manufacturing.  There are many other businesses which service the sector, such as pilot and aviation engineer training facilities, aeromedical centres, simulator farms, specialist aviation seat and carpet makers, export-focused component manufacturers and academic institutions, to name just a few.  Ireland is also home to a number of corporate aviation companies supplying private aviation services to clients.  We also have a thriving and enthusiastic general and sports aviation community.<br \/>When I first joined the IAA board I was truly struck by the size of the sector here and the range of activities going on at any one time.  Ireland's geographical location means it has a strategic prominence in the north Atlantic.  In terms of air traffic management, it stands as the marshalling yard between Europe and North America.  As much as 90% of all air traffic to and from the US travels through Irish airspace, which is the busiest oceanic airspace in the world.  On any given day the IAA is charged with the safe handling of approximately 1,800 flights which pass through Irish airspace.  This happens at our air traffic control facility in Shannon, 24 hours in a day and 365 days a year.<br \/>Dublin Airport is currently the seventh largest airport in Europe in terms of passenger numbers.  While it suffered dreadfully during the downturn, there is now a sharp upswing.  So far this year there has been a 7% growth in air traffic numbers.<\/p> <p>The utilisation of the main runway is among the best in Europe and the number of aircraft it can safely handle per hour is second only to Gatwick, which has a superior ground infrastructure to Dublin, enabling easier access to the runway.  I have highlighted all of these facts because the sheer scale of the contribution that aviation makes needs to be borne in mind when reviewing the role and contribution of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA.<br \/>Turning to the IAA, the company has a key role to play across all of the sectors I have just mentioned.  The IAA is responsible for the management of Irish controlled airspace covering some 451,000 sq. km.  Air traffic management includes the provision of operational services, engineering and communications in our vast airspace and the provision of the related air traffic technological infrastructure.  <br \/>We are also responsible for the safety regulation of the civil aviation industry in Ireland and, in recent years, we have taken on responsibility for aviation security regulation in Ireland.  <br \/>I would like to highlight some key points about the IAA for the committee.  The IAA&rsquo;s remit is to always act in the public interest first and foremost, and safety is at the very heart of our business.  It is, in essence, our corporate mission and underpins everything we do.  The board and the executive management foster a culture throughout the organisation where safety is paramount.<br \/>The authority ensures that Irish civil aviation operates to international and European safety standards and systems in accordance with international agreements and protocols.  The Safety Regulation Directorate, SRD, of the IAA is charged with overseeing the implementation of these standards and its activities, in turn, are subject to regular independent audits by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, the European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA - I am sorry; we speak in acronyms a lot - and Eurocontrol.  I do not know what that stands for but it is the international air traffic management organisation based in Brussels.<br \/>The IAA has an excellent track record in the discharge of its duties and obligations as aviation safety regulator for Ireland.  In July 2013, for example, Ireland was ranked first out of 29 European states for the measure of effectiveness of safety management by Eurocontrol.  In 2011, Ireland was ranked among the best in the world for civil aviation safety oversight, following an intensive international audit by the ICAO conducted during 2010.  We were ranked by ICAO third in Europe and fourth worldwide, ahead of countries such as the USA, Germany and the Netherlands.  <br \/>We achieve this high standard through our risk based oversight process, which focuses on three main aspects.  First, our rolling surveillance programme involves the auditing of all Irish registered airlines wherever they operate.  These audits cover their aircraft, flight crews, maintenance, fuel facilities and so on.  The spot checks can be planned &ndash; or unplanned and unannounced.<br \/>Second, it is important to understand that the primary responsibility for safety lies with the operator and thus each airline is itself responsible for the safe operation of its service through the implementation of what we call a safety management system, SMS, which is effectively an internal control system.  We audit their SMSs to ensure they meet with the highest international standards and to ensure that they comply with all regulatory requirements.<br \/>Third, we monitor airlines and the overall system performance through the mandatory and voluntary incident occurrence reporting systems.  Irish air operator certificate holders must report any occurrence which affects or is likely to affect the safety of the aircraft to the IAA.  These reports are analysed to assess the safety risks associated with the incident.  If an elevated safety risk is identified, appropriate action will be taken by the authority.  The IAA recently participated in a survey of international reporting rates, the results of which indicated that Ireland has a strong reporting culture.<br \/>I will make some brief comments on our financial position.  The IAA is completely self-funded and receives no funding from the State.  Our revenues are generated through charges and fees, which are among the lowest in Europe, raised from our regulatory clients and airline customers in respect of their regulatory and operational activities.<br \/><b><\/b>The IAA is a profitable company.<b><\/b>In 2013, we generated an operating profit of &euro;25.7 million on a turnover of &euro;173.5 million and paid a dividend to the shareholder of &euro;4.8 million from our after-tax profits.  The IAA&rsquo;s multi-annual financial plan envisages, <i>ceteris parabus<\/i>, that we will make the same contribution in the years ahead.<br \/><b><\/b>The IAA has no debt<b><\/b>and we have adequate cash to service our planned expenditure on our critical technological needs over the next five years.<br \/><b><\/b>The IAA has no pension issues.  In accordance with the requirements of FRS17, plans were put in place a number of years ago to eliminate the pension deficit.  I am pleased to say that the IAA remains on target to achieve its forecasted reduction in the pension deficit by 2018.<br \/>Seventy-five per cent of our income is derived from our international activities.  For example, over 68% of our revenue comes from en route air traffic, that is, traffic that  flies through our airspace without ever landing, and British Airways is our largest customer in that regard.<br \/>The authority&rsquo;s competitive position is among the very best in Europe<b><\/b>with well below average charges to customers and high levels of operational performance and project delivery.  Our en route costs are among the lowest for Eurocontrol member states, the fourth lowest overall in 2014.  Our gate to gate average financial cost effectiveness was &euro;385 against a European average of &euro;423 as determined in June 2013 by Eurocontrol.  <br \/>We have one of the highest customer satisfaction ratings<b><\/b>for an ATC service.  The 2013 customer survey of the IAA&rsquo;s top 25 revenue generators showed a very high level of satisfaction with our activities at 90.94%, which is up from 90.8% in 2012.<br \/><b><\/b>We employ approximately 650 highly skilled people<b><\/b>such as experienced commercial airline pilots, aircraft engineers, and air traffic controllers.  These personnel are located at five locations throughout Ireland.<br \/>To ensure productivity and efficiencies are as good as they can be, and to ensure the long-term viability of the organisation, the IAA has entered into a number of strategic partnerships and alliances<b><\/b>with other air navigation service providers, regulatory authorities and the private sector.  In the short to medium term this gives us access to cutting edge aviation management and safety technologies.  For example, our COOPANS air traffic management system is the most modern system in Europe, and this ensures efficiencies in the deployment of our personnel and savings for our airline customers.<br \/>In December 2013, we became a shareholder in an entity called Entry Point North, which is an international air traffic control training academy.  In January 2014, the IAA became a shareholder in a very interesting company called Aireon, which is a provider of space based satellite ATC surveillance systems.<br \/>As part of our endeavours to support Irish aviation<b><\/b>and with a view to promoting the importance of the industry, we have developed a number of ancillary events and activities such as FlightFest in September 2013, which was the largest free public event of The Gathering last year, and only last week we sponsored the inaugural Aviation Industry Awards, which have been established to give recognition to the leading businesses across our industry.<br \/>I will briefly address our approach to corporate governance in the authority. The IAA is a wholly owned commercial semi-State company which was established under the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993, and is governed by the provisions of that Act as well as the Air Navigation and Transport Acts and, like all private companies, the Companies Acts.  We also comply with a number of other pieces of legislation and policies such as the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies and the Ethics in Public Office Act.  The board insists on the highest standards of governance, and we monitor progress towards that objective regularly.<br \/>I will outline some of the key features of our company.  In short, the IAA is a safety focused, financially independent, profitable, well-managed and well regarded international business, which works at the very heart of the aviation sector in Ireland to ensure that our airspace is as efficient and safe as it can be.<br \/>There are many challenges in the years ahead.  As Chairman of the IAA it is incumbent upon me to support the board and the executive in their efforts to properly deal with all of these challenges and in their aspirations to achieve and exceed the organisation&rsquo;s goals.  I will set out our key challenges.  First, we must above all else maintain our high safety record.  We must never be complacent about safety matters.  We must never take it as a given, and we must continue to ensure that it remains our primary focus and that it is at the heart of everything we do.  This will be achieved through our robust three-pronged safety oversight processes comprised of our rolling safety surveillance programme; our oversight of the airlines&rsquo; safety management systems, and our constant monitoring of the incidents and occurrence reports.<br \/>Second, we must innovate continuously and invest in the right technology.<\/p> <p>That is a key pillar that helps us to provide a safe, efficient and competitive service which will meet our customers&rsquo; needs.  That is why we are planning to continue to invest in modern systems and infrastructure.  We are well ahead of other states in that regard through our cutting edge automated safety oversight tools, highly advanced air traffic management, ATM, system and participation in the company to which I referred, Aireon, which will be a step change in air traffic surveillance in the years ahead.<br \/>Next, we must continue to improve our efficiency and reduce costs.  Our customers and stakeholders require this of us.  Almost 80% of our business is now subject to economic regulation, with the objective of driving down costs even further.  As a very lean business already, especially relative to other companies across Europe, that is a challenge to be met.  Innovation in our processes, technology and procedures will help us to achieve this.<br \/>We must continue to remain financially independent<b><\/b>and ensure a return to the shareholder.  This will be achieved through robust oversight by the board of the IAA&rsquo;s planning and investment strategies and financial functions.<br \/>With the European Union looking to liberalise the European air traffic management market through implementation of the Single European Sky legislative package, the IAA must keep on top of the proposed changes.  We must develop further relevant and productive strategic partnerships and alliances<b><\/b>with other jurisdictions with a view to ensuring the success of existing and proposed functional airspace blocks, FABs, which are designed to reduce costs to airspace users.<br \/>We must start to prepare for an uplift in the Irish and global economies.  The IAA has received planning permission to build a new tower at Dublin Airport.  We put the project on hold about five years ago on account of the economic downturn and the consequent slump in traffic at State airports, including Dublin.  Traffic has now started to pick up and we estimate that we will be back to 2008 levels by 2020.  If that happens, the single runway at Dublin Airport will not be enough to handle all aircraft.  We would like to see the DAA and the Government take the initiative to construct a parallel runway.  We could then go ahead with our tower project and by 2020 the IAA would be in excellent shape to meet capacity demands at Dublin Airport.<br \/>As chairman of the IAA, it is my strongly held view that Ireland should continue to support and encourage this sector, that we should exceed normal expectations and position Ireland as a true centre of excellence in aviation.  Through this approach, the aviation industry will be able to provide more high quality jobs, more taxes and wealth in the economy and Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as the best little country in which to do aviation business will grow and grow.<br \/>I thank the Chairman and members for their attention.  I am happy to take their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014061700003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403023800,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Nolan for a full report on her role and the important role played by the IAA in the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014061700005#D00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1403023800,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Nolan for her overview of the industry.

It was very unfortunate and we were very sorry to see it happen.  It was, as the Deputy said, very difficult for the students involved.  We were asked to help as best we could, given that our remit covered the oversight of the safety at the college.  One of the problems at the time was trying to secure training records for the students which they needed to be able to move to another training school to continue their training, for which they had paid a great deal of money.  We offered advice and help in liaising with students.  We sent a captain to Florida and another person to Waterford to try to help the students.  We installed a helpline and paid for students to be repatriated.  We did our best to try to help them.  As I understand it, 183 students managed to continue their training.  The outcome is unknown in the case of the other 107 as some of them returned to Bahrain and the countries from which they had come.  We were sincerely sympathetic to everybody involved and did everything within our power.  We made suggestions as to how this scenario might be prevented in the future and suggested bonding might be a solution.  I understand it would be very expensive to do this and that it might, therefore, make the training colleges uneconomic.  I do not think there is legally a need for bonding, but it was a suggestion we thought might help.  I think students do not pay the lump sum of &euro;80,000 upfront.  Payments are staggered which is probably a help and I hope students will not find themselves in this situation again.<\/p><p>  It was remarkable that none of the Irish airlines won an award.  An independent panel of judges made the awards and the best airlines won on the day.  It was such a successful event that there will be an opportunity to enter the competition next year.  It does not mean that there is anything wrong with the Irish airlines.  Their safety record is on a par with that of the best airlines globally.  They are measured and audited to the same extent as every other airline.  A better airline pipped them to the post on the day.  There is always next year.  We look forward to welcoming some members of the committee to the awards ceremony next year.<\/p><p>  Aireon is the way to go.  We invested in it just after Christmas and it will solve the dreadful problem with flights such as MH370 because radar monitoring ends at a certain point in the ocean.  As I understand it, the system will be up and running by 2018 approximately.  We intend to capitalise on the opportunities it might present for the authority in the years ahead.  There are changes to the EU policy of the Single European Sky and our business will change.  We hope it will give us a new lease of life and help us to get bigger and better and create more jobs in the Irish aviation sector.<\/p><p>  The Deputy must pardon me as I cannot remember it and did not bring the figure, but I think the after tax profit figure was in the region of &euro;12 million to &euro;13 million.  We paid 30% to the Government.  The policy is to ask organisations such as ours to pay at least 30%, recognising that sometimes it might be less and sometimes more.<\/p> <p>Last year we paid 50% of our after-tax profits.  Because of the pension position, for a few years prior to that we were not in a position to pay a dividend and felt we would like to make it up to the State as best we could, so we offered a 50% dividend in 2012.  We hope to be able to pay and that our business will be as good as it possibly can be.  I hope I have answered the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014061700005#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1403024400,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Nolan.

Some of the statistics she has presented are strong and encouraging.  Sometimes in those environments one wonders whether one can do more.  One does not want to slip into a position where one is comfortable or the company is complacent in terms of how it achieves its results.  I congratulate the Irish Aviation Authority on its safety record in particular.  Ms Nolan mentioned that in July 2013, Ireland ranked first out of 29 European countries in a measurement of the effectiveness of safety management in the Eurocontrol performance review body annual monitoring report on safety.  Is Ireland consistently at the top of the league on an annual basis?  While she mentioned that Ireland was top of the league in a given year, I assume that is not an isolated occurrence.  I note that the airports over which the Irish Aviation Authority has authority are Shannon, Dublin and Cork.  What are the obligations to the smaller airports nationwide in terms of safety and any other areas?  Cork South-West is the constituency I represent, and Cork airport is very important for many of the Cork and Munster constituencies.  The environment in Cork has been difficult.  The statistics show that Dublin Airport is getting ahead, Shannon is doing well in respect of commercial traffic and Cork airport is bouncing along a flat line.  Can Ms Nolan outline how the Irish Aviation Authority deals with the airport authority at Cork?  Does she have a view as to how we can improve the situation in Cork?  I note what she said about Dublin in regard to the second tower and a parallel runway, all of which is excellent news for Dublin, but is there a similar strategy in place to help Cork airport increase its traffic?<\/p><p>  I note that parts of the United States, or perhaps all of it at this stage, are allowing the use of electronic devices on board.  Is this an issue for the Irish Aviation Authority?  Is the matter being discussed?

I thank the Deputy for his congratulations.  It is effectively my third term.  The business is so different and so technical that it takes some time to get up to speed.  Everybody speaks in acronyms.  By the time one gets ahead of the acronyms, a couple of years have gone by.  The role of chairman is a completely different role than that of a regular board member.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about our statistics and whether we are consistently at the top of the safety league.  Yes, we have been at the top for the past four or five years.  We are consistently considered to be at the top not only by Europe but also by the International Civil Aviation Organization.  They are different bodies and they measure different things.  As chairman, I get great comfort from the fact that we are generally at the top.  We may not always be first but we might be one, two, three, four or whatever.  I would be extremely worried if we were at other end of the business.  I am rather pleased from that point of view.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the statistics for Cork airport.  I had a look at the latest figures and I thought the committee might be interested to see them.  Shannon terminal movements are doing very well and are up 21%, almost 22%.  Dublin terminal movements are up 7.5%, and Cork is up, which is good.  Every time I have seen figures for the past couple of years, the terminal airports have been down.  Overall, our terminal business is up 8.1%.  That is why we believe we will need our new control tower in a few years' time, sooner rather than later.  We did build a new control tower in Cork a few years ago, so we were trying to help out.  I was present at its opening a few years ago but, unfortunately, traffic slumped.  Aviation works on a collegiate and collaborative basis and we all try to help each other.  While responsibility lies with the airports, in the Irish Aviation Authority we are trying to do whatever we can to help float all boats.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014061700006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1403024400,"counter":421,"content":"<p>The Irish Aviation Authority collaborates and there is a strategy for Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014061700006#E00600","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403024400,"counter":422,"content":"<p>We do not have a specific strategy for Cork, although I am sure Cork Airport has one itself, but we do collaborate very effectively.

As a citizen, my view is that it would be wonderful if we could afford to keep all of our regional airports.  That may or may not be possible.  In our aviation promotion policies, the whole idea is to promote the island of Ireland as a centre of excellence for aviation in and out, leasing companies and so on.  We are doing our best.  As I understand it, there are similar discussions taking place in other countries throughout Europe, and there may be a possibility of remotely controlled tower activities, which might help save a few bob somewhere along the way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014061700006#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1403024400,"counter":423,"content":"<p>Ms Nolan mentioned the regional airports and air traffic control.

Would Sligo Airport have closed if those taking flights could be assured they could be in Dublin Airport half an hour before the flight time?

Deputy Griffin referred to the ash cloud.  When that happened I was acting chairman of the authority, and I was caught in Lisbon in the thick of it, if you will pardon the pun.  I was away from all the activity but I got many telephone calls asking me what I was doing and why I was not there, although, obviously, I could not get home.  I believe - and we took the view at the time - that the Irish Aviation Authority and the other authorities throughout Europe that were affected by the event took a rather cautious approach.  At the time that was absolutely the right thing to do.  That was the first time such a thing had happened.  Now, each time I meet my Icelandic colleagues I ask them how the monster is doing.  Last week they told me it was palpitating.  That is a good thing and it means it is not going to explode on us.  The chances are that it might happen again, but the European aviation authorities will be in a better position to handle it.<\/p><p>  We bought some equipment after the last incident because we had been reliant on what the authorities in the United Kingdom and Eurocontrol were doing.  We decided that we needed to be able to take our own measurements for ash cloud readings and so on, so we bought some Lidar equipment.  I am unsure of the detail.  I understand that if it happens again, when a certain level of ash is detected, individual civil aviation authorities will be able to make their own decisions.  In other words, there may not be a blanket closing down of the entire airspace around Europe and we will be able to make our own decisions.  Some of the airlines will be kitted out in such a way that they will be able to make decisions as well.  Depending on their technology, some of them may be able to fly in heavier ash cloud than others.  However, if the ash cloud were to reach a certain level then the Eurocontrol people would step in and close the entire place down.  However, hopefully that will not happen again.  That is what we will do in future.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to skimping on fuel.  There is absolutely no possibility of airlines on our register skimping on fuel.  I know there have been some reports in newspapers and so on, but they do not do that.  They have to carry a certain level and we check that.  Our inspectors will turn up at the fuelling depots or on the ramp and explain that they will be travelling with the captain on that day, whether announced or unannounced.  The inspectors check that.  We watch out for things like that all the time.  It is not in the airlines' interests.  They have to carry certain levels of fuel.  If there are very bad weather conditions on approach to an airport, for example, and the airplane has to go into a holding pattern for a given period, then the fuel will drop to a certain level.  The aircraft is then obliged to declare an emergency landing.  That is all specified, and commanders of aircraft have to follow the rules; they have absolutely no choice in the matter and we check it regularly.  I would not be concerned about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014061700008#G01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1403025600,"counter":460,"content":"<p>How often has that happened with aircraft originating from Irish airspace and those landing in Irish airspace?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014061700008#G01600","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1403025600,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I actually do not know the answer to that.

That is on the cards and it is going through with the single European sky legislative package at the moment.  At the moment there are 42 different air traffic navigation service providers throughout Europe.  I have the map before me.  The committee members are welcome to examine it and it is probably on our website as well.  It looks remarkably complicated, unlike in America, where the Federal Aviation Administration is one company that is set up in the same way as the IAA, with safety regulation and air navigation services.  The European Union is working towards tidying that up and consolidating it.  The Union has put all of us into what are termed functional airspace blocks.  Naturally, we are in a block with the United Kingdom.  In the past four or five years we have been working very closely with the United Kingdom on various aspects of the provision of air navigation services.  Apparently this has resulted in savings of tens of millions of dollars for the airlines.  The point is that it will result in savings for airline customers and give passengers a better experience.  I remember going to Brussels years ago and we would be in a holding pattern for 20 or 25 minutes before we could land.<\/p> <p>I certainly feel that things have improved from that point of view and in general in the context of functional airspace blocks, FABs.

She also stated that by 2020 the level of traffic at the airport will have returned to 2008 levels.  I met the CEO of Tourism Ireland earlier today and he painted a very positive picture with regard to the number of tourists visiting Ireland.  He suggested that the number of tourists visiting the country will return to the levels which obtained in 2007 and 2008 within a couple of years.  Two or three years ago there was a great deal of criticism regarding the construction of Terminal 2 and the fact that it was under-utilised at that point as a result of falling tourist numbers.  Obviously, the terminal will see good use in the very near future.  The other point the CEO of Tourism Ireland made is that there is a kind of three-tier development of the tourism product in Ireland.  Dublin represents the first tier in this regard.  It is doing very well but there is a danger that it might again become a tipping point because there are not enough hotel rooms available in the city.  The second tier comprises Galway, Limerick, Cork, etc., while outlying rural areas comprise the third tour.  There are many tourist attractions  in the latter areas which are not benefiting at all from recent developments.<\/p><p>  I am not suggesting that the new tower at Dublin Airport should not be built and neither am I contradicting Ms Nolan's view.  Tourist numbers dropped in the past as a result of the recession and the fact that Ireland was no longer competitive because prices had gone through the roof.  It appears that this could be happening again, particularly in Dublin where there is a shortage of hotel rooms.<\/p> <p>Is there a danger of another bubble that will, in the long term, cause problems for tourism in particular as well as traffic?
