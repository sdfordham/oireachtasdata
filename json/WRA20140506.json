This management is carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), the State Agency with statutory responsibility for inland fisheries under the 2010 Inland Fisheries Act. The individual river management strategy is based on the fact that each of Ireland&rsquo;s 143 salmon rivers has its own unique stock of salmon which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn and create the next generation of fish exclusive to that river.<\/p><p>  IFI is supported in its management of salmon stocks by a statutorily based Standing Scientific Committee on Salmon (SSCS) comprising scientists from IFI, an Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM), the Loughs Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI- Northern Ireland) other State bodies and third level institutions. This independent scientific committee assesses and offers advice on the predicted stocks status in all 143 Irish salmon rivers each year against that river's Conservation Limit using the most recent five years of available data from the catchment. The Conservation Limit is the number of adult salmon required on each river to maintain a healthy population, the stock level that maximizes the long-term average surplus. <\/p><p>  IFI also undertakes an extensive programme of patrol and protection of the fisheries resource, in gathering data on stock status and in seeking to improve angling potential and develop angling tourism. In 2013, IFI is currently involved in projects funded to the value of over &euro;9M in research on and enhancement and development of the inland fisheries resources and habitats with many projects active in the area of wild salmonids. IFI also administered projects under the Salmon Development Fund to the value of almost &euro;400,000 primarily through supports to angling clubs and federations.<\/p><p>  The Atlantic salmon is a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive and Ireland&rsquo;s current salmon management regime complies with the requirements of this legislation. The conservation imperative means that exploitation of salmon from each river is only permitted where the independent scientific committee determines that the stock in that river is above its conservation limit. The annual advice of the SCCS is available on the website of IFI.  For 2014, based on the scientific advice, of the 143 rivers assessed, 57 rivers are open to exploitation of a harvestable surplus, 30 are open to catch and release angling only and 56 are closed to all activity. Each of these rivers will be reviewed again as part of the annual scientific assessment later this year in contemplation of management measures for 2015.<\/p><p>  Commercial harvest fisheries are only allowed on individual river stocks which are shown to have a surplus of fish over the Conservation Limit.

That said, however, it needs to be borne in mind that these stations were established as commercial entities.  Station owners sought and accepted licences on clear terms; terms which included a limited amount of &lsquo;public service&rsquo; type content. Moreover, in many cases, their success in the licence application process was assisted by the voluntary commitments they gave in regard to the provision of public service type content, over and above that required by the relevant legislation.<\/p><p>  The licences were accepted in full knowledge of the current system of public funding. The fact that some of these stations are now undergoing a degree of financial stress is regrettable and a cause for concern but it does not mean that the State should step in and provide funding &ndash; they are and remain commercial enterprises.  The rationale for providing State funding for the Public Service Broadcasters is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows these corporations to attain their statutory public service objects while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence. This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.<\/p><p>  Over the last number of years, there have been calls from a wide range of media organisations in relation to the future distribution of licence fee funding. Before considering any wider distribution of public funds than that which applies at present, I would have to be convinced that such a distribution would represent a sound proposition in terms of policy for the sector and would not be to the ultimate disadvantage of our Public Service Broadcasters.  Even if I were minded to provide public monies to private investors, EU State Aid rules would apply. It is categorically not possible for the State to simply decide to fund a set of incumbent licence holders during a licence period.<\/p><p>  Additionally, the independent radio stations receive a significant amount of publicly funded support from the Broadcasting Funding Scheme.

In that role it provides scientific advice to my Department regarding the most up-to-date status of species under its brief.  Sea trout, bass and salmon are all managed as recreational angling species. All three are highly valuable angling species and provide the basis for significant employment and associated revenue generation in the angling tourism sector throughout Ireland.<\/p><p>  IFI manages salmon stocks on an individual river basis as each of Ireland&rsquo;s 143 salmon rivers has its own unique stock of salmon. IFI is supported in its management of salmon stocks by a statutorily based Standing Scientific Committee on Salmon comprising scientists from IFI, Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM), the Loughs Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI- Northern Ireland) other State bodies and third level institutions. IFI carries out extensive monitoring of salmon stock status which feed into the the scientific committee's assessments carried out every year. Sea trout greater than 40cm length are managed under the same regulations as salmon. <\/p><p>  The offshore and inshore salmon and sea trout commercial fisheries were closed in 2007 in order to comply with the EU Habitats Directive. A &euro;25M Hardship Scheme was established for fishermen. While the scheme was administered by BIM, I understand that the average payment under the scheme was almost &euro;23,000 and the highest payment was over &euro;195,000. Conditions of the scheme included that nets had to be verifiably decommissioned and those availing of the Scheme would not be entitled to a licence in the future. <\/p><p>  Commercial harvest fisheries are currently permitted on individual river stocks which are shown to be meeting their conservation limit. Fisheries in estuaries may also be permitted where the stocks from individual rivers entering the estuaries are each meeting their individual conservation limits. The current management approach allows Ireland to meet its international and national obligations in terms of salmon conservation and operate sustainable harvest fisheries (commercial and recreational) where this is feasible.<\/p><p>  The steep decline in bass stocks in Ireland in the mid-1970s resulted in a severe deterioration of the renowned Irish bass angling resource. Ultimately the decline led to the cessation of the commercial fishery in 1990 via the Bass (Conservation of Stocks) Order, 1990. Since then bass, which are at the extremes of its European distribution in Irish coastal waters, have been regarded solely as an angling species and are restrictively managed largely on a catch and release basis.<\/p><p>  Since 1990 Ireland has applied the precautionary principle in relation to management of Irish bass stocks and has concentrated on measures to enable the rebuilding of the severely depleted stock. Recent advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) is that data are insufficient in the wider Northeast Atlantic Area, which includes Ireland, to evaluate the status of bass and that, on a precautionary basis, catches should not be allowed to increase. The current advice states that Irish bass are slow growing and discrete and the stock is highly dependent on suitable environmental conditions for successful recruitment.<\/p><p>  IFI is currently delivering on its bass research programme, which seeks to provide greater insight into the ecology and biology of bass to support long-term bass sustainability. The outputs from this research and associated annual monitoring will, in the future, provide scientific advice to support the future management and conservation of Ireland&rsquo;s bass stocks. The current Irish management model is regarded as being progressive by many observers and there are no data to warrant any change in the management approach. I am advised that the focus should be to continue observing the precautionary principle and collecting better quality data on stock status as consistently advocated by ICES for all species as a fundamental policy approach.<\/p><p>  There are three species of mullet in Irish waters; the most abundant and common is the grey mullet. Grey mullet is also a popular recreational angling species which is sought after by specialist recreational anglers. I am advised that stock status is unknown as there is no formal stock assessment and no evaluation of mullet stocks by ICES in the north east Atlantic. Like bass, mullet are slow-growing, long-lived and late-maturing fish. In the absence of formal assessment I am advised by IFI that the precautionary principle is recommended. Opening up a fishery on stocks with an unknown status presents the possibility of over-exploitation without any measure of current sustainability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600053#WRA02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1069"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gas Distribution System","counter":33,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600053#WRA02350"},{"type":"question","counter":34,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[19937\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600053#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his views on the Western Development Commission paper, \"Why Invest in Gas?\", which outlines the clear benefit of extending the natural gas distribution network to the west\/north west; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This register includes central government buildings, some agencies and Garda stations.  In fulfilment of our obligations under article 5 of the Energy Efficiency Directive, OPW calculated the equivalent annual savings that would be achieved if 3% of the floor area was retrofitted and proposed using the &quot;alternative approach&quot; to achieve our energy saving requirements under the Directive, which in practice is an expansion of their successful <i>Optimising Power at Work<\/i>campaign, to targeted buildings in the wider public sector. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform allocated &euro;9m over three years to the OPW in Budget 2013 to expand this campaign. <\/p><p>There is also an obligation on all public sector organisations to report annually on their energy consumption. SEAI maintains a database of the public sector&rsquo;s energy usage and tracks each individual organisation&rsquo;s progress towards the 33% target. Although initially focussed on the top 135 energy-using public bodies, in time the objective is to include all 440 public bodies. Public bodies insert their electrical and gas meter numbers and SEAI gets the annual consumption for them for these energy uses. The database contains 40,000 meter numbers and is growing. Each public body receives an annual scorecard to show their progress. This database is being developed with linkages to the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) and will lead to better procurement of energy supplies for the public sector. A report on public sector energy consumption will be published later this year. <\/p><p>Under the Social Housing Investment Programme, funding is provided by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to local authorities for a wide range of measures aimed at improving the social housing stock. Over the course of 2011 and 2012, the Department of the Environment&rsquo;s retrofitting programme focussed exclusively on the refurbishment of vacant properties with the objective of returning as many of these to productive use. Over that period, some &euro;52.5 million was recouped to local authorities and some 4,774 properties were improved.<\/p><p>Phase 1 of the Energy Efficiency scheme (Fabric Upgrade-phase 1) commenced in June 2013 and targeted the improvement of insulation standards and overall energy performance across 30,000 social rented properties and continues in 2014. It is envisaged that all Phase 1 works will be completed in 2014 and funding drawn down by year end.  In 2014, a new measure with funding of &euro;15 million was announced which will be invested in bringing vacant and boarded-up local authority houses back into productive use. In this context, local authorities were recently advised that funding of up to &euro;30,000 per dwelling will be provided for a suite of retrofitting works to bring vacant properties back to a high standard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600053#WRA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cyber Security Policy","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600053#WRA02750"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[19943\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600053#WRA02800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if his Department has taken any action to address the heartbleed bug; if his Department has any strategy to protect State assets from cyber attacks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This will be achieved by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. For example:<\/p><p>- Eircom is rolling out a &euro;400m investment in a Next Generation Access Fibre Network that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps. Service is already available to over 800,000 addresses, with planned coverage to reach 1.4m addresses by 2016.<\/p><p>- UPC has invested over &euro;500m in upgrading its cable network. Over 700,000 homes can already access minimum broadband speeds of 120Mbps and up to 200Mbps. Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps.<\/p><p>- ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure. It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage. The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>- Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction. There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements.<\/p><p>- Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband.<\/p><p>- The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.<\/p><p>My Department does not hold any records of the number of residential premises in Ireland, nor would it hold an accurate number of those that would have broadband in excess of more than 30Mbps now or by end of 2016. I note however that the ComReg quarterly report for the period Q3 2013, found that over 35% of the 1.7m broadband subscribers in Ireland are now subscribing to services over 30Mbps. <\/p><p>Under the national mapping exercise that is being undertaken as part of the National Broadband Plan information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA). Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing. The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines. Of the estimated 2.3m premises in Ireland, approximately 1.4m are expected to be served by these commercial next generation broadband services over the coming years. <\/p><p>This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. The speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. <\/p><p>On 25th April, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as a cornerstone of its investment under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.  Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently underway. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. The list is available on my Department's website . <\/p><p>In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre rollout may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive.  Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention. A full public consultation will take place once the strategy is published and EU State Aids clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised. It is expected that the detailed procurement process will take place in 2015 with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>It is my intention to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to-end market intervention with fibre as a core component. In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21st century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600053#WRA03400","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Resources","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600053#WRA03450"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[19957\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600053#WRA03500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if interdepartmental consultations and collaboration has taken place between his Department and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in encouraging and incentivising small to medium sized businesses to adopt renewable energy sources, including micro-generation options; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In the past decade, the country has recorded remarkable improvements in human development as measured by the UN Human Development Index. This progress is an example of the success of international development assistance when delivered in partnership with a developing country Government.  It is our strong position that positive development results and respect for human rights must go hand in hand, and we are working with the Government to build good governance, and the institutions which can protect the rights of all citizens, including the most vulnerable. <\/p><p>  The Government monitors the human rights situation in Ethiopia through our Embassy in Addis Ababa and in cooperation with our EU partners.

However, since the transfer, the men have apparently been denied access to a hospital. <\/p><p>  Oromia is one of the nine regions in Ethiopia, accounting for approximately 35% of the total population of the country.

The home regulator must then provide the host regulator with a certificate attesting that the insurer covers the EU Solvency Capital Requirement, as well as the nature of the business which the insurer intends to undertake.  The insurer may start to pursue business from the date that the certificate is communicated to the host regulator, in this case the Central Bank of Ireland.<\/p><p>Setanta Insurance Company Limited (&quot;Setanta&quot;) is a Maltese incorporated company which was both authorised and prudentially supervised by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA).  While its financial position is not supervised by the Central Bank of Ireland as\u00a0the Central Bank has no role in that regard,\u00a0the firm is supervised by the Central Bank for conduct of business rules, i.e. consumer protection obligations.

I understand that Setanta met its EU regulatory obligations and under EU\u00a0law is therefore entitled to trade across EU borders.  Following\u00a0negotiations that were completed at European\u00a0level in November, 2013,\u00a0a new regime known as Solvency II will commence on 1 January 2016, which will further strengthen the EU regulatory framework.  The Solvency II EU Directive sets out new, stronger EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers with the key aim of increasing policyholder protection.  The new regime will also ensure greater cooperation between supervisors.<\/p><p>My Department and the Central Bank will\u00a0be reviewing the circumstances relating to Setanta and will be reporting to me on what lessons can be learnt and how the framework can be strengthened.  The European Commission have indicated that it will review whether any issues raised relating to the regulatory framework require action.  On\u00a016 April, 2014, Setanta\u00a0determined that the company was insolvent.  This means that Setanta does not have sufficient funds to be able to honour its full obligations towards claimants, policyholders and other creditors.  Setanta\u00a0was formally placed into liquidation by the MFSA following a meeting of the creditors which took place on 30 April, 2014 where a liquidator, Mr Paul Mercieca, was appointed.  The meeting was attended by a representative from the MFSA, who advised the\u00a0Central Bank of Ireland on developments.<\/p><p>While the position on each policy is for the liquidator to decide in due course,\u00a0policyholders will be given cancellation notification during which period cover will remain in force.  While policies will remain valid until the required notice period has been served,\u00a0it is important to be clear that the amounts due under any claims may not\u00a0be fully recoverable in all circumstances.  The Central Bank has written to over 230 brokers and firms\u00a0who were offering policies from Setanta Insurance to consumers to require them to immediately contact any Setanta policyholder and inform them of the urgency to make alternative motor insurance arrangements.<\/p><p>Claims on personal insurance policies will be payable from the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF).

The principal role of MIBI is to compensate innocent victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles.  If, for legal reasons, MIBI is not in a position to accept a claim, these third party claims will be eligible to proceed for consideration by the High Court for compensation from the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF).  The ICF is subject to the limit of 65% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the less.

I am also advised that since then there has been extensive on-going engagement with the LGMA to ensure all the relevant Household Charge data held by them has been forwarded to the Commissioners. <\/p><p>  A comprehensive data matching exercise was undertaken by Revenue which identified a database of some 400,000 properties for which the Household Charge (HHC) was outstanding. Work on the database is continuing according as property owners contact Revenue.  It is accepted that the database may not be 100% accurate for a number of reasons, including:<\/p><p>  -  The LGMA Register captured the name of the person who paid the HHC rather than the owner of the property, therefore, for example, where a son or daughter paid the HHC on behalf of a parent and particularly where the address of the property was a 'non-unique' rural address, Revenue may not have been able to match the HHC payment to the right property.<\/p><p>  -  The legislative basis for both the HHC and LPT are different. Some properties that are liable for LPT were exempt from the HHC and, unlike LPT, property owners were not actually required to make a claim for exemption from HHC.\u00a0 For that reason, Revenue could not identify every property that was exempt from HHC through the cross-referencing process.<\/p><p>  In all its communications with property owners during the current compliance campaign, the Revenue Commissioners have highlighted that these inconsistencies exist and have outlined the action that owners need to take if the HHC is not due.  The Commissioners have confirmed that as part of their Household Charge compliance campaign they are currently writing to some 227,000 property owners who, according to their records, have not paid the &euro;200 arrears in respect of about 273,800 properties.\u00a0 The letter advises property owners to log in to the LPT\/Household Charge arrears online system on the Revenue website and make arrangements to pay the &euro;200 arrears, or update their Household Charge arrears record to confirm they have paid the charge or are exempt, or entitled to a waiver, from the charge. Owners who require assistance or who are not the liable person for the Household Charge are being advised to contact the LPT helpline on 1890 200 255.<\/p><p>  Where a liable person ignores the letter, payment of the LPT\/Household Charge arrears will be pursued, where necessary, using the range of collection\/enforcement powers at Revenue's disposal which includes mandatory deduction at source from salary, various occupational pensions or from certain Government payments.

The existing provision for 10,575 posts has been increased to 10,965 posts being made available for allocation by the end of 2014.  This will bring to almost 11,000 the number of SNA posts available to work with children who have an assessed care need requiring SNA support in primary, post primary, and special schools.  These extra posts will ensure that the Government's policy of ensuring that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support.<\/p><p>  In June 2011, the Department of Education and Skills published a Value for Money and Policy Review of the SNA scheme. In May 2013, the National Council for Special Education published its Policy Advice on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools.  Both reports concluded that the SNA scheme has been highly successful in supporting the care needs of children with special needs in schools and with assisting to facilitate their integration and inclusion. However, the reports also concluded that the intended purpose of the scheme was not always generally well understood by parents or schools and that the scope and purpose of the scheme should be clarified for schools.<\/p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills accordingly prepared a new Circular for schools, which was designed to clarify the scope and purpose of the SNA scheme, in accordance with the recommendations of the reports and policy advice noted above.  The circular therefore should not be interpreted as a means to reduce the numbers of SNAs in schools.

All ITE Programmes are subject to ongoing review by the Council in accordance with the Criteria. It is the aim of the Council that teachers are competent to teach in the different teaching environments and are prepared to be lifelong learners continually adapting to enable them to support their students in achieving their full potential. Graduates from primary ITE Bachelor of Education courses are recognised to teach in all primary schools.<\/p><p>  Policy on the programmes, interventions and supports for children in education is a matter for my Department. Decisions in this regard are informed by evidence based research and advices received covering a range of matters including pedagogy, school curriculum, special educational needs and child development. The role of the SESS is to attend to the training needs of teachers on foot of these decisions. In selecting and developing suitable programmes, the service is guided by advices from my Department, aegis bodies of the Department where appropriate, relevant research and best practice.<\/p><p>  The SESS has developed the Contemporary Applied Behaviour Analysis (C-ABA) Course under the direction of Dr Patsy Daly. This course provides an introduction to ABA for practising teachers in special education settings in Irish schools. The course trains teachers to 'design, implement and evaluate' interventions to change the behaviour of students in their care.  My Department is satisfied that research does not support the exclusive usage of any one approach as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism. It is for this reason that the preferred policy is for a child centred approach based on the individual child's needs. It is important that children have access to a range of approaches so that their broader needs can be met. While ABA helps to improve behaviour, other approaches, such as Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600059#WRG01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[20282\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600059#WRG01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 247 of 15 April 2014, wherein he noted that the SESS is not involved in the supervision of the implementation of ABA, if there is a person or organisation associated with his Department who has responsibility for the implementation of ABA in the classroom.","asker":"1020","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":237,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[20283\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600059#WRG01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 247 of 15 April 2014, wherein he states that there is no circular on the use of ABA in autism classes, the reason this is the case.","asker":"1020","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":238,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 194 together.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware my Department's position is that as each child with autism is unique, they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs. Applied Behavioural Analysis, or ABA, is one of the approaches used in special classes for children with autism.<\/p><p>  The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues. My Department supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use.  Other approaches, such as Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) are also used in developing children's communication and speech skills. It is important that children have access to a range of approaches so that their broader needs can be met. As children differ significantly from one another and as children's needs vary and change over time, it is not possible to impose a method or approach that will work for all children with autism. It is not the practice to issue a circular on each approach used in the classroom setting.<\/p><p>  As outlined in my previous response, in accordance with the Education Act 1998, the Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school with the responsibility of operating the school efficiently and effectively.

Indeed, open data is core to Ireland's draft OGP Action Plan and to open government objectives in Ireland overall.  I believe that through open data and technology, we can empower citizens, bring them closer and allow them to participate more closely in decision-making.

I am strongly in favour of making information available and easily accessible online with a view to it being used by businesses and citizens alike. <\/p><p>  At the conference, Minister Lebranchu announced that France will sign up to the OGP and I very much welcome this announcement.

Significant changes in pension policy have been introduced in recent years, particularly in relation to increasing State pension age and supporting the sustainability of defined benefit pension provision.    <\/p><p>  It is a priority for the Government to increase supplementary pension coverage and the Programme for Government includes a commitment to reforming the pension system to progressively achieve universal coverage, with particular focus on lower-paid workers.  Recent figures indicate that only half of workers aged between 20 and 69 years have a supplementary pension and this relatively low coverage is of major concern.  The sustainability of the pension system is a particular concern because of the demographic challenges faced by Ireland, the associated increases in pension (and other age related) costs, and the deterioration in the public finances.  This means that the task of financing future increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population as demographic projections indicate the ratio of working age to pensioners will decrease from 5.3:1 at present to 2.1:1 by 2060.<\/p><p>  The OECD Review of the Irish Pension System, which I published last April, provides an international perspective on Ireland&rsquo;s retirement-income provision.  It covers all components of the pension system: State, private personal and occupational plans, and schemes for public-sector employees. Whilst endorsing pension policy reforms undertaken to date, the report also makes a number of recommendations for future reform.  The OECD&rsquo;s key finding was that private pension coverage, both in occupational and personal pensions, is uneven and needs to be increased urgently and the review recommended that this could be done through a universal employment-based pension system.    <\/p><p>  While there are no plans, at present, to establish a commission on pensions, options in this area are actively being considered with a view to developing a road-map for the introduction of a comprehensive occupational pension scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600064#WRM01200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":375,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600064#WRM01250"},{"type":"question","counter":376,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[20182\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600064#WRM01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the progress made to date on an appeal in respect of overpayment of carer's allowance in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":377,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal in respect of overpayment of carer&rsquo;s allowance by the person concerned was received in that office on the 14th April 2014.

For example employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.  Further, unemployed persons not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of up-skilling opportunities, for example through ETB (formerly F&Aacute;S) training for unemployed people, but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  The Work Placement Programme is also open to persons not in receipt of a social welfare payment, although the participant will not receive a payment while on the programme.<\/p><p>  An unemployed person who does not qualify for a social welfare payment due to the assessment of their means may be eligible to sign for social insurance contribution credits.  Persons who sign for credits for three months (78 days) of the last six months are eligible to participate in the JobBridge programme.  There are no plans to make changes to these arrangements at present.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600065#WRN00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":385,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600065#WRN00525"},{"type":"question","counter":386,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[20223\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600065#WRN00550","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive a decision on their invalidity pension appeal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":387,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 1 May 2014.

This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and <\/p><p>- a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, over &euro;2 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. For example:<\/p><p>- Eircom is rolling out a &euro;400m investment in a Next Generation Access Fibre Network that offers speeds of up to 100Mbps. Service is already available to over 800,000 addresses, with planned coverage to reach 1.4m addresses by 2016. <\/p><p>- UPC has invested over &euro;500m in upgrading its cable network. Over 700,000 homes can already access minimum broadband speeds of 120Mbps and up to 200Mbps. Businesses can access speeds of 500Mbps. <\/p><p>- ESB is engaged in a new project allowing a fibre network to be rolled-out on its existing electricity infrastructure. It is understood that discussions between ESB and Vodafone to form a new Joint Venture Company are at an advanced stage. The company has initial plans to construct a fibre network directly to 450,000 premises outside of Dublin and it is expected that details will be announced over the coming weeks. <\/p><p>- Mobile operators have launched 4G high speed mobile broadband services following ComReg&rsquo;s multiband spectrum auction. There has also been continued investment by all operators in enhancing and broadening 3G services and network improvements. <\/p><p>- Fixed wireless operators are continuing to invest in high speed point-to-point wireless broadband. <\/p><p>- The broadcaster Sky has entered the broadband market, increasing choice for consumers.<\/p><p>Of the estimated 2.3m premises in Ireland, approximately 1.4m are expected to be served by these commercial next generation broadband services over the coming years. <\/p><p>This accelerated roll out of high speed services by the commercial sector means that the addressable area required by the State intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. The speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. <\/p><p>On 25 April, I signalled the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment under the National Broadband Plan. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way.  Central to the strategy will be a fibre build-out to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It is intended that the fibre will be delivered directly to access points for homes and businesses, where service providers can utilise the fibre to provide high speed services to end users. The fibre build-out will also ensure that fibre is deployed to strategic locations on each route such as schools, business hubs and health facilities. The fibre build out will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>I have published a county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the comprehensive mapping process currently underway. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. Currently I envisage that a total of 59 areas in County Kerry will be included in the proposed fibre build-out. The list is available on my Departments website .<\/p><p>In tandem with the fibre build-out, the Strategy will include measures to respond to aggregated community demand for services, and the provision of access services in the most remote areas where fibre rollout may be insufficient to stimulate commercial investment or may be cost-prohibitive. <\/p><p>Intensive design work is ongoing in the Department with a view to publishing an end-to-end implementation strategy later this year, together with the outcome of the mapping exercise which will identify the areas that require intervention. A full public consultation will take place once the strategy is published and EU State Aids clearance will be required for the intervention strategy once finalised. It is expected that the detailed procurement process will take place in 2015 with a view to commencing construction of the fibre network and provision of services in the areas that require intervention as quickly as possible. <\/p><p>The EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on state aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude member states from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard it is noted that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out a fibre-based broadband network in County Leitrim, which includes rolling out that service in Carrigallen by July 2016.<\/p><p>I fully share the concerns of local representatives about the quality of broadband in rural areas. I intend to ensure that rural Ireland enjoys similar opportunities to urban areas by ensuring an end-to end market intervention with fibre as a core component. In committing to a fibre build-out at the heart of this strategy, the Government is acknowledging that broadband is the key infrastructure of the 21st century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600066#WRO02200","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Post Office Network","counter":433,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600067#WRP00200"},{"type":"question","counter":434,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[20207\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600067#WRP00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his proposals to introduce post offices in large supermarket chains; if he will consider allowing a local shop to operate a post office in certain cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":435,"content":"<p>Matters relating to the post office network, including the location of post offices, are an operational matter for the Board and management of An Post and one in which I have no statutory function.

Ireland is currently heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels to meet our energy needs. While it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time to come, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our generation portfolio. The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources. Provisional figures for 2013 show that 20.5% of electricity demand was met from renewables.<\/p><p>  To date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. Provisional figures for 2013 indicate that 16.4% of electricity demand was met by wind generation. At the end of 2013, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was 2,300 MW. It is estimated that a total of around 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target. Currently, over 3,000 MW of renewable generation has taken up connection offers under the Gate 3 grid connection programme. <\/p><p>  With regard to other renewable energy technologies, my Department is currently in the process of finalising a national bioenergy strategy, which will be published shortly.

This dependency underlines the immediate and long term imperatives of enhancing energy security, reducing price volatility and ensuring energy sustainability. National energy policy objectives are in line with overall EU policy objectives and are informed by the critical work of the International Energy Agency (IEA) on all aspects of energy security.  Electricity and gas costs in Ireland are influenced by various drivers, including wholesale gas prices, the cost of capital, exchange rate fluctuations, the small size of the Irish market, geographical location and low population density. Wholesale gas prices are by far the most significant factor with prices rising since 2009 driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan and the significant growth in demand from China and India.<\/p><p>  Currently, almost all of Ireland&rsquo;s gas comes from the UK. Figures published by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) in February 2014, show that around 49% of our electricity was generated using gas in 2012. While the UK is not heavily reliant on Russian gas, a shortfall in the supply of Russian gas could potentially result in an increase in the wholesale price of gas on the continent, including in Ireland. However, in Europe generally there are supplies of storage gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) available and there is lower gas demand over the summer period. Gas flows consequential on any such supply disruptions and wholesale price rises are difficult to predict. My Department is continuing to monitor the Ukraine situation in close co-operation with other EU Member States.<\/p><p>  Detailed operational plans are in place to deal with any unexpected short term disruption to gas supplies. In the unlikely event of a major gas disruption, EirGrid and Gaslink would implement their respective emergency plans to deal with the situation. In terms of oil imports from Russia, in 2013 Ireland imported only a very small quantity of gasoil and no other petroleum products or crude oil. As such, the crisis in Ukraine would not have a direct impact on Irish oil supply. There are a number of EU Member States that directly import oil from Russia by pipeline and these Member States would stand to be directly impacted in the event of a reduction in oil supplies. <\/p><p>  Ireland is a founding member of the IEA which was established to improve international oil security. The IEA continues to keep the situation in the Ukraine under review, as does the EU. In terms of prices, Ireland is a price taker in the global fossil fuel market. In the event of reduced international oil supply, it is likely that international oil prices would rise which could ultimately impact on consumer prices.<\/p><p>  In terms of long term plans for energy security, Ireland&rsquo;s approach is to diversify fuels and supply sources. The use of indigenous gas and access to Liquefied Natural Gas storage would enhance diversity. Continuing to develop indigenous renewable electricity is also a key strategy in ensuring supply diversity. Currently over 20% of electricity is generated from renewable sources and supports are in place to ensure we attain our target of increasing this to 40% by 2020. In addition, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, funded and assisted by my Department has, over the past decade, been proactive in maximising energy efficiency. Several successful initiatives have been undertaken while new initiatives are also being considered which will further improve the efficiency of energy consumption, thus reducing our consumption (including consumption of imported energy) and contributing to security of supply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600068#WRQ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":469,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600068#WRQ00700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Development Policy","counter":468,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600068#WRQ00650"},{"type":"question","counter":469,"qnumday":290,"qnumall":"[19311\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600068#WRQ00700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will draft a rural economic development policy statement; the way he will implement the other recommendations set out in the recently published CEDRA report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":470,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach launched the CEDRA report on 14 April 2014.

Following on from this, a number of measures, including restricting the number of posters per candidate and the display of posters in designated areas only, were pilot-tested during the 2009 Local and European Election. Local authorities were canvassed for their views on these measures.Several local authorities indicated that any restriction on the number of posters per candidate would be difficult to police effectively. There were also concerns that restricting the number of posters per candidate would favour larger parties with several candidates running, while restricting the number of posters per party would disadvantage candidates with running mates. Furthermore, there were concerns that any such measures would disadvantage first-time candidates and thus interfere with the democratic process. Other concerns included the diverse geographical nature of constituencies, e.g. small urban versus large rural electoral districts.<\/p><p>  As a result, no measures were introduced to restrict the number of posters at that time. However, section 19(7) of the Litter Pollution Act 1997 was amended by the Electoral (Amendment) (No.2) Act 2009, to introduce a 30-day time limit prior to an election taking place, during which election posters can be displayed. Prior to this amendment, the relevant legislation had required that election posters be taken down within 7 days of an election but provided no time limit for the period prior to an election within which posters could be displayed. While not dealing directly with the number of election posters on display, this legislation ensures that posters are only displayed for a finite and reasonable period.<\/p><p>  For the reasons outlined, I have no plans to restrict the number of election posters permitted at this time.

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the company the necessary powers to allow it to undertake the metering programme. <\/p><p>Most meters for public utilities are located at the point where the connection enters the household. In the case of water services, under the provisions of the Water Services Act 2007, household pipes internal to the boundary of a property are considered the responsibility of the householder, and thus water meters are being fitted at the stopcock at the boundary of the property. As this is located on publicly accessible land, it minimises disruption during the installation programme and in terms of meter reading in due course, as access is not required to people&rsquo;s homes. The meter boxes are not sealed and can be opened to allow the householder to read their meter, if necessary. Meters will be read automatically and the information will be provided directly to customers in their bills.  Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that all of the water metering contracts are fully compliant with the Disability Act 2005 and that the water meters in use by Irish Water comply with the Measuring Instruments Directive.  In all customer communications, Irish Water asks any householders with any disability, mobility or medical concerns to contact its call centre (1890 278 278) in advance of the meter installation so any additional support or advice can be arranged.\u00a0   <\/p><p>Irish Water will not need to reset water meters to zero for October 1st 2014.  The meters used in the domestic water metering programme maintain a record of the reading at midnight on the last day of each month.  This provides Irish Water with an accurate month end\/month start cumulative consumption on an ongoing basis. These month end records will be collected each time the meters are read.   <\/p><p>To assist the homeowner in the identification of any leaks Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that water meters being installed as part of the metering programme have a &ldquo;constant flow&rdquo; alarm which alerts Irish Water who will in turn alert the affected homeowner. Householders with a meter installed will be provided with a reading of their meter as part of their bill and any unusual usage patterns can be discussed with Irish Water if the householder is concerned.  As part of the metering programme, my Department, in conjunction with Irish Water, is currently working on a proposal regarding customer-side leakage.   <\/p><p>In common with meters for other utility services, the meters will be the property of Irish Water which will also be responsible the repair and maintenance of the meter.  Section 74 of the Water Services Act 2007 provides that it is an offence to damage or otherwise impair a water meter.  I would also like to inform the Deputy that Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

This new scheme is being designed so as to bring all of the social housing services provided by the State together under the local authority system, with local authorities being responsible for all households with an established housing need and ensuring significant efficiencies in the provision of rental assistance.  On 30 April 2014, Government approved the publication of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 which will, when enacted, provide the legislative framework for the introduction of HAP.  My Department and the Department of Social Protection continue to work closely on the legal, policy and operational issues involved in developing and introducing HAP.<\/p><p>  HAP will provide a new framework for the provision of rental assistance, and will support the removal of existing barriers to employment by allowing HAP recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. In that context a household which is eligible for HAP will, having sourced appropriate accommodation, pay a rental contribution to the local authority based on the differential rent scheme for the relevant local authority. The local authority differential rent scheme is an income based scheme which relates the amount of rent a household must pay to the household&rsquo;s income and therefore their ability to pay. The planned introduction of a harmonised rents framework coupled with a phased reduction in rental assistance will go some way towards providing additional security to households in the early stages of returning to employment.<\/p><p>  Following an administrative and statutory pilot phase in 2014 which involves 7 local authorities, roll out to the remaining local authorities is scheduled to begin on a phased basis in 2015. It is intended that the pilot and implementation phase will prioritise, as much as is possible, the transfer to HAP of long-term unemployed rent supplement recipients, or those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600070#WRS00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Correspondence","counter":536,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600070#WRS00750"},{"type":"question","counter":537,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[20313\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600070#WRS00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when a reply will issue to correspondence (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":538,"content":"<p>The correspondence in question relates to proposals for enhanced alignment between local government and local development arising from the Local Government Reform Act 2014.

Details in respect of each category are as follows:<\/p><p><b><i>Criminal Legal Aid<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>Total expenditure on Criminal Legal Aid for 2012 came to &euro;50.5 million, a reduction of 10% over 2011 (&euro;56.1million).  This reduction in the annual expenditure is the largest ever recorded and represents a fall of approximately &euro;10 million, or 16%, over the peak recorded in 2009.<\/p><p>Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal aid themselves.  The 1962 Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  Criminal prosecutions originate in the District Court and if so satisfied, the Judge will grant a criminal legal aid certificate.  I can inform the Deputy that the District Courts granted 49,639 certificates in 2012.  However, as more than one certificate may be granted to any one person, it is not possible to provide a figure for the total number of persons provided with criminal legal aid.<\/p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that in relation to the request for the ten largest amounts paid for individual cases, my Department's computer records are not kept in such a manner as to allow for this information to be extracted without requiring a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort.  This could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.  With regard to information sought in relation to the average cost of legal aid, given that expenditure in 2012 was &euro;50.5 million and the number of certificates granted was 49,639, the approximate average cost was &euro;1,017.<\/p><p>An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for the granting of criminal legal aid under the Act and consequently the information sought by the Deputy in respect of the number of persons who received criminal legal aid on more than one occasion is not available.  Records are not kept in a manner which would allow for the extraction of information showing the number of times a person has been granted criminal legal aid.<\/p><p><b><i>Civil Legal Aid<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>In respect of civil legal aid, this is provided by the Legal Aid Board, an independent State agency. Persons availing of civil legal aid pay a contribution towards the service, with some exceptions, so it is not a free service per se. Exchequer funding is provided by way of a grant-in-aid to the Board. In 2012, this grant amounted to &euro;32.922 million and this increased to &euro;33.759 million last year. The service is primarily provided through the Board's law centre network and by its own solicitors, although private practitioners on the Board's panels are engaged to provide a complementary service by the Board, mainly in District Court family law matters.  Overall in 2012, civil legal aid was provided in some 17,652 cases, of which 9,962 involved court representation.  For civil legal aid, information on the most expensive cases is not readily available due to the nature of the Board's operating model.  Whilst it is not unusual for an applicant to access civil legal aid services more than once, particularly in family law matters, applicants do not tend to be in receipt of civil legal aid repeatedly. It should be noted that each and every application for civil legal aid is subject to a means test and a merits test, in line with the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, and the associated Regulations. Figures in respect of persons in receipt of civil legal aid more than once in a year are not available.<\/p><p>Further details can be found in the Board's 2012 Annual Report, available at www.legalaidboard.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600071#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Accidents Data","counter":570,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600071#WRT00750"},{"type":"question","counter":571,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[20271\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600071#WRT00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 509 of 4 February 2014, if the report referred to in the reply is now to hand.","asker":"1020","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":572,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that between 1 January, 2013 and 31 December, 2013, there were 249 drivers recorded as being involved in a fatal collision and 424 in a serious injury collision.

Where the driving licence number is so collected, the driving licence number is sent electronically to the Courts Service with the summons application and the licence number is updated to the Courts Service computer system.

As outlined above, if the licence is produced,  the Court Registrar records the licence number and the number is updated to the Courts Service computer system.

Details of the requests received by Ireland from the United Nations and European Union since 2004 to contribute Defence Forces personnel to missions and the outcome of these requests are contained in the following schedule.<\/p><p><b><i>REQUESTS FOR CONTRIBUTIONS OF DEFENCE FORCES PERSONNEL TO UN\/EU MISSIONS (2004-2013)<\/i><\/b><table><tr><th><div>Mission<\/div><\/th><th>Nature of Request<\/th><th>Outcome<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) (2013)<\/td><td>Contribution of (a) Staff Officers to UNDOF headquarters and (b) Mechanised Infantry Company for the task of Force Mobile Reserve with C-IED capability<\/td><td>Following Government and D&aacute;il approval, as appropriate, HQ Staff and a Force Reserve Company have been deployed to UNDOF since June and September 2013, respectively.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>United Nations Mine Action Service (Sudan)(UNMAS)(2013)<\/td><td>Specialist Training Team on Conventional Munitions Disposal.<\/td><td>Training team deployed to the Mission in August 2010 following Government Approval.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS) (2012)<\/td><td>Military Observers and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Experts.<\/td><td>Deployed in May 2012 and withdrawn in August 2012 when the mission closed.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) (2010)<\/td><td>Mechanised Infantry Battalion<\/td><td>Following D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approval, a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force has been deployed to UNIFIL since June 2011.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>European Training Mission in Somalia (EUTM Somalia) (2010)<\/td><td>Training Team and Mission Staff at mission headquarters.<\/td><td>Following Government approval, Defence Forces personnel were deployed to the mission between April 2010 and April 2014.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>European Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) (2010)<\/td><td>Training Team to train Malian Armed Forces.<\/td><td>A training team was deployed to the Mission following Government approval in April 2010.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT) (2009)<\/td><td>MINURCAT replaced EUFOR Tchad\/RCA in 2009 with which an Irish Battalion and HQ staff had been serving.

Its headline targets were to increase by 2020 the value of: <blockquote>- Primary output in the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sector by 33%;<br \/><br \/>- Value added production by 40%;<br \/><br \/>- Agriculture, food (including seafood) and drink exports by 42%;<\/blockquote>In addition, a 50% increase in milk production and a 78% increase in the volume of aquaculture production was envisaged.<\/p><p>Implementation of this report is driven by the High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC), which I chair and which also involves the chief executives of the main state bodies. In addition, the HLIC engages with the agri-food related commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs to provide cohesive direction and focus for the sector.<\/p><p>Annual progress reports on progress are produced, the 3rd and latest being Milestones for Success 2013.  On its headline targets, the current position is that the sector has achieved growth in value in excess of 33% for primary production (CSO 2013 advance estimate), 20% in gross value-added output (CSO 2011 data ) and a 24% increase in the value of exports (Bord Bia 2013 data) compared to the baseline period. In addition to noting progress on the main sectoral targets, the 215 recommendations in FH2020 and advance benchmarks set in 2010, the Milestones for Success report () also documented progress on achievements under a range of other initiatives for the sustainable development of the agri-food and fisheries sector. These included improved policy environment outcomes, industry investment, SME credit facilities and case studies on improved competitiveness, sustainability, collaborative working, innovation and entrepreneurship.<\/p><p>The result of this sustained focus on the &lsquo;Smart&rsquo;, &lsquo;Green&rsquo; themes in Food Harvest 2020 is that the agri-food and fishing industry has grown in size and importance.  It now plays a very  significant role in national economic development, providing the primary employment for 175,300 people or 9.2% of total employment, 12.3% of all merchandise exports and 23% of all industry turnover.<\/p><p>Further opportunities exist to increase our exports to countries such as China, Africa, South East Asia and the Middle East and there will be opportunities arising for increased market access from the negotiation of Free Trade Agreements.

Felling the infected trees is the appropriate measure with the aim of preventing further spread by limiting spore production.<\/p><p>  In relation to the actual removal of trees, Coillte has advised that 70% of the volume felled in Gougane Barra was Larch and that the remaining 30% was made up of Lodgepole pine (19%) and Sitka spruce (11%). I am advised that these areas were felled along with the larch because they were either in intimate mixtures with the Larch or would have been small blocks of these other species remaining isolated in the forest and would have blown over in the first storm event.  I understand that, subsequently, there was substantial wind-blow in other parts of the Forest Park after Storm Darwin and Coillte advise that removal of these extra species proved to be the prudent option as going back to harvest these isolated blocks would have proven very difficult.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600073#WRV02100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Felling Licence Application Numbers","counter":647,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600073#WRV02150"},{"type":"question","counter":648,"qnumday":352,"qnumall":"[20347\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600073#WRV02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"in relation to the tidy up operations after the recent storms and particularly in regard to trees on roadsides and on private lands which were not commercial plantations, the number of felling licences that were issued for health and safety issues and\/or other reasons connected to the storms; the record of site inspections prior to issue of licences by Forest Service inspectors; the number of consultations that occurred with the National Parks and Wildlife Service officials where trees were in, or bordered on, ecologically sensitive sites; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":649,"content":"<p>Where trees are damaged by storms or wind-blow, there may be health and safety concerns at the location of these trees, be it from trees still standing, blown, partially blown, or completely uprooted or snapped.

Since this date the staff of the former NEWB, including its Educational Welfare Officers, have transferred to the new Agency.  Within the Child and Family Agency, the statutory Education Welfare Service (EWS) has specific authority for the Agency&rsquo;s general functions to monitor school attendance and ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. <\/p><p>  The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, provides the legislative framework for promoting school participation, retention and regular attendance as well as tackling the causes of absenteeism and early school leaving. The legislative provisions include distinct responsibilities for parents, school authorities and the Agency in respect of school attendance.  Every child has a right to an education and it is a parental responsibility to ensure that children of compulsory school age attend school or otherwise receive an education. <\/p><p>  Recognised schools are required to record and monitor daily attendance for all students enrolled in the school, irrespective of the age of the student. Schools must report patterns of non-attendance or concerns about the educational welfare of individual students, including those aged under 6 years, to the designated Educational Welfare Officer (EWO). The EWO will then work with the family, the school and other services where appropriate to improve attendance and participation in school. <\/p><p>  There is no legislative impediment to proactive intervention by schools and the Agency to positively support parents of children under six years of age who may be experiencing difficulties. However, as compulsory school attendance does not extend to children under six years of age, EWOs cannot consider a prosecution against parents of children under six. It is important to understand that the Act requires the Agency to exhaust all welfare interventions to remedy the situation before considering legal action in any case.  The focus of an Educational Welfare Officer&rsquo;s work centres on establishing the barriers preventing a child from attending school regularly and then working with the family to resolve these issues. If appropriate or necessary, the EWO will link in with other agencies and support services. Therefore only a small percentage of the overall casework ends up with parents being prosecuted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600074#WRW00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foster Care Supports","counter":657,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600074#WRW00550"},{"type":"question","counter":658,"qnumday":355,"qnumall":"[20240\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600074#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if financial assistance is available for fostering children (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":659,"content":"<p>Under the Child Care Act, 1991 and the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013, the Child and Family Agency has a statutory duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.

The HSE has apologised that it is not possible to give the costs in this way.  The reasons for this are:<\/p><p>- The referring consultant stipulates the treating consultant and hospital abroad so referrals for the same treatment may be provided by different providers and even in different countries at different costs;<\/p><p>- The actual cost of a treatment is specific to the needs of the individual patient e.g. one patient may have no complications and be discharged early while another may have complications and require a greater input and\/or duration of care.<\/p><p>Therefore to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s query as to the actual cost of each treatment would require the HSE to provide the individual cost of the circa 1,000 episodes of care provided under the TAS in any given year.

Off-label use of a medicine arises where a medicine which is authorised for use for a particular condition is used for the treatment of a different condition.  Medicines shortages have become increasingly prevalent in recent years and off-label use and use of unlicensed medicines are two of a number of strategies used to ensure that the needs of patients are met.

As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees. This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  The Government is providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the cost of this measure which will provide a GP service to approximately 240,000 children that must currently pay to see a GP.<\/p><p>The implementation of this new service requires primary legislation. In that respect, the Health (General Practitioner Service) Bill 2014 was published on 23 April 2014. The key features of this Bill are as follows: <\/p><p>- it provides an entitlement for <i>all<\/i>children aged under 6 to a GP service without fees;<\/p><p>- it removes the need for children aged under 6 to have a GMS medical card or GP visit card in order to qualify for a GP service;<\/p><p>- it provides that the HSE may enter a contract with GPs for the provision of this service to children; and <\/p><p>- it provides that the Minister may set the rates of fees payable to GPs for this service, though requiring that the Minister must follow a set process before doing so.<\/p><p>It is intended to introduce the Bill in the Oireachtas during May, with a view to enactment by July.  Payments can only be made to GP's where the requisite legislation and contractual arrangements are in place. Therefore, payments related to the provision of the GP service without fees for children aged 5 and under cannot be backdated, prior to when the service is available, to the date on which the measure was announced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600082#WREE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":924,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600082#WREE00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects Status","counter":923,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600082#WREE00750"},{"type":"question","counter":924,"qnumday":444,"qnumall":"[20008\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014050600082#WREE00800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"to detail the position regarding the contracts for the development of the N18 Gort-Tuam motorway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1185","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":925,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.\u00a0 The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.<\/p><p>  With\u00a0Minister Howlin, I attended the signing of\u00a0the contract for the N17\/N18 Gort Tuam PPP on Wednesday 30 April 2014.\u00a0 The contracting authority is the National Roads Authority and this scheme is a non-tolled PPP.\u00a0 The contract consortium is Direct Route, whose members include Roadbridge, John Sisk, Lagan, three large Irish civil engineering firms and Strabag of Austria.
