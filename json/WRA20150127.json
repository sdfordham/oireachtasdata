These procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils.  All Boards of Management are required to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of the procedures.  A template anti-bullying policy which must be used by all schools for this purpose is included in the procedures.<br\/><br\/>  The procedures outline key principles of best practice for both preventing and tackling bullying and require all schools to commit to these principles in their anti-bullying policy.  In particular, they emphasise that a cornerstone in the prevention of bullying is a positive school culture.  In that regard, the procedures set out the need for schools to encourage and strengthen open dialogue between all school staff and pupils and to ensure that they provide appropriate opportunities for pupils to raise their concerns in an environment that is comfortable for the pupil.<br\/><br\/>  The procedures also recognise the importance of good supervision and monitoring systems to prevent bullying and facilitate early intervention.  The school's anti-bullying policy must explicitly confirm that appropriate supervision and monitoring policies and practices are in place to both prevent and deal with bullying behaviour.<br\/><br\/>  In relation to reporting bullying behaviour, the procedures make clear that a pupil or parent may bring a bullying concern to any teacher in the school and individual teachers must take appropriate measures regarding reports of bullying behaviour in accordance with the school's anti-bullying policy.  The procedures require that all reports, including anonymous reports of bullying must be investigated and dealt with and that it should be made clear to all pupils that when they report incidents of bullying they are not considered to be telling tales but are behaving responsibly.<br\/><br\/>  The procedures include specific requirements in relation to the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour amongst pupils. There is a requirement in the procedures for the school Principal to report regularly to the Board of Management in relation to the overall number of bullying cases and provide confirmation that they are being dealt with in accordance with the anti-bullying procedures.<br\/><br\/>  The Board is also required, under the procedures, to undertake an annual review of the school's anti-bullying policy and its implementation by the school. Written confirmation that the review has been completed must be made available to the Parents' Association and published on the school website.  There is no requirement for reporting incidents of bullying centrally to my Department.<br\/><br\/>  Arising from commitments made in the Action Plan on Bullying, my Department's Inspectorate is placing a stronger focus on the actions schools take to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying.  For example, parent and student questionnaires issued as part of whole school evaluations, include, since January 2014, additional questions to get a clearer picture of how the school deals with bullying.  Furthermore, the Inspectorate's plan for 2015 provides for collaborative research to be conducted in a sample of primary and post-primary on how schools provide for pupils' well-being.  This will culminate in a research report which will highlight best practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700062#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staffing","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700062#WRB02550"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[3335\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700062#WRB02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to outline her plans to support the valuable contribution played by schools within rural communities; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.

Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.

However, it is important to be clear that it is a parent who decides the religious denomination of their child. It is not a decision of a school.

In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person&rsquo;s income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.  It is recognised that the downturn in the economy had an impact on many self-employed persons with a consequent reduction in their income and activity levels.  This may be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance purposes.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.<\/p>  <p>  Self-employed people in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance have access to the full range of activation measures available through the State.  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.  However, many services are available to the formerly self-employed who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.<\/p>  <p>  Some employment services, such as assistance with job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.

FIS is designed to prevent child and family poverty and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment as compared to social welfare payments.<\/p>  <p>  Expenditure on FIS for 2014 is estimated to be of the order of &euro;281 million and it is currently paid to some 50,306 families in respect of almost 111,583 children. <\/p>  <p>  An integral part of the FIS scheme is that once the level of payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment.  However, in the following two circumstances, the weekly rate of FIS can be revised during the year:<\/p>  <p>  - If a claimant starts to care for an additional child in the course of the 52 weeks;<\/p>  <p>  - If a claimant was getting a one-parent family payment and this payment was stopped because their youngest child reached the relevant age limit, then the FIS rate can be reassessed to take account of the loss of their one-parent family payment.<\/p>  <p>  The rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in the recipient&rsquo;s earnings.  A key advantage of this approach, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is that claimants can be certain that they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.  This certainty is important to the success of the scheme as it provides a real incentive to workers with families to avail of employment opportunities.  For those who experience a reduction in their income over the course of the year, the rate of payment will be reassessed at the end of the 52 weeks upon renewal of a FIS claim.    <\/p>  <p>  This aspect of the FIS scheme is also important in minimising the administrative effort associated with the operation of this scheme and helps to speed up processing times for claims for FIS, which could otherwise be subject to delays due to frequent reviews.<\/p>  <p>  I have no plans to change the existing arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700063#WRC03000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":154,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700064#WRD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":155,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[3477\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700064#WRD00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 201 of 17 September 2014, if the review of personal pension vehicles has taken place; if the issue of extending the approved retirement fund options to holders of buy-out bonds derived from defined benefit schemes has been examined; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1026","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":156,"content":"<p>The current supplementary pension system which comprises a multiple of pension savings vehicles has evolved over time has become extremely complex and difficult to understand without investment of considerable time and effort of the engagement of professional advisors.

The rise in basic deprivation has affected all income groups and reflects the legacy of the economic crisis since 2008 on many low and middle income households. <\/p>  <p>  The key measure of poverty from a policy perspective is consistent poverty, which is the combination of at-risk-of-poverty and basic deprivation. The rate of consistent poverty in 2013 was 8.2 per cent, a slight though not statistically significant increase on 2012. The Government remains committed to meeting the national social target for poverty reduction, which is to reduce consistent poverty to 4 per cent by 2016 and 2 per cent or less by 2020. <\/p>  <p>  A key component of Government policy to tackle poverty is to provide adequate income support through the social protection system. In 2013, welfare payments and other social transfers (including pensions) lifted a third of the population out of the at-risk-of poverty, thereby reducing the rate from 49.8 per cent to 15.2 per cent, which is 1 percentage point lower that the 2012 at-risk-of-poverty rate. <\/p>  <p>  Growing employment and providing the supports needed through activation to get people back to work will have a direct impact on poverty. While Government policies are restoring economic and employment growth, this recovery is not yet reflected in household living standards, as captured in the 2013 statistics. The Government is committed to delivering a new deal on living standards to ensure that the economic recovery is felt by low and middle income working families. Thus, Budget 2015 increases support for families raising children, assists unemployed families with children to return to work and improves the financial position of vulnerable welfare recipients, including those living alone.

The task of introducing this new tax, the largest extension of the self-assessment system in the history of the State, posed major administrative challenges.  The staffing model for its introduction was built on flexible deployment, which included a mix of experienced existing staff, additional staff on a temporary basis, and an external call centre service to provide an information help line. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue has informed me that this flexible mix of resources was considered the most effective model available and was vital to the successful introduction of the tax in a relatively short period of time.  The temporary staff in Ennis were employed on fixed-term contracts which specifically stipulated that their employment would end on a specific date or when the task for which they had been employed was completed.  In accordance with their contracts, employment of these temporary staff will cease on 27 March 2015.  Revenue is not in a position to offer them permanent employment when their fixed-term contracts expire. <\/p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of permanent staff in Revenue is regulated by the Commission for Public Service Appointments.  All recruitment for permanent clerical positions in Revenue must be carried in accordance with the recruitment licence granted by the Commission.

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance. <br\/><br\/>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, for the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold known as the &quot;Group threshold&quot; - \u00a0below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.<br\/><br\/>There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.<br\/><br\/><b>Group A: tax free threshold &euro;225,000 - <\/b>applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.<br\/><br\/><b>Group B: tax free threshold &euro;30,150 - <\/b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.<br\/><br\/><b>Group C: tax free threshold &euro;15,075 - <\/b>applies in all other cases.<br\/><br\/>In the case of the Group A tax-free threshold, each child is separately entitled to receive life-time gifts or inheritances up to the total value of &euro;225,000 from his or her parents before that child would have any liability to CAT. \u00a0Gifts or inheritances received by the child since 5 December 1991 from his or her parents are aggregated for the purposes of determining whether this threshold is exceeded.\u00a0 CAT is charged on the amount of the gift or inheritance that exceeds the child's tax-free threshold of &euro;225,000 at the rate of 33% and on that excess only.<br\/><br\/>Land, either as a site or as a farm, is an asset for both gift and inheritance tax purposes and the transfer of such capital assets by parents to children, either during the lifetime of the parents, or on the death of the parents, is within the scope of CAT. The transfer of such capital assets has always been subject to CAT and the Finance Act 2014 changes in restricting the CAT exemption for normal and reasonable payments made by parents to children for their support, maintenance or education has not changed this position.<br\/><br\/>It should be noted that since the introduction of CAT in 1975 special treatment has been afforded to gifts or inheritances of agricultural propertyhowever, this does not apply to gifts of sites for house building. Agricultural Relief is available provided the conditions applicable to the relief are fulfilled.  The effect of the relief is that market value of agricultural property gifted or inherited is reduced significantly for the purposes of determining the amount of CAT, if any, payable on a gift or inheritance of such property.Currently, the market value of agricultural property is reduced by 90%. \u00a0<br\/><br\/>This means that, where agricultural relief applies, parents can normally transfer agricultural property up to the value of &euro;2,250,000 to each of their children, provided the children satisfy the conditions applicable to the relief, without any liability to CAT arising on the transfer. If the agricultural property is worth &euro;2,250,000 and agricultural relief applies, the taxable value of the agricultural property is reduced by 90% from &euro;2,250,000 to &euro;225,000 for CAT purposes.  Assuming the child has received no previous gifts or inheritances from the parent since 5 December 1991, the reduced value of the gift or inheritance equals the &euro;225,000 tax-free threshold resulting in no CAT liability for the child.<br\/><br\/>This special treatment of agricultural property for CAT purposes ensures that the transfer of most family farms by parents to children, either by way of gift or inheritance, is not subject to CAT.\u00a0<br\/><br\/>1.

PRSAs may be taken out by anyone, regardless of employment status, are transferable from job to job and are available from a variety of authorized providers.  However, they have particular relevance for those who are not members of occupational pension schemes and the self-employed (where they operate as an alternative to retirement annuity contracts).  In essence, a PRSA is a personally held contract-based defined contribution retirement arrangement between an individual and an authorised PRSA provider, such as an insurance company, credit institution or investment firm.  They are maintained in the form of an account that holds units in investment funds managed by the authorized providers.<\/p>  <p>  An individual may make tax-relieved contributions to a PRSA and, where the PRSA is effected by an employer in circumstances where there is no employer-sponsored occupational pension scheme, employers may also contribute but are not obliged to do so.  Pension benefits under a PRSA may, with some exceptions, be taken from age 60 to age 75.  A tax-free retirement lump sum not exceeding 25% of the fund can be taken, subject to a maximum tax-free amount of &euro;200,000 with the remainder of the fund used to purchase an annuity, retained in the PRSA and drawn-down over time or used to avail of the flexible retirement options which include investing in an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF).  All withdrawals are subject to income tax at the individual's marginal income tax rate as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons why, under existing policy, pre-retirement access to pension savings held in the form of pension plans or schemes is not permitted.  The principal reason is that these arrangements (and the associated tax reliefs on contributions and pension fund growth) are designed to be long-term savings vehicles based on the principle that the benefits will be \"locked away\" to help fund an adequate income in retirement.  This is why the Government encourages pension savings through generous tax relief on contributions and pension fund growth.<\/p>  <p>  That said, in Budget and Finance Act 2013, I introduced Section 782A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to provide members of occupational pension schemes with a once-off opportunity to access a part of their Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs), including AVCs made by a scheme member to an AVC-PRSA product, prior to retirement.  The option is available for a three year period from 27 March 2013, the date that the Finance Act 2013 was passed into law.  The take-up of the measure to date has not been particularly significant and most individuals have decided to preserve their AVC pension savings.  I would emphasise, of course, that the pre-retirement access allowed for in this initiative is to additional pension savings over and above an individual's core savings in his or her main employer-sponsored scheme.  Main pension scheme savings are generally not accessible pre-retirement.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that for those in financial difficulties, it is natural to look to their pension savings as a possible means of helping to solve those difficulties.  However, I am strongly of the view that it is preferable not to allow early unplanned withdrawals of core pension savings as an inevitable result is to divert the savings, initially intended to finance retirement, to meet short term financial crises.  Allowing such access would clearly pose retirement income adequacy issues and the impact of the early withdrawal of pension savings on the ultimate value of the pension pot at retirement should not be underestimated.<\/p>  <p>  For these various reasons, I have no plans to extend pre-retirement access to pension savings beyond what is provided for in relation to AVCs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700066#WRF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Charges","counter":253,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700066#WRF01700"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[3558\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700066#WRF01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount collected by each State backed bank in maintenance fees or overdraft facility charges for each of the past five years on bank accounts that have been inactive for at least three years.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":255,"content":"<p>The banks have been unable to provide the information as requested by the Deputy within\u00a0the required timeframe as\u00a0I understand that this data\u00a0is not captured by the banks in the normal course of operations.<\/p>  <p>  However one bank, permanent tsb,\u00a0has provided my Department with an estimate of the information requested which would indicate that the amount over the past five years is not material as only a very small number of their accounts were charged the fees in question and were inactive at any point in time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700066#WRF01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Repossession Rate","counter":256,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700066#WRF02000"},{"type":"question","counter":257,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[3577\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700066#WRF02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has assessed the numbers of home repossessions which are ratified and are occurring; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":258,"content":"<p>The Central Bank's Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossession Statistics for Quarter 3 of 2014 can be accessed at the following link: .<br\/><br\/>I am very\u00a0aware of this issue and a number of initiatives have been put in\u00a0place to address it.\u00a0 While the administration of the Courts is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality,\u00a0 it is important to note that there are important protections available to borrowers under the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA).<br\/><br\/>In accordance with the\u00a0CCMA,\u00a0any lender must have complied with the CCMA before a threat of repossession can be made.

This is known as the Standard Fund Threshold or SFT and was introduced on 7 December 2005 and amended since (most recently in Finance (No 2) Act 2013 which, among other things, reduced the SFT from &euro;2.3 million to &euro;2 million from 1 January 2014).  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A higher limit, known as a Personal Fund Threshold or PFT, may be claimed where the capital value of an individual's pension benefits exceeded the SFT on the date of its introduction or on the dates of its reduction.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The SFT regime was originally introduced mainly to deal with the abuse of the tax-relief arrangements for pensions which resulted in pension overfunding by individuals and was also subsequently amended to place a constraint on the cost to the Exchequer of tax relief for pension saving generally.  The regime deals with these issues at the point of pension draw down in retirement rather than by applying specific restrictions to pension savings or accrual upfront.  There is, therefore, no restriction or limit on the contributions that an individual can make to his or her pension savings on an ongoing basis or on the annual accrual of pension benefits (other than the standard earnings and age-related percentage limits that determine the annual level of tax-relieved contributions that can be made by an individual).  Instead, a significant tax charge is imposed on the value of retirement benefits in excess of the SFT or PFT, as appropriate, when they are drawn down.  In this way, the maximum allowable pension fund for tax purposes acts to discourage the building up of large pension funds in the first place or unwinds the tax advantage of funding for benefits above those limits by clawing back, through the tax charge, the tax relief granted.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Where an individual is a member of a pension scheme or arrangement on or after 7 December 2005 and the scheme or arrangement is or becomes subject to a pension adjustment order (PAO), then in calculating the capital value of any benefit drawn down at retirement from the pension scheme or arrangement (e.g. a pension, annuity, lump sum etc.) in respect of that individual for the purpose of establishing if their SFT or PFT has been exceeded, the benefits designated to a spouse or civil partner under the PAO are to be included in the calculation as if the PAO had not been made.  Also, in calculating whether an entitlement to a PFT arises in the first place, the individual seeking the PFT includes the capital value of his\/her pension benefits as if the PAO had not been made.   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The PAO exclusion provision was introduced as an anti-avoidance  measure, designed to prevent an individual with a PFT, whose pension was subject to a PAO, from taking the view that as part of his or her pension had been assigned to a spouse\/civil partner, he or she was then free to avail of further tax relief in building their part of the pension fund back up to the level of their PFT.  If this had been permitted, it would have allowed a situation to arise whereby the aggregate amount of the pension funds built up originally with tax relief (in respect of which the PFT was granted) and then built back up again (with further tax relief) to the PFT amount, following the PAO, to greatly exceed the original amount of the PFT, at significant additional tax cost to the Exchequer.\u00a0 For these reasons, the legislation requires a PAO to be ignored for the purposes of determining whether an individual's SFT or PFT has been exceeded.  The corollary of this is that the designated benefit going to the non-member spouse or partner is not included in determining the overall capital value of the non-member spouse or partner s supplementary pension benefits, if any, as to do so could result in  double taxation.\u00a0   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Up to recently, the arrangements described above could also result (where a chargeable excess arose and a PAO was involved)\u00a0 in the pension scheme member being liable to the entire tax charge on the excess, notwithstanding that a significant part of his or her pension benefits may have been designated to a former spouse or partner.  In section 19 of Finance Act 2014, on foot of representations made to me in this matter, I made provision so that, in such cases, the tax charge is shared more equitably between the affected individual and his or her former spouse or partner in relation to whom the PAO refers.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It has never been the case that the SFT, or a PFT if applicable, is shared between individuals whether married or divorced.  The SFT has relevance and potential application only to individuals who are funding for or accruing pension benefits in pension saving arrangements approved by the Revenue Commissioners and who have relevant earnings out of which contributions to such arrangements are, or are capable of, being tax-relieved or tax subsidised.  It has no direct application or relevance to individuals or taxpayers who are not in this position, including for example, the former spouses or partners of pension scheme members who are not in pension saving arrangements as described.\u00a0 I have no plans for further change in these arrangements. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700067#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":294,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700067#WRG00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coastal Protection","counter":293,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700067#WRG00750"},{"type":"question","counter":294,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[3750\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700067#WRG00800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the serious damage caused to the costal protection and sea defences of a beach (details supplied) in County Donegal following recent adverse weather conditions; her plans to repair these sea defences and remedy this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":295,"content":"<p>Responsibility for identifying appropriate measures to address damage to coastal defence infrastructure at Maghera Beach, Glenties rests with Donegal County Council in the first instance. <\/p>  <p>  It is open to the Council to utilise its own resources, or to avail of funding that might be available from other sources to deal with the issue.

This landmark reform targets very substantial long-run savings of about one third of pension outgoing, with those savings deriving mainly from career-average (not final-salary) pension accrual, inflation (not pay) linkage of benefits, and higher minimum pension age (effectively 68 years for most new joiners).<\/p>  <p>  Several other measures have also been taken over recent years which help to curb public service pension costs as follows:<\/p>  <p>- In 2004 minimum pension age for new-joiner public service workers was raised from 60 to 65 years.<\/p>  <p>- In 2010 public service pay cuts averaging approximately 7% were applied.  Further pay cuts affecting public servants with annual earnings above &euro;65,000 were applied in July 2013.  In general, these various pay reductions act to reduce individual pension and lump sum awards to persons retiring from the public service.<\/p>  <p>- In January 2011 public service pensions in payment above &euro;12,000 were reduced via a multi-band progressively structured Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR), which had an average impact of 4% on pensions.<\/p>  <p>- In July 2013, further cuts in public service pension payment rates, via adjustments to the rates and scope of the PSPR, and amounting to between 2% and 5%, were imposed on pensions in excess of &euro;32,500.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the great majority of public servants hired since 1995 make an explicit contribution to their pensions, comprised of 3% of pay and an additional 3.5% of net pay, where net pay is defined as salary less twice the rate of Contributory State Pension.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the future of PRD, I have already put on record my view that, subject to a continuation of our fiscal recovery and to the necessary economic conditions being in place, I envisage a future orderly wind-down of the financial emergency measures legislation.

This scheme has a new minimum pension age of 66, raised from 65 as applies to new entrant Public Servants from 2004, and linked to future increases in the age for the Contributory State Pension. Benefits under the new scheme are substantially revised, with pensions for all new entrant Public Servants, including new entrant Oireachtas Members and Officeholders, to be based on career average earnings rather than the current final salary basis.<\/p>  <p>  Successive Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts have impacted on the pay and pensions of politicians.  For example the pay reductions have substantially reduced the salaries on which pensions are calculated.  A progressive Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) was introduced from January 2011 on the pensions of those who retired before March 2012, and\u00a0a new higher PSPR rate of 20% was introduced from January 2012 for pensions over &euro;100,000.  Further PSPR reductions were introduced for pensions of &euro;32,500 and above from July 2013 which impacts on those retiring before the end of the current 'grace period'.\u00a0 This was deemed necessary and appropriate to ensure that higher-paid pensioners, including Oireachtas Members and Officeholders, would make a fair and proportionate additional contribution to the fiscal consolidation measures. <\/p>  <p>  A further effective pension cut applies with effect from 1 September 2013 in the case of persons who receive two or more Public Service pensions which have a combined value in excess of &euro;32,500.  This further pension cut is based on applying the PSPR to the combined value of the multiple Public Service pensions held by such a person, rather than to each pension individually.  This aggregation of pensions for PSPR purposes reduces the overall Public Service pension income of affected pensioners, including significant numbers of pensioners who receive both a TD pension and a Ministerial pension.<\/p>  <p>  Other measures introduced in recent years which have impacted on the pensions of politicians include the exclusion for pension purposes of long service increments and the bar on serving Oireachtas or European Parliament Members from receiving Ministerial pensions.\u00a0 In addition, although not a pension issue, severance payments for Ministers and other Officeholders were abolished under the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act 2014 and no member of the current Government will receive such payments upon leaving Office.<\/p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to further reduce Public Service pensions.\u00a0 However, I would like to assure the Deputy that pay and pension costs will be kept under review as part of the Government's ongoing strategy to bring the public finances to a sustainable level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700067#WRG01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works Projects","counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700067#WRG01850"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[3525\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700067#WRG01900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the expected eventual cost of the fence which is to be erected by the Office of Public Works around the Castletown Demesne, Celbridge, County Kildare.","asker":"1008","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>At present there are no plans to erect a fence around the Castletown Demesne, Celbridge, Co Kildare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700067#WRG02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1106"},{"type":"question","counter":313,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[3526\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700067#WRG02100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the amount of funding his Department and or the Office of Public Works has allocated for a court case regarding the right of way at Castletown Demesne, Celbridge, County Kildare to be taken by an organisation (details supplied); and the specific purposes or beneficiaries of such funds.","asker":"1008","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":314,"content":"<p>I am advised that the Commissioners of Public Works are not aware of any court case regarding a right of way at Castletown Demesne, Celbridge, County Kildare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700067#WRG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1106"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":315,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700067#WRG02250"},{"type":"question","counter":316,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[3621\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700067#WRG02300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the current position regarding FEMPI (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":317,"content":"<p>I refer to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 44305 of 18 November 2014.

In framing policy regarding employment permits, thought is given to wider policy instruments that are also available in meeting the challenges presented by skills shortages.  Migration in itself is not a sustainable long-term overall solution to skills shortages.  It is intended to complement the primary policy objective of Government, the up-skilling of the resident population at all levels.  We are cognisant that migration can, in some circumstances, help to perpetuate skills shortages in the economy, by reducing latent demand for such skills.  Ensuring an uninterrupted flow from the domestic and EEA economies of high quality specialist skills in de-boning is critical.  The Department of Education and Skills will comment on opportunities for training operatives in the meat industry including butchers\/boners.<br\/><br\/>My Department reviews and updates the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List (HSEOL) and Ineligible Categories of Employment List for employment permits bi-annually.  This review is predicated on a formalised and evidence based process.  Such a process involves obtaining and considering advice from the Expert Group on Future skills Needs (EGFSN) and the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU-SOLAS) with the EGFSN&rsquo;s National Skills Bulletin contributing principally to the Department&rsquo;s ongoing monitoring of the labour market.  The 2014 National Skills Bulletin had just over 8,000 butchers and fishmongers of which almost 40% are non-EEA nationals.  Few occupations have a share of non-EEA nationals higher than butchers.  The number of non-EU national visas that have been issued to the meat industry for each of the past ten years are listed in the following table.  The SLMRU&rsquo;s analysis of labour market transitions in 2013 indicated a high turnover for food operatives and suggests an issue regarding retention of staff.  The National Skills Bulletin concluded that while no shortages of meat processing skills had been identified, it recognised that many food processing companies are experiencing difficulty in attracting and retaining skilled butchers\/de-boners. <br\/><br\/>My Department has had ongoing engagement with the meat industry since 2013 to resolve the issue of a sufficient supply of de-boners.  In May 2013 my Department convened an inter-Departmental group Chaired by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) and comprising, Department of Social Protection (DSP) and Department of Education and Skills (DES) and Enterprise&ndash;Ireland, to see how the issue might be addressed.

The Action Plan for Jobs is an annual plan designed to drive action across all Government Departments and Agencies in a collective effort to put in place the conditions needed to support and grow enterprise in the State.<br\/><br\/>As I have said on more than one occasion, I have been working with my Department on the development of a framework for the formulation of Regional Enterprise Strategies that will enable us to identify the sustainable competitive strengths of each region and to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprise growth and jobs in areas of potential, which I hope to publish shortly.<br\/><br\/>It is my intention that the Regional strategy will be rolled out firstly in the Midlands before being rolled out in other regions and will include specific actions and targets on the part of my Department, the enterprise development agencies and other public bodies to promote enterprise growth and job creation in the region.<div><b>Number of IDA Ireland sponsored Site Visits by potential investors on a county by county basis in 2014<\/b><\/div><table><tr><th><div>County<\/div><\/th><th><div>Site Visits<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td><div>9<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td><div>30<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td><div>205<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td><div>19<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td><div>22<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td><div>10<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon<\/td><td><div>0<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td><div>11<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700068#WRH02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":368,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700068#WRH02800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Development Plan","counter":367,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700068#WRH02750"},{"type":"question","counter":368,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[3587\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700068#WRH02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the proposed timetable for the implementation of the new national rural development plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":369,"content":"<p>The draft Rural Development Plan (RDP) 2014-2020 was formally submitted to the European Commission on 3 July 2014, a number of weeks in advance of the regulatory deadline.

The Board and the Executive of Bord na gCon have assured me that they share my view and are doing their utmost to enhance the regulatory systems underpinning the industry to ensure that they are effective and fit-for-purpose.<br\/><br\/>I expect that Bord na gCon, who as I outlined at the outset is the state body responsible for the regulation of greyhound racing, will be happy to provide additional detail sought by the Deputy on this topic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700069#WRJ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bord na gCon","counter":404,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700069#WRJ02150"},{"type":"question","counter":405,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[3543\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700069#WRJ02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his view on the move to replace five of the seven board members of the Irish Greyhound Board; if he will provide details of the five outgoing members of the IGB board; when they will be replaced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":406,"content":"<p>The legislative provisions governing the appointment of members to the Board of Bord na gCon are contained in the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 , as amended by the Greyhound Industry (Amendment) Act 1993.<br\/><br\/>In summary Board Members are appointed by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine after consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.

No. 207 of 2014 - European Union (Identification of Equidae) Regulations 2014.<br\/><br\/>Regulation 504\/2008, which came into effect on 1 July 2009, requires three elements of identification to be fulfilled in respect of each equine &ndash; i.e. a single lifetime passport, a method to ensure the unequivocal link between the animal and the passport (transponder) and a database which records the identification details of the animal under a unique identification number which relates to the animal for which the passport was issued and the person responsible for identifying the animal. However, Regulation 504\/2008 does not require horses which were identified in accordance with the legislation which preceded it to be micro-chipped. <br\/><br\/>In view of the foregoing, it would not be legally possible for my Department to impound all horses which are not micro-chipped. However, I strengthened equine identification legislation last year with the signing of S.I. 207 of 2014 European Union (Identification of Equidae) Regulations 2014, which consolidated previous secondary legislation in this area and further reinforced my powers in relation to the seizure and detention of documents and equine animals. <br\/><br\/>In addition, equine identification legislation has been complemented by mandatory requirements which I introduced in recent years requiring the registration of equine premises and notification of change of ownership. <i><\/i>In this regard, persons acquiring ownership of equines after 1 July 2014 are required to notify the \u00a0Passport Issuing Organisation which issued the horse passport of the transfer of ownership.

However the vessel in question was precluded from fishing for herring and mackerel as it does not have the required track record in these fisheries. <br\/><br\/>The sea-fishing boat licences issued to the named individual did not carry a restriction on fishing methods. <br\/><br\/>The named individual transferred ownership of the vessel, inclusive of its fishing capacity in 2006, and the vessel was registered and licensed to its new and current owner on 3 October 2006. <br\/><br\/>In relation to fishing effort restrictions in certain areas, EU Regulation 1342\/2008 introduced a management system for fishing effort to rebuild over exploited cod stocks. The Minister established a Steering Group in February 2009 consisting of representatives of the Irish Fishing Industry, the Marine Institute, the Sea Fishing Protection Authority, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Department to advise on the management arrangements for both the Irish Sea and the North West of Donegal. The full details of the scheme introduced to meet the requirements of the EU Regulation are set out in the Information note on the Department&rsquo;s website. In order to qualify for an effort allocation, all vessels registered and licensed must have a track record in a gear type and will receive fishing effort for that gear type. The qualification threshold in Area VIIa is one or more days in area VIIa in the period 2005 &ndash; 2008 using a regulated gear in Annex 1 to Council Regulation 1342\/2008. The qualification threshold in Area VIa is one or more days in area VIa in the period 2006 or 2007 using a regulated gear in Annex 1 to Council Regulation 1342\/2008. <br\/><br\/>In implementing the track record requirement, the Department is advised by the SFPA of the vessels which met the criteria for an allocation of effort. This is based on an analysis of logbook records during the relevant years. In order to qualify for an allocation of fishing effort for a particular gear type, vessels must have a record of fishing with that gear type in the area. As recommended by the Steering Group, the Minister has introduced restricted entry for certain gear types and details are available on the Department&rsquo;s website. <br\/><br\/>If a vessel owner considers that its vessel qualifies as having used a regulated gear in the relevant year(s), but has not been granted effort, the owner should contact the SFPA to have its logbook records reviewed for the period to see if activity with the specific gear type was missed.

Occupational medicine focuses on a combination of preventative medicine, health promotion, medical supervision and medical assessment. Such medical oversight is necessary in order to maintain a Force that is operationally ready for the tasks assigned by Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces Medical Corps is responsible for the delivery of medical services to Defence Forces personnel. The Medical Corps, in addition to the administrative staff of the Central Medical Unit, comprises Medical Officers ( i.e. qualified medical doctors , dentists and pharmacists ) and other medical professionals who provide the services, augmented by contracted doctors, dentists, and other specialised medical professionals engaged to provid e   medical services to the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to primary care, a key element of the medical services provided to the Defence Forces is the daily surgery, referred to as &ldquo;sick parade&rdquo;. In an ideal world sick parades would be delivered by Defence Forces Medical Officers only. However, due to a shortage of Medical Officers within the Defence Forces in recent years sick parades are delivered by a mix of Defence Forces Medical Officers and civilian doctors engaged on a contract for services basis. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, in circumstances where a member of the Defence Forces requires the services of a GP after hours and he or she does not live in the vicinity of a Military Medical Facility, they may attend a local GP. Similarly, if a soldier is injured on a training exercise and requires immediate medical assistance, they can be sent to a local GP or hospital if necessary. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the occupational medical service, all members of the Permanent Defence Force are required to undergo a mandatory medical examination at least once in every twelve month period. Currently all annual medical assessments are carried out by Defence Forces Medical Officers . However again due to the difficulty experienced in recruiting doctors to the Defence Forces there was a need to identify alternative options for the provision of this medical service. In this context, a Request for Tender for the provision of Occupational Medical Examinations for military personnel issued in late 2014. It is anticipated that a contract to conduct these examinations will be awarded shortly. This contract is for the provision of 1,200 occupational medical examinations. This contract is not to replace the work of the Defence Forces Medical Corps, rather it is intended that it will supplement its work in this area. <\/p>  <p>  It can be seen from the above that there are a number of different scenarios where a member of the Defence Forces may need to attend a general medical practitioner (be it a Defence Forces Medical Officer or a civilian doctor). <\/p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Military Authorities that it is not possible to extract from the Medical Module of the Personnel Management System (PMS) the number of times per annum that a member of the Defence Forces is referred to a general medical practitioner. Therefore, there is no way of providing this information without examining every medical record of every member. <\/p>  <p>  I am also advised that further development of the PMS or implementation of a new IT system is required to enable this level of data to be recorded.

The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted in certain circumstances for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation themselves.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.<br\/><br\/>These provisions must have regard to the right to a fair trial, including the provision of legal aid where appropriate, which is a Constitutional right upheld by the courts in a number of judgments.  The Supreme Court ruling in the case of <i>State (Healy) v Donoghue [1976]I.R. 325<\/i>effectively determined that the right to criminal legal aid is, in circumstances which are quite wide in practice, a Constitutional right.  Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights states that &quot;<i>Everyone charged with a criminal offence has [the right] to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require&quot;. <\/i>As the Deputy will be aware, an accused person is entitled to a presumption of innocence and legal representation and any obstacles to obtaining necessary legal aid which were found to be unreasonable could give a defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.<br\/><br\/>I can inform the Deputy that a  new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is currently being drafted to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Legislative provisions under consideration include provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, enable the Board to verify the means of applicants and to provide for prosecution of cases of abuse. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700072#WRM03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Haddington Road Agreement Implementation","counter":546,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700072#WRM03800"},{"type":"question","counter":547,"qnumday":304,"qnumall":"[3619\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700072#WRM03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 187 of 14 January 2015, the reasons specific to her Department the workforce de-layering has not yet been achieved within her Department, as it has in the Health Service Executive in line with section 3.11, workforce restructuring, of the Haddington Road agreement and section 4.2.1 - iii, develop options for workforce de-layering, start Q1 2014, end Q4 2014, of the action plan, appendix 1 of the Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016; if she will initiate workforce de-layering with immediate effect; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1198","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":548,"content":"<p>The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has overarching responsibility for human resource management policy in the Civil Service and his Department is currently considering options for advancing the objective of grade restructuring as one of a number of actions to strengthen Human Resource Strategy and resourcing policies.

The strategy reflects on current international research and practice which indicate that better outcomes can be achieved through utilising gender informed approaches in dealing with women.  The support of the community and voluntary sector will be crucial to implementing the new interagency women&rsquo;s strategy.  T&uacute;s Nua is a residential project for women offenders funded by my Department through the Probation Service.  T&uacute;s Nua works closely with the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service to support women offenders to reintegrate into the community on their release from custody.  <br\/><br\/>To date the Probation Service has continued to work in partnership with the IPS to put in place targeted responses in relation to women offenders.  This is undertaken under the auspices of the sentence management process.  The Probation Service has provided an in reach service to work with women in Limerick prison.  Dedicated Probation Officers in the community have been identified and introduced on a phased basis where there are significant numbers of women offenders.  Gender informed guidelines for assessment have been drafted and training is due to commence.  Women specific Community Service and Community Return options are being identified on an ongoing basis.  Links have been established with the Probation Board for Northern Ireland and a joint PS\/IPS visit has been undertaken to the INSPIRE project in Belfast.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, the Strategic Review of Penal Policy Report which I launched in September 2014 recommends a greater focus on step-down facilities, supported accommodation and the use of more community based open conditions for female offenders.  In November 2014, the Government gave its approval, in principle, to proceed immediately with the implementation of a number of key recommendations including pursuing options for an open prison for female offenders.<br\/><br\/>Finally, the Abigail Centre in Finglas, Dublin opened in December 2014 which is a new service to meet the needs of vulnerable women that require supported accommodation for a temporary period, some of whom will have moved there directly on release from prison.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700073#WRN01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Releases","counter":569,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700073#WRN01400"},{"type":"question","counter":570,"qnumday":311,"qnumall":"[3734\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700073#WRN01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if her Department is collaborating with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to ensure that there is appropriate accommodation available to persons leaving prison; and the measures that are being put in place to ensure that persons are not being released into homelessness or into emergency accommodation where there is active drug use if this person has undergone detox while in custody.","asker":"1190","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":571,"content":"<p>The Irish Prison Service is represented on seven of the Regional Homeless Consultative Fora established under the provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act, 2009.

Referrals to the Department of Social Protection service generally occur at the pre-release stage where emergency and other accommodation options, and income maintenance can be arranged by the Community Welfare Officers (CWOs).  The Department of Social Protection in-reach service is invaluable for the successful resettlement of offenders and a vital component of pre-release planning.  It is widely recognised across the prison estate that in order to provide this service to all inmates, an increase in service provision is required. <br\/><br\/>In the Homeless Strategy National Implementation Plan the Irish Prison Service was assigned a priority action 'to improve discharge planning for all individuals leaving prisons to include identification of housing needs and follow up supports, through close links between those discharging institutions, housing providers and community based services'.  I am happy to report to the Deputy that a new pre-release planning policy for the Irish Prison Service is at an advanced stage and will represent considerable improvements to current pre-release planning and practices in Irish prisons.  It is envisaged that a new central information window on the Prisoner Information Management System (PIMS) will record a range of information with regard to post release concerns and plans for individual prisoners which will improve transition to the community and reduce occurrences of ex-offenders becoming homeless post release. <br\/><br\/>  With regard to women prisoners specifically, a joint Women's Strategy document for the IPS and the Probation Service was published in April 2014.  The issues being addressed include rehabilitation, housing and reintegration to the broader community, and apart from the IPS include engagement with the HSE, the Department of Education (VEC), NGOs, the National Council for Women, and areas within the Justice family.

The intention is to ensure that lending institutions do not resort to repossession proceedings without considering the PIA option under the 2012 Act. The section will not apply to investment or commercial properties.  In effect, section 2 provides a new, final, time-limited opportunity for court adjournment of repossession proceedings for the possibility of a Personal Insolvency Arrangement to be examined as an alternative to repossession.  <br\/><br\/>A PIA may be entered into following a court adjournment as indicated above or through the main route set out in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 via engagement with a Personal Insolvency Practitioner and the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  In addition, I should point out that a PIA provides statutory protection to the borrower and may enable them to remain in their home while resolving the debt in a sustainable manner. <br\/><br\/>This Government has provided an enhanced range of information and guidance services for\u00a0mortgage\u00a0holders, including a dedicated information website, a\u00a0mortgage\u00a0arrears\u00a0information and advice helpline and the provision of independent financial advice for\u00a0mortgage\u00a0holders who are being presented with long-term\u00a0mortgage\u00a0resolution proposals by their lenders.

The applications referred to, totalling 1,363 applications, were refused by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and not by the Courts.  I have arranged to have the D&aacute;il record corrected to reflect that fact. <\/p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Working Group Report on the review of firearms licensing, published for consultation in November 2013, sets out views expressed by members of the judiciary in relation to legislative provisions governing firearms.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on individual cases before the Courts.  However, I am advised that over the past four years, Judges in District Courts have commented that it is a matter for the legislature and not the judiciary to address the concerns of senior Garda Officers tasked with considering applications to licence, in particular, large calibre handguns and semi automatic centre fire rifles.  For example, I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that Judge Lucey, in various District Courts throughout the country, Judge O&lsquo;Kelly in Limerick District Court and Judge Kennedy in Bray District Court have dealt with the issue that as the legislation currently allows for the licensing of such firearms, the law must be applied as it currently exists.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have advised that judges have raised issues in relation to interpreting Section 33 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which prohibits 'practical or dynamic shooting'.  I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that Judge Riordan in Cork District Court, Judge McNulty in Bandon District Court, Judge Larkin in Kilmallock District Court, Judge Neylon in Mullingar District Court and Judge Kelleher in Cork District Court have commented on the difficulties in interpreting what exactly constitutes 'a form of activity in which firearms are used to simulate combat or combat training', which was a central issue in appeal cases before these courts. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, Judge Durcan, in a written judgment in Ennis District Court on 5 November, 2014, addressed an issue relating to the interpretation of the legislation when he stated: &ldquo;By way of casual initial observation, it must be said that the manner of amendment adopted by the legislature with respect to the Firearms Code is to be regretted.  The 2006 Act amends substantially fourteen of the thirty sections of the Principal Act, six important sections of the Principal Act being completely amended by substitution.  The 2009 Act contains an additional 20 sections which effect considerable amendments to the code.  It is highly unsatisfactory that the code must now be read by reference to a number of different statutes, when the opportunity could have been taken to provide a consolidating statute.  Despite developments in information technology and the empowerment of computer consolidation, Statue Law should be easily accessible not merely to Lawyers and Legislators, but also to ordinary citizens in a comprehensible manner&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has also raised the question of the ability of the Garda PULSE system to produce figures on the number of cases which were appealed to the District Court and how many were granted.  The Deputy will appreciate that firearms legislation provides for an appeal to the District Court where a firearms licence has been refused by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am informed that the information sought regarding such cases is not readily available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Courts Service.  The work required to collate this information could only be retrieved by way of a manual examination of each individual court record.  This would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.  Furthermore, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have advised that refused renewal applications for restricted firearms that were subsequently granted on appeal are no longer recorded on PULSE as refused or appealed.  These applications are updated on the system to show the application as granted.  I understand this new method of updating the licensing system on PULSE was introduced to address concerns of interest groups, so that licence holders granted a licence after an appeal do not have an initial refusal recorded on their licence record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700073#WRN04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting of Personnel","counter":597,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700073#WRN04200"},{"type":"question","counter":598,"qnumday":321,"qnumall":"[3943\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700073#WRN04300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on a matter (details supplied) regarding Garda vetting; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":599,"content":"<p>Ensuring the safety of children and vulnerable adults is the primary consideration in any vetting process and accordingly such vetting processes demand rigorous procedures to ensure their integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service.  To that end full vetting checks are conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.  <\/p>  <p>  The current procedures for Garda vetting ensure the integrity of the system.  This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Garda Vetting Disclosure would not include information regarding any recent criminal convictions, and the second employer could not safely rely on it.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date and employers would be exposed to civil liability if they knowingly recruited staff based on out-of-date criminal records information where the person in fact had a more recent criminal conviction.  Effectively, the non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service and such procedures are in line with best practice internationally.<\/p>  <p>  There are, however, certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  For example, persons involved in voluntary work may be doing work with more than one voluntary organisation at the same time, and may agree with the vetting applicant to share a single vetting disclosure.  Similar arrangements arise in the health sector in regard to persons working as locums, agency nurses or other temporary employees in a number of different organisations, or in the education sector where substitute teachers are on panels for substitute teaching in more than one school.   <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the current average processing time for vetting applications is four weeks.

Ensuring the best possible outcomes for children in their early years is therefore an important element in future economic planning. <\/p>  <p>  The case for investing in children and young people on both social and economic grounds is supported by a body of international evidence.  As the Minister with responsibility for this key area, I have established a cross-Departmental group at senior level to develop a whole-of-Government approach to future investment in early childhood care and education and after-school care.  The group will undertake an economic and cost benefit analysis of policies and future options for increasing the supply, accessibility and affordability of quality childhood care and education services. <\/p>  <p>  It is clear that accessibility, affordability and high quality childcare can play a critical role in achieving a number of Government priorities, including improving educational outcome for children, reducing poverty and increasing parents' participation in the labour market.  The importance of this area is reinforced by continuing economic improvement and job growth and an increased focus on activation for those currently outside the labour market.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure that all the potential benefits can be realised, future public investment in childcare must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated.

Children under 16 who present as being homeless to emergency services are taken into care.  Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care, or provided a service under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991.  Young people who are homeless, either singly or as part of a family unit and not falling within this category are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities.  Young people who were formerly in the care of the State and presently in receipt of aftercare services have their accommodation needs identified as part of this support.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, a protocol was established between the County and City Management Association and the Child and Family Agency in relation to the assessment of housing needs for young people leaving care, the interaction between interagency aftercare committees and local authority housing representatives and how to progress such accommodation related matters.  The aim of the protocol is to make the assessment and allocation of social housing, where deemed to be the most appropriate response to the young person&rsquo;s need, more efficient and seamless.  This protocol came about through the collaboration of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Child and Family Agency. <\/p>  <p>  The protocol will see the relevant local authority housing representative attend aftercare planning meetings with social workers of the Agency in relation to those young people for whom social housing has been identified as the most appropriate form of accommodation support.  This, it is hoped, will facilitate a more efficient service for those leaving care in obtaining social housing suitable to their needs.<\/p>  <p>  During the course of discussions with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the issue of the particular vulnerability of young people leaving State care, as highlighted in the first report to Government of the Homelessness Oversight Group, was considered.  Discussions between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government have been ongoing in relation to matters of accommodation for those leaving the care of the State and how they might be best supported.<\/p>  <p>  Aftercare is the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him\/her in making the transition to independent living.  The children most vulnerable to homelessness as care leavers are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements.  Children who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that can be so important in realising positive outcomes.  It is essential that these young people have an opportunity to develop a relationship with a dedicated aftercare worker who will work with them to identify their needs and ensure that services are in place to help provide them with the stability and support they need.<\/p>  <p>  It has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.

My Department, in the normal course of its work, has ongoing contact with Departments and Agencies on a range of issues relating to children.  During the coming year such contacts will comprehend preparations for engagement with the UN Committee.<\/p>  <p>  Aftercare is a term used to describe the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him\/her in making the transition to independent living.  It is essential that all young people leaving care are provided with the type of transitional support that their individual situation requires.<\/p>  <p>  The Child Care Act 1991 provides that the core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years up to 21 years.  This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged, up to the age of 23 years.<\/p>  <p>  Current aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical (including accommodation and financial) support.  Advocating on behalf of young people to support their development as fulfilled adults in their community and, when necessary, to link them to targeted adult services, are also crucial elements of an aftercare service.<\/p>  <p>  Between 450 and 500 young people leave care annually upon turning 18.  The Child and Family Agency advised that at the end of June 2014, 1,614 young people aged 18-23 years (inclusive) were in receipt of an aftercare service.  Of those, 884 (55%) were in full-time education.<\/p>  <p>  The Child and Family Agency has advised that they are in the process of establishing interagency aftercare committees at local level bringing together Local Authorities, HSE and other statutory and voluntary agencies.  These committees will develop interagency wrap around aftercare plans for young people, particularly for those with complex needs, including housing requirements.  The situation regarding the establishment of these committees varies nationally but it is expected that all committees will be operational by mid-2015. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the legislative provisions regarding aftercare are being strengthened to respond to past concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.  The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person.  The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports. <\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Aftercare Bill will be published in the early part of this year.<\/p>  <p>  Other matters raised by the Deputy in this instance come within the area of responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Health, respectively.

Notwithstanding the problems that some facilities face with structures and facilities, the vast majority of their residents receive excellent levels of care. Without these public facilities many older people would simply have nowhere to go, other than our acute hospitals which are already under pressure.  It is therefore very important that the services provided by public facilities be maintained.<\/p>  <p>  Demand for capital investment for the Community Nursing Unit programme far exceeds the funding available, and investment must therefore be allocated as effectively as possible based on the HSE's assessment of priorities.<\/p>  <p>  HIQA has indicated that a number of units do not fully meet the standards one would expect to find in a modern nursing home.  This is not surprising given the age and structure of many of our public nursing homes.  However, there is adequate flexibility available within the terms of existing legislative provisions, and through ongoing discussions between the HSE and HIQA, for solutions to be found.

It is marketed in tablets containing 25, 50 and 100 micrograms and is the subject of a marketing authorisation in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) became aware of shortages of Eltroxin tablets during the week of 1 December 2014. On becoming aware of the shortage the HPRA contacted the manufacturer. This was not however a formal investigation but part of the HPRA's activities in managing disruption in supply of a medicine. It is understood that this shortage was  due to a regulatory non-compliance by the manufacturer. The non-compliance was that a registered in-process test was not being applied during manufacture of current batches of Eltroxin. Over the following days, a number of &lsquo;fast track&rsquo; regulatory requests (variations), submitted by the manufacturer, were approved by the HPRA in order to allow for the release of batches of tablets onto the Irish Market.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its routine post marketing activities, the HPRA continues to monitor and investigate issues relating to disruption in supply. In the event of a shortage of a medicine to patients, HPRA will attempt to minimise the impact on patients by:<\/p>  <p>  - working with pharmaceutical companies to resolve manufacturing and distribution issues;<\/p>  <p>  - sharing information with the HSE and international partners about alternative sources of supply;<\/p>  <p>  - seeking input from the HSE, patient groups and healthcare professionals on the impact of medicine shortages, to support decision-making;<\/p>  <p>  - taking measures to allow alternative medicines or suppliers to be used;<\/p>  <p>  - having in place a fast track regulatory mechanism (known as &lsquo;batch specific request&rsquo;) to permit packs of a medicine intended for another market to be modified to meet the requirements of the authorisation to market the product in Ireland;<\/p>  <p>  - operating a notification system relating to the sourcing by distributors of exempt (unauthorised) medicines to meet the special needs of patients. This can include the sourcing of an exempt alternative where there is a shortage of the authorised product.<\/p>  <p>  Parallel exporting is the exporting of medicines intended for use in one market to other countries in the European Economic Area (EEA).  EU law provides for the free movement of goods across borders within the EU so the practice of parallel import and parallel export of medicines is legal.  Member States may restrict the free movement of goods only in exceptional cases, for example when there is a risk resulting from issues such as public health, environment, or consumer protection. In September 2011, the HPRA wrote to the majority of wholesalers regarding the public service obligations contained in the Irish Medicines Regulations. The HPRA closely monitors the situation and if it is found that a product shortage may have been due to parallel trading, the HPRA will investigate.<\/p>  <p>  At present, the HPRA is not aware of any shortage in supply of Eltroxin in Ireland. It continues to work with the manufacturer concerned to ensure that sufficient stocks of this, and other of its products, are available for patients in Ireland. Based on the information available to the HPRA the shortage of Eltroxin tablets in December 2014 was not caused by parallel trade of the product.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700076#WRQ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Provision","counter":734,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700077#WRR00150"},{"type":"question","counter":735,"qnumday":367,"qnumall":"[3556\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700077#WRR00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding home help service in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 13; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":736,"content":"<p>I would like to extend my sincerest condolences to the family of Mr. Paige.

Each year approximately 1,500 nurses complete the nursing degree programme. This is the number seen as necessary to maintain nursing numbers at the level required to support service delivery.<\/p>  <p>  There was a requirement to reduce public service numbers and maximise savings in the public service from the time of the downturn in the economy. The embargo on recruitment introduced by the HSE in 2007, followed by the moratorium on recruitment resulted in a fall of about 4,500 in nursing numbers between 2007 and the middle of 2013. Nursing numbers have increased by nearly 500 in the past 12 months. This increase can be attributed to the very positive initiatives undertaken by the HSE to reduce reliance on agency and to offer contracts of employment where agency can be replaced by full time posts. It is noteworthy that the number of nurses who have made requests for verification to the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland &ndash; a requirement if they intend leaving the country - fell by 400 in 2014, meaning that this additional number wish to remain in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has the capacity to recruit where it is necessary to deliver front-line services. This is reflected in the current recruitment campaign where the HSE is actively recruiting to fill 1,600 approved nursing posts. These are across all grades and all divisions of the register spanning acute hospitals, community, ID and mental health.<\/p>  <p>  Many of these posts are currently being filled on a temporary or an acting basis. Following a high profile online campaign at the end of 2014 the HSE is currently processing 3,700 applications for nurses (all divisions of the register across all areas) to meet current needs. These applicants will be interviewed and their applications processed over the next number of weeks.  <\/p>  <p>  However, there will always be certain posts that are difficult to attract suitably qualified candidates to and individual strategies are developed for these in conjunction with the line managers. Where front-line staffing shortages exist, the HSE makes alternative arrangements to ensure continued service provision, including recourse to agency cover. However, it is preferable that sufficient numbers of nurses are recruited to permanent posts to support the most efficient and effective delivery of services.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700077#WRR02600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Nurses","counter":772,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700077#WRR02650"},{"type":"question","counter":773,"qnumday":380,"qnumall":"[3677\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700077#WRR02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to intervene in the ongoing dispute between nursing unions and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland regarding increased registration fees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"949","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":774,"content":"<p>I am concerned regarding the implications for the health service and patient safety should the current impasse over the annual retention fee increase continue.

The Review is being carried out by my Department in collaboration with the HSE, with analysis and recommendations provided by an external service provider on specific issues which required specialised expertise.<\/p>  <p>  A call for written submissions to inform the review was made on the 16th June 2012. In total 61 submissions were received from a broad range of individuals, nursing homes, statutory bodies, groups representing the interest of older people, private\/commercial bodies and organisations in the community and voluntary sector. A summary report of the submissions was published on the Department's website in December 2012.<\/p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference for the Review are:<\/p>  <p>  Taking account of Government policy, demographic trends and the fiscal situation:-<\/p>  <p>  1. To examine the on-going sustainability of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme,<\/p>  <p>  2. To examine the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating\/setting prices,<\/p>  <p>  3. Having regard to 1. and 2. above, to consider the balance of funding between long-term residential care and community based services,<\/p>  <p>  4. To consider the extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health),<\/p>  <p>  5. To make recommendations for the future operation and management of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The elements of the Review that relate to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme itself are well-defined, but an effective assessment of the Scheme for the future requires consideration of where it fits within the spectrum of services and supports for older people, and of how the make-up of and balances within this spectrum may change over time. This exercise is broader than was first envisaged and the various issues arising are now being  systematically considered with a view to completion and publication as early as possible. It is expected that the Review will be completed by the end of this quarter and the report will then be made publicly available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700078#WRS02600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Inspections","counter":816,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700078#WRS02650"},{"type":"question","counter":817,"qnumday":395,"qnumall":"[3767\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700078#WRS02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update on the situation regarding public nursing homes that are at risk of failing to meet Health Information and Quality Authority national accommodation standards; if the Health Service Executive is working with the 27 homes identified as potentially being unable to meet its standards; if funding is being put aside to ensure the standards are being met and if so, the amount, the plans in place to cater to clients, should any or all of these homes be closed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1093","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":818,"qnumday":416,"qnumall":"[3942\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700078#WRS02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on reports that up to 21 of the largest publicly run nursing homes are at risk of closure due to the State's failure to invest in bringing them up to national accommodation standards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":819,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 395 and 416 together.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 119 public residential units providing a mixture of long-stay and short-stay residential care. All of these are registered with HIQA. Notwithstanding the problems that some facilities face with structures and facilities, the vast majority of their residents receive excellent levels of care. Without these public facilities many older people would simply have nowhere to go, other than our acute hospitals which are already under pressure. It is therefore very important that the services provided by public facilities be maintained. <\/p>  <p>  Demand for capital investment for the Community Nursing Unit programme far exceeds the funding available, and investment must therefore be allocated as effectively as possible based on the HSE's assessment of priorities. <\/p>  <p>  HIQA has indicated that a number of units do not fully meet the standards one would expect to find in a modern nursing home.  This is not surprising given the age and structure of many of our public nursing homes. However, there is adequate flexibility available within the terms of existing legislative provisions, and through ongoing discussions between the HSE and HIQA, for solutions to be found. In this context the HSE has been working with HIQA over the past number of months to meet the re-registration requirements of these units, and my Department is closely monitoring the situation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700078#WRS02900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Administration","counter":820,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700078#WRS02950"},{"type":"question","counter":821,"qnumday":396,"qnumall":"[3784\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700078#WRS03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Offaly will receive a hospital appointment with the pain management clinic, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9.","asker":"1101","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":822,"content":"<p>The scheduling of appointments for patients is a matter for the hospital to which the patient has been referred.

The Act provides that persons, unable without undue hardship having regard to their overall financial situation to arrange GP services for themselves and family, qualify for a medical card. The Deputy will also be aware of the publication of the <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility<\/i>and the <i>Medical Card Process Review<\/i>in November 2014.  A key recommendation of the Expert Panel was that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.<br\/><br\/>The HSE has discretion, exercised in accordance with the legislation, to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines. The HSE is obliged to operate within the legal parameters as set out in the Health Act, while also responding to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals who apply for a medical card.  <br\/><br\/>In the light of the conclusions of the two reports a range of actions have been identified to improve the operation of the medical card system, particularly for people with significant medical needs. The HSE has appointed a senior manager to lead the reform of the systems for handling medical card application and reviews. Under one of the actions, the HSE is taking steps to establish a clinical advisory group to develop a methodology and guidance for the assessment of applications involving significant medical conditions so as to take account of the burden involved and the needs arising from the condition and to ensure that appropriate services are provided to people who need them. The HSE is also putting arrangements in place for a more integrated and sensitive processing of medical card applications involving significant medical conditions to ensure greater interaction between the central office regarding the assessment of a person&rsquo;s eligibility and the local health office regarding the person&rsquo;s medical condition and the services that they may require. Consequently, the number of medical cards issued, where the HSE has exercised discretion, has increased from approximately 50,300 at the start of 2014 to approximately 76,700 at the start of 2015.<br\/><br\/>The Minister and I have also asked the HSE to examine, with the Department of Health, the best way to meet the needs of people with significant medical conditions who need the support of the public health system. This work includes considering the best way to make medical aids and appliances available to persons who do not hold a medical card, the provision of services to children with severe disabilities, and to enable people with particular needs to have these met on an individual basis rather than awarding a medical card to all family members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700079#WRT00400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","counter":827,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700079#WRT00500"},{"type":"question","counter":828,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[3798\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700079#WRT00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on implementing recommendations (details supplied) regarding residential care.","asker":"1034","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":829,"content":"<p>Like others, I was shocked and distressed by the revelations of extremely poor and unacceptable standards of care and mistreatment of vulnerable adults in &Aacute;ras Attracta. Every person who uses our disability services is entitled to expect and receive supports of the highest standard and to live in an atmosphere of safety and care.  <\/p>  <p>  The safeguarding and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the health service is of paramount importance and the Director General of the HSE has written to all staff instructing them to take personal responsibility for ensuring that individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with dignity and respect.  <\/p>  <p>  In December 2014 the HSE initiated both an expert investigation chaired by Mr Christy Lynch, and an independently chaired review of services at this facility led by Dr Kevin McCoy. <\/p>  <p>  Mr Lynch&rsquo;s investigation team is working independently of the HSE and its findings will be a precursor to any disciplinary process consideration at which the HSE will undertake. Mr Lynch is both nationally and internationally recognised as a champion for people with a disability and a leader in the implementation of innovative supports.  His independence in relation to this issue should not be questioned, as his proven track record in fighting for people with a disability speaks for itself.<\/p>  <p>  Dr McCoy is undertaking an Assurance Review of the services at &Aacute;ras Attracta and the final report will include an individual plan for improvement in each bungalow within the complex.  The review will identify system wide learning involving engagement with relevant expertise as well as input from staff. <\/p>  <p>  A Garda investigation into allegations of abuse at the centre is ongoing and the Garda had requested that a stay be placed on HSE investigations until such time as the Garda investigation is completed. However, the HSE has informed me that garda&iacute; have now cleared the way for the investigation to commence. Following the lift of a Garda stay, I have asked the HSE to keep me informed of progress.<\/p>  <p>  On 16 December 2014, the Director General of the HSE announced the appointment of Ms Leigh Gath as Confidential Recipient in respect of complaints or disclosures of abuse of vulnerable persons in receipt of HSE funded services.

They must investigate all complaints promptly, and following investigation put in place any measures required for improvement.  Records of complaints made are required to be kept.  These are available for inspection, thus enabling the HIQA inspector to determine whether the complaints system is sufficiently robust. <\/p>  <p>  HIQA takes into account and uses all information received to inform and plan its regulatory activity, and information on individual cases can provide useful pointers in this context.  HIQA&rsquo;s programme of both scheduled and unannounced inspections helps to ensure that standards are maintained and where issues of non-compliance arise, that these are addressed and rectified.

Our overall objective is to protect the viability of as many units as possible, within the funding and staffing resources available.  Therefore improving the supports available for older persons is a significant commitment in our Programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  All developments must be addressed in the light of the resources available and based on priority of need.  HIQA has indicated that a number of units do not fully meet the standards one would expect to find in a modern nursing home.  This is not surprising given the age and structure of many of our public nursing homes.  Currently the funding for the Community Nursing Unit (CNU) programme focuses on the upgrade and refurbishment of existing facilities to achieve HIQA compliance.    <\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services.  This includes provision of the appropriate infrastructure which supports service delivery, such as the facilities at this particular location.  Given that demand for capital finance for the Community Nursing Unit programme alone far exceeds the funding available, investment must be allocated as objectively as possible, based on the HSE's assessment of priorities of needs.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has identified this location as a priority location for a new Community Nursing Home unit.  The design team has been appointed.  Currently it is projected that a planning application could be lodged with the local authority in Q2 2015.  Following the award of planning it is expected that the project will progress to the tendering \/ construction phase in late 2015.   In advance of the award of planning permission it is not possible, at this point in time to be definitive about a time frame for completion once work begins, other than to say that it is possible that the construction of a CNU could be completed within twelve months of appointing a contractor.  All Government Departments and agencies, including the HSE, that are funded from the Exchequer must comply with EU Directives and national guidelines on procurement and in this regard the HSE's selection of a contractor will be in accordance with this process.  <\/p>  <p>  As with all capital projects, the CNU infrastructure programme which includes this project, must be considered within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.  There will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer.  There is limited funding available for new projects, over the next multi-annual period 2015-2019, given the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place.    Therefore the reason capital funding is not ring-fenced by project is to ensure that the HSE has flexibility to manage within its voted capital allocation in the event that one or more of the hundreds of construction projects underway at any time do not progress as scheduled.  Indenting rather than ring-fencing enables the HSE, to leverage its capital allocation efficiently, so that it delivers the maximum number of priority projects for the funding available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700080#WRU01300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":878,"content":"<p>Question No. 416 answered with Question No. 395.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":880,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700080#WRU01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Applications","counter":879,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700080#WRU01700"},{"type":"question","counter":880,"qnumday":417,"qnumall":"[3468\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700080#WRU01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the reason only two-year passports were issued in respect of persons (details supplied) with Irish citizenship; and if the persons will be expected to pay the full application fee when applying for replacement passports.","asker":"968","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":881,"content":"<p>Passports belonging to a mother and her four children were declared lost in October 2012.

The standard based craft apprenticeship scheme was designed as a demand driven alternance programme in conjunction with all key stakeholders.  The number of craft apprentices registered with SOLAS is determined by individual employers recruiting potential apprentices within a range of occupational sectors.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, apprentices must be at least 16 years of age on entry to the existing apprenticeship trades. The entry requirements are set at a minimum of 5 Grade Ds at Junior Certificate or equivalent, or successful completion of an approved pre-apprenticeship course, or at least three years' work experience approved by SOLAS. In practice at least 70% of apprentices registered with SOLAS in 2014 had attained Leaving Certificate standard. Employers often consider criteria beyond the minimum entry requirements and in many apprenticeship programmes the standard of mathematics, science and or technology content has intensified in line with labour market expectations and demands.  Furthermore, the majority of employers are less inclined to recruit apprentices at a relatively young age. For example, only 1% of apprentices registered with SOLAS in 2014 were 16 years of age, 78% of apprentices were 19 years of age and over and 58% were over 20 years of age.<\/p>  <p>  The recent review of apprenticeship recommended that with respect to the current apprenticeship trades, \"the minimum entry levels needed to successfully complete each programme should be reviewed, while ensuring appropriate pre-apprenticeship programmes are made available for those unable to meet the entry requirements.\" With regard to apprenticeships in new areas, which are expected to be developed following a call for proposals in this regard by the recently established Apprenticeship Council, the Review recommended that \"Entry levels may need to be raised to cater adequately for occupations with a high mathematics, science or technology content. However, care should be taken to ensure that opportunities for those with lower skills to progress are not eroded unduly. Entry levels should be set on an occupation by occupation basis.\"  These recommendations will be borne in mind when examining entry level requirements for apprenticeships into the future.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the option of returning to the Leaving Certificate, there are already a significant amount of opportunities for adults to return to education. Over the past few years a range of programmes has been developed to facilitate adults who want to return to education, including programmes leading to the Leaving Certificate examinations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700081#WRV00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Disputes","counter":919,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700081#WRV00750"},{"type":"question","counter":920,"qnumday":430,"qnumall":"[3381\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700081#WRV00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the actions being taken to resolve the junior cycle dispute with teachers; if a resolution is imminent; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1198","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":921,"content":"<p>Reform of the Junior Cycle is important and is a policy priority.

The Board of Management shall publish the enrolment policy of the school and that policy must be non-discriminatory and applied fairly in respect of all applicants.<\/p>  <p>  This Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area.  Where new schools are needed, the model of provision is decided by an open patronage determination process, which is overseen by the New Schools Establishment Group. The criteria for awarding patronage place a heavy emphasis on parental choice and diversity of provision. Prospective patrons must also commit to enrolling pupils from the area to be served by the new school.  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.<\/p>  <p>  Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values. The Equality legislation provides that any primary or post primary school that has this objective may, where it has more applicants than places available, admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation also provides that a school whose objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values can refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion only where the school proves that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school. <\/p>  <p>  The Constitution provides that legislation providing State aid for schools shall not be such as to affect prejudicially the right of any child to attend a school receiving public money without attending religious instruction at that school. In this regard, Section 30 of the Education Act (1998), provides that no student can be required to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student. Therefore, parents have the right, if so desired, to ensure that their children do not receive religious instruction. <\/p>  <p>  It is my firm view that all schools should be inclusive. It is with this spirit of inclusiveness that the proposed Admission to Schools Bill is designed.

The Report of the Advisory Group to the Forum made a series of recommendations dealing with the creation of more inclusive schools.  The Report took account of the findings and conclusions of previous groups and committees, such as those of the Constitution Review Group of 1996.<\/p>  <p>  Religious education is one of the seven curricular areas of the 1999 Primary School Curriculum. However, under Article 44 of the Constitution, all parents have the right to withdraw their child from religious instruction in school.  Furthermore, under Section 30 of the Education Act 1998, a student cannot be required to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student or, in the case of a student who is 18 or more, the student him\/herself. The Education (Admission to School) Bill, which is currently being drafted, will require schools to publish an enrolment policy which will clarify the school's arrangements for upholding the constitutional right of parents that their children not attend religious instruction. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to denominational religious education, the Forum Report did not recommend that religious instruction be removed from the school day. However, the Advisory Group had concerns about the amount of time which can be devoted to sacramental preparation in some schools and they recommended that it should not be allowed to encroach on time allocated for the general curriculum. They also recommended on-going discussion with parents and clergy in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Report also noted that there are currently no non-denominational primary schools, but that there is no objection to the establishment of such schools if sought by a sufficiently large number of parents. The Forum also concluded that the State has a responsibility to ensure that all children have the right to receive Education about Religions and Beliefs (ERB) and Ethics and recommended that an ERB and Ethics programme be developed.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) is developing a curriculum for ERB and Ethics for all primary schools.<\/p>  <p>  A follow-up paper to the Forum Report entitled Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector: Progress to Date and Future Directions was published on 1 July 2014.  The paper outlines good practice and options for promoting diversity in all schools and encourages school authorities to engage in consultation with stakeholders and to review their policies and practices on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain suitable for the school population that they serve.  It recognises that each school should arrive at solutions that suit its own particular context.  It also notes that this is an evolving situation and that practices may evolve over time as circumstances change.<\/p>  <p>  The paper was informed by a consultation with stakeholders and encourages school authorities to consider their policies and practices and to review whether they are taking the steps necessary to welcome all pupils and make them feel included.<\/p>  <p>  Particular areas to be examined by schools relate to:<\/p>  <p>  - The right to opt out of religion classes;<\/p>  <p>  - Scheduling of Religion Classes and other Religious Activities;<\/p>  <p>  - Options for Pupils in relation to Religious Ceremonies of the Ethos of the School; <\/p>  <p>  - Celebration of Religious Festivals; and<\/p>  <p>  - Display of Religious Artefacts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700081#WRV03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":954,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 442 to 444, inclusive, answered with Question No. 437.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children First Guidelines","counter":955,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700082#WRW00350"},{"type":"question","counter":956,"qnumday":445,"qnumall":"[3459\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700082#WRW00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the changes made since the publication of a report (details supplied) regarding the enforcement of legislation and constitutional provisions in dealing with religious patrons.","asker":"1192","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":957,"content":"<p>Procedures for schools on the implementation of Children First in the school setting were updated and published in September 2011.

The primary purpose of POD  will be to monitor the education progress of primary pupils (in DES aided  schools), throughout the primary system and onwards to post primary level and  to help them develop their full educational potential. Once up and running  other secondary purposes of POD will include becoming the basis for the  allocation of teachers and capitation grants. Aggregated POD data will also be  used for the production and publication of primary level statistics. A PPS number is an individual's unique identification number for all dealings  with the Public Service, including Social Welfare, tax, education and health services.<br\/><br\/>Having the PPSN on the database will help ensure that there are no  duplicate records in the system i.e that two schools do not have the same child  on their roll. In the future we will be able to track pupils from early  childhood education, to primary school and onto post-primary, which will allow  us to ensure that every child in the State of compulsory school age is in  education.  Religion is requested for statistical reasons only and parents have  the option not to include the religion of their child on POD. Individualised data coverage has already been in place for a number of years at  pre-primary, post-primary and third level education who collect individual  information on each pupil, including their PPSN.<br\/><br\/>The current retention policy for Primary Online Database (POD) data is for records to be maintained for the longer of either the period up to the pupil's 30th Birthday or for a period of ten years since the student was last enrolled  in a primary school. In future schools will no longer be required to keep the Cl&aacute;rleabhar therefore POD will be the official register of pupils in schools  and data will be retained to allow pupils to obtain their records in the future. The retention policy facilitates the Department's requirement for audit and accounting purposes as pupil's data is used in the allocation of teaching  posts and funding to schools. The policy also serves to trace retention trends  in the education system, is important for longitudinal research and policy  formation, as well as being an important statistical indicator nationally an  internationally. Aggregate and not individual data is used for the majority of these purposes. The Department will continue to review its retention policy for pupil data in consultation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. The Department proposes in the future to share some of the personal data stored on POD with other State bodies. These are: <br\/><br\/>- Central Statistics Office, under the Statistics Acts to assist with the compilation of national statistics. <br\/><br\/>- The National Council for Special Education, under the Education Welfare Act, in order to assist in supporting resource allocation in relation to pupils with special educational needs. <br\/><br\/>- The Child and Family Agency, under the Education Welfare Act, to ensure that each child of compulsory school age is in receipt of an education. <br\/><br\/>- The Department of Social Protection to validate pupil identity.  The Department will put in place a data user agreement with each of these bodies, which includes the purpose for which the body requires the data, its  storage, security and retention. <br\/><br\/>  The information on POD will, from the 2016\\2017 academic year onwards, be used to underpin the payment of public funds and allocation of resources to primary  schools, as is already the case at pre-primary, post-primary and third level  education. If a child's data is not on POD at that time then they may not be  counted for grant payment and teacher allocation purposes for the child's  school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700084#WRY01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":1047,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700084#WRY01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1048,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[3768\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700084#WRY01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will prioritise the building of a school (details supplied) in County Westmeath.

Armagh entering the River Fane system which is the source of the drinking water supply for Dundalk.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of Irish Water to assess the risk of contamination to public water drinking sources and to monitor any such risks. Monitoring occurs of the source water, the water after treatment and the water at the point of use within the water network and drinking water sample results for 2014 are fully compliant with the Drinking Water Regulations.\u00a0If the supply becomes contaminated or fails to meet the minimum drinking water quality standards Irish Water must notify the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promptly.\u00a0 The EPA investigates all such notifications to ensure that remedial action is taken to prevent any reoccurrence. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, I understand that Louth County Council, on behalf of Irish Water, has contacted the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland to investigate this specific allegation. <\/p>  <p>  Lough Muckno is part of the EPA&rsquo;s national Lake Monitoring Programme network under the Water Framework Directive. Biological monitoring is undertaken every 3 years and monitoring of the general physical conditions is undertaken every year with samples analysed for 13 specific parameters.\u00a0   <\/p>  <p>  The Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts carry a general prohibition on the entry of any polluting matter to waters. \u00a0Any persons causing or permitting polluting matter to enter waters is liable on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;15,000,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, or both. The primary enforcement responsibility in relation to water pollution rests with local authorities, which are in turn supervised by the EPA for this purpose. Local authorities issue a significant number of enforcement notices every year under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts. These enforcement notices require respondents to carry out actions to prevent or remedy water pollution, and are followed up by prosecutions where necessary.   <\/p>  <p>  Enforcement in relation to illegal diesel laundering activities is primarily a matter for the Revenue Commissioners from the point of view of avoiding loss of revenue to the Exchequer. My Department assists local authorities in carrying out their role as competent authorities under waste legislation, which is to take the necessary measures, on behalf of the State, to ensure that any waste generated and left abandoned by the diesel launderers is disposed of without endangering human health and without harming the environment, in particular without risk to water. <\/p>  <p>  Approximately 1,200 incidents of diesel laundering waste dumping have been dealt with by local authorities since 2008 and to date my Department has reimbursed all of the costs associated with such disposal on a case by case basis. Almost half of the clean-up operations have taken place in County Louth with 596 incidents having been dealt with at a cost of approximately &euro;4.8 million. <\/p>  <p>  Following discussions with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners and Monaghan County Council who have also been seriously affected by this issue, my Department has agreed to fund a pilot sampling programme for abandoned fuel laundering waste material in order to generate improved intelligence. This exercise may result in linking dump sites to particular laundering processes as well as identifying the origins of the diesel based on the markers detected in the analysed material. The pilot programme will be carried out by a specialised contractor who will visit the sites, sample the waste, deliver these samples to the state laboratory and compile a report based on that analysis. <\/p>  <p>  My Department, as part of on-going cooperation with the Northern Ireland authorities on repatriation of illegally deposited waste in Northern Ireland, has held recent discussions with the relevant Northern Ireland authorities on the need to develop a mechanism for dealing with waste from cross-border diesel washings which would be factored into the overall discussions on waste repatriation. These discussions are on-going.   <\/p>  <p>  There is strong end active co-operation on this and other waste management issues between the relevant enforcement authorities on both sides of the Border, involving An Garda Sioch&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other enforcement agencies. However, I will be writing to my counterpart in the Northern Ireland Executive, Minister Mark Durkan, to highlight again the problems being faced by border counties exposed to the consequences of environmental crime and will also raise the issue at the next meeting of the North South Ministerial Council.   <\/p>  <p>  I believe that a complete solution to this problem must necessarily involve effective and co-ordinated enforcement of the law from both a revenue and waste management perspective. In that context, my Department continues to liaise with representatives of the Revenue Commissioners, the local authorities concerned and the EPA&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Enforcement to seek to identify more effective enforcement solutions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700086#WRAA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Lottery Funding Disbursement","counter":1139,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700086#WRAA01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1140,"qnumday":508,"qnumall":"[47713\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700086#WRAA01500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"in view of the amendment accepted to the National Lottery Bill, including natural environment agencies, as potential recipients as of April 2013, the procedure for agencies and groups that qualify for funding under the amendment to apply for funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1141,"content":"<p>The inclusion of Section 41(1) of the National Lottery Act 2013 , incorporating the new heading &ldquo;natural environment&rdquo; as one of the purposes for which the proceeds of the National Lottery may be applied, is to be welcomed.

A scheme exists whereby a local authority (LA) can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (LA- mortgage-to-rent). The other scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage, which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (AHB-mortgage-to-rent).  Both schemes are designed to assist families with income difficulties whose mortgages are now unsustainable, and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  To be eligible for the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme a household must have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, agree to the voluntary surrender of their home, be in negative equity, and be deemed eligible for social housing in accordance with section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.<br\/><br\/>A total of 2,598 cases had been submitted by the end of December 2014 under the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme. Of these 1,040 were ineligible or terminated during the process, of which 276 cases were not progressed because the household in question was deemed to be over or under accommodated. Agreement on the sale could not be agreed on a further 46 cases. Of the remaining cases submitted, 68 have been completed, 1,002 are currently with the lenders who are seeking the consent of borrowers to share information and for the carrying out of an independent valuation, and the remaining 442 are actively being progressed.My Department has issued funding approval in respect of 119 cases. <br\/><br\/>The Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) scheme, which was rolled out nationally in February 2014, allows local authorities to offer the mortgage to rent scheme to local authority mortgage holders with unsustainable mortgages.

The Commissioner o f Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters. The Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property determined by the Valuation Office to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.<br\/><br\/>Local authorities are very aware of the demands placed on the business and commercial sector at this time, as well as the competitiveness issues this gives rise to. Local authorities have a leading role in creating a pro-enterprise supportive environment to generate new jobs and sustain existing ones. They are committed to local economic development, and are best placed to meet many of the needs of businesses in terms of infrastructure, local promotion and other key enabling measures.<br\/><br\/>In accordance with the Government&rsquo;s <i>Action Plan for Jobs,<\/i>my Department requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting ARVs in recent years and they have responded positively in this regard. The average ARV adopted by local authorities nationally has decreased each year since 2010. The new structures of local government, including the establishment of municipal districts, have provided an opportunity to achieve a more coherent approach to rates and charges on a county-wide basis. In 2015 , local authorities have begun the process of harmonisation to cater for differences between ARVs of former towns and of counties. In the harmonisation process ratepayers will not pay any more in 2015 than they did in 2014. Any increase or decrease in rates liability due to harmonisation will be phased in after 2015 over a period of up to 10 years. I am also pleased to note that those local authorities which are not subject to the requirement to harmonise, due to already having one ARV for the whole of their administrative area, have either reduced the ARV for 2015 or kept it the same as 2014.<br\/><br\/>It is worth noting that analysis of the impact of rates on business costs is limited. What analysis is available concludes that commercial rates represent a small portion of overall business overheads compared to energy, rents, payroll and other inputs. The figures vary from sector to sector but research from Forf&aacute;s, IBEC and local authorities all indicate that commercial rates are, on average, less than 5% of business costs. <br\/><br\/>I accept that the current rates burden , while not excessive overall , may be unfairly distributed in some cases. The revaluation process currently underway by the Valuation Office is re-balancing rates liabilities to ensure that the rates burden is more equitable and in line with changes in valuations across different classes of properties within counties. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700087#WRBB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Private Rented Accommodation Standards","counter":1194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700087#WRBB02250"},{"type":"question","counter":1195,"qnumday":528,"qnumall":"[3620\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700087#WRBB02300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if there is a register of all rented properties here; if not, if a register will be compiled; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

There is enough accommodation available for all those sleeping rough so that no one needs to sleep rough unless they choose to do so. The number and availability of emergency beds is being monitored closely by Dublin City Council and further beds will be brought on stream should the need arise. Where a homeless person does not want to be placed in emergency accommodation, the Housing First intake street team will refer the person to the recently established Nite Caf&eacute; which is now fully operational.

The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050. Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the <i>Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>In anticipation of enactment of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing a low-carbon plan - the National Mitigation Plan - the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures within the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050. I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to comply with the annual mitigation targets under the 2009 EU Effort-Sharing Decision (406\/2009\/EC) in the first half of the 2013-2020 compliance period.  However, there will be a significant compliance challenge in the years 2017-2020 and therefore the first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address this particular challenge in the years 2017 to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to be ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that. It is also important to note that the Bill will provide for long-term successive planning in this respect.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the timeframe, the development of the National Mitigation Plan will be an open and inclusive process.

Both of these processes involve a number of phases, including statutory consultative phases at different stages of the development of the plan. In addition to the statutory consultations required under the Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment legislation, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill provides that there will be a consultation process on the draft National Mitigation Plan.

Specific responsibilities within the remit of my Department in this regard include setting energy performance standards under the Building Regulations and promoting energy efficiency in social housing.<br\/><br\/>Directive 2010\/31\/EU on the energy performance of buildings requires EU Member States to ensure that all new buildings will be nearly zero-energy by 31 December 2020.The Directive broadly defines a &lsquo;nearly zero-energy building&rsquo; as a building with a high energy performance where the very low amount of energy required should, to a very significant extent, be met by energy from renewable sources, including renewable energy produced on site or nearby.<br\/><br\/>Against this background, Ireland has been making significant progress in terms of both improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide emissions within the built environment. Taking the energy efficiency requirements established in 2005 as the benchmark, the Building Regulations (Part L Amendment) Regulations 2007 set the requirements necessary to achieve a 40% improvement (over the 2005 standards) in the energy and carbon performance of new dwellings. The requirements were subsequently upgraded under the Building Regulations (Part L Amendment) Regulations 2011 which has delivered a 60% aggregate improvement (relative to 2005 standards) in both the energy and carbon performance of new dwellings. One further upgrade of the Part L requirement is envisaged in order to ensure that Ireland meets our 'nearly zero energy' obligation by 2020. A comprehensive public consultation process and a rigorous regulatory impact assessment will be undertaken before such changes are finalised.<br\/><br\/>My Department also continues to pursue an ongoing programme of investment in improving the energy efficiency of the existing stock of social housing owned by local authorities and has published the best practice design guidelines <i>Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities<\/i>which, among other things, promote higher standards of energy efficiency in new social housing. Local authorities are undertaking an ambitious programme of insulation retrofitting, with the support of my Department, on the least energy efficient social houses over a 3 year period. Funding of &euro;50 million is being provided over the period 2013-2015 for improving the energy performance of older local authority housing stock. This programme will improve energy efficiency and comfort levels, and therefore BER ratings, in 25,000 local authority homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700089#WRDD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Guidelines","counter":1281,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700089#WRDD03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1282,"qnumday":560,"qnumall":"[3893\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012700089#WRDD03300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when the revised guidelines for wind energy will be published; and if they will apply to projects that have prior applications submitted.","asker":"1180","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1283,"content":"<p>In December 2013, my Department published proposed \"draft\" revisions to the noise, setbacks and shadow flicker aspects of the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines.

In this regard, while Inland Fisheries Ireland is the Statutory body responsible for the protection, management and conservation of the inland fisheries resource, it is supported in Salmon fisheries assessment by the Standing Scientific Committee on Salmon (SSCS) which includes fisheries scientists from IFI, the Marine Institute, National Parks and Wildlife Service, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Loughs Agency, and the Agriculture, Food and Biosciences Institute for Northern Ireland (AFBINI).  Although the scientists are drawn from these agencies, the advice from the SSCS is independent of the parent agencies.<\/p>  <p>  The SSCS annually carry out an assessment of salmon stocks on a catchment by catchment basis using internationally accepted best scientific practice to ascertain whether conservation limits are being or likely to be attained on an individual river basis.  The SSCS provide advice to IFI, who are responsible for the management and conservation of these stocks.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Inland Fisheries Ireland that fish counter data and rod\/net catch data (in-river or estuarine measures) of salmon abundance are used by the SSCS to provide a primary measure of spawning stocks and attainment of individual river conservation limits.<\/p>  <p>  With the operation of fisheries restricted to estuaries and rivers, following the Government decision to close mixed stock fisheries at sea from 2007, the SSCS assessment is now focused primarily on estimating individual river returns from catch data, counter data and ranges of rod catch exploitation rates derived from observed values in Irish rivers in recent years.  The catch statistics derived from estuarine commercial fisheries are an important source of quantitative information for the SSCS, particularly in determining the attainment of individual river Conservation Limits.  Following implementation of the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme which commenced in 2001, the catch data are derived from the logbook returns of commercial fishermen and recreational anglers.<\/p>  <p>  Data are available to the SSCS from 32 fish counters for the 2014 &ndash; 2015 assessments, an increase of 11 counters on the 2011 &ndash; 2012 assessment.  Information on juvenile abundance indices derived from electro-fishing surveys carried out annually by IFI is also examined to indicate stock status.  Juvenile abundance data is used primarily where new information has not been available for rod catches where rivers may be closed to exploitation.<\/p>  <p>  The information set out above is very comprehensive and is collected annually, where available, for all 143 salmon rivers in Ireland.  The SSCS use the most recent five years of data and not a once annual count to forecast the run of salmon in the following year and to formulate advice to IFI on any surplus available over the conservation limit of each individual river.  This is done to take account of any extremes in conditions such as droughts and floods, and to avoid large short-term fluctuations in predicted salmon returns in the annual scientific advice.<\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where the number of anglers is reduced over recent years, for rivers where rod catch is the primary means of salmon stock assessment, a rod exploitation rate is applied to the reported rod catch for each river.  If the number of anglers has reduced, for example, due to catch and release angling, a lower rod exploitation rate is applied in that instance.<\/p>  <p>  For the majority of salmon rivers, the reported rod catch is used in conjunction with rod exploitation rates over the previous five years to estimate the size of salmon runs and predict the run in the following year.  Rod exploitation rates used are derived from fish counters where the total salmon run is known and the also percentage of the run that is taken by anglers (i.e. the exploitation rate).<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s wild salmon management regime, including the work of the SSCS, is very well regarded internationally with delegations from a number of countries visiting in recent years to study and learn from our management system now regularly viewed as best international practice.  The management structure is also well regarded within the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO).<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the survival of salmon after catch and release, a recent study on three Irish rivers (Gargan et al. 2015) has shown that, when conducted using proper guidelines, survival of salmon after C&amp;R can be high.  Opening rivers to C&amp;R angling provides an important tool to assist data collection on salmon stock status while not significantly impacting on salmon survival.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, rod catches and commercial catches (if a commercial fishery operates) are used to determine the status of salmon stocks on the Barrow, Nore and Suir rivers.  Use of rod catch, in conjunction with a range of exploitation rates, is the primary index of salmon stock status on the great majority of Irish rivers.  IFI are currently investigating the possibility of installing a fish counter on the river Barrow for salmon stock assessment.  This process will depend on locating a suitable site and securing the necessary planning and other relevant permissions.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Eel Management Plan (EMP) was accepted by the EU in 2009 under the EC Regulation (EC No. 1100\/2007).  I am advised by IFI that a close link between the management actions in Ireland&rsquo;s EMP and eel-stock targets has been established by implementing a comprehensive monitoring and stock assessment programme.  This will allow for a direct feedback to management based on response of the stock to management actions.<\/p>  <p>  Each year, eel stocks are assessed in a national monitoring programme.  This involves assessment of juvenile eel (glass eels or elvers), maturing eel (yellow eels) and mature eels on their migration to sea (silver eels).  Monitoring of recruitment is critical to evaluating the overall success of the eel regulation and is required by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) for international stock assessment.

The plan outlined the following main management actions aimed at reducing eel mortality and increasing silver eel escapement to the sea: <br\/><br\/>-  a cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market,<br\/><br\/>-  mitigation of the impact of hydropower installations,<br\/><br\/>-  ensure upstream migration of juvenile eel at barriers,<br\/><br\/>-  improvement of water quality.<br\/><br\/>The overall requirement and objective is to provide, with high probability, a long-term 40% escapement to the sea of the biomass of silver eel, relative to pristine conditions (i.e. if the stock had been completely free of man-made influences including commercial fishing).<br\/><br\/>Based on comprehensive scientific assessment of eel stocks nationally and a review of Ireland&rsquo;s EMP in 2012 it was recommended that the closure of both the commercial and recreational eel fisheries be continued in line with the conservation imperative.  The 2012 review included a robust public consultation during which many issues were raised and considered.  Full details of the outputs of the public consultation are available on the Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) web site.  Similar reviews were carried out across EU Member States as the eel stock has radically declined throughout Europe.  The status of the European Eel has also been defined by the United Nations as critically endangered.<br\/><br\/>While I recognize fully the difficulty facing eel fishermen, the review of scientific and management advice and inputs from the public consultation informed the decision to continue with the cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market for the period from 2012 to 2015.
