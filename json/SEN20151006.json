I have raised this issue a number of times in recent years.  As the Minister is probably very well aware, the inspection regime causes considerable distress to farmers whose properties are being inspected.  It is imperative that I highlight the practices that have been carried out by some officials during the most recent inspection period.<\/p><p>In the Galway East constituency and elsewhere throughout the country, inspectors arrived on farms and conducted inspections without giving prior notice.  In the ordinary course of events, this would render their arrival on farms illegal.  However, they carried out their inspections under the terms of the animal feed and hygiene regulations and, under EU law, no notice is of such inspection is required.  A difficulty arose in many cases in that the Department officials then proceeded to carry out tagging inspections on sheep and cattle, in respect of which 48 hours' notice is required, and further inspections on land eligibility, with regard to which 14 days' notice should be given.<\/p><p>Many farmers have come to my office to complain about the penalties imposed on them.  From my legal experience, it is clear that these departmental officials would have exceeded their jurisdiction in cutting any single farm payment stemming from cases where minimum notice was not respected and, therefore, the penalty could not be upheld if challenged through the courts.  Some departmental officials gave notice to farmers and some of them gave notice about their payments being cut.  This was done on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis, without any particulars relating to which cuts were being made or how they had arisen being provided.  It is clear that we need to strive for better standards to ensure that best practice is adhered to and that the fundamental principles of fair procedures are upheld in the context of farm inspections.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lorraine Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2385\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2385&amp;amp;pid=LorraineHiggins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A number of farmers in the Galway East constituency, where I live, have informed me that they dread farm inspections.  In many cases they feel they are being treated unfairly and are afraid to stand up for themselves for fear of detrimental action being taken against them in the future.  This is wrong.  It is an unacceptable imposition on the farming community and we need to put a stop to it.<\/p><p>I have raised this issue in the Seanad on several occasions.  While I acknowledge that the Department and the Minister have worked hard on the charter of rights for farmers, it is very much a fluffy document.  I do not believe it gives any legal status to farmers and does little to empower them throughout this process.  Procedure is important.  It should be incumbent on agencies to give farmers at least seven working days' notice in writing that an inspection is to be carried out on their land, including in respect of cattle and sheep tagging and so on.  This is standard practice on the part of other agencies of the State.  I refer, for example, to the Revenue Commissioners and the fact that they give notice of proposed audits, etc.  I do not think farmers should be treated any differently.  It is unacceptable that they would not get, at the very minimum, a letter informing them that they are to be subject to an inspection in the weeks ahead.  Farmers, particularly hill farmers, of which there are many in the constituency in which I live, would then at least have an opportunity to enlist the support of neighbours in rounding up cattle and sheep to ensure they are properly tagged and can thereby pass inspection.  These are proactive measures to deal with the current situation relating to procedures for carrying out farm inspections.  I look forward to the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015100600002#B00600","speaker":"1173","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444138200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for the opportunity to set the record straight on a number of matters.  I would first like to outline to the House the background of the inspection requirements relating to the direct payment scheme and other area-based schemes.<\/p> <p>In the context of the delivery of the direct payment scheme and rural development measures, my Department is required to carry out an annual round of inspections on a number of farms.  These cover such issues as eligibility under the schemes and compliance with cross-compliance requirements as set down in EU legislation.  The basis for such inspections is governed by EU legislation and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must take place annually.  Eligibility inspections must be carried out on a minimum of 5% of beneficiaries.  These inspections verify the eligibility of the land declared for the drawing down of payments and ensure that any ineligible land or features have not been not been included for aid purposes and that other scheme-specific eligibility criteria have been met.<\/p> <p>My Department has made every effort to respond to concerns about the impact on farmers of on-farm inspections.  Arising from this, 75% of land eligibility inspections are initially carried out without any farm visit as the information required is acquired using the technique of remote sensing via satellite imagery.  In addition, the governing regulations allow for eligibility inspections under the various schemes to be combined.  For example, cases selected for inspection under the basic payments scheme can also count towards the inspection requirement under greening, the young farmers scheme, etc., thereby limiting the overall number of such inspections required to be carried out.<\/p> <p>The rate of inspection for cross-compliance is a minimum of 1% of beneficiaries regarding all statutory management requirements, SMRs, and good agricultural conditions, GAC, in terms of standards.  However, 3% of farmers must be inspected under the bovine identification and registration, IDR, requirements and 3% of sheep or goat farmers must be inspected, covering 5% of the flock.<\/p> <p>My Department endeavours to minimise the number of farm visits as much as possible by combining animal IDR inspections with land eligibility inspections where feasible.  Rules regarding the advanced notification of inspections are clearly laid down in the governing EU regulations and must be adhered to by officials of my Department.  The regulations allow the Department to give notice of land eligibility and cross-compliance inspections involving SMRS, other than those relating to food, feed and animal welfare.  However, this notice must be strictly limited to the minimum period necessary and shall not exceed 14 days.  For checks involving cattle and sheep identification and registration, the minimum advance notice is 48 hours.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For SMRs dealing with feed, food and animal welfare, no advance notice may be given and these inspections must take place on an unannounced basis.<\/p><p>Following discussions with the farming organisations, as part of a review of the farmers' charter of rights, it has been agreed that where the purpose of the visit by the inspecting officer is a combined notice and non-notice inspection, this will be clearly explained by the inspecting officer to the farmer.<\/p><p>All no-notice inspections will be conducted separately from all notice inspections unless the farmer requests otherwise, which I think is the issue the Senator is raising.

Farming organisations have signed up to that but the Senator does not seem to be happy with it.  I am not quite sure whose side she is on.  Farming representative bodies are happy with the new farmers' charter.  We are now going to implement that new approach, which is a much more farmer-friendly approach towards inspections.

The focus we need to have now is to ensure that we have a consistent and fair inspection regime, and that we do not go on farms unless we absolutely have to.

If one is concerned about welfare, one must be able to make an unannounced inspection to see the reality of what is happening on a farm.  One cannot give notice for that, so we are required to have a certain amount of unannounced inspections.  To be fair, the Senator is right to raise this issue.  The real problem arose in the past where unannounced inspections turned into announced inspections, because inspectors were on the farm on unannounced inspections they were also looking at other issues in the farmyard.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That really upset farmers who felt they were entitled to receive notice before people came to look at a whole series of things.

That will no longer happen, unless a farmer chooses to say, \"I have nothing to hide.  You can look at what you want.  Let us get it out of the way today.\"  An impression was given by farming organisations that there was pressure on farmers to accept a series of inspections on the back of an unannounced inspection.

I have raised this matter on a number of occasions.  From my file I see that in February 2013, I raised the matter of the two Labour Court recommendations that gratuity payments be made in lieu of pension entitlements to a cohort of home help workers that are funded in the main by the HSE.  In the intervening period, we have had some changes in the health service.  I have continuously corresponded with the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, on this matter.  In February of this year, we got a little bit of light when he informed me following further correspondence to him:<\/p><blockquote>My Department in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE has initiated a review of the matter involving the Department's legal advisers.  It is expected that this will conclude in March 2015.<\/blockquote> <p>That did not happen.  I raised the matter again as a Commencement matter in the Seanad.  I was told that in line with the discussions that were happening around the new pay deal with the public and Civil Service, it was being looked at again and that a conclusion would be reached by September 2015.  I am obviously very anxious that these low-paid workers get what they are entitled to.  In some instances, it will run into a few thousand euro.  It is not an insignificant sum.  I think everyone will agree that home help workers carry out a crucial role on the front line of our health service in caring for our sick, elderly and infirm at home.  I do not think we can allow a situation to persist where what the Labour Court recommended in 2009, one of two recommendations I might add, that they are entitled to these payments, should be withheld any further.<\/p><p>I hope the Minister of State will have some good news for me today.  We were told that this issue would be effectively resolved by September 2015.  It is not a substantial sum of money.  From the calculations my party colleagues and I have done, we are looking at a figure of between &euro;12 million and &euro;15 million countrywide but it might not even be that much.  The recommendation has been made and the workers are entitled to this money.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for her presence and look forward to her response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015100600002#H00300","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1444138200,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Brien for raising this issue which I went through with his colleague, Deputy Billy Kelleher, recently.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Kathleen Lynch:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=656\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=656&amp;amp;pid=KathleenLynch&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The Senator's question on home helps is specific and he has clearly stuck to his question but the issue has a wider context.  I thank him for raising the issue in the House.  He will of course be aware that the issue of paying gratuities to a particular group of home help workers was considered by the parties at the recent public sector talks that were facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission.  The Minister and I believe it is important that we do all we can to ensure that those members of our elderly population who wish to stay in their own homes and communities are supported and facilitated to do so.  Also, I want to ensure that we support in every way we can the return of those who have required acute hospital care back into their homes when they are fit for discharge.<\/p><p>In 2015, the HSE will spend &euro;330 million on home care packages and home help services, including &euro;185 million to provide 10.3 million home help hours.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, these people form an invaluable group in terms of services delivered within the wider community.  Home help services are provided mainly by HSE directly employed staff.  A home help contract introduced for HSE employees in 2014 followed on from a lengthy consultative process under the auspices of both the LRC and the Labour Court.  The annualised contract which was accepted is fundamental to both parties as it matches the actual workforce to the changing needs of the service as well as giving certainty to employees by way of  guaranteed weekly minimum paid hours.  However, in the greater Dublin area, as well as in Wicklow and Clare, home help services are provided by voluntary providers on behalf of the HSE.  It is this group of home help workers that I shall focus on now and I know the Senator has a particular interest in this group.  Voluntary providers are funded under section 39 of the Health Act 2004.  The HSE has in place service level agreements with these providers that sets out the level of home help service to be provided in respect of the grant to the individual organisations and requirements in terms of standards of care.  As the home helps employed by these section 39 organisations are not HSE employees, the HSE has no role in determining the salaries or other terms and conditions applying to these staff, including pension arrangements.  Accordingly, such arrangements offered by individual providers will vary.<\/p><p>Access by home helps, who work in voluntary organisations, to a pension has been the subject of a number of Labour Court recommendations involving SIPTU, IMPACT and the HSE.  Implementation of a Labour Court recommendation on the payment of a gratuity to the home helps employed by the section 39 organisations has been hindered in recent years by the budgetary situation, a situation that I know the Senator will understand.  The matter is further complicated by the fact that the HSE is not the employer and, therefore, has no role to play.<\/p><p>As I noted in my opening comments, this issue was discussed during the recent Lansdowne Road talks in the context of which a side agreement was made.  The parties reached agreement on a process for giving a more formal consideration to the matter and to establish, in the short-term, a working group to examine a number of issues, including gratuity payments for home helps.  This process will now be progressed following the recent ratification of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Initial contacts have taken place between the HSE and the relevant staff associations.  It is expected that the first meeting will take place during this month of October.  The precise time for the duration of the work involved will be agreed at that stage which is likely to be approximately three months.<\/p><p>I want to acknowledge the valuable contribution that home help workers make in our communities and the fundamental role they play in ensuring that our growing elderly population are facilitated as much as possible to live as independently as they can.  I hope that this is the beginning of the process.  I also hope that the Senator's long and considered correspondence with the Department of Health, more than anyone else, will in fact contribute to an outcomes that we can all live with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015100600002#H00400","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444138200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and I appreciate the response.

Would the HSE and the Department allow this to happen if these were highly-paid hospital consultants?  Is it that these are the lowest paid workers within our health service that they are not being given the priority?  I know the Minister of State would have a great deal of sympathy and support for these workers.  All that is happening - I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State as this is the response she has been given by the Department - is that we are being strung along big time.  Every single response, going back to early 2013, referred to timeframes, to an understanding of what I was saying and so on.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, was explicit in the timeframes he gave to me on 9 June and this now kicks it into next year.  God knows where any of us will be at that stage.  I was trying to get it concluded before the end of this D&aacute;il and Seanad term.  I ask the Minister of State to use her good offices to tell the Department officials and the HSE that this is not acceptable.  This is a small number of people who have been earning &euro;8, &euro;9, &euro;10 and &euro;12 per hour, some of whom are due &euro;5,000, &euro;6,000, &euro;7,000 or &euro;8,000 back.  It is a significant amount of money due to them.  They have been incredibly patient up to now.  <\/p><p>I am really disappointed with this response.  I intend to take it up again and will write to the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, asking why he is permitting the Department to continually miss deadlines and set new deadlines which I know will be missed.  I am seeking the Minister of State's assistance to tell them this is not on, because it affects low-paid workers all across the country.  They only asking for what they are entitled to.  I realise there have been budgetary constraints.  We realised that in 2013 when I first raised the issue.  We have been incredibly patient but I will not be patient anymore.  I seek the Minister of State's direct intervention and assistance to put a fire under a couple of people within the Department and get them to sort it out.

I take on board what the Senator is saying.  Depending on the circumstances and the urgency of any issue, and depending on who is involved and who are direct beneficiaries, things move slowly or quickly.

Some of them have paid into their pension scheme for 42 years but they have now been butchered to permit the sale of the Government's stake in Aer Lingus.  The whole thing was a divi-up purely to get rid of the deficit in the pension scheme to sell to IAG.

I understand time can be set aside for Members to pay tribute to great leaders of our nation, of whom Brian Friel was one.  Will the Deputy Leader set time aside to pay tribute to him?  Brian Friel was a Senator in the 18th Seanad between 1987 and 1989, as a Taoiseach's nominee.  He has the record of not having spoken a single word.  For such a prolific writer, he kept his own counsel and never said one word in the Chamber during this period.  Is binn b&eacute;al ina thost.  He was born in Omagh, County Tyrone in 1929.  His working relationship with the Abbey Theatre and other theatres dated back to 1962 when &quot;The Enemy Within&quot; had its world premiere.  Other premieres at the Abbey Theatre included &quot;The Freedom of the City&quot;, &quot;Volunteers&quot;, &quot;Living Quarters&quot;, &quot;Aristocrats&quot;, &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot;, &quot;Wonderful Tennessee&quot;, &quot;Give Me Your Answer, Do!&quot; and, of course, &quot;The Loves of Cass Maguire&quot; and &quot;Faith Healer&quot;.<\/p><p>Brian Friel began his career as a short story writer, but his play, &quot;Philadelphia, Here I Come!&quot;, revolutionised Irish theatre.  Plaudits followed over the course of a long and prolific theatre career in the form of the London <i>Evening Standard <\/i>Award for &quot;Aristocrats&quot; and again for &quot;The Home Place&quot; in 2005, which was staged at the Gate Theatre, a Tony award in 1992 and an Olivier award in 1991 for the massively successful &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot;, as well as a lifetime achievement award from <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  He was also a Saoi in Aosd&aacute;na.  As a co-founder of the Field Day Theatre Company in 1980, he worked with a number of other seminal artists, including Seamus Deane, Stephen Rea and Tom Kilroy, to provide a theatre company for Northern Ireland and particularly for Derry in the middle of the Troubles.  It opened with a premiere of another extraordinary seminal play, &quot;Translations&quot;.  His legacy is a collection of plays which interrogate language, family, religion, history and our concept of what it means to be Irish.  These works will resonate with future generations.<\/p><p>I consider Brian Friel to be one Ireland's greatest nation builders who forensically interrogated and challenged the establishment of the Republic of Ireland.  He understood the power and ambiguity of memory in developing a sense of who we are as a people and a nation.  His work constitutes a living, evolving history of Ireland.  Here was a playwright who was striving to ensure the past never became fossilised and deeply aware that it was not the literal past, the facts of history, that shaped us but images of the past embodied in language such as in &quot;Translations&quot;.  His loss is deeply regretted not only by his family, including his wife, Anne; son, David; daughters, Sally, Mary and Judy, but also his friends and colleagues across all theatres in Ireland, Britain, elsewhere in Europe and the United States, from Broadway to Los Angeles and from Ballybeg, the mythical site of Glenties where all his work was based, to the Abbey Theatre.

This service helps people from the very rich to the very poor.  It does not matter how much money one has.

We now have some breathing space for negotiations that are taking place as we speak.  Some fundamental issues have been raised.  IO Systems first got a three-year contract in 2003.  Pay reductions were introduced in January 2011, which followed a Labour Court finding.  Both sides agreed to this and it was binding.  The most recent contract was signed in September 2013 and following that, further pay cuts were sought by IO Systems.  Talks between IO Systems, the Communication Workers Union and the LRC failed to reach agreement.  IO Systems proceeded anyway and introduced its so-called new pay and roster arrangements which meant a cut in pay for some staff.  As we know, this resulted in strike action on 1 October.<\/p><p>What is interesting and very worrying is that we almost had the complete closure of the entire postal service in the State.  How did that happen?  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy White, told the D&aacute;il last Thursday that An Post had a contingency plan to deal with any dispute.  According to the Communication Workers Union, that contingency plan included closing the entire service.  Was the Minister aware that the contingency plan included closing the service?  Did he give the nod to that?  These questions need to be answered.  If he was not aware of that, it surely raises questions about senior management in An Post failing to give information to the Minister when he made his statement to the D&aacute;il.  Irrespective of those questions that the Minister needs to answer, I hope the negotiations result in agreement on the substantive issues.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to raise those questions with the Minister.

When home in Galway recently, I encountered a person who is caring for somebody with Alzheimer's.  When the discussion about extra care came up, the helpful local health board representative asked the carer \"Would you consider putting him into respite for a week?\"  The carer found this very upsetting because the person in question would not be fit for that and would find it extremely disorienting.  Whereas she realised that the health board official was seeking to be helpful, she felt all the more lonely that her particular situation was not understood.  Cases such as this underline what the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and others are saying when they talk about the need for intensive, dementia-specific care in the community.  In fact, they are talking about funding such provision beyond the eight current pilot sites to all local health office areas, which would cost approximately &euro;320 million.  Of the order of &euro;1.69 billion is currently spent on caring for people with dementia, but most of that is spent on nursing home care when in fact such care should be the last resort.  It is important to have care in the community and that people are assisted in living and being cared for at home.  That requires supports, including people who understand the evolving situation that having dementia or Alzheimer's involves being brought in.  The care on offer should be specific to the condition of the person.  With all the pre-budget and pre-election talk, I hope that care in this important area is something the Government will take seriously.  It should listen to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and provide funding to meet the need that exists in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015100600002#W00600","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1444138200,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I support the request made by Senator Mac Conghail for tributes to and statements about Brian Friel in this House.

Much of the pressure in UHG is due to the closure of the facility at Ballinasloe.  When the facility at Ballinasloe was closed there was a promise that a community service with up to about ten nurses would be put in place to deal with people in the community but that has not been delivered upon.  I ask that the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, come to the House to look specifically at the issues around Galway-Roscommon which are in absolute chaos as nobody appears to be managing the services.  When the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, was trying to contact management at the weekend in respect of UHG, the management which is responsible for putting nurses into the unit was nowhere to be found.  It is disgraceful.  This put lives in jeopardy at the weekend and the position does not appear to be improving, so we need the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to come to the House.  I hope it is only a Galway-Roscommon issue and not a nationwide issue.  Certainly it is at crisis point and needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015100600002#Y00100","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1444138200,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Senator Darragh O'Brien has opposed motion No. 1, re Aer Lingus, being referred to the committee.

It was a dreadful incident in which so many people were killed.  There is definitely a need for an inquiry in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett congratulated William Campbell, the Nobel Prize winner.  I am sure we all wish to compliment Professor Campbell on his wonderful award.  The Senator also noted the trans-Pacific trade agreement and the issues involved in that regard.  Perhaps we will have time at a later date to discuss the matter, especially in regard to the European and US trade agreement, which has been mooted also.<\/p><p>Senators Mac Conghail and Jim D'Arcy mentioned the sad passing of Brian Friel.  The Senators paid fitting tributes to a man who was certainly a giant of theatre and a wonderful playwright.

It is customary to pay tribute to former Senators at a later stage and we will try to arrange for same.<\/p><p>Senator Brennan welcomed the new biometric passport that has been announced.  He also complimented the Naval Service on its work in the Mediterranean.  Senator Mooney notified the House about the four Israeli children that were murdered and he outlined the need for a two-state solution in the Middle East.  Certainly, both Senator Mooney and all Members of the House condemn all violence on all sides in this dispute.<\/p><p>Senator Moloney complimented the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, on his work in his Department.  She also made a point about the closure of a women's refuge.  Perhaps she might table the issue as a Commencement matter.  Senator Norris referred to the arrest of a 12-year old child for the murder of an eight-year old child in the US.  He again outlined the futility of the gun laws which exist in the United States of America.  It is incomprehensible to people in other countries that such laws should exist. <\/p><p>Senators Mullins and Walsh mentioned Ibrahim Halawa and the ninth postponement of his trial.  They agree that this is an appalling position for an Irish citizen to find himself in.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is doing everything possible to secure the release of Ibrahim Halawa.  Let us hope he will be released sooner rather than later and that he can be returned to his family.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane welcomed the suspension of strike action which brought postal services to a standstill in recent days.  He also wished the negotiations well.  I am sure  the Minister is on top of his brief in this regard.  Senator Kelly rejected the amalgamation of electoral areas in Roscommon and Westmeath.  I am sure we will have an opportunity to discuss the matter when there is legislation in that regard.  Senator Walsh mentioned NAMA, which has been debated extensively in committee.  I do not think this House should duplicate the efforts of the committee.  The Senator also chose a number of issues on which he hopes that the next election will be fought on.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maurice Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2003\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2003&amp;amp;pid=MauriceCummins&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Moran talked about promoting Positive Mental Health Week, which is laudable as it is a very important subject.  She also welcomed the employment strategy for people with disabilities, which was announced last week.  In respect of her question about Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, perhaps she could put the matter down for a Commencement debate.  It could then be discussed and she could get the relevant information from the Minister.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen spoke about Alzheimer's disease and dementia.  I agree with the Senator that care in the home is the most important thing we have in this area and I note his points.  Senator D'Arcy paid tribute to Brian Friel on his work and Senator Craughwell wondered why the National Monuments Service did not intervene in regard to the archaeological site in the midlands.  Perhaps he could also put down the matter for a Commencement debate so that he could ask the Minister himself.<\/p><p>Senator Higgins said a driving disqualification should be mandatory for a burglar who uses a car and called for more effective laws in this regard.  The Minister has indicated that she will be bringing a burglaries Bill before both Houses in early course.  I am sure those points can be made at that time.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the plight of psychiatric nurses and services in Galway-Roscommon.
