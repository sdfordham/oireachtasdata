Tusla seems to have written directly to the person on 12 January and the individual who wrote to us has reverted to the committee with further queries.  We will ask Tusla for a response in so far as it can give it, as it relates in part to individual staff members.<\/p><p>The next item is No. 1042 received<b><\/b>from Deputy Catherine Murphy in relation to the funding model for local authorities and population changes.

It refers to the allocation of funding to local government, as it relates formally to the local government fund.  The information was gathered around 2000 based on what was known as the needs and resources model.  It counted what was there historically and the benchmark was that no local authority was to lose out.<\/p> <p>  There was no future-proofing of the model and no counting of population.  There have been several censuses of population since then.  The baselines which were set originally around 2000 or 2001 are not very different from what is used now.  There would have been changes relating to Irish Water and the associated transfer of staff, resources and liabilities and there was a change last year related to how pensions were calculated, but otherwise the baselines have not changed.<\/p><p>I have examined a number of comparators between counties that are growing rapidly and some that are not growing as quickly.  In all cases where there has been a population increase, I have tried to match them with counties of comparable sizes.  For example, Mayo has a baseline of &euro;17 million whereas Wicklow has a baseline of &euro;6 million.  If one considers how the local property tax, LPT, is impacted by the baseline, one will see that Mayo receives a sizable transfer of funds whereas Wicklow contributes to the LPT fund.  In terms of gross expenditure by counties that are not dissimilar, however, Mayo actually has a great deal more money to spend.<\/p><p> Other pairs show the same trends.  Where Limerick City and County Council is concerned, the city has a decent commercial rates base.  Fingal has the lowest baseline in the country, but it has been the most rapidly growing area.  Parts of Fingal did not even exist when the resourcing model was established.<\/p><p> The baseline is influencing how much of the money that must be spent is self-funded, effectively replacing the grants that would otherwise have been paid from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The baselines need to be amended and account must be taken of population changes in any calculation if there is to be a fair allocation and value for money around the country.<\/p><p> I wrote to determine whether the committee would consider this matter.  What is being examined at the moment is exclusively a revaluation of LPT.  Projecting that revaluation forward, the areas with stronger population growth will recover better and, due to the baselines, far more authorities will fall into the self-funded category and will have less discretion with the overall take.  The LPT will be undermined by the baselines.<\/p><p> I wrote because I was unsure as to whether this matter fell within our remit, but it is problematic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#A00400","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Before Deputy Connolly speaks, we have scheduled a meeting on the chapter on central government funding for local authorities for 8 March, which seems germane to this topic.

We have three reports before us today, the first of which is the accounts of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board for 2016.  This is a small operation with a clear audited opinion.  The other report is the 2015-2016 accounts for Mary Immaculate College in Limerick, which have a clear audited opinion and attention is drawn to recognition of the deferred pension funding and a standard for all universities and colleges.<\/p> <p>  The committee has received the financial statement for 2016 from the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  This organisation maintains the register of tenancies and provides dispute resolution services for tenants and landlords.  The turnover of the organisation is &euro;10.2 million.  It is clear audited report but the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to &euro;2.1 million of legal fees where the relevant services had not been procured by way of competitive processes since 2011.  Before I came to the committee today I had a quick look at the accounts for the RTB.  The expenditure of the year 2016 was &euro;10.3 million and the single biggest cost was legal and professional fees of &euro;2.147 million.  The salary costs were only &euro;1.5 million.  That an organisation can spend 20% of its total income in one heading without going to a competitive tender, for the last seven years, is utterly unacceptable.  The committee will write to the RTB for a detailed note.  We will ask for a detailed note, company by company, to provide the total payments that were made in the financial statements of 2016, legal firm by legal firm as the case may be, or the other professional advisers.  I am sure we could include valuers also.  We will ask why there was not a competitive tendering process in recent times.  When we get this information, the committee will scrutinise it further.  The scale of this non-procurement relative to the size of the organisation is extraordinary. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#C03300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Is that organisation duty-bound to put that work out for procurement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#C03400","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Yes, it is subject to Government procurement rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#C03500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Is it not living by the standards?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#C03600","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Maybe the Comptroller and Auditor General would like to comment on this.

The National Shared Services Office was set up in 2014 as an administrative office within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  From the beginning of this year, 2018, it has been a stand-alone office with its own Accounting Officer.  It is responsible for delivering suitable business services on a shared basis, mainly for other central Government Departments and offices.<br\/><br\/>The shared services office currently provides two main services: PeoplePoint,<b><\/b>which provides a human resources and pensions administration service; and the Payroll Shared Service Centre,<b><\/b>which provides a payroll and pension payment service.<\/p><p>A shared services financial management system is in development.  At the end of 2016, 39 departments had transferred HR functions to PeoplePoint and 43 had transferred their payroll functions to the Payroll Shared Services Centre, PSCC.<\/p><p> The 2016 appropriation account for the Vote for shared services records gross expenditure totalling &euro;36.4 million.  There was an underspend in the year of &euro;7.35 million.  That was 17% relative to the gross estimate.  This was primarily due to delays in planned transfers of staff from departmental payroll centres to PSSC, and delays in staff recruitment.  There has been a change in the presentation of the Vote for 2016.  In previous years, each of the main shared services was reported on as a separate expenditure programme.  For 2016, only a global programme is presented.  Pay costs totalling &euro;21.1 million accounted for 58% of the expenditure.<\/p><p> Turning to the chapter on the management of salary overpayments, acting as the agent for the bodies it serves, the shared services office processed payments of &euro;3.2 billion relating to 102,400 employees in 2016.  This involved running 2,438 weekly, 1,482 fortnightly and 192 monthly payment runs.  It should be noted that the payments made for the bodies concerned are charged back to the relevant appropriation account or financial statements of the bodies concerned, and are not a charge on the Vote for shared services.  During the audits of appropriation accounts for 2015, we noted a general increase in the level of salary overpayments being reported.  I decided to examine the matter across the board for 2016, focusing on how the shared services office managed and recovered salary overpayments.  The examination found that the office notified its client departments that overpayments totalling &euro;4.6 million were outstanding at the end of 2016.<\/p><p> In any large and complex payroll system, it is likely that some salary overpayments will occur, usually because it is necessary to process the payroll to meet pay day commitments before all information that might require a salary adjustment is available.  The examination found that late notification was the cause of the overpayment in the majority of cases reviewed.  In a sample examined, this mainly occurred because the PSSC were only notified weeks, and, in some cases, months, after an employee should have been put on a zero rate or a reduced rate of pay, for example, due to extended sick leave.  There can be late notification by the relevant employer department to PeoplePoint, and-or by PeoplePoint to PSSC.  Like any debt, it is important that salary overpayments are managed effectively, and repayment arrangements put in place promptly.  In figure 10.2, the chapter presents an overview of a framework for the effective management of overpayments.  The examination found scope for improvement in each aspect of this framework.<\/p><p> We found that, at the end of 2016, there were almost 650 identified overpayment cases where the amount of the overpayment had not yet been recorded.  The overpayment had arisen more than six months previously in a quarter of these cases.  Delays in identifying the value means the recovery process cannot begin, which may ultimately make it more difficult to recover the overpayment.  We also identified two ways in which overpayments arose, but which were not being correctly captured by shared services.<\/p><p> Even in cases where the overpayment amount had been calculated, there was evidence of delays in commencing recovery action.  At end 2016, there were more than 380 cases with an overpayment value of &euro;1.1 million outstanding for more than a year, with no recovery plan in place.  Based on the examination of a sample of cases, the average time taken to issue the first letter requesting repayment was 13 weeks.  We also found there was a lack of clarity between the NSSO and the departments being served around the division of responsibility for management of identified overpayment cases.<\/p><p> Recovery of overpayments is often by means of regular deduction from future pay.  There is no system in place to identify cases where deductions have ceased but the full amount of the overpayment has not yet been recovered.  The examination identified overpayments to four individuals where this had happened.<\/p><p> Overall, it was found that the systems in place did not provide the necessary information to allow for the effective management of overpayments.  It was not possible to readily generate an aged analysis of overpayments or to quantify the level of recovery.  Extensive manual intervention was required to calculate the amount outstanding at year end and the examination identified a number of errors in this calculation.  In addition, the reported year end figure did not include all overpayments, mainly due to a lack of clarity between the NSSO and client departments as to the respective responsibilities for particular types of cases.  The chapter makes a number of recommendations to improve systems and recovery processes, and to clarify responsibilities.  I am glad that the Accounting Officer accepted all of the recommendations, and will provide an update on their implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Paula Lyons, assistant secretary and head of employee shared services; Ms Joan Curry, principal officer and head of corporate services; and Ms Lisa Hennessy from the NSSO corporate office.  I thank the committee also for the opportunity to make an opening statement.  As we have provided the committee with briefing material, I will endeavour to provide a relevant overview in my statement to make best use of the committee&rsquo;s time.<\/p> <p>  The matters being examined are chapter 10 of the Comptroller and Auditor General report 2016; which is titled Shared Services &ndash; Management of Salary Overpayments, and the Appropriation Account 2016, Vote 18, which is the Vote for the NSSO.  Before I give an outline of these matters, and as this is my first appearance before the committee as the Accounting Officer for the NSSO, I would like to set out the background of the office and the progress we have made in delivering our objectives in recent years.<\/p> <p>  The NSSO is a statutory office, established under the National Shared Services Office Act 2017, on 1 January 2018, when it became a separate Civil Service office, under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The NSSO is contributing to the modernisation of corporate administration and professionalisation of these functions across the civil and public service.  The office is responsible for shared services provision across the entire Civil Service . This allows Departments and offices to focus on their core purpose of effective front-line service delivery.  While each sector in the public service has responsibility for implementing shared services, the NSSO supports the progression of the strategy across the public service by providing advice and guidance on best practice, creating professional communities for learning about shared services standards, policy development and research.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman will be familiar with MyPay in County Laois, which administers payroll for 28 local authorities and pensions for 15 local authorities, and HAP in Limerick, a housing assistance payment scheme.  A new multifunctional shared services centre for higher education is being established in Dublin.  Athlone has an administration centre for schools, and SUSI's data centre in Cork and its operation in Dublin administers the grant payment shared service for students.  The HBS is the provider of multiple shared services to the HSE and it has plans to consolidate administration further.<\/p> <p>  The NSSO has two shared services operations in four locations - Clonskeagh, Tullamore, Killarney and Galway - which comprise HR shared services, providing HR and pensions administration services to 34,500 civil and public servants, and payroll shared services, administering payroll, travel and expense, and pension payments to 124,500 civil and public servants.  A project is well under way to develop the shared services model for financial management and this will go live in mid-2018.  As articulated by Secretary General, Mr. Robert Watt, during previous sessions with the committee, the Government must invest to deliver cost and efficiency benefits, and shared services is an intrinsic part of that transformation of strategy.<\/p><p>Since 2012, the Government has invested &euro;32.3 million capital funding in technology, facilities and consulting costs for HR and payroll shared services.  While this is still at an early stage of maturity, the savings estimated for HR and payroll shared services to date are &euro;21 million and it is expected to deliver &euro;13 million annually, as these centres are fully established.<\/p><p> In addition to cost savings and improved effectiveness arising from standardised processes across the Civil Service, other benefits include the following.  Payroll shared services has replaced 18 payroll offices around the country that had different licensing and versions of payroll systems with one shared service centre on a single technology platform administering payroll, pensions, and travel and expenses one way across Government.  In 2016, payroll shared services made 2.7 million payments to the value of &euro;3.24 billion.  This increased to &euro;4.7 billion in 2017 and will increase further in 2018 now that all in-scope public service bodies have transitioned their payroll and expenses to the NSSO.  HR shared services responded to 77,466 calls and closed 215,268 cases in 2016.  In 2017, this increased to 86,028 calls and 231,289 closed cases.  This level of service delivery was acknowledged with the awarding of the CCMA 2015 Shared Services Award to PeoplePoint while the Civil Service Innovation Award went to the PSSC in the same year.<\/p><p> A further &euro;42.7 million is the estimated capital investment required to establish finance shared services.  The development of a new finance technology solution for Government is well under way.  A single finance technology platform will replace 31 financial management and reporting systems across Government Departments and offices and facilitate transaction processing in the new finance shared services operation in the NSSO.  When fully established, finance shared services will deliver a sustainable reduction in the annual cost of Government financial management of approximately &euro;15.4 million annually from 2021 through a reduction in the cost of support for finance technology, and a reduction in the resources required to provide financial management processing.<\/p><p> Since 2014, the NSSO has delivered many benefits for the Civil Service.  These include the introduction of one set of standard HR and pension processes, applied consistently, based on common HR policies.  These standard processes are eliminating local interpretation and thereby increasing fairness for employees.  Civil servants can access HR and pension services through a much wider range of channels, including the first online system, giving them easier and faster access to important information on entitlements and services.  For example, the HR portal receives over 300,000 visits per month.  HR data analytics are more readily available to management on a Civil Service-wide basis.  The first online system for public service travel and expenses claims was introduced, with payments processed within a week.  Online payslips are provided to all payees and there is immediate access to payroll information, including downloadable P60 forms.  This is a significant change to the hard-copy payslips and paper-based receipts of the past.<\/p><p> Insights gained through shared services informed the development of Government policies, such as absence, leave and the recoupment of overpayments.  Improved technology has resulted in automation in several areas, including the updating of personal information, for example annual leave, removing the need for repeated manual entry on the HR system.  Almost 1.5 million annual leave updates have been recorded in four years and further automation is on the way.  A single definitive source of information can be utilised for many purposes that can help the Government with the implementation of strategic changes and the development of data driven, evidence-based policy formulation.  Shared services continues to have a positive impact by creating dedicated specialist teams whose focus is solely on service quality through process improvement, technology and digitisation.  Our team is building expertise and competencies in complex large-scale transformation programme management, service and quality management, lean thinking and digital and technology innovation.<\/p><p> As with any organisation on this scale and at such an early stage of maturity, progress has not been without its issues.  It is reasonable to expect that challenges and corrections are needed as part of the set-up and stabilisation period.  As with other shared service organisations in the public and private sectors, this has also been the case for the NSSO.  We have encountered and solved a number of issues and learned some lessons.<\/p><p> I turn now to address the Comptroller and Auditor General Report 2016, Chapter 10 - Shared Services &ndash; Management of Salary Overpayments.  I start by thanking the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for its valuable assistance in preparing this report to deal with complex issues, which I will now articulate as follows.  The committee should note that the Comptroller and Auditor General report accepted the inevitability of salary overpayments, given the scale and complexity of the payments involved and it acknowledged that there are many causes for overpayments.  I stress that the NSSO is very aware of its responsibility for the stewardship of public moneys.  When any overpayment occurs, the NSSO pursues the recovery of those moneys as soon as possible in a standard way for all staff.  In the response to the Comptroller and Auditor General report, it was noted that the value of overpayments in 2016 represents just 0.3% of the pay bill, confirming that 99.7% of the pay bill is being administered effectively.  I also welcome that the Comptroller and Auditor General noted in his report that the audits of those bodies did not find any material errors in the payroll charges.  Of course we would like to eliminate all overpayments, but we do not operate in a perfect world where every pay impact is notified in time to administer prior to the payroll run.  Adjustments to salaries are always needed, be it public or private sector.  An overpayment occurs when a staff member is paid more than his or her entitlement.  Overpayments to staff of salary, allowances and expenses can and do occur because of late notification, after the payroll closed and the file has issued to the bank for payment.<\/p><p> I confirm that the NSSO agreed to all the recommendations in the report from the Comptroller and Auditor General on the overpayment of salaries to civil and public servants and has commenced implementation of actions required.  As well as accepting all recommendations in the report, we outlined that a number of actions would be taken.  Since the last quarter of 2017, a monthly report on overpayments issues to each finance officer.  This shows the current balance outstanding on plans in recoupment, the value collected on all plans \"year to date\", and the list of all active overpayment cases.  This provides the finance officer with all the information required.  The decision for off pay cases remains with each Accounting Officer.  Responsibility for legacy cases is being progressed and a statement on responsibility will be inserted into the service management agreement for 2018.  In the Comptroller and Auditor General report it was noted that there was a delay in recovering overpayments.  I confirm to the committee that just over &euro;2 million was collected in 2016 and the estimate for 2017 is higher.  A revision to the recoupment circular in May 2017 allows for recovery of the full value of an overpayment within a month in circumstances where a staff member has been overpaid for a period of five days or less.  This has resulted in a reduction in the time taken to process overpayments.<\/p><p> The reform of sick leave in the public service, while creating significant savings and standardisation of administration and elimination of legacy issues, has meant that staff are reaching sick leave thresholds earlier which increases the risk of a pay adjustment not being notified in a timely manner.  Shared services is reliant on employees and managers notifying sick leave on the first day of occurrence.  Late or delayed notification results in overpayments.  Regular communications were issued by the NSSO to Civil Service staff to notify them of their obligations and an intensified information campaign is also planned for 2018 with local HR.  Following a comprehensive analysis of the root cause of overpayments in 2017, a review of pay impact processes in the NSSO including greater automation is under way.  This will help to reduce and eliminate any delays in the NSSO.<\/p><p>Furthermore, internal organisation changes are planned for the end of the second quarter of 2018 to centralise the calculation of overpayment values, in order to shorten the time taken to agree the recoupment plan and start to recover the money.  Consequently, I believe the NSSO will reduce the number and value of overpayments further in 2018.<\/p><p> On the appropriation account published in 2017, I welcome the clear audit opinion given by the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of Vote 18 for shared services, which is subject to review today.  Since the NSSO was established on an administrative basis in 2014, I have worked to ensure that the NSSO operates effectively and efficiently and that the use of public resources is scrutinised and optimised to ensure best value for money for the Exchequer.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding that, there is an issue with under-expenditure in the Vote.  The reasons relate mainly to the ongoing project work we are delivering.  These projects are very significant.  The NSSO is leading a very significant transformation programme across Government.  There is a balance between maintaining the project pace within an acceptable level of risk while ensuring delivery and value for money.  Our best attempt to forecast may require adjustment if a risk arises.  In 2016, the underspend was declared and surrendered to the Exchequer in a timely manner.  We are aware that, for 2016, there was a significant underspend as set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  As an office, we are very conscious of ensuring we set realistic forecasts and adjust as soon as possible on an ongoing basis, consistent with public financial procedures.<\/p><p> Shared services contribute to the modernisation of the civil and public service.  They create capacity to build a clear strategy for HR, payroll and finance and improve the capability and professional skills of our staff.  By operating a single standard way of working, the NSSO is able to contribute strategically and respond quickly to new and emerging requirements such as when a new Government Department is created.  Shared services are about standard processes supported by self-service technology.  It is a balancing act, investing to reduce costs and demonstrating efficiencies and improvements while at the same time changing responsibilities and accountabilities.  While making these changes, issues such as overpayments are amplified by the centralisation of data and the transparency that shared services bring to such matters.<\/p><p> Before I conclude, I acknowledge and thank my staff who have really got behind this major change programme and worked hard and long hours to deliver it.  Without their dedication and focus, the NSSO could not have achieved these milestones reached so far.  I also thank past members of the shared services steering board and programme boards for providing their support and time to assist the delivery of this ambitious programme of change.  I am confident that further improvements currently underway will result in a positive impact on managing overpayments more effectively.  I will answer any question the Chairman or members of the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Hilary Murphy-Fagan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Murphy-Fagan for that opening statement.

One of the biggest lessons was the impact of the change and the requirement to support the change management in each public service bodies, PSBs, and to support users with the system.  While we have communicated and developed communication materials that were disseminated in various PSBs, we have learned that we need to do even more of that in the future.  We have taken that lesson as it relates to financial management shared services and really increased the level of engagement, communication and awareness for financial management.  That has been a big lesson because there is an impact on the end user when one moves to a shared services model, particularly with the difference in responsibilities and accountabilities because they change when one moves to a shared services model.<\/p> <p>  The second lesson is that we have robust business cases in every case.  That was a requirement for the Government to make a decision to implement this change.  We did not start the benefits management and tracking as early as we could have.  We now track our benefits which I was able to insert into my opening statement.  When it comes to financial management, we will have a benefits statement which will be signed and agreed with each Accounting Officer before we start the transition to the final shared services.  We will make sure that we monitor that.  A last point, despite the best attempts, efforts and experience of my staff and the competencies and capabilities they have gained in the past year, is that with any large-scale transformation programme, while there are significant benefits, there are also risks.  We have to consider how we manage those risks and look for certain risks that maybe, with the wisdom of hindsight, we could have dealt with sooner.  We will certainly look at that in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Hilary Murphy-Fagan"},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Ms Murphy-Fagan has led me to my next question.

I will outline them to the witness and she can respond because, obviously, we must have both sides of the equation.  They had difficulty explaining a number of issues for many of the people the office serves.  There were issues relating to overpayments, delays and mistakes with pension payments, which had not happened previously, delays of two to three months with the payment of increments, which had not happened previously, delays with leave applications, particularly applications for parental leave for some reason, and mistakes and misunderstandings regarding starting pay when people get promoted or moved.  A specific issue raised with me, which is quite unique, relates to the early shutdown of payroll before Christmas, which meant some people on lower wages did not get the overtime payments they were depending on for Christmas.  Another relates to delays in issuing P60s.  The Chairman asked about that earlier, probably for the same reason.  Does the witness wish to comment on those issues?

It is our reputation and we are constantly striving to improve it.  We have a very strong governance process.  We have a customer services group which has representation from HR managers and finance officers from the various Departments we service.  My colleague, Ms Lyons, is on that customer services group and it is chaired by the chief human resources officer for the Civil Service because shared services are part of that HR strategy.  The group meets monthly to look at what the top issues are.  Service management meetings are held very regularly to examine what issues are arising for staff or management, to understand the root cause of those issues and to see how we can improve those.  We keep a log or record of everything.  We look at what issues we are able to resolve and close and what issues remain open.  It is really quite a robust system around service management.

Given the number of people the office is dealing with, we are bound to get information from them.  When one centralises a system such as this, particularly with regard to HR, it is a system and process where one must follow rules and logic.  I am a former IT manager so I understand the process by which it all must work.  I had to centralise systems in my time.  When one is dealing with HR issues and financial payments, particularly HR issues, there seems to be an almost impersonal element to it that needs to be flagged or dealt with in some way from one occasion to the next.  I suggest that some pathway is created whereby individuals who have a personal or a once or twice in a work career issue, instead of just being identified as a case number, have a way in which the issue can be pushed up the line and processed relatively quickly through the HR functions and the organisations.  I have heard that cases involving an exceptional issue are not being dealt with quickly enough.  The witness might accept my suggestion.  Trust me, I am hearing that from the people to whom I have been talking.<\/p> <p>  I have a final couple of questions.  One of them is somewhat out of left field.  Obviously, there are capital outlays relating to where the office is going in respect of the financial management of bodies.  Financial management is going to be the third leg of the organisation.  Personally, I believe the office should consolidate what it is doing first.<\/p><p>Moving into that space is probably the right thing to do.  I have rolled out massive large-scale projects in a previous life.  The NSSO needs to bed down and then move on again.<\/p><p> As regards underspend, it would be preferable for an organisation such as the NSSO not to have an underspend, given the scale of its operations, because it will be fighting for money for the financial management leg of its work.  Why was there a significant underspend?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#K02500","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517475600,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Kelly that it would be preferable for us not to have an underspend, which was due to two key factors.  The first is that a plan for the transition migration of a payroll into my office is only a plan and, as we get deeper into the preparation and level of readiness for transfer, things may arise such that we have to change the sequencing of Departments.  A Department may have to come ahead of one that was in the original plan, and that is always open to change, or things may have to be slowed down to ensure we manage any risks we identify.  A delay of transition or migration creates an underspend on our vote because we do not recruit the staff we intended to or transfer staff to our office who were doing that work previously, for example.  However, the corollary is that where we have an underspend, that pay bill spend is on the corresponding Vote and, therefore, is neutral overall but it shows up in my Vote if we have a delay.<\/p> <p>  On the capital expenditure side, the underspend is primarily due to the very large finance shared services programme.  Approximately 50% of the capital cost has already been spent for that programme but there have been delays.  Having followed due process in respect of procurement, there was an initial delay in finalising the contract with the provider or system integrator, which delay had a knock-on effect in respect of our Estimate for the following year, which had already been created.  It is not a matter of an overall overspend but rather is more of a timing issue because we will actually spend-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Hilary Murphy-Fagan"},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Underspend.

As we expanded the service offering to new Departments, the number of staff working in shared services increased.  Shared services is a specialism that requires clear accountability for all the people who receive the services and the Departments that are served.  It also requires clear funding arrangements, a very strong customer focus and a continuous improvement focus on operations and technology.  I suppose that is different from the business of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is primarily a policy Department.  The NSSO is more than twice the size of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

Now we have all the payrolls within the shared service so we have a better view end to end.  We would, therefore, be able to see where a recoupment stopped and why, and to follow it up fairly quickly.  The situation in 2016 certainly presented more challenge in trying to manage it as an end to end process.  The full migration of payrolls will improve that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#S01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Paula Lyons"},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I asked too many questions together and I apologise.

Given that the office will be getting its Estimate of expenditure approved for 2018 any day now, I expect that, in calculating that figure, the NSSO should be able to estimate what it believes the figure for outstanding payments will be at the end of 2018.  I am now moving on much further.  If one is coming in to get the group of Votes for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform next month, this month or on another occasion, it is logical to be asked about this.  I refer to where one is looking for the Estimate figure for the office for the coming year - the Estimate for its Vote.  A level of overpayments will be in place for last year and one will have to know, in one's working papers, the estimated figure for 2018.  That is relevant to the Vote the office requires.  Therefore, I presume it will be possible for the office to give us some estimate.  I stress that it will be an estimate.  Ms Murphy-Fagan spoke about planning.
