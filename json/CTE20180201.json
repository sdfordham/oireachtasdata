Tusla seems to have written directly to the person on 12 January and the individual who wrote to us has reverted to the committee with further queries.  We will ask Tusla for a response in so far as it can give it, as it relates in part to individual staff members.<\/p><p>The next item is No. 1042 received<b><\/b>from Deputy Catherine Murphy in relation to the funding model for local authorities and population changes.

It refers to the allocation of funding to local government, as it relates formally to the local government fund.  The information was gathered around 2000 based on what was known as the needs and resources model.  It counted what was there historically and the benchmark was that no local authority was to lose out.<\/p> <p>  There was no future-proofing of the model and no counting of population.  There have been several censuses of population since then.  The baselines which were set originally around 2000 or 2001 are not very different from what is used now.  There would have been changes relating to Irish Water and the associated transfer of staff, resources and liabilities and there was a change last year related to how pensions were calculated, but otherwise the baselines have not changed.<\/p><p>I have examined a number of comparators between counties that are growing rapidly and some that are not growing as quickly.  In all cases where there has been a population increase, I have tried to match them with counties of comparable sizes.  For example, Mayo has a baseline of &euro;17 million whereas Wicklow has a baseline of &euro;6 million.  If one considers how the local property tax, LPT, is impacted by the baseline, one will see that Mayo receives a sizable transfer of funds whereas Wicklow contributes to the LPT fund.  In terms of gross expenditure by counties that are not dissimilar, however, Mayo actually has a great deal more money to spend.<\/p><p> Other pairs show the same trends.  Where Limerick City and County Council is concerned, the city has a decent commercial rates base.  Fingal has the lowest baseline in the country, but it has been the most rapidly growing area.  Parts of Fingal did not even exist when the resourcing model was established.<\/p><p> The baseline is influencing how much of the money that must be spent is self-funded, effectively replacing the grants that would otherwise have been paid from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The baselines need to be amended and account must be taken of population changes in any calculation if there is to be a fair allocation and value for money around the country.<\/p><p> I wrote to determine whether the committee would consider this matter.  What is being examined at the moment is exclusively a revaluation of LPT.  Projecting that revaluation forward, the areas with stronger population growth will recover better and, due to the baselines, far more authorities will fall into the self-funded category and will have less discretion with the overall take.  The LPT will be undermined by the baselines.<\/p><p> I wrote because I was unsure as to whether this matter fell within our remit, but it is problematic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#A00400","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Before Deputy Connolly speaks, we have scheduled a meeting on the chapter on central government funding for local authorities for 8 March, which seems germane to this topic.

We have three reports before us today, the first of which is the accounts of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board for 2016.  This is a small operation with a clear audited opinion.  The other report is the 2015-2016 accounts for Mary Immaculate College in Limerick, which have a clear audited opinion and attention is drawn to recognition of the deferred pension funding and a standard for all universities and colleges.<\/p> <p>  The committee has received the financial statement for 2016 from the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  This organisation maintains the register of tenancies and provides dispute resolution services for tenants and landlords.  The turnover of the organisation is &euro;10.2 million.  It is clear audited report but the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to &euro;2.1 million of legal fees where the relevant services had not been procured by way of competitive processes since 2011.  Before I came to the committee today I had a quick look at the accounts for the RTB.  The expenditure of the year 2016 was &euro;10.3 million and the single biggest cost was legal and professional fees of &euro;2.147 million.  The salary costs were only &euro;1.5 million.  That an organisation can spend 20% of its total income in one heading without going to a competitive tender, for the last seven years, is utterly unacceptable.  The committee will write to the RTB for a detailed note.  We will ask for a detailed note, company by company, to provide the total payments that were made in the financial statements of 2016, legal firm by legal firm as the case may be, or the other professional advisers.  I am sure we could include valuers also.  We will ask why there was not a competitive tendering process in recent times.  When we get this information, the committee will scrutinise it further.  The scale of this non-procurement relative to the size of the organisation is extraordinary. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#C03300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Is that organisation duty-bound to put that work out for procurement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#C03400","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Yes, it is subject to Government procurement rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#C03500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Is it not living by the standards?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#C03600","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Maybe the Comptroller and Auditor General would like to comment on this.

The National Shared Services Office was set up in 2014 as an administrative office within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  From the beginning of this year, 2018, it has been a stand-alone office with its own Accounting Officer.  It is responsible for delivering suitable business services on a shared basis, mainly for other central Government Departments and offices.<br\/><br\/>The shared services office currently provides two main services: PeoplePoint,<b><\/b>which provides a human resources and pensions administration service; and the Payroll Shared Service Centre,<b><\/b>which provides a payroll and pension payment service.<\/p><p>A shared services financial management system is in development.  At the end of 2016, 39 departments had transferred HR functions to PeoplePoint and 43 had transferred their payroll functions to the Payroll Shared Services Centre, PSCC.<\/p><p> The 2016 appropriation account for the Vote for shared services records gross expenditure totalling &euro;36.4 million.  There was an underspend in the year of &euro;7.35 million.  That was 17% relative to the gross estimate.  This was primarily due to delays in planned transfers of staff from departmental payroll centres to PSSC, and delays in staff recruitment.  There has been a change in the presentation of the Vote for 2016.  In previous years, each of the main shared services was reported on as a separate expenditure programme.  For 2016, only a global programme is presented.  Pay costs totalling &euro;21.1 million accounted for 58% of the expenditure.<\/p><p> Turning to the chapter on the management of salary overpayments, acting as the agent for the bodies it serves, the shared services office processed payments of &euro;3.2 billion relating to 102,400 employees in 2016.  This involved running 2,438 weekly, 1,482 fortnightly and 192 monthly payment runs.  It should be noted that the payments made for the bodies concerned are charged back to the relevant appropriation account or financial statements of the bodies concerned, and are not a charge on the Vote for shared services.  During the audits of appropriation accounts for 2015, we noted a general increase in the level of salary overpayments being reported.  I decided to examine the matter across the board for 2016, focusing on how the shared services office managed and recovered salary overpayments.  The examination found that the office notified its client departments that overpayments totalling &euro;4.6 million were outstanding at the end of 2016.<\/p><p> In any large and complex payroll system, it is likely that some salary overpayments will occur, usually because it is necessary to process the payroll to meet pay day commitments before all information that might require a salary adjustment is available.  The examination found that late notification was the cause of the overpayment in the majority of cases reviewed.  In a sample examined, this mainly occurred because the PSSC were only notified weeks, and, in some cases, months, after an employee should have been put on a zero rate or a reduced rate of pay, for example, due to extended sick leave.  There can be late notification by the relevant employer department to PeoplePoint, and-or by PeoplePoint to PSSC.  Like any debt, it is important that salary overpayments are managed effectively, and repayment arrangements put in place promptly.  In figure 10.2, the chapter presents an overview of a framework for the effective management of overpayments.  The examination found scope for improvement in each aspect of this framework.<\/p><p> We found that, at the end of 2016, there were almost 650 identified overpayment cases where the amount of the overpayment had not yet been recorded.  The overpayment had arisen more than six months previously in a quarter of these cases.  Delays in identifying the value means the recovery process cannot begin, which may ultimately make it more difficult to recover the overpayment.  We also identified two ways in which overpayments arose, but which were not being correctly captured by shared services.<\/p><p> Even in cases where the overpayment amount had been calculated, there was evidence of delays in commencing recovery action.  At end 2016, there were more than 380 cases with an overpayment value of &euro;1.1 million outstanding for more than a year, with no recovery plan in place.  Based on the examination of a sample of cases, the average time taken to issue the first letter requesting repayment was 13 weeks.  We also found there was a lack of clarity between the NSSO and the departments being served around the division of responsibility for management of identified overpayment cases.<\/p><p> Recovery of overpayments is often by means of regular deduction from future pay.  There is no system in place to identify cases where deductions have ceased but the full amount of the overpayment has not yet been recovered.  The examination identified overpayments to four individuals where this had happened.<\/p><p> Overall, it was found that the systems in place did not provide the necessary information to allow for the effective management of overpayments.  It was not possible to readily generate an aged analysis of overpayments or to quantify the level of recovery.  Extensive manual intervention was required to calculate the amount outstanding at year end and the examination identified a number of errors in this calculation.  In addition, the reported year end figure did not include all overpayments, mainly due to a lack of clarity between the NSSO and client departments as to the respective responsibilities for particular types of cases.  The chapter makes a number of recommendations to improve systems and recovery processes, and to clarify responsibilities.  I am glad that the Accounting Officer accepted all of the recommendations, and will provide an update on their implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Paula Lyons, assistant secretary and head of employee shared services; Ms Joan Curry, principal officer and head of corporate services; and Ms Lisa Hennessy from the NSSO corporate office.  I thank the committee also for the opportunity to make an opening statement.  As we have provided the committee with briefing material, I will endeavour to provide a relevant overview in my statement to make best use of the committee&rsquo;s time.<\/p> <p>  The matters being examined are chapter 10 of the Comptroller and Auditor General report 2016; which is titled Shared Services &ndash; Management of Salary Overpayments, and the Appropriation Account 2016, Vote 18, which is the Vote for the NSSO.  Before I give an outline of these matters, and as this is my first appearance before the committee as the Accounting Officer for the NSSO, I would like to set out the background of the office and the progress we have made in delivering our objectives in recent years.<\/p> <p>  The NSSO is a statutory office, established under the National Shared Services Office Act 2017, on 1 January 2018, when it became a separate Civil Service office, under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The NSSO is contributing to the modernisation of corporate administration and professionalisation of these functions across the civil and public service.  The office is responsible for shared services provision across the entire Civil Service . This allows Departments and offices to focus on their core purpose of effective front-line service delivery.  While each sector in the public service has responsibility for implementing shared services, the NSSO supports the progression of the strategy across the public service by providing advice and guidance on best practice, creating professional communities for learning about shared services standards, policy development and research.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman will be familiar with MyPay in County Laois, which administers payroll for 28 local authorities and pensions for 15 local authorities, and HAP in Limerick, a housing assistance payment scheme.  A new multifunctional shared services centre for higher education is being established in Dublin.  Athlone has an administration centre for schools, and SUSI's data centre in Cork and its operation in Dublin administers the grant payment shared service for students.  The HBS is the provider of multiple shared services to the HSE and it has plans to consolidate administration further.<\/p> <p>  The NSSO has two shared services operations in four locations - Clonskeagh, Tullamore, Killarney and Galway - which comprise HR shared services, providing HR and pensions administration services to 34,500 civil and public servants, and payroll shared services, administering payroll, travel and expense, and pension payments to 124,500 civil and public servants.  A project is well under way to develop the shared services model for financial management and this will go live in mid-2018.  As articulated by Secretary General, Mr. Robert Watt, during previous sessions with the committee, the Government must invest to deliver cost and efficiency benefits, and shared services is an intrinsic part of that transformation of strategy.<\/p><p>Since 2012, the Government has invested &euro;32.3 million capital funding in technology, facilities and consulting costs for HR and payroll shared services.  While this is still at an early stage of maturity, the savings estimated for HR and payroll shared services to date are &euro;21 million and it is expected to deliver &euro;13 million annually, as these centres are fully established.<\/p><p> In addition to cost savings and improved effectiveness arising from standardised processes across the Civil Service, other benefits include the following.  Payroll shared services has replaced 18 payroll offices around the country that had different licensing and versions of payroll systems with one shared service centre on a single technology platform administering payroll, pensions, and travel and expenses one way across Government.  In 2016, payroll shared services made 2.7 million payments to the value of &euro;3.24 billion.  This increased to &euro;4.7 billion in 2017 and will increase further in 2018 now that all in-scope public service bodies have transitioned their payroll and expenses to the NSSO.  HR shared services responded to 77,466 calls and closed 215,268 cases in 2016.  In 2017, this increased to 86,028 calls and 231,289 closed cases.  This level of service delivery was acknowledged with the awarding of the CCMA 2015 Shared Services Award to PeoplePoint while the Civil Service Innovation Award went to the PSSC in the same year.<\/p><p> A further &euro;42.7 million is the estimated capital investment required to establish finance shared services.  The development of a new finance technology solution for Government is well under way.  A single finance technology platform will replace 31 financial management and reporting systems across Government Departments and offices and facilitate transaction processing in the new finance shared services operation in the NSSO.  When fully established, finance shared services will deliver a sustainable reduction in the annual cost of Government financial management of approximately &euro;15.4 million annually from 2021 through a reduction in the cost of support for finance technology, and a reduction in the resources required to provide financial management processing.<\/p><p> Since 2014, the NSSO has delivered many benefits for the Civil Service.  These include the introduction of one set of standard HR and pension processes, applied consistently, based on common HR policies.  These standard processes are eliminating local interpretation and thereby increasing fairness for employees.  Civil servants can access HR and pension services through a much wider range of channels, including the first online system, giving them easier and faster access to important information on entitlements and services.  For example, the HR portal receives over 300,000 visits per month.  HR data analytics are more readily available to management on a Civil Service-wide basis.  The first online system for public service travel and expenses claims was introduced, with payments processed within a week.  Online payslips are provided to all payees and there is immediate access to payroll information, including downloadable P60 forms.  This is a significant change to the hard-copy payslips and paper-based receipts of the past.<\/p><p> Insights gained through shared services informed the development of Government policies, such as absence, leave and the recoupment of overpayments.  Improved technology has resulted in automation in several areas, including the updating of personal information, for example annual leave, removing the need for repeated manual entry on the HR system.  Almost 1.5 million annual leave updates have been recorded in four years and further automation is on the way.  A single definitive source of information can be utilised for many purposes that can help the Government with the implementation of strategic changes and the development of data driven, evidence-based policy formulation.  Shared services continues to have a positive impact by creating dedicated specialist teams whose focus is solely on service quality through process improvement, technology and digitisation.  Our team is building expertise and competencies in complex large-scale transformation programme management, service and quality management, lean thinking and digital and technology innovation.<\/p><p> As with any organisation on this scale and at such an early stage of maturity, progress has not been without its issues.  It is reasonable to expect that challenges and corrections are needed as part of the set-up and stabilisation period.  As with other shared service organisations in the public and private sectors, this has also been the case for the NSSO.  We have encountered and solved a number of issues and learned some lessons.<\/p><p> I turn now to address the Comptroller and Auditor General Report 2016, Chapter 10 - Shared Services &ndash; Management of Salary Overpayments.  I start by thanking the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for its valuable assistance in preparing this report to deal with complex issues, which I will now articulate as follows.  The committee should note that the Comptroller and Auditor General report accepted the inevitability of salary overpayments, given the scale and complexity of the payments involved and it acknowledged that there are many causes for overpayments.  I stress that the NSSO is very aware of its responsibility for the stewardship of public moneys.  When any overpayment occurs, the NSSO pursues the recovery of those moneys as soon as possible in a standard way for all staff.  In the response to the Comptroller and Auditor General report, it was noted that the value of overpayments in 2016 represents just 0.3% of the pay bill, confirming that 99.7% of the pay bill is being administered effectively.  I also welcome that the Comptroller and Auditor General noted in his report that the audits of those bodies did not find any material errors in the payroll charges.  Of course we would like to eliminate all overpayments, but we do not operate in a perfect world where every pay impact is notified in time to administer prior to the payroll run.  Adjustments to salaries are always needed, be it public or private sector.  An overpayment occurs when a staff member is paid more than his or her entitlement.  Overpayments to staff of salary, allowances and expenses can and do occur because of late notification, after the payroll closed and the file has issued to the bank for payment.<\/p><p> I confirm that the NSSO agreed to all the recommendations in the report from the Comptroller and Auditor General on the overpayment of salaries to civil and public servants and has commenced implementation of actions required.  As well as accepting all recommendations in the report, we outlined that a number of actions would be taken.  Since the last quarter of 2017, a monthly report on overpayments issues to each finance officer.  This shows the current balance outstanding on plans in recoupment, the value collected on all plans \"year to date\", and the list of all active overpayment cases.  This provides the finance officer with all the information required.  The decision for off pay cases remains with each Accounting Officer.  Responsibility for legacy cases is being progressed and a statement on responsibility will be inserted into the service management agreement for 2018.  In the Comptroller and Auditor General report it was noted that there was a delay in recovering overpayments.  I confirm to the committee that just over &euro;2 million was collected in 2016 and the estimate for 2017 is higher.  A revision to the recoupment circular in May 2017 allows for recovery of the full value of an overpayment within a month in circumstances where a staff member has been overpaid for a period of five days or less.  This has resulted in a reduction in the time taken to process overpayments.<\/p><p> The reform of sick leave in the public service, while creating significant savings and standardisation of administration and elimination of legacy issues, has meant that staff are reaching sick leave thresholds earlier which increases the risk of a pay adjustment not being notified in a timely manner.  Shared services is reliant on employees and managers notifying sick leave on the first day of occurrence.  Late or delayed notification results in overpayments.  Regular communications were issued by the NSSO to Civil Service staff to notify them of their obligations and an intensified information campaign is also planned for 2018 with local HR.  Following a comprehensive analysis of the root cause of overpayments in 2017, a review of pay impact processes in the NSSO including greater automation is under way.  This will help to reduce and eliminate any delays in the NSSO.<\/p><p>Furthermore, internal organisation changes are planned for the end of the second quarter of 2018 to centralise the calculation of overpayment values, in order to shorten the time taken to agree the recoupment plan and start to recover the money.  Consequently, I believe the NSSO will reduce the number and value of overpayments further in 2018.<\/p><p> On the appropriation account published in 2017, I welcome the clear audit opinion given by the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of Vote 18 for shared services, which is subject to review today.  Since the NSSO was established on an administrative basis in 2014, I have worked to ensure that the NSSO operates effectively and efficiently and that the use of public resources is scrutinised and optimised to ensure best value for money for the Exchequer.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding that, there is an issue with under-expenditure in the Vote.  The reasons relate mainly to the ongoing project work we are delivering.  These projects are very significant.  The NSSO is leading a very significant transformation programme across Government.  There is a balance between maintaining the project pace within an acceptable level of risk while ensuring delivery and value for money.  Our best attempt to forecast may require adjustment if a risk arises.  In 2016, the underspend was declared and surrendered to the Exchequer in a timely manner.  We are aware that, for 2016, there was a significant underspend as set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  As an office, we are very conscious of ensuring we set realistic forecasts and adjust as soon as possible on an ongoing basis, consistent with public financial procedures.<\/p><p> Shared services contribute to the modernisation of the civil and public service.  They create capacity to build a clear strategy for HR, payroll and finance and improve the capability and professional skills of our staff.  By operating a single standard way of working, the NSSO is able to contribute strategically and respond quickly to new and emerging requirements such as when a new Government Department is created.  Shared services are about standard processes supported by self-service technology.  It is a balancing act, investing to reduce costs and demonstrating efficiencies and improvements while at the same time changing responsibilities and accountabilities.  While making these changes, issues such as overpayments are amplified by the centralisation of data and the transparency that shared services bring to such matters.<\/p><p> Before I conclude, I acknowledge and thank my staff who have really got behind this major change programme and worked hard and long hours to deliver it.  Without their dedication and focus, the NSSO could not have achieved these milestones reached so far.  I also thank past members of the shared services steering board and programme boards for providing their support and time to assist the delivery of this ambitious programme of change.  I am confident that further improvements currently underway will result in a positive impact on managing overpayments more effectively.  I will answer any question the Chairman or members of the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Hilary Murphy-Fagan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Murphy-Fagan for that opening statement.

One of the biggest lessons was the impact of the change and the requirement to support the change management in each public service bodies, PSBs, and to support users with the system.  While we have communicated and developed communication materials that were disseminated in various PSBs, we have learned that we need to do even more of that in the future.  We have taken that lesson as it relates to financial management shared services and really increased the level of engagement, communication and awareness for financial management.  That has been a big lesson because there is an impact on the end user when one moves to a shared services model, particularly with the difference in responsibilities and accountabilities because they change when one moves to a shared services model.<\/p> <p>  The second lesson is that we have robust business cases in every case.  That was a requirement for the Government to make a decision to implement this change.  We did not start the benefits management and tracking as early as we could have.  We now track our benefits which I was able to insert into my opening statement.  When it comes to financial management, we will have a benefits statement which will be signed and agreed with each Accounting Officer before we start the transition to the final shared services.  We will make sure that we monitor that.  A last point, despite the best attempts, efforts and experience of my staff and the competencies and capabilities they have gained in the past year, is that with any large-scale transformation programme, while there are significant benefits, there are also risks.  We have to consider how we manage those risks and look for certain risks that maybe, with the wisdom of hindsight, we could have dealt with sooner.  We will certainly look at that in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Hilary Murphy-Fagan"},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Ms Murphy-Fagan has led me to my next question.

I will outline them to the witness and she can respond because, obviously, we must have both sides of the equation.  They had difficulty explaining a number of issues for many of the people the office serves.  There were issues relating to overpayments, delays and mistakes with pension payments, which had not happened previously, delays of two to three months with the payment of increments, which had not happened previously, delays with leave applications, particularly applications for parental leave for some reason, and mistakes and misunderstandings regarding starting pay when people get promoted or moved.  A specific issue raised with me, which is quite unique, relates to the early shutdown of payroll before Christmas, which meant some people on lower wages did not get the overtime payments they were depending on for Christmas.  Another relates to delays in issuing P60s.  The Chairman asked about that earlier, probably for the same reason.  Does the witness wish to comment on those issues?

It is our reputation and we are constantly striving to improve it.  We have a very strong governance process.  We have a customer services group which has representation from HR managers and finance officers from the various Departments we service.  My colleague, Ms Lyons, is on that customer services group and it is chaired by the chief human resources officer for the Civil Service because shared services are part of that HR strategy.  The group meets monthly to look at what the top issues are.  Service management meetings are held very regularly to examine what issues are arising for staff or management, to understand the root cause of those issues and to see how we can improve those.  We keep a log or record of everything.  We look at what issues we are able to resolve and close and what issues remain open.  It is really quite a robust system around service management.

Given the number of people the office is dealing with, we are bound to get information from them.  When one centralises a system such as this, particularly with regard to HR, it is a system and process where one must follow rules and logic.  I am a former IT manager so I understand the process by which it all must work.  I had to centralise systems in my time.  When one is dealing with HR issues and financial payments, particularly HR issues, there seems to be an almost impersonal element to it that needs to be flagged or dealt with in some way from one occasion to the next.  I suggest that some pathway is created whereby individuals who have a personal or a once or twice in a work career issue, instead of just being identified as a case number, have a way in which the issue can be pushed up the line and processed relatively quickly through the HR functions and the organisations.  I have heard that cases involving an exceptional issue are not being dealt with quickly enough.  The witness might accept my suggestion.  Trust me, I am hearing that from the people to whom I have been talking.<\/p> <p>  I have a final couple of questions.  One of them is somewhat out of left field.  Obviously, there are capital outlays relating to where the office is going in respect of the financial management of bodies.  Financial management is going to be the third leg of the organisation.  Personally, I believe the office should consolidate what it is doing first.<\/p><p>Moving into that space is probably the right thing to do.  I have rolled out massive large-scale projects in a previous life.  The NSSO needs to bed down and then move on again.<\/p><p> As regards underspend, it would be preferable for an organisation such as the NSSO not to have an underspend, given the scale of its operations, because it will be fighting for money for the financial management leg of its work.  Why was there a significant underspend?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#K02500","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517475600,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Kelly that it would be preferable for us not to have an underspend, which was due to two key factors.  The first is that a plan for the transition migration of a payroll into my office is only a plan and, as we get deeper into the preparation and level of readiness for transfer, things may arise such that we have to change the sequencing of Departments.  A Department may have to come ahead of one that was in the original plan, and that is always open to change, or things may have to be slowed down to ensure we manage any risks we identify.  A delay of transition or migration creates an underspend on our vote because we do not recruit the staff we intended to or transfer staff to our office who were doing that work previously, for example.  However, the corollary is that where we have an underspend, that pay bill spend is on the corresponding Vote and, therefore, is neutral overall but it shows up in my Vote if we have a delay.<\/p> <p>  On the capital expenditure side, the underspend is primarily due to the very large finance shared services programme.  Approximately 50% of the capital cost has already been spent for that programme but there have been delays.  Having followed due process in respect of procurement, there was an initial delay in finalising the contract with the provider or system integrator, which delay had a knock-on effect in respect of our Estimate for the following year, which had already been created.  It is not a matter of an overall overspend but rather is more of a timing issue because we will actually spend-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Hilary Murphy-Fagan"},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Underspend.

As we expanded the service offering to new Departments, the number of staff working in shared services increased.  Shared services is a specialism that requires clear accountability for all the people who receive the services and the Departments that are served.  It also requires clear funding arrangements, a very strong customer focus and a continuous improvement focus on operations and technology.  I suppose that is different from the business of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is primarily a policy Department.  The NSSO is more than twice the size of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

Now we have all the payrolls within the shared service so we have a better view end to end.  We would, therefore, be able to see where a recoupment stopped and why, and to follow it up fairly quickly.  The situation in 2016 certainly presented more challenge in trying to manage it as an end to end process.  The full migration of payrolls will improve that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020100002#S01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Paula Lyons"},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I asked too many questions together and I apologise.

Given that the office will be getting its Estimate of expenditure approved for 2018 any day now, I expect that, in calculating that figure, the NSSO should be able to estimate what it believes the figure for outstanding payments will be at the end of 2018.  I am now moving on much further.  If one is coming in to get the group of Votes for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform next month, this month or on another occasion, it is logical to be asked about this.  I refer to where one is looking for the Estimate figure for the office for the coming year - the Estimate for its Vote.  A level of overpayments will be in place for last year and one will have to know, in one's working papers, the estimated figure for 2018.  That is relevant to the Vote the office requires.  Therefore, I presume it will be possible for the office to give us some estimate.  I stress that it will be an estimate.  Ms Murphy-Fagan spoke about planning.

It was founded as an output from the Queen&rsquo;s visit to Ireland in 2011.  Our <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre<\/i>is to champion, protect and grow the trade between the UK and Ireland, trade worth in excess of &euro;65 billion a year and that sustains over 400,000 jobs, evenly spread across Britain and Ireland.<br\/><br\/>As president of the chamber, I take great pride in the work we have done to date in promoting this trade.  However, we now find ourselves in uncharted waters and every effort must be made to ensure that this trade that supports jobs, economies and communities across both islands does not become the first casualty.<br\/><br\/>The UK is Ireland&rsquo;s largest two-way trading partner.  In 2016, Ireland exported 14% of its goods and services to the UK while we imported 11% from there.  In goods trade alone, the UK is the source for nearly a quarter of all Irish imports.  The significance of the UK market to Ireland is most evidently seen in our food and drinks sector.  Despite a fall in the overall share of exports destined for the UK, 35% of our food and drink output still ends up in this market and exports to the UK grew by 7% last year to &euro;4.4 billion.<br\/><br\/>The British Irish Chamber of Commerce works on behalf of its members, large and small, North, South, east and west, connecting them to fresh business opportunities between and from these two islands, growing trade, investment and jobs.  We want to ensure this work continues beyond the current crisis that now faces us.  The implications for business which arise because of the UK&rsquo;s vote to leave the EU is an issue which consumes the British Irish Chamber of Commerce and our work around Brexit.  As the only organisation representing business interests in both islands, we are uniquely placed to see both the opportunities and challenges which now face the business community as it prepares for what is currently an uncertain future.<br\/><br\/>The British Irish Chamber of Commerce welcomed the publication of the joint report on phase one of the negotiations by the European Commission and the UK Government last December.  Its adoption meant an important milestone was reached on phase one of the negotiations which now allows us to look to the future of UK and EU relations, as well as the trade environment which might emerge after Brexit.<br\/><br\/>What was agreed in December has given rise to much debate.<\/p><p>By taking the text of the joint report and reading paragraphs 49 and 50, it would seem to state that should an agreement not be reached that avoids the need for &quot;any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls&quot; on the island of Ireland, then it continued:<\/p><blockquote>The United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement.<\/blockquote><p>Furthermore, Paragraph 50 states that no new regulatory barriers will develop between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.  This then means that any solution found on a North-South basis should equally apply on an east-west basis.  The easiest way to achieve the above would be for the UK to remain in both the EU customs union and Internal Market.  Should this not be possible, the adoption of a future framework such as that outlined in the chamber's document entitled Big Principles for a Strong Brexit Partnership would also meet the conditions as set out in the joint report.<br\/><br\/>Where the confusion arises is that even after the UK signed up to the joint report, its Government stated that the UK still intends to leave the EU Internal Market and pursue its own trade deals.  This is a circle that simply cannot be squared.  It is not possible for the UK to pursue its own trade agenda while maintaining borderless trade with Ireland and, therefore, the rest of the EU.  Rules of origin, standards, and regulatory compliance checks as well as the collection of customs duties, all take place at borders. <br\/><br\/>In order to maintain the integrity of the EU Internal Market, it is essential that all goods entering this market from external markets are checked to ensure it is not compromised.  Even if the UK retains full alignment with the EU on regulations and standards so that goods entering the UK under its own deals would be fully compliant with EU conditions, border checks of some type would still need to take place in order to collect the appropriate customs and duties on these goods.  Until the UK comes forward with proposals on how it will address such a conundrum, business will remain uncertain, and plan accordingly, about what its future trading environment will ultimately look like. <br\/><br\/>What I have said so far is mainly concerned with the trade of goods but the UK is a service economy.  The risk that Brexit poses to the city of London and the broader service sector is real and should not be underestimated.  The chamber was recently in Brussels for extensive engagement with the EU Brexit negotiators and senior representatives of the parliament, where it was said to us, on many occasions and from various sources, that without Single Market membership there is zero possibility of the UK keeping its passporting licence for financial services into the EU.  This is a hard reality and, if anything, reflects some of the anger and anti-UK sentiment that is developing in Brussels and across the EU over the Brexit issue.<br\/><br\/>It is for these reasons that the chamber has taken a proactive approach.  We have put forward a solution that we believe addresses many of the concerns while also taking account of the political reality within the UK.  What we are proposing is a politically ambitious but technically achievable solution that outlines the chamber's vision for a possible trade framework for the UK and the EU post-Brexit.<br\/><br\/>The key objectives of our document entitled the Big Principles for a Strong Brexit Partnership include: A trade relationship between the UK and the EU that is effectively borderless, including in Ireland and at UK ports, and free from tariff and non-tariff barriers that will enable trade in both goods and services; an alignment of the UK's tariffs with the established common external tariff and continued regulatory alignment to both maintain standards and protect the UK and the EU from an influx of cheaper, lower quality goods that would endanger citizen safety in manufacturing and food production; a solution to the island of Ireland border issue and the protection, critically, of the Good Friday Agreement; a joint approach to mutually beneficial trade deals rather than the UK's sole pursuit of global Britain, which we view as being of less benefit to discussion; we acknowledge the wishes of the UK population in the referendum, particularly to take control and allow control of the migration policy, and we see the agreement encompassing the UK being able to set its own migration policy; and an alternative model to the Court of Justice of the EU, CJEU, for dispute settlement, just as in other EU trade deals.  The paper proposes that all of this be achieved through a customs arrangement between the UK and the EU.  The arrangement will cover the trade of goods between parties post-Brexit.  Continued regulatory and tariff alignment are key pillars of the proposal.<br\/><br\/>Alignment in both would remove the need for regulatory standards and customs checks to take place along borders.  It would ensure that the UK and EU are protected from an influx of cheaper, lower quality goods that might compromise standards in manufacturing and food production.  In addition, such measures will also protect the integrity of the EU's Internal Market and customs union, a key requirement from the EU in all of its documents to date, making the possibility of borderless trade between both markets more achievable.<br\/><br\/>Unlike previous EU customs agreements, this proposed arrangement goes further in terms of trade with third countries.  It is proposed that the UK has an input but no veto into future trade deals and automatically has access to these markets under the same conditions as those for the EU.  If the EU was to complete all its trade deals that it is currently negotiating, 88% of UK trade would be covered by those deals.  Furthermore, Prime Minister May previously stated that the UK, in its international trade negotiations, is willing to mirror deals made between the EU and third countries with Japan being a prime example.  This model would at least provide the UK with input into the negotiation of these deals. <br\/><br\/>The proposal also recommends that the customs arrangement be coupled with a comprehensive deal on the trade in services.  It points to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, and the EU's deep and comprehensive free trade areas with Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova as possible models to follow to achieve this.<br\/><br\/>As the UK will leave the Single Market, the proposal allows the UK to meet its stated objectives of managing its own immigration policy and removing itself from the direct jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the EU.  It is proposed that the final agreement be governed by an international dispute resolution mechanism where grievances and complaints can be brought and whose judgments should be binding. <br\/><br\/>We are now at a crucial stage.  Discussions are due to start this month on the shape and conditions of a transition arrangement.  The EU has been clear in its recent directive that for a transition phase to be accepted, the UK would have to retain all current obligations and requirements of EU membership, including financial contributions, while losing its voice and representation in the EU institutions.  Also, worthy of note and potentially worrying for business, the EU has recommended that the transition phase should end on 31 December 2020.  That means it would be shorter than the two-year period previously requested by Prime Minister May.  It should be welcomed that the Secretary of State, David Davis, last week while giving evidence before the House of Commons Select Committee on Exiting the European Union, seemed to accept these conditions.<br\/><br\/>Both the conditions of the transition phase and the full withdrawal agreement text will need to be finalised by October of this year to allow time for ratification across the EU institutions and in Westminster.  Talks on the framework for the future relationship are expected to begin in March.  They would need to be finalised during the transition phase if we are to avoid a further cliff edge scenario.  The nature of the future relationship will not be discussed in detail until after the UK has left the EU on 29 March 2019.  This timeline shows that the clock is ticking, and that we need to see some urgency from the UK Government in putting forward its proposals for its future relationship with the EU.  Brexit is possibly the biggest economic challenge of this generation.  Therefore, we should not let it happen without ensuring that the risks are well known to all.  The British Irish Chamber of Commerce will continue to put forward and advocate strongly for sensible solutions that best protect the prosperity and trade that both our islands currently enjoy. <br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it and I invite members to ask questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018020100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin O'Neill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517479200,"counter":746,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Neill for his comprehensive analysis of the current situation.

One theme that ran very strongly through Mr. O'Neill's presentation was the notion of an uncertain future.  I represent two of the southern Ulster counties and a lot of businesses there are very heavily dependent on the British market.  The agrifood, construction, construction products and engineering sectors are more heavily dependent on Northern Ireland and the British market than others.  They are very concerned about planning for the future.  Members of the House of Commons foreign affairs committee visited Cavan and Monaghan and met local interests from the agrifood, hospitality, transport and other sectors.  The message we all got from those interests and sectors was they are concerned about planning ahead in their businesses.  March 2019 will come very quickly.  The transition period will end in December 2020 which is not far away in business terms for people who have to plan business for the future.  There is a very strong message there in regard to the concerns of business.  Does the British Irish Chamber of Commerce have constituent members in Northern Ireland?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018020100002#B00800","speaker":"1270","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517479200,"counter":754,"content":"<p>We have members across the two islands in all jurisdictions.

Mr. David Sterling, the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, and Julie Sinnamon from Enterprise Ireland, spoke which is a reflection of the cross-border nature of trade and activity.  A lot of the concerns the Chairman addressed were raised at that forum.  It is equally challenging on the other side of the Border if they are exporting to the South.  There are challenges on both sides of the Border.  We have interests and membership spread right across the UK.

I appreciate all their work to date.  I had dealings with Ms Daughen in early January and some of my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il spent two days around Westminster.  We got great assistance from Claire who does a lot of work with the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, Member of Parliament, Mr. Conor McGinn, and the APPG group.<\/p> <p>  The question is how to make Brexit work for all of us.  It is an easy question to ask but getting the answers is difficult.  From my contacts with colleagues in Britain through the foreign affairs committee and through my role as foreign affairs spokesperson for my party, it is clear there are very different views within the British Cabinet and Parliament depending on the committee one talks to.  One specific area I want to ask Mr. O'Neill about is the agreement on phase one.  We tried to interrogate this when we were in England the week before last.  Our understanding of it is that no regulatory divergence applies to North-South and that will extend, de facto, to east-west.  If that extends to east-west, it means that lack of divergence will extend further into the EU.  If Ireland, as an EU state, has no divergence with the UK after it leaves, it would mean Britain would effectively have no divergence with the EU and the other EU 26.  We put that question to the foreign and commonwealth office and the Brexit office in No. 9 Downing Street and there was a different view in both of those offices; they did not necessarily believe that would be the case.  Mr. O'Neill highlighted the need for them to stay within the customs union so as not to bring about further tariffs or border checks.  We know that.  Phase one was the easiest, if any of it could be called easy.  Phase two is what will really be difficult.  We are into senior hurling now, to use an Irish phrase.  The British will understand that pretty soon.  What Mr. O'Neill has been able to do is set out a sensible approach.  I want to ask about the regulatory divergence.  What is the British Irish Chamber of Commerce picking up?  Is the understanding in Ireland the same as it is in Britain?  With regard to the extension of the transition phase, Mr. O'Neill mentioned the Secretary of State, Mr. David Davis, seemed to accept that.  Mr. O'Neill is saying very clearly that he thinks the transition phase is too short.  I agree with that.  It is important that we, as a member state, ensure the integrity of the European Union and that the strength of the union remains intact.  We can be reasonable.  <\/p> <p>  The British Irish Chamber of Commerce has a role in continually highlighting the trade issue.  I will turn to that issue now.  In all of our discussions in Brussels, it is clear that our colleagues in the European Union fully understand the situation with regard to the North.  They understand that the maintenance of the Good Friday Agreement and the rights of Irish citizens in the North, who by extension are EU citizens, is really important politically and socially on the island.  I have a concern that the European Union may feel that if that element is dealt with the trade issue is secondary.  The Chairman and Mr. O'Neill have outlined that 400,000 jobs on both islands are underpinned by the substantial trade done between the islands.  We need to continue to reinforce that.  I am worried the attitude will be, although not in a flippant way, that the Good Friday Agreement has been dealt with and therefore we will not get assistance on trade issues.  What more can we do here to try to get that message across?  Does Mr. O'Neill agree it is timely for the European Union to look at an EU reform fund to support businesses that are heavily vested in the UK market?  I get a sense that state aid rules have loosened in Britain to a great degree already and may not be following the letter of the law with regard to EU state aid rules.  We need to have a level playing pitch when we are competing with British companies.  Our exporters and members of the British Irish Chamber of Commerce need assistance.  What more does the Irish Government need to do?  I have asked both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, why we have not asked at the Commission for a relaxation of state aid rules.  In the agrifood sector in particular, there are areas that need assistance immediately.  For British businesses in Britain, the pinch is being felt now as a result of the increase in import inflation, inflation and the drop in net wages as a result of inflation in Britain.  Does Mr. O'Neill get a sense that Brexit is beginning to bite there?  Does he agree the reality is dawning and the hard Brexit attitude that no deal is better than a bad deal, to quote John Redwood and others like him, is losing currency in Britain?<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. O'Neill for his presentation and for all the work he is doing.  I might come in again afterwards.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018020100002#C00500","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1517479200,"counter":758,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Neill was very clear and comprehensive.

I will start by addressing Deputy O'Brien's questions.  With respect to where we are with the negotiations, he is correct in saying Articles 49 and 50 in the agreement underpin the understanding and it is our understanding too.  For North-South and east-west, there it is an equal understanding.  It is not sovereign-dependent but it goes to Europe and the UK.  It is absolutely our understanding as well.  It is an agreement and not a treaty.  It is a phase and not the end.  In the context of the negotiations, we have come through a gate but it is not a binding gate in many respects.  It is a key element of what we are about.<\/p> <p>  We go to the UK quite a lot and I too have been in those hallowed halls.  I have met some of those people and some very senior UK politicians.  We have spent time with Philip Hammond, David Davis, Boris Johnson and others.  We heard them articulate the need, for example, for a long-standing relationship between the UK and EU going forward.  We have equally witnessed the demand for a global Britain agenda and where that would take the UK's market.  We point out in our document that 88% of where the UK would like to trade is covered under current or future EU treaties.  In that context, we would contend strongly, particularly when we speak in the UK, that the best is in what they have already and the treaty arrangements already in place.  Why would they compromise those in the effort to seek the additional 12%?  We articulate that view very strongly.<\/p> <p>  Whereas there is a continued focus on global Britain in the public media and articulations coming from elements within the UK Government, it will be increasingly difficult to arrive at a treaty-based decision on the future of the strategy.  That is our single biggest concern.  The House of Lords committee was here on Tuesday and they attended the House as well.  I made a presentation to them and articulated our view that there is no future for a global Britain approach against the backdrop of negotiations.  One cannot be any clearer than that in what we seek.  We are very strong in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The engagement into Europe and the relaxation of state aid rules flows to Deputy O'Sullivan's question about the relationship with Europe.  The absolute strength of the relationship between Ireland and the European Union has been very obvious to us as an organisation, and in particular the support given by the EU to Ireland around the critical matter of protecting the Good Friday Agreement.  We are all of a generation where we remember the bad times and we are not going back there, so we must protect that.  The support achieved by Ireland right across Europe for that is critical.  That is not to say the sentiment towards the UK's departure from Europe has not left a scar across Europe.  Many European countries are very upset about it and they are determined that on exit, a hard bargain is driven for Europe and its protection.  It is important not to confuse the two.  Ireland needed to ensure the protection of the Border was critical to phase one.  In the next stage of the negotiation process, the protection of our trading links with the UK will become increasingly important.  As the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade articulated at Chatham House last night, there is a need for Ireland to be the UK's best friend in many respects in the negotiations.  That will underpin and protect the trading relationship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018020100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin O'Neill"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517479200,"counter":762,"content":"<p>The regulatory divergence piece was mentioned.

There is division not only within the Cabinet and the British Government but within individual parties.  We have been in Westminster twice and there is a possible visit planned for later this month, and we have advocated strongly on the proposals.  It depends on where people would lie within the spectrum of their belief on Brexit.  Those who are hard-line Brexiteers want to leave the EU and have very little association, politically, with the EU after Brexit.  They do not feel a solution like this will work but rather in absolute free trade and the global Britain agenda, as Mr. O'Neill alludes to.  Those who want to remove some of the political ties from the EU institutional role within the UK are more open to a trade solution, as we put forward in the big principles.  It is very hard to know.  It is worth noting that since we published this paper last November, the CBI - Ireland's equivalent to IBEC - came out with something similar the week before last.  It is rumoured that Labour's policy position is also moving to something similar to what we have put forward in the principles.  There is a shift and this is constantly evolving.  Without some formal framework for regulatory alignment and trade tariff alignment, it is very hard to see a way in which those commitments made in the joint report can really be met.<br\/><br\/>The EU has been very open in what is on offer and there is not a CETA plus plus plus on offer.  It is CETA or the Internal Market.  There might be some openness to a customs arrangement like we propose, given that it kind of relies on the <i>status quo<\/i>.  If the UK wishes to trade, it is very hard to see how it can have its own trade deals with third countries while maintaining open borders on the island of Ireland and east-west as well.<br\/><br\/>There is the point about the transition phase being too short.  The EU Commission has set the deadline of 31 December 2020 on the basis that it is the end of the current multi-annual financial framework.  There probably would be an option to extend the transition phase beyond that but it would require the UK paying into the next framework budget, which could be very sensitive politically within the UK.  There is a possibility nonetheless.<br\/><br\/>The Good Friday Agreement and the trade piece was mentioned.  The Good Friday Agreement has rightly been given much focus.  We believe we are putting forward a trade framework that could almost address many of the concerns around the Good Friday Agreement and uphold the commitments of both Governments to it.

It is a very important question and it consumes the discussions with members and their ability to plan for the future.  We very much commend the work of the State agencies, particularly Enterprise Ireland, in their resolute attempt to get businesses to focus on the implications of Brexit and where it might take them but also on the need to expand markets.  It is worthy of note that the work being done, particularly by the diplomatic service in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade should be commended.

A survey of small and medium enterprises produced last week by the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland, showed only 16% had taken a step forward to prepare their Brexit plans.  That is too small a number.  The number needs to be increased and there are supports and grants available for businesses to work in that area.  We beat a constant drum in terms of talking to small and medium enterprises about the need to step up and do some prep work in that space.  I understand that small businesses are busy doing what is required for the day job, but planning a strategy for where it might take them will be very important.

The more I read and listen, the more concerned I become.  We have every reason to be concerned.  We started off with a great blaze of publicity because everything was concentrated on Ireland initially.  That is fading and will continue to fade.  We should not be fooled into believing that everybody is going to be looking after us.  The reality is that we are the real losers.<\/p> <p>  Ireland must demand protection.  The idea of people coming into Ireland without a so-called boundary with the UK is a dreamland when we get down to the nitty-gritty.  The current situation, whereby I can get off a plane or boat in Dublin, hire a car and make my way to the North of Ireland without anybody stopping me, and then make my way into Britain, will not continue.  It is not reality.  I do not care what people say or what so-called agreements are in place.  It is not practical and has all sorts of implications for us.  We will become a gateway into the EU.  We will take on a great deal of responsibility because we have a boundary to protect on behalf of the EU, just as Britain has a boundary to protect on its behalf.<\/p> <p>  The more I watch television and listen to debates, the more convinced I am that we are too quiet.  We should be in every discussion and debate that takes place, consider our position carefully and demand more than what we are getting.  We had a blaze of glory for a couple of days, but that has faded.  We are now getting different versions of what was supposed to be agreed in regard to Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  I follow the issue very closely on television.  I am a great watcher of BBC television in order to find out exactly what is happening.  At times I say to myself that this is not what I was led to understand.  Time is marching on.  I am delighted that the witnesses and their group are taking such an active involvement in this, but they deserve greater backup and support and it is time that was provided.  We as committee members need to keep highlighting that we cannot be forgotten.  There cannot be a mindset that Ireland has been sorted out.  Ireland has not been sorted out.  <\/p> <p>  Anybody with a brain between his or her ears cannot answer my question.  As I said, the idea that I can get on a boat or plane, land in Ireland and drive to the North of Ireland and access Britain without anybody stopping me is not for real.  It might last six months initially, but then all of the difficulties will appear.  There will be goods brought in through back doors.  I was a Minister for Defence at one stage and brought the visitors to see what the Border is actually like.  They were flabbergasted to see that there were no gates or walls.  There are open fields and mountains.  It is impossible.<\/p> <p>  I get the feeling that these negotiations are going on, but at the end of the day the real loser will be Ireland which has taken on a significant responsibility given that we are the only land gateway into Britain.  We are saying that the land gateway will be unprotected.  Realism has to come into this debate.  We need to work together and be more demanding about getting answers now to the sort of questions I and others, including the witnesses, are posing.  This issue cannot go into 2019 and 2020.  When it comes to the rubberstamp, Ireland will be told it cannot stand in the way of the agreement. <\/p> <p>  Now is the time to have an agreement down on paper and stamped so that we know exactly what is involved.  We can then move on to other discussions.  It is only when we meet people like the witnesses, read their comments and see more that we ask ourselves how this is going to work.  Nobody can answer that because we have never been given an answer.  The most worrying thing is that if one watches the BBC which I and, I am sure, others do, the information given depends on who is being interviewed.  Some people have a different version of the Irish agreement.  There was a side comment that things have not been fully agreed.  What has been agreed?  That is what I want to know.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted that we have had an opportunity to hear the views of the witnesses.  The more we talk to people like them and listen and understand, the more we realise how important it is to have an organisation like theirs and others, and start listening, focusing and looking for an agreement on paper long before 2019 or 2020 so that there are no ifs, ands or buts.  Nobody has been able to answer the questions I have posed.  I thank the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018020100002#E00600","speaker":"1219"},{"type":"speech","time":1517479200,"counter":772,"content":"<p>Part of the difficulty with the conversation about the divergent views of the British political establishment is that it is going in different directions and no one seems to know what is happening or how to deal with the situation.<\/p><p>The simplest way forward would be if the UK stayed in the Single Market and the customs union.  The British Irish Chamber of Commerce has called for a new customs arrangement.  Is that to try to sell it to those who are blatantly opposed to being involved in the whole European project?  Is this some way to try to move them along the road?  Clearly, there is no agreement.  The Brexiteers want to leave the Single Market and customs union and that creates major problems for those of us in Ireland.  Our party has been involved in the referendum against Brexit.<\/p><p> The chamber deals with this to some extent in the paper and states that the organisation has repeatedly stated its concern for the island of Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement due to Brexit.  Given that the majority of people in the North of Ireland voted to remain in the EU &ndash; the figure was 56% - does the chamber believe this vote must be respected?  Does the chamber believe a deal should be done to grant some sort of special arrangement - we use the term \"special status\" - to remain in the EU?  Does the chamber have a view on that?<\/p><p> The representatives of the British Irish Chamber of Commerce have said that the Good Friday Agreement should be protected.  Do they agree that it should be protected in full?  I am asking because they have also said that there needs to be an alternative model to the European Court of Justice for dispute settlement.<\/p><p> The right of Irish and British citizens to redress currently in the European courts is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement.  Having such rights dealt with only at British court level would be in direct violation of that underpinning.<\/p><p> The trade dispute mechanism and other EU trade deals, such as TTIP and CETA, are private so-called investor-state dispute settlement models.  They allow and facilitate private companies to sue governments.  They are nothing compared to the scope and power of the European Court of Justice and protections under EU law.  The removal of the ability of citizens to get redress at the European Court of Justice violates the terms and essence of the Good Friday Agreement.  Anyway, perhaps I have read incorrectly what the chamber seems to be suggesting.<\/p><p> Do the chamber representatives agree that we should try to protect the enabling legislation, including the UK's Northern Ireland Act 1998, which put the Good Friday Agreement into domestic law within the EU legal framework, rather than trying to create a bespoke or different legal framework purely for private companies?<\/p><p> The chamber document also states that Britain should be able to set its own migration policy.  Under the Good Friday Agreement, citizens of the North of Ireland are Irish citizens and British citizens.  The same applies to those born in the North or those who have had permanent residence there for more than five years.  If the British Government drastically changes this migration policy &ndash; as some among the political establishment are suggesting &ndash; and removes the right of these people to remain and work in the North, it amounts to a violation of the Good Friday Agreement.  That would deeply affect the economy and the social fabric of many communities there.  Is that a matter of concern for the chamber and its members?<\/p><p> There is another difficult part of this equation.  The British are leaving, but they are not saying what they want.  It is reasonable for us to ask what they want.  They are not very clear in articulating exactly what they want.  I believe the current arrangement, including the customs union and the Single Market, would be the best deal for Ireland.  The chamber seems to be moving away from that position.  Is the chamber simply dealing with the reality by saying that the UK will pull out and that is simply part of the viewpoint coming from Britain?  Is this seen as a way of softening the complete separation that some Brexiteers are proposing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018020100002#E00700","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517479200,"counter":774,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late.

I thank Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett for his kind words and offer of support.  We will take any support we can get.  We take it from all quarters and we receive significant support throughout the full spectrum.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Crowe asked us to put our position clearly on the table.  The British Irish Chamber of Commerce advocated strongly for a remain agenda throughout the campaign.  We campaigned in the UK for a remain agenda.  We tried to mobilise the voice of business, which was a difficult voice to mobilise in the UK in the course of the campaign.  We were ardent supporters of a remain agenda because we did not see any positive future in the UK exiting, either for the UK or for the rest of Europe.  I wish to make that point in case there is any ambiguity.  That was strongly our view.<\/p> <p>  Our absolute understanding is like the understanding of everyone else.  We understand the border agenda is as defined in articles 49 and 50 of the joint report, that is to say, that there will be an open border relationship North and South.  However, as that infamous week went on, we went from having 49 articles to 50 articles following an intervention from the North.  We moved to not having an east-west border either, because there was some sub-text of a border going down the middle of the Irish Sea.  Last week I met a delegation of members from the Scottish Parliament.  They were equally concerned about what a border down the middle of the Irish Sea might look like given the question of where it would leave Scotland.<\/p> <p>  As we start to peel the onion, we get different layers evolving in all aspects of it.  I absolutely understand the concerns expressed about a gateway concept and Ireland.  It is a result of a vote we did not have.  The result was foisted upon us and has resulted in us becoming a gateway to Europe.  That will put an extraordinary and onerous responsibility on the Irish sovereign State to protect and manage its borders as an entry point into the European entity.  I do not think that has been addressed but it needs to be addressed in far more detail in the context of the argument on where we might go.<\/p> <p>  We have tried to call out strongly where we believe the decision of the sovereign vote in the UK has led.  We respect the vote of the UK.  We could parcel it and say that Scotland voted to stay, Wales voted to leave and Northern Ireland voted to stay.  The city of London voted to stay.  We could start to parcel it but at the end of the day the sovereign entity voted to leave Europe and we have to respect the vote of the people.  The British Irish Chamber of Commerce is a democratically-driven organisation and we respect that vote.<\/p><p>We cannot start to parcel down elements of it, much and all as we might like to.  Against that backdrop, what we have tried to do in our Big Principles document is present a palatable way forward for that electorate to make the best of a difficult situation.<\/p><p> I did not really address it earlier when Deputy O'Sullivan asked me where we could find some positives and opportunities in this.  Let us be absolutely clear that there are no positives. There are positives in what we have today, which has been positive for us for many years on this island, but there are no positives in this going forward.  The best we can hope for is a nil-sum game which is difficult and challenging in its own respect.  We are not blind to the issues and we absolutely respect that.  <\/p><p> I will allow Ms Daughen to speak on some of the cases of the Court of Justice of the European Union.

There would still be the usual passport checks.  As the UK and Ireland are outside the Schengen Agreement, there is removability from it.  There would be more focus on access to services, national insurance numbers and the right to work etc.  This is where we would see a lot of that control in terms of the UK setting its own migration policy.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Crowe's question also related to the migration stream.  If UK migration policy does get more stringent, the common travel area is being protected by the statements and commitments in the joint report.  This refers back to the Ireland Act 1949 in the UK which confers rights on Irish citizens on a pretty much equal basis to those born in the UK.  This means that an Irish citizen today can move there and have more expansive rights than someone from, say, France or Germany.  For example, I can vote in its national elections.  We think that Northern Irish citizens who might identify as Irish will be covered through that and migration policy will not impact on them or their rights.  It is interesting to note that the UK's guidelines for citizens of Europe excludes Irish citizens as they are being treated separately due to the common travel area.<\/p> <p>  On the Court of Justice issue, the EU has international dispute resolution mechanisms with other trading countries that are above what was described about CETA and TTIP.  The EFTA court is a prime example.  We have not been particularly prescriptive because it is a matter for negotiation but we point to the EFTA court and suggest that this could almost be an add-on to it.  What we are proposing could be overseen or it could be some kind of mirroring of it.  There are also other mechanisms such as that in the EU-South Korea free trade agreement although generally we are talking about trade when we are talking about international dispute resolution mechanisms.<\/p> <p>  Northern Ireland and UK citizens will still have recourse to the European Court of Human Rights because that is completely separate to EU membership.  This would cover the conditions put forward in the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Barrett asked about Ireland losing its influence.  It is important to note that even in phase 2 Ireland remains a distinct strand of the negotiations.  This means that Ireland has some influence on what the overall outcome will be and this is a clear recognition of the diplomatic work done by Irish officials across Europe and the understanding within Brussels of the Irish-specific situation.  While the focus will change, Ireland still has a strong voice within the negotiations.<\/p> <p>  In terms of what has been agreed on the Border, I suppose nothing has been agreed.  The joint report is a political commitment and there is no legal underpinning to it but Michel Barnier has been clear that he wants to provide that legal underpinning as soon as possible and it will form part of the withdrawal agreement.  This covers a totality of issues including EU citizen rights and the withdrawal bill.  It is important, therefore, that it is given some legal underpinning.  Hopefully, it will be done by October in terms of allowing for the timelines for ratification etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018020100002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Katie Daughen"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517479200,"counter":779,"content":"<p>To finish up on those points, the Irish Government is currently running with two key initiatives that we support strongly.

To refer to Deputy Barrett's point earlier, it allows us to create a strong voice in that space on our role in Europe and we would be very supportive of it.

From some of the events concerning Brexit which I have attended in recent months, the only positive note that seemed to be struck was struck from an academic setting or context.  In particular, researchers from Science Foundation Ireland and others commented that there may be a positive spin-off in terms of attracting academic researchers who see that with Brexit they will lose the potential for collaboration and, in particular, European research grants.  We may be able to attract them here.  Will Mr. O'Neill comment on that from the perspective of the chamber of commerce?

That is particularly focused on research and development functions and supports at third level.  I am not 100% sure of this statistic but my colleague Ms Katie Daughen might comment, that roughly about 25% of academics in the United Kingdom come from outside the common travel area.  Straight away there are issues in terms of the potential academics going to work in the university sector but also the research work they do and in many respects, the money follows the academics, not the other way.  There is an opportunity within that sector.  I contend strongly that there is an opportunity for Irish universities to partner with UK universities to actually build a constructive future for themselves to be an European base and UK base, because the United Kingdom will still be a source of a significant amount of funding in the context of that.  Our patron, Mr. Niall FitzGerald, the former chairman of Unilever and other companies across the UK who many will know is a man of strong Irish conviction and Munster rugby conviction is a very strong proponent of this idea that the UK universities, in his role as the chair of the Leverhulme Trust, will support each other and in that context will seek European support.

Mr. O'Neill stated that the UK looks for the ability to set out its own migration policy.  That is something that Mr. O'Neill has dealt with in his own paper.  Freedom of movement is one of the four freedoms of the European Union and it is a crucially important freedom.  I would not want, and I do not think that any members, as EU citizens, would want that provision to be watered down by way of a deal.  I was struck in particular by the British Prime Minister's comments in China yesterday when she spoke about their being a different level of access for EU citizens post the transition period.  I think that is a most unhelpful remark by her and is probably or may be playing towards the hard wing of her party, particularly over the political differences that have come to the fore in the past week.  In advance of the phase two negotiations that seems to be hardening of that stance.  I would not accept both as a Member of the Oireachtas and an EU citizen that we could enter into an arrangement that would effectively mean we will allow Britain to restrict the freedom of movement of EU citizens because of any deal we would do with it.  Immigration and migration was the issue, not global Britain.  A person in Sunderland was not worried about Britain increasing its trade with China.  Again, Mr O'Neill is asking how we square that circle.<\/p> <p>  Both Mr. O'Neill and Ms Daughen have consistently and rightly mentioned that although the UK is our number one trading partner we have diversified greatly and are not nearly as reliant on trade with Britain, but do they remind the British as well that we are their fifth biggest market and that we run a trade deficit with the British too?  I have been at pains to remind colleagues in Britain and some are astonished at that fact.  I watched Boris Johnson last year berating an audience in India, saying that the UK was doing more trade with Ireland than they were with India but that is a reality.  How do British business and politics react to that?  We need to rebalance that.  We need to have a position to come out as a partner and not as a junior partner, in that we need them but they also need us.<\/p> <p>  I will leave it at that, but there are so many other points we could raise.

That is not because we think it is the best for business.  We think the absolute best outcome for business would be for the UK to remain in the Single Market and the customs union, but politically we do not believe that is achievable at present, which is why we are putting forward the best Plan B, which is what our big principles proposal really is.<br\/><br\/>We agree that the movement of people is by far the most politically sensitive issue within the UK.  What we are proposing in terms of the customs arrangement largely relies on the trade of goods and we are seeing the UK can set its own migration policy within limits.  We are also proposing that it be coupled with a comprehensive deal on services.<br\/><br\/>The more the UK wants to have alignment with the EU on services and trade into the EU, the more there will be conditions around that mainly to do with the movement of people.  If one is selling a service into a different market, one needs to be able to travel there to sell that service.  Likewise things such as the future Framework Programme 9 that will replace Horizon 2020 will also rely on whether the UK wants to remain party to the movement of academics and so on.  It will be down to how much the UK wants access to services.  If one looks at CETA, which is by far the most comprehensive deal the EU has signed with a non-European country, the trade and services covered in it are quite limited but it does allow for some procurement and investment and things like that which would allow people selling those services to travel.  At the other end of the spectrum is the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, DCFTA, that the EU has with Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, that is done through the adoption of the EU <i>acquis<\/i>.  There are models that are not fully reliant on the freedom of movement.  We do not think the UK would probably get that, given that this is seen as more towards accession rather than leaving.  There are models that can be worked with.  From a business perspective there are labour needs in the UK that are currently being filled by EU citizens.  I think Scotland, especially, has serious concerns because of the demographics around its workforce.  We will advocate as this is such a strong issue and politically sensitive one.<\/p><p>The UK can have control over freedom of movement.  Much of that will depend on what deal is struck on services as well.  Outside that we will advocate strongly to the UK Government in its own domestic migration services to ensure that businesses that need access to labour get it.  There are other ways around it, but we cannot ignore the fact that this is a hugely politically sensitive issue in the UK.  That is why it is factored into our proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018020100002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Katie Daughen","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517479200,"counter":799,"content":"<p>I wish to pick up on Deputy O'Brien's point about trade.

As general secretary of the Psychiatric Nurses Association, I would like to highlight my concerns in relation to the future of mental health care in Ireland.  The inadequacies and underinvestment in the current provision of mental health services is something the PNA has consistently drawn attention to and I would hope that the interest of the committee in this area will help to address the many gaps in the mental health services that exist throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  In 1984, the first major mental health policy, Planning for the Future, was published, recommending the development of community services to coincide with the closure of hospital beds.  The closure of a large number of beds occurred but very limited community services were provided, as outlined in the table in my submission.<\/p> <p>  In 2006 A Vision for Change was published with recommendations to close more beds and develop comprehensive community services.  The policy envisioned an active, flexible and community-based mental health service where the need for hospital admission would be greatly reduced.  It would require substantial funding but there was considerable equity in building and lands within the mental health system, which could be realised to fund the plan.  The report recommended that steps be taken to bring about the closure of all mental hospitals and to reinvest the resources released by these closures in the mental health service.<\/p> <p>  The report, An Impact Evaluation of \"Vision for Change\" (Mental Health Policy) on Mental Health Service Provision, phase 1, 2016, which was commissioned by the PNA and completed by the faculty of nursing and midwifery of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, aimed to explore the extent to which the principles and practices enshrined in A Vision for Change have been realised and implemented over the past decade.  While the study participants identified a multiplicity of prerequisites for the full implementation of A Vision for Change, their top priorities were identified as: comprehensive staffing and resourcing of community-based services; the provision of 24\/7 crisis home care teams; the development of crisis houses; developing alternatives to hospital admission; the establishment of rehabilitation assertive outreach teams in all mental health services; and regional intensive care units to be established as per A Vision for Change.<\/p> <p>  The PNA-RCSI study 2016 clearly shows that 76% of beds were closed but only 30% of the community services were provided.  The table in my submission outlines the reduction in beds since Planning for the Future.  In 1984, there were 12,484 beds; in 2004, just two years prior to A Vision for Change, there were 4,173 beds; and in 2016, there were 1,002 beds.  In percentage terms, between 1984 and 2016, there was a drop of 92% and between 2004 and 2016, there was a drop of 76%.<\/p> <p>  It is very evident that the necessary agreed closure of inpatient beds has not coincided with a well-developed and resourced comprehensive community-based alternative in line with the national policy.  As outlined in the table in my submission the stark reduction in funding coincides with the timeline of both policies, clearly indicating that both policies have been used as cost-cutting measures.  The findings indicate that there has been a significant failure to implement national policy and clearly indicate that this failure has a very significant impact on the quality of mental health services and care available to the public.  The report concludes that unless the community-based mental health service is fully staffed and resourced the system will continue to malfunction and fail to meet the needs of its users, people with mental health needs and mental illness, an already vulnerable cohort in society.<\/p> <p>  The table in my submission indicates the mental health budget as a percentage of the health budget.  In 1984, coinciding with the table in my submission, this was 14%; in 2004, it was 7.34%; and in 2015, it was 6%.  A Vision for Change estimated it would require a budget share of 8.4%, at a minimum.<\/p> <p>  In the UK and Australia, the mental health services percentage of the health budget is between 12% and 14%.  It is imperative that the mental health budget as a percentage of the health budget is significantly increased.  Research would show that one in four people develop a mental health problem in their lifetime equating to 25% of the population, yet over 6% of the health budget is allocated to mental health.<\/p> <p>  Another key factor in the lack of service development is the crisis in recruitment and retention of psychiatric nurses.  In December 2016, HSE figures showed that there were 885 psychiatric nurses over the age of 55 and 867 nurses between the ages of 50 and 54.  Under fast accrual potentially 885 psychiatric nurses may retire immediately, while a further 867 may retire within the next five years, a total of 1,752, which equates to 34.2% of the mental health nursing workforce.  The headcount as of September 2017 was 4,746.  These figures would suggest that there are 374 vacancies but a recent survey of PNA branches suggests vacancies are closer to 500.  Services with high levels of vacancies are: the Tallaght-St. Loman&rsquo;s service, Dublin, with 43 vacancies which equates to over 20% of the whole-time equivalents, WTEs, St. Joseph&rsquo;s, Portrane, with 58 vacancies, which is over 20%; Waterford with 26 vacancies, which is over 19%; and Louth-Meath with 34 vacancies, which is over 16%.  When we factor in the service developments as outlined in A Vision for Change, which have not yet been implemented, there is a requirement for the provision of an additional 700 plus nurses.<\/p><p>When the service developments outlined in A Vision for Change and not yet implemented are factored in, the requirement for additional nurses reaches more than 700.  A Vision for Change recommended between ten and 15 nurses per assertive outreach team.  Calculated on the basis of one team per 100,000 population, this requirement alone would equate to 675 nurses where there are 45 teams with 15 nurses per team.  Figures from the Health Service Executive revealed that by August 2017, only 93 new staff had been recruited in that year to date, despite soaring demand in all areas of the mental health services and the HSE's admission that 1,963-new posts had to be filled if the level of staffing required in A Vision for Change was to be achieved.<\/p><p> I will provide some examples of the impact of nursing shortages on service provision.  In May 2017, 50% of the admission beds in Linn Dara child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in Dublin were closed until the end of October.  This meant 11 of the 22 beds at the facility were closed as a direct result of nursing shortages as the service was short 50% of its nursing complement.  A Vision for Change recommended 100 CAMHS beds nationally.  Following the closure of beds in Linn Dara, bed numbers nationally declined to 52 and currently stand at 63.<\/p><p> The construction of the new national children's hospital is a welcome development.  The new hospital will have 20 beds for child and adolescent mental health, eight of which will be dedicated to a service for eating disorders.  However, considering the difficulties in recruiting and retaining nursing staff in the child and adolescent mental health services, this development will also create some challenges.<\/p><p> As a result of the failure to provide assertive outreach teams and intensive care rehabilitation units, ICRUs, more than 16% of beds are occupied by patients who were admitted more than six months previously.  As a consequence of the 76% reduction in beds and the lack of community services, significant demand on beds has resulted in bed usage reaching 120% in many areas.  To give an example of this excessive demand, service users in Waterford and Kilkenny regularly resort to sleeping on chairs because beds are not available.  This means a person admitted during the day may be informed that he or she will have to spend the night on two chairs in a corner.  Also in Waterford, service managers proposed to suspend parental leave and cancel annual leave for four weeks over the Christmas period owing to nursing shortages.<\/p><p> The Tallaght-St. Loman's mental health services have 43 nursing vacancies.  As a consequence, the assertive outreach team, which should have 45 nurses as per A Vision for Change, had 13 nurses last year.  This figure has since declined to eight.  This is a vital service for those with an enduring mental illness if we are to ensure that service users can live as independently as possible in the community.  The diminution of this service will ultimately result in an increase in the number of admissions among this client group.  As a result of staffing shortages, the same service proposed to close its six-bed high observation unit at the end of December 2017.  This is a unit for those with an acute mental illness who require a higher level of observation.<\/p><p> In County Kerry, the home based team recommended in A Vision for Change has been disbanded.  St. Joseph's intellectual disability and mental health services has 58 nursing vacancies and relies heavily on overtime and agency work.  This has a significant impact on the continuity of care for clients.<\/p><p> I will refer to some examples of challenges in recruitment.  The figures presented in the submission show the purchasing power parity ratio, PPPR, in main destination countries for Irish nurses.  Based on the staff nurse salary minimum point of the scale, the hourly rates using the PPPR are 27.13 in Canada, 21.10 in Australia, 16.66 in Ireland and 19.87 in the United once the high cost area supplement available in Britain is factored in.  Moreover, all nurses in the UK commence employment on the second point of the salary scale in recognition of the nursing degree qualification and are recruited to areas where the high cost area supplement automatically applies.<\/p><p> According to the Department of Health, the top five destinations for Irish nurses emigrating are Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and New Zealand.  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland found that a total of 1,343 nurses and midwives sought certificates of current professional status in 2017.  These documents verify qualifications and are sought by nurses when they intend to work overseas.  They provide a strong indication of a nurse's intention to work abroad.<\/p><p> The UK has 24,000 nursing vacancies and the figure is expected to increase after Brexit.  Mr. Jim Campbell, director of the World Health Organization's workforce department, speaking at the global forum on human resources for health in Dublin in November 2017, raised concerns that, post-Brexit, the UK may try to fill gaps left by migrant health workers from the European Union by attracting nurses from Ireland under the traditional UK-Ireland bilateral agreement.  The UK is offering packages such as &euro;8,000 relocation costs, which is more than five times higher than the figure offered in the HSE's Bring them Home campaign.  They also offer educational opportunities, low cost accommodation and a 37.5 hour week.  Mental health nurses are in significant demand in the UK and other countries and services in these locations are offering relocation and incentive packages to attract Irish nurses.  The HSE Bring them Home campaign in 2015, which offered a relocation package of &euro;1,500, attracted only six psychiatric nurses to return to Ireland. <\/p><p> Domestically, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin, starts all graduates on the second point of the scale.  A welcome package of &euro;3,000 is also on offer, with &euro;1,500 paid after six months and a further &euro;1,500 paid after 12 months.  Nurses in St. Patrick's Hospital work a 37.5 hour week and are not subject to the pension levy.<\/p><p> The work environment for psychiatric nurses is characterised by overcrowding, staff shortages, the failure to implement service developments as per A Vision for Change, poor job satisfaction, workplace stress, a lack of cohesion and continuity of care, an unsustainable workload, an acuity of symptoms among service users due in part to a lack of community development, a lack of career opportunities and incidences of violence and aggression.  These factors help explain poor nurse retention rates.<\/p><p> There are also significant delays in the HSE recruitment process, which can take between four and six months to complete.<\/p><p>At a time of recruitment crisis, these delays are inefficient and unacceptable.  Authority needs to be delegated to the community health care organisation, CHO, areas to speed up this process.  In the UK, the professional qualifications of the nurse are recognised, with the first point of the nurse&rsquo;s scale higher than the maximum of the HSE scale.  In the UK, the nurse is recruited at the same level as the therapy grades - physiotherapists, occupational therapists, podiatrists etc.  In Ireland, the nurse is treated as a lesser professional than the therapy grades.<\/p><p> Please note the comparative salaries.  A staff nurse on the first point of the scale earns &euro;29,122 whereas someone on the first point of the therapy grade scale earns &euro;34,969.  There is almost &euro;6,000 in the difference.  The midpoint for a staff nurse is &euro;37,129 whereas it is &euro;43,191 for someone in a therapy grade.  The 12th point of the scale for a staff nurse is &euro;43,754 while it is &euro;48,851 for someone in a therapy grade.  The long-service increment for a staff nurse is &euro;45,086 compared with &euro;51,033 for someone in a therapy grade.  When one factors in that those in therapy grades work a 37 hour week while staff nurses work a 39 hour week, there is a difference of 20% in their hourly rates.  It is the view of the PNA that the staff nurse scale must commence at a point equivalent to that of therapy grades.  Having regard to the comparable minimum qualifications, that is, an honours degree, and the role and responsibilities of the posts, the salary scale for therapy grades should be applied in its entirety to nurses.  The development of the staff nurse scale in this way would enhance recruitment and retention.<\/p><p> The mental health service is in dire need of psychiatric nurses and other professionals who will join and stay in the public system after qualifying.  One of the most significant consequences of the recession and of the decisions of Government in cutting public service pay, introducing the graduate scheme and enforcing a recruitment embargo was the creation of a culture of graduate emigration.  For those who were unable to emigrate or who chose to remain at home, the private sector continues to offer exciting and financially rewarding opportunities.<\/p><p> The current crisis in nursing is forecast to get significantly worse over the next few years.  Should the Public Service Pay Commission fail to recommend remedial pay measures, then the chance for this country to resolve this crisis will be lost for a generation, with horrendous implications for the delivery and development of mental health services and patient care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018020100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Hughes","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517493600,"counter":812,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hughes.

This is probably the most damning document I have seen in the two years I have been in the D&aacute;il.  It is even worse when one sees it in black and white, word by word and statistic by statistic, because behind every statistic is a person who has been neglected and left behind by the State.  It is damning beyond belief.  I can only imagine the morale among psychiatric nurses at the moment.  It must be on the floor when one considers their pay and conditions.  It is damning of our society that this has been allowed to happen.  Some people do not want to hear it, but the reason that these decisions are being made and that this document has been produced is that people and governments have made political choices.  They have to live with themselves.  Some of them do.  They can live with themselves while neglecting people like this.<\/p> <p>  I want to clarify some elements of the presentation.  On inpatient beds in mental health services, it seems that a shocking amount of mental health beds were lost in that 30 year period.  Will Mr. Hughes clarify that?  I am sure there is some sort of proper answer.  In Linn Dara in the area in which I live, 11 beds were lost in the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  It is just not acceptable.  Sometimes one runs out of adjectives.  Things are so accepted and routine.  What really drives me mad is that politicians have reached a crescendo speaking about mental health services and trying to bring them together, but when it is put in black and white it is terrible to see.  Obviously pay and conditions are pretty bad in comparison with those of other grades.  I acknowledge the work of psychiatric nurses and nursing staff.  We do not want to play down their role because they are on the front line.  Will Mr. Hughes clarify these issues, particularly the loss of beds, the other units which have closed and the mental health spend?<\/p> <p>  The spend is crucial to the whole issue.  A Vision for Change advocates that 8.24% of the health budget be spent on mental health, but we are nowhere near that.  People can say that there were years of recession, but the economy is on the up, as people are saying, and that should inform the percentage we expend on mental health.  This will keep going on and on until we address it politically and deal with front-line staff.  It is great that Mr. Hughes has brought this issue in here.  Will things change?  I hope so, but they will only change if political choices are made.  If they are not made, we will still be here in five years.  A Vision for Change was ten years ago.  Have most of its recommendations been implemented?   Very few have.  Reports just gather dust.  It is a damning report.  I am sure that many people were neglected and let down by our mental health service over that period.  It is a shame that this is ongoing, that it has happened and that it probably will happen.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. Hughes address those issues, especially pay and conditions, the loss of mental health beds and what can be done?  We do not want to come out of here depressed out of our minds.  We want to say what can be done logistically and collectively, even though I have said that these are political choices.  Something like mental health is so serious that we try not to be political about it, but sometimes we have to be.  These are choices.  As a country, how do we address the issues I have just outlined?  How can we right the terrible wrongs outlined in this document?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018020100002#E00300","speaker":"1299"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517493600,"counter":814,"content":"<p>The reduction in bed numbers resulted from the closing of the large institutions.  We had almost 12,500 beds in 1984.  As I said, the Government policies in 1984 and 2006 were both intended to close beds and introduce comprehensive community services.  Our research shows that in the ten years since A Vision for Change was published, over 70% of beds were closed and only 30% of the community resource was put in.  With the closure of the large institutions, the money raised from the sale of lands and the staff resources of the institutions were supposed to move to the community to provide comprehensive 24-7 crisis services, outreach services and intensive care rehabilitation units. Those never materialised.  As we see, in the same timeframe, the percentage of the health budget allocated to mental health services decreased.  Had the budget even stayed at 13%, as it was in 1984, we would probably have an excellent mental health service.<\/p><p> I started my career in the early 1980s in St. Brendan's Hospital when there were 12,000 beds in the system.  There is no longer a hospital on the St. Brendan's site, although a new unit with 52 beds has been built on it, and development of community services in the area has been minimal.  At that time, we were told nothing could be done with the old hospital because it was an old Victorian building.  It is now a state-of-the-art Dublin Institute of Technology complex.  I live near the area, and when I walk through the site, I cannot believe the transformation that has taken place.  When people lived in the building, it was an absolute disgrace.  It is now a beautiful place as a result of investment.  While a brand new unit has been built on the site, there has been, as I stated, very little development of community mental health services.<\/p><p> Psychiatric nurses initially embraced A Vision for Change.  The result, however, was the removal of beds from the system without an alternative being provided to the hospital mission.  That is the sad part of it.  We are now being told there is no budget available, yet there are still opportunities.  For example, there are lands available in places such as St. Senan's hospital in Wexford, and Portlaoise.  Why can the revenue raised from the sale of these lands not be reinvested in mental health services?  This was done on a smaller scale in the St. Loman's-Tallaght service where I also worked.  When part of the land of the old St. Loman's hospital campus was sold, a sum of, I believe, &euro;28 million was ring-fenced for mental health services.  As a result, the primary care centre in Ballyfermot now also provides mental health services and two new 17 bed hostels have been built.  Resources were provided when money from sales was reinvested.  The problem, however, is that the cost of living in Dublin, among other factors, makes it difficult to attract staff to work in the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018020100002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Hughes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517493600,"counter":816,"content":"<p>It has been suggested that the Department is unable to spend its mental health budget because of difficulties with recruitment.

There are also ways of attracting staff to work in services.  What is happening is there is a continuous flow of the work environment, meaning the more one works short-staffed, the more frustrated and demoralised staff become.  We must create a good working environment and also address the pay issue.  I cited the example of a private service in Dublin.  Other private companies are paying newly qualified psychiatric nurses &euro;25 per hour, which equates to approximately &euro;50,000 as a basic annual salary.  Nurses only need to move to the United Kingdom and they will receive a relocation package of &euro;8,000.<\/p> <p>  We must consider providing subsidised accommodation.  We made a proposal, as part of a pre-budget submission and separately to the pay commission, to include some subsidised staff accommodation in Portrane where the new national forensic hospital is being built.  While I am not an expert in construction, add-ons to major construction projects do not cost much.  One could impose conditions on staff moving into subsidised accommodation, for example, requiring them to move out after a maximum of five years.  This proposal, if implemented, would attract staff.<\/p> <p>  As I outlined, there are 58 vacancies in the Portrane service and almost 30 vacancies on the mental health side.  It is difficult to attract people to work in that area.  The majority of those who work in the forensic mental health service live on the southside of Dublin or in County Wicklow.  If these staff are expected to move to Portrane, we must consider the provision of subsidised accommodation or some sort of allowance.  We must also address the pay element.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018020100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Hughes"},{"type":"speech","time":1517493600,"counter":818,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Hughes aware of a model elsewhere in the world where accommodation has been provided for hospital staff?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018020100002#F00400","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517493600,"counter":819,"content":"<p>In the United Kingdom, the NHS is building 20,000 units for staff as we speak.

Before demolishing a building, why not wait until we are ready to build on the site?  This building could have been utilised for staff or homeless accommodation or another purpose.

A lot of temporary nurses and graduate nurses were made permanent and we increased the number of undergraduates.  We also got a postgraduate course up and running.  A feasibility study has been completed on those who have a degree in psychology or social science etc. moving into psychiatric nursing by way of possibly a two-year course to get an honours degree in psychiatric nursing.

Are there any statistics on people from other jurisdictions, who would have trained in other areas, and have come to work in Ireland?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018020100002#J01500","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1517493600,"counter":891,"content":"<p>We are all aware of the difficulties in recruiting people into the public services.  However, the facts and figures presented by Mr. Hughes are of extreme concern.  We could hear a pin drop we were all so taken aback.  The word demoralising has been used but I would suspect it is heartbreaking for health professionals to work in a situation where they are reduced to saying that a chair is a bed.  They are highly trained professionals.<\/p> <p>  If we look at 34% being eligible for retirement in five years, we are facing a mental health time bomb.  I refer to 500 vacancies in psychiatric nursing and 1,343 trained nurses and midwives having sought certificates of current professional status because they are going to go overseas.  It is incredible.  However, if people are working in a system with low pay, appalling working conditions and they are undervalued, why would they stay?  They are so valued abroad.  <\/p> <p>  It is obvious that the issue of pay and conditions needs to be addressed and quickly.  Do the members of the PNA reference any other barriers or disincentives?  I refer to people in Waterford being told that parental or annual leave may have to be suspended.  Are career progression, cost of living and work life balance issues that come up?  What can be done to address those issues?  What services and supports are in place for our mental health professionals?

We can increase our training numbers as much as we like but we are in a global market.  We can train 1,000 psychiatric nurses.  However, that does not mean 1,000 psychiatric nurses are going to stay in our health system because it is dysfunctional.<\/p> <p>  What structural change does the PNA see as necessary within the health service in general and the mental health services in particular?  I refer to recruitment and retention.  As Deputy Neville said also, I do not think that it is all salary.  It is career progression, job satisfaction, and being valued within the service.  There is huge problem of demoralisation and demoralised staff are quite inefficient in the service that they deliver.  We have looked at this and all these issues in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  There needs to be structural change within the HSE to demand accountability and responsibility but also to put in supports for staff.   Bricks and mortar are important but the human resource in our health service is the most important part. <\/p> <p>  What supports, as Deputy Martin asked, are there to value a staff member and to prevent them leaving the service?  Many people leave the service and there is no exit survey to ask why.  If there was an attrition rate in a commercial company that we have in our health service, one would wonder what was wrong with that company that was allowing so many people to haemorrhage.  What structural changes does the PNA see in the HSE that could stop this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018020100002#J01700","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1517493600,"counter":893,"content":"<p>I express an interest, being very closely aligned with the PNA.  I welcome the witnesses.  I am delighted to see the response around this table.  We have been raising this issue for years and have not got this message out of how desperate the situation is in our mental health services.<\/p> <p>  I want to go back on a few points.  I talked a lot in past committee meetings.  I disagree with Deputy Neville.  We live with the legacy of the yellowpack offer now.  The nurses forced out at that time will not come back.  They will not come back under any circumstances.  It is to do with Mr. Tony O'Brien never saying sorry.  Those nurses are in Australia and the UK.  I disagree as well with Deputy Harty that it is global.  Global goes both ways.  Why are we not getting people from other countries and not necessarily our Irish nurses back?  Something is lacking.  Pay is one part of it, along with accommodation.  However, I also refer to educational opportunities and using the skills that we have.<\/p> <p>  I wish to talk about generic nursing when it was mooted.  I know the Chair has asked that question about other health care workers filling the gap.  The Government wanted to scrap psychiatric nursing in its entirety some years ago and just have generic nursing.  We fought really hard for it.<\/p><p>Research from around the world, in particular in Australia, shows that services for psychiatric patients have decreased and there is a lack of expertise, which has a negative effect on the experience and chance of recovery for patients.<\/p><p> A home-based scheme with outreach teams has operated in Cavan-Monaghan for a while.  The initiative has led to a 72% reduction in the number of admissions to psychiatric hospitals.  The 24-7 service has tried to replicate that success throughout the country.  It would be great if people were a lot more knowledgeable about the home-based scheme.<\/p><p> I want to say to Mr. Hughes that if any business anywhere is 120% over capacity, then health and safety should be called in.  Can the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, be called upon to resolve this matter?  Unfortunately, one cannot do so because morally one cannot shut down services, and in some cases they have been shut down.  If an organisation in any other sector was 120% over capacity, it would be deemed dangerous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018020100002#J01800","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517493600,"counter":895,"content":"<p>This part of the meeting has run over time.

They highlighted the fact that it takes more than a certain salary to attract people back.  I think a salary can act as a huge incentive.  As Senator Devine has said, the graduates who were part of the graduate scheme would have some reservations about returning home.  I hope that we will get them back.  We must develop services, make them attractive and provide promotional opportunities.  I also wish to mention subsidised accommodation, but we cannot provide same.<\/p> <p>  Earlier I spoke about the purchasing power parity, PPP, ratio in different countries.  Ireland is below the PPP ratio.  One can talk about the cost of living in cities like Sydney and London, but when one applies the PPP ratio, in terms of an hourly rate, one can see that Ireland is still below.  Ireland does not measure up to the other countries in that respect.  In other countries one has greater purchasing power or one's money goes further.  That is one element.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Martin mentioned services in Waterford, how demoralised the staff there are, and people sleeping in beds.  There has been very little community development in the area but it is not the only one.  The alternative to hospital admission is to constantly keep pressure on bed capacity in the area.  Waterford now takes all admissions since the psychiatric unit in Wexford closed bar a small number of admissions from Gorey upwards that travel to Newcastle.  There are extra pressures now.  As has been done all along, beds were closed quickly without resources being allocated to communities.<\/p> <p>  I know I have harked on about a 24-7 service.  In Australia a 24-7 service has been provided for 30 years and the UK has had one for the past 25 years, but this country does not have even one such service.  This country is way behind.  Years ago I worked in Australia as part of a team to provide 24-7 care.  This country does not even have a service that resembles that and the closest we have is a few home-based teams.  Senator Devine referenced the scheme in the Cavan-Monaghan district, which has proved successful.  Has the scheme been replicated anywhere else in this country?  No.  The relevant authority seems to have adopted the view that the scheme worked once but it will not work anywhere else.  That seems to be an issue.<\/p> <p>  We go to services and look for any developments as per the national policy document, A Vision for Change, or the next version of same, but the providers can say they do not believe in the model.  We need the national policy to be applied consistently and standardised.  We should roll out schemes nationwide that have been proven to work.  That is why I have called for a 24-7 service to be rolled out in two rural areas and two urban areas on a pilot basis.  If the scheme works, it can be rolled out nationally and, therefore, become the national standard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018020100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Hughes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517493600,"counter":897,"content":"<p>The committee will write a letter to Mr. Hughes and his organisation seeking answers to a few questions, which will help us compile our report.

It is now estimated that half of all people will experience a mental illness in their lifetime, and approximately one in five working age adults suffers from mental ill health at any given time.  Mental health issues have been shown to have serious and detrimental consequences with people suffering from chronic, enduring mental health problems having shorter life expectancies by between ten to 20 years.  Prevalence of mental health disorders in children and adolescents is also growing with studies showing the prevalence of diagnosable mental disorders as one in six in young teenagers.  Mental health disorders in childhood are a strong predictor of mental health disorders in later life.  Good outcomes are most likely if children and young people have timely access to advice, assessment and treatment.<\/p> <p>  Recruitment and retention of medical staff is a major issue across our health services including within our mental health services, specifically.  The recruitment and retention of psychiatric consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors is a significant concern.  This lack of recruitment leads to variations in access to services with excessive waiting times for outpatient assessments, high usage of locum staff with consequent impacts on budgets and continuity of care, and access to child and adolescent mental health services has reached a critical point with under-resourcing and difficulties recruiting and retaining medical staff leaving young people and their families particularly vulnerable.  In 2016, the Mental Health Commission reported that the most cited challenge facing Community Health Organisations was the recruitment and retention of staff across all specialties with particular difficulty in recruiting consultant psychiatrists in child and adolescent psychiatry.  While HSE figures suggest that general adult community health teams across the country operate at 78% staffing levels, psychiatry of old age teams at 58% and child and adolescent mental health teams at 53%, the sharing of staff, overtime hours worked and the filling of key consultant positions by locum staff render the full extent of understaffing difficult to quantify.  The HSE, in its quarterly performance report from July to September 2017, highlighted difficulties in the recruitment and retention of skilled medical staff as a significant challenge to the provision of mental health services with high agency costs having a significant budgetary impact on community healthcare organisations.  In particular, the HSE highlighted recruitment and retention of medical staff to child and adolescent mental health teams as a key factor contributing to waiting lists in excess of 12 months in CHO 1, which comprises Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan, and CHO 3, which is the mid-west, including, Clare, Limerick and Tipperary, CHO 4, including Cork and Kerry, and CHO 8, including Laois, Offaly, Longford, Westmeath, Louth and Meath.  It also highlighted recruitment and retention of staff as contributing to difficulties reducing the number of children admitted to psychiatric units.<\/p> <p>  Only 67 child and adolescent mental health teams are in existence out of the 95 recommended in A Vision for Change with many not working at full capacity.  Just 66 inpatient child and adolescent beds are available, a figure that falls far below the 100 beds that were required as a matter of urgency in 2006.  Since 2006, there has been a population increase of approximately 200,000 of those aged less than 18 years, an increase of approximately 21%, generating even greater need.  Furthermore, inpatient beds are available only in the major urban centres of Cork, Dublin, and Galway.  This often places treatment options far from the homes of patients in more remote areas of the country.  No inpatient beds for child and adolescent mental health services exist in the country's north west, south west, south east, or the midlands, nor in the State's third most populous city, Limerick.  Where referrals are required for patients in these regions, they must be sent to already facilities which are already under pressure in Cork, Dublin, or Galway.  If we are serious about putting mental health on a par with physical health, serious action must be taken by the HSE to address the recruitment and retention crisis affecting both consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors in our health services.<\/p> <p>  It is little wonder that the health services in Ireland experience pronounced difficulties in recruiting and retaining medical staff when both remuneration and working conditions lag significantly behind those available elsewhere in the English-speaking world.  Independent research on the emigration of health professionals from Ireland has found that &ldquo;much recent emigration has been driven by dissatisfaction with working conditions in the health system and uncertain career progression opportunities, aggravated by austerity-related staff reductions, salary reductions and taxation increases\".  This research also indicated that the overwhelming majority of those who leave do not plan to return to Ireland, and experience superior working conditions, training, professional opportunities, and pay abroad.  Simply put, no solution can be found to the staffing issues within the mental health services without services that are appropriately resourced to deliver patient care in a safe environment; competitive remuneration of consultant and non-consultant doctors compared to international levels in English speaking countries; adequate clinical and other supports; increased educational and training supports; and enhanced and improved work-life balance.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Dr. Ray Walley will address the issues of general practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018020100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matthew Sadlier"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517493600,"counter":913,"content":"<p>General practitioners, GPs, are often the first point of contact for those suffering from mental illness.  International best practice suggests that the majority of emotional and psychological problems, such as anxiety disorders and mild to moderate depression, can be adequately managed by GPs in the community without referral to specialist mental health services.<\/p><p>The value of psychological therapies, including counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy, psychotherapy and group therapy, is widely recognised in the treatment of patients with mental health issues.  There is increasing evidence that exercise is effective in the treatment of mild depression and anxiety.  It is recommended in A Vision for Change that all individuals should have access to a comprehensive range of interventions in primary care for disorders that do not require specialist mental health services.  Failure to provide adequate counselling, psychotherapeutic and occupational therapy services and support in primary care can therefore lead to an over-reliance on drug therapy or unnecessary referral to equally under-resourced specialist mental health services.  Current counselling in primary care services are provided to adult medical card holders only.  Meanwhile children and those entitled to a doctor visit card are left reliant on the private system where the cost is often prohibitive and where the regulation of counsellors and therapists is only now being introduced. <\/p><p> Our GPs describe the situation in our CAMHS as \"heart sink\".

Jigsaw, which works in my area, is the one I am most familiar with.  I give the caveat that I am not a specialist child psychiatrist.  I am an adult psychiatrist.  Our statutory mental health services were designed at a time when mental health services dealt with what we would now call severe and enduring mental health problems, specifically issues of schizophrenia, learning disabilities and severe levels of illness.  We are now dealing with issues of mental health as opposed to mental illness, if we can make that distinction.  Issues of distress and anxiety have moved into the realm of the treatment zone as psychotherapies in these sorts of things have advanced and have been found to be beneficial in these areas.<\/p> <p>  Is there a middle ground between primary care and specialist secondary psychiatric care?  There can be and there are models that have worked elsewhere in the world.  However, for that to happen we would need to have very well-defined referral pathways.  We would need to have very well-defined middle-ground services with staff with adequate qualifications and adequate definitions of roles, which can be a problem in areas of non-statutorily defined roles such as nurse and doctor.  That is the difficulty with that middle-ground area.<\/p> <p>  At the moment people are generally seen by the specialist services initially.  This is certainly the case with adults.  Where we would see those over 18, these are in the teenage years, but the later teenage years.  We would divert some patients to wards if we felt they were not suitable for secondary services.  We have two choices.  We can run a service where patients get screened at the highest level of expertise first.  Then the specialist services will, for want of a better word, and I apologise, keep some people within their services and divert some people to services of a lower level of complexity or whatever terminology one wishes to use.

However, we are saying the service is heart sink.  Over the past three, four or five years there has been an improvement in the pathway methods in regard to child and adolescent mental health.  I agree with the Chairman that we are on a learning curve as well because much of the service is not there.  For example, only in recent years have we had things like a more defined early intervention team service with, it is hoped, support from speech therapy, occupational therapy and all the other therapies.  In some cases we would have sent people into CAMHS, but we were generally given feedback to direct them in a different way.<\/p> <p>  We recently had an email debate about CAMHS among our GP committee which highlighted that it is very difficult for even the moderate and severe patients whom we are referring in to get seen.  I know of two cases in north Dublin in the past seven days.  Obviously, I have to be careful about the details.  One of them was very young - under ten years - and one of them was young.  Basically, the GP in question discussed the case with the child and adolescent mental health consultant in the daytime and the advice was to send that case to Temple Street hospital, meaning that we could not get an appointment for a very severe case because they were under so much pressure.  The same happened with the older child.  These cases were identified as needing to see a psychiatric service.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Chairman that at the start of this referral system, since we were learning what to send and what not to send, there probably was an over-referral.  However, I cannot say it is there now.  Automatically, we have somebody coming in.  These are children.  Automatically, we feel for the family and for the patient.  We know automatically that the patient is on a long waiting list on a referral pattern.  Basically, such a patient will get a knock back.  If I make a referral, I know there will be at least one knock-back letter.<\/p><p>Then one is trying to engage with someone to say this is where we are going and some might come in but that is not a service.  They are very stretched with what they have.  Some of our referrals come from school principals who are already dealing with these issues and are involving the allied services within education and they are stretched too.

We sat for 11 months to discuss reforming the health service in general, resulting in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Issues such as this have been raised in that report.  It is eight months since the report's publication and it does not look as if it will be accepted as an implementation blueprint for reforming our health service.  Those are the indications we are getting from Government.<\/p> <p>  In the absence of a broad plan such as that, what do the witnesses see as the first step in reforming our health service?  We are speaking about recruitment and retention here.  Recruitment and retention of GPs is very important for the mental health services because generally we are the first port of call.  We will deal with most of those patients ourselves or refer them to a community psychiatric team, which should consist of a psychologist, a social worker, maybe cognitive behaviour therapy and a community psychiatric nurse, all the components make up a community team and many do not exist.  The posts are not filled.  Those places are vacant.  We spoke with the Psychiatric Nurses Association earlier and went through various reasons why people are not staying in the service.  They reckoned salary was the main problem.  I would think career progression, job satisfaction, being supported in their job and the morale of staff are problems.  They should be valued members of staff yet there does not seem to be a lot of support for them.  What do the witnesses feel is needed in respect of recruitment and retention of GPs, the allied services and consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors in psychiatric services? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018020100002#N01000","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517493600,"counter":938,"content":"<p>As someone who has worked in the health service for 19 years I would say it is a question of improvement not reform.  We have had so many reforms that I sometimes do not even know who I am working for.  I started working under health boards, then the HSE, then pillars, then community health care organisations and integrated service areas.  It is a question of incremental improvement to the services rather than another broad scale reform of the services.  That is my first visceral reaction.<\/p> <p>  To improve the services we have A Vision for Change for mental health care.  I would argue that mental health care has led out the Irish health care service for a long time.  There was an inspector of mental hospitals a long time before the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, was ever thought of to inspect general hospitals.  We have had reports on how the mental health care services should be organised since the late 1960s.  There was Planning for the Future in the 1980s and A Vision for Change in 2006.  It is a question of implementing the reports that are there.  The structures in A Vision for Change are excellent.  We divide the country into catchment areas.  There is a service that is accountable for every area, with community mental health care teams, whether for adults, old age or children.  The difficulty is in staffing those teams, the recruitment and the retention.<\/p> <p>  I cannot overstate how much damage the 30% cut to consultants' salaries, which was introduced unilaterally in 2012, inflicted on the Irish health care service.  It was felt by trainee doctors at the time as a direct assault on them.  We had experienced FEMPI cuts and cuts for new entrants across the public sector and various changes in terms and conditions but this one cut was imposed on one grade for reasons that nobody could really understand.  Nobody could work out what due diligence was done at the time or what were the expectations of this.  Since then we have gone from a system where consultant staff were easy to recruit.  The first consultant interview I ever sat for was in early 2012 and there were 37 applicants for three consultant posts in north Dublin.  There are now 22 vacant consultant posts and nobody applying for them.  That problem has not been solved.  There are three different salary scales for consultants.  People see that as a direct assault on them, their training and their expertise and they are unwilling to take a job where they will be working side by side with somebody who has the same level of expertise and responsibility and is expected to deliver the same workload but at a significantly different rate of remuneration.  Nobody would take up those jobs in a private company.<\/p> <p>  There are other issues in respect of funding training and education for non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs.  They used to have a training grant but now they have to self-fund a lot of training which is becoming more expensive.  They have to pay for various things out of their own salaries.  That could be improved by comparison with Australia and Canada where our doctors are going.  We work in an English-speaking health service and compete with New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom.  Other countries seem to have done better on issues regarding training and education and work-life balance.<\/p><p>Junior doctors here are still expected to work outside the European working time directive limits and we have difficulty in applying the maximum 24-hour shifts.

It was said that GPs aged over 60 now accounted for 30% of the workforce and we do not know if these will be replaced.  Before Christmas, we were told there were only 37 GPs in Kilkenny, 38 in Longford and 41 in Kildare and that last year was the first year ever that ten places on the GP training scheme were not filled.

The State is also doing what it should do and there is a good campaign, the Be a GP campaign, which got people interested.  The majority of the workload is done by GPs with a medical card contract, and there are only a small number of private GPs, just 266 out of a total of 2,540.  It is 40 years since Professor Barbara Starfield looked at best health care systems and found that, in the general practice-led European system, mainly in the form of the NHS and the Dutch system, morbidity rates and rates of medical complication were inversely proportional to the number of GPs.<\/p> <p>  The emphasis of general practice is continuity of care.  One knows one's GP and can talk to him or her.  Much of the service is from cradle to grave and that is still the emphasis of good health care systems.  In America at the time, and it is still the case, there was one cardiologist to 10,000 people but its mortality and morbidity rates were atrocious for a First World country.  The American health care system remains the system which one must not emulate.  It costs a fortune and one gets very little out of it in the way of reduced mortality and morbidity.<\/p> <p>  The idea was to have GP-led teams.  In my practice there are eight staff, including three GPs, one practice nurse and three secretaries.  As a business, we run on a 30% profit margin but under the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, we had a 40% cut in funding, meaning we automatically had to let staff go.  We had to constrain the practice to ensure we did not go bankrupt.  For the first time in the history of this State, 120 middle-aged GPs left the country with their families.  It is unheard of, but I remember a politician saying that doctors had always emigrated, a very flippant comment that just irritated people.  The cuts are still in place and, as a result, general practice has not been able to employ more staff.  It is now worse because the people who come off the training schemes are emigrating and it is difficult to get locums.  It is difficult to get holidays and that brings more stress to the system.  We are not as far gone as some European countries and we could still resuscitate the system.<\/p> <p>  I have no problem with blue-sky thinking but what I really want is evidence-based medicine, and my patients deserve that.  Blue-sky thinking is experimental but it costs a lot.  As a vocationally trained GP, my prescribing costs less than that of somebody who is not vocationally trained.  The system is based on managing a budget in an appropriate way and that is what happens in a practice.  The Irish College of General Practitioners provides organised continuing medical education.  We have the same programme, curriculum and methodology so that we treat people in the same way, although we all have different personalities.  Anything else is blue-sky thinking and I am concerned that it will cost more money if we do not fund what we should fund.<\/p> <p>  The health care system to copy is the Dutch system because they have developed general practice over 30 years.  They provide 10% to general practice and 10% to community care and they have 85% of their beds full at any one time.  They rotate and do not have problems with elective surgery.  I am sure the system is not perfect but it is the system to emulate.  They retain all their staff and have no training problems.  It is not exorbitantly expensive like the American system, where consultants and GPs can earn eye-watering money.  Dutch doctors are paid reasonable rates and they retain their staff.  The system works and the population is happy.  We are at Olympic standard when it comes to producing reports but we are at bronze medal level, or even at the bottom of the heap, in implementing things.  We implement nothing.  Patients in rural and urban deprivation often have a lack of reading and writing skills and cannot defend themselves.  We pay a fortune to fix these people because most of them are public patients.  If we carry out preventative medicine and save a person's life by persuading them to have a smear test, it is cheaper than if they get cervical cancer later on.  It is straightforward but we do not seem to get it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018020100002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ray Walley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517493600,"counter":942,"content":"<p>Health systems that have good primary care systems have taken decades to build up and it does not happen overnight.

At the time the average age of a general practitioner in Australia was also 52 years, which was looked upon as being old.  Markets like Australia then began to aggressively incentivise people to move there.  There is a difficulty in all countries in which English is spoken because they have an ageing medical workforce.  What can now be done in the health care sector is more complex.  People are also living longer.  There are statistics which show that a person aged over 70 years has so many comorbidities he or she requires more inputs by a doctor and so on.  All of the countries in which English is spoken are incentivising medical personnel to move and remain there.  I am a trainer under one of the general practitioner training schemes.  The modern day graduate is no different from the majority of those who are still working here, but what he or she wants is a work-life balance.  When a GP experiences a 40% reduction in turnover, the only person from whom he or she can get more is himself or herself.  As a result, he or she ends up arriving at work before the staff and leaving after them.  He or she will also take on fewer locums and assistants and do more of the work himself or herself.  Many practices have closed.  I know of one in which the GP employed an assistant who he had hoped would replace him when he moved on, but that practice has closed and the assistant has moved to Canada.  Only about 15% of practices in the country are operated single-handedly.  We moved to a double partnership and then to operations comprising three or four doctors.  We need to move to having practices that will have the least referral rates to hospitals.  The most expensive is an average practice with two to three GPs because they know their patients.  The problem is we do not use evidence based medicine.  Ireland is no different from Britain which, following the Second World War in which a swathe of people were killed, had to bring people in from the colonies.  It had to incentivise people to move into areas of deprivation and rural areas.  It had to design contracts in a certain way.  However it is done it will be expensive, but we have to do rather than talk about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018020100002#P02000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ray Walley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517493600,"counter":964,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt Dr. Walley, but I must allow Senator M&aacute;ire Devine in at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018020100002#P02100","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1517493600,"counter":965,"content":"<p>We know about the loss of nursing staff and this is probably due to the austerity cuts.

There was no foresight and the service shot itself in the foot.  We and in particular the kids with mental health issues are living with that today.<\/p><p>Previous witnesses said that if there are applicants the recruitment process takes too long.  It is too cumbersome and wrapped up with a lot of red tape.  They ask if the community health organisation, CHO, areas, did the recruitment directly would that significantly improve and speed up the process.  I am not sure whether the present witnesses can comment on that.  <\/p><p>The observation was made that in 1984 there were 14% entering the mental health area but now it is 6% yet the statistics here show a rise of 21%, at least in those younger than 18 years, since A Vision for Change came into being.  Mental health disorder in children and adolescents is growing with a prevalence of diagnosable mental disorders in our young people aged between one and six.  That scares the living bejesus out of me.  I do not believe our teenagers have such a high incidence. <\/p><p>Dr. Sadlier described the serious need for wraparound services which are important for the enduring, chronic mental illnesses, schizophrenia, bipolar, and that sort of stuff.  The Chairman touched on well-being and how we deal with that as opposed to putting the teenagers on this train that takes years to get them to a treatment they do not need but will need by the time they get there.  The idea is to have well-being ambassadors in communities.  Our well-being has to be community-led and owned.  How do we do that?  Dr. Sadlier asked who falls through the gaps, who is responsible and accountable when a person in serious need is missed.  There has to be a way to figure this out because we cannot continue to label one in six of our teenagers as mentally unwell.  They have issues with well-being and some have issues with mental health.  That will develop into difficulties.  <\/p><p>I am cynical about the influence of the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders<\/i>, DSM.  How often is it referred to?  It has grown since 1957 from 106 diagnosable mental health problems or illnesses to over 300 in its last publication.  On the back of it there is what I believe is disease-mongering.  It is in the interests of big pharmaceutical companies to have more diagnoses available so that they come up with a pill that will hopefully deal with some of the symptoms.  We have got so far in diagnosing to death all our foibles, all our sense of spontaneity and human traits that we need to separate them.  They are not problems unless they are causing the person who is living with them, or those around them, problems.  There has to be a much easier and more compassionate way to consider everyday difficulties that we all encounter as human beings, and to mind our children and make sure they get the well-being service wrapped around them, not necessarily the medication, the diagnoses and the waiting on the train for the wraparound mental health services.  We need to have much more community ownership of this.  Society needs to say it and not the DSM or big pharma guys.  That is my soapbox speech.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018020100002#Q00100","speaker":"1388"},{"type":"speech","time":1517493600,"counter":966,"content":"<p>Before the witnesses came in the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, gave a presentation and we were all shocked, except Senator Devine who has worked in that field.

The witnesses say that the failure to provide adequate counselling and psychotherapeutic and occupational therapist services in support and primary care can lead to an over-reliance on drug therapy.  There is an over-reliance on anti-depressants.  The number of people who come into my office and say they are on anti-depressants is incredible.  I am sure they are telling the truth.  There is an over-reliance on opiates as well.

When we say one in six teenagers and 50% of the population have a mental disorder some of that is phobias.  While I do not wish to be dismissive of people with those problems, it is not as serious as schizophrenia or illnesses like that and treatment is usually relatively straightforward and recovery rates are quite high.  They can be treated sometimes outside statutory services.  The Senator is absolutely right that we need to have sensible referral pathways and guidelines towards the treatment of these disorders.  There is an element of public information regarding the use of antidepressant medication.<\/p><p>As Dr. Walley said on the subject of antibiotics for illnesses, people tend to feel their problem is not being validated if they do not get a prescription for an antibiotic.  Public information is necessary to persuade people that not every problem requires medication and that alternatives are available.  Psychotherapy is often recommended but I would also recommend occupational therapy and a good study was done by the mental health service in north Dublin, where I was working, and the FAI into running a football programme.  It involved kick start football training one day per week and was found to be incredibly effective.  Such interventions, on the part of organisations such as the FAI, the IRFU or the GAA, have a community and social involvement and that can help.<\/p><p> Opiate services are our Cinderella services and we have called for drug detoxification units for a number of years, because they are lacking at the moment.

Some of my patients are just different and it would be very boring if everybody was the same.  As their GP, they have known me for a long time.  I give them the same advice about exercise and diet and the majority are not on medication.  Because they are given this advice by a professional, they are very relaxed about it.  Nuffield, a non-governmental organisation in the UK, looked at this issue following allegations that more prescribing was taking place and it decided that it was a good thing, as it meant people came early with mental health issues and that is what we want.<\/p> <p>  There are criteria under which one prescribes medication and one takes people off after a certain length of time but modern life is tough.  There are difficulties and that results in mental health issues.  They have been particularly evident during the ten years of the financial crisis in Ireland and the UK.  Professional journals provide evidence that the increase in prescribing was not unique to Ireland and the UK but also happened in America.  People are better educated and come to primary care and GP-community care more easily so we are giving more medication but we are also taking more medication away.  We are trying to get people to be more exercise-conscious because that can lead to a massive improvement in mental health.<\/p> <p>  I am a GP in the inner city and there is a lack of opiate services, with only 35 detox beds for a country of 4.7 million people, which is crazy.  Ritalin is a controlled drug and is consultant prescribed, meaning GPs do not prescribe it without it being reviewed by a clinic.  I am an interviewer on one of the HSE panels and we are often lucky to have applicants because there are many posts for which there are no applicants.  I trained in the UK and came back to apply for my post in north Dublin as one of 72 applicants.  I came in at No. 4 but the people ahead of me were older and decided not to come back.  We train excellent graduates which other countries want.  Companies trying to recruit for the UK, Canada or wherever do not come here to interview potential GPs or consultants.  They go to Australia instead, as they can meet more Irish young doctors in Australia, New Zealand or Canada than here.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Sadlier will give his opinion on cannabis.  As a GP who has been qualified for 30 years, I am concerned about the legalisation of cannabis as it is a major carcinogen, with a higher tar content than cigarettes.  It is especially dangerous in the adolescent brain and while there are medical uses for medicated cannabis, as somebody working in a deprived area I can say that evidence-based medicine is not there.  If there is evidence-based medicine and there are uses for it, it would need to be reviewed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018020100002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ray Walley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517493600,"counter":974,"content":"<p>In my time working in general adult psychiatry I would say that one quarter of my inpatients were there because of cannabis.

It is more than likely that some are effective and can be used in the treatment of illnesses.  Digoxin, a heart drug we all use, comes from the foxglove plant but I would not advise people to pick foxglove leaves to chew, nor would Dr. Walley or Deputy Harty.  Cannabis should be dealt with like any other medication.  When a distillative cannabis is found to be effective for treating an illness it should be licensed in the same way as penicillin or any other medication.  I do not see the sense in making an exemption for cannabis herbal products.  If an evidence-based product is found and passed by the same drug regulations as apply to every other pharmaceutical agent, then I would have no problem with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018020100002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matthew Sadlier"},{"type":"speech","time":1517493600,"counter":975,"content":"<p>This committee will produce a report at the end of the year which will try to improve our mental health services.

I thank the Chairman and members for welcoming me to Dublin and giving me this opportunity to come to the Oireachtas to discuss the European semester and economic developments in Ireland and the European Union.<br\/><br\/>My visit is taking place in the context of the European semester, which has become our main economic and fiscal policy co-ordination tool, and we have an opportunity to discuss with member states key fiscal, economic and social challenges.  In the European Semester Office we prepare country reports.  In line with the practice established last year, we sent the analytical parts of the draft country reports to the member states, waiting for their factual comments and inputs.  The negotiated country reports provide countries with the opportunity to view the factual feedback.  We found it quite useful when we first did it last year.<br\/><br\/>As regards the situation in Ireland and Ireland's position as regards the European semester, first, we have seen strong economic growth in Ireland last year, close to 5%, and this year the economic growth is close to 4%.  The economy is developing, unemployment is reducing and job creation is proceeding at a good pace.  All in all, we see positive developments in the Irish economy.<br\/><br\/>As regards Ireland's fiscal performance, Ireland has made a major adjustment since the crisis and this year we expect Ireland to meet its medium-term budgetary objective.  According to the European semester, we set the medium-term budgetary objectives for each EU member state to meet.  In the case of Ireland, it is 0.5% of GDP structural deficit and now we forecast that Ireland will actually reach the medium-term budgetary objective.  What is important is that public debt is reducing.  The figures for public debt need to be interpreted with caution because in 2015 there was a major readjustment of the calculation of Irish GDP and also the debt-to-GDP ratio decreased very rapidly, but if we use other measures to do this assessment, like public debt <i>per capita<\/i>or public debt per tax revenue, we still see that Ireland has quite high public debt and is exceeding the Maastricht criteria threshold of 60% of GDP.  It is important to stay the course and continue to reduce the public debt.  It is also important in the context of potential economic shocks, which Ireland may face.  In our assessment, a most immediate and imminent issue which we will need to deal with is Brexit.  Brexit is a potential source of uncertainty, especially in Ireland which has the closest economic links with the United Kingdom from the EU 27 countries.  The European Union is ready to stand by Ireland and support Ireland in this process and also to address negative economic consequences that Brexit may bring.<br\/><br\/>As regards the European semester, we also issue country-specific recommendations to address certain challenges which we think are important.  In the case of Ireland, we have three country-specific recommendations.  First is a fiscal recommendation and I touched on this when I spoke about the medium-term budgetary objective.  I stressed the need to continue to reduce public debt.  In terms of the privatisation of public expenditure, we propose to prioritise investment, especially in areas of transport, energy, water supplies and also to enhance social infrastructure, including social housing and child care facilities.  This is one of the directions where we think there are infrastructural bottlenecks which need to be addressed.<br\/><br\/>On the social side, we see that while unemployment is decreasing, there are still issues in terms of activation policies and a relatively high share of low-skilled workers.  The level of participation of women in the marketplace is below the EU average.  We recommend the delivery of an integrated package of activation policies to improve the employment prospects of certain categories of people.<br\/><br\/>Our third recommendation concerns the financial sector and the need to address the level of non-performing loans.  This is in a sense a legacy of the crisis not only in Ireland but in many European countries, so we are currently developing action plans to reduce the number of non-performing loans at EU level.<\/p><p>It is worth pointing out that, primarily, this is still the work of the member states and much progress has been done on this in Ireland.  In mid-2017, which are the latest verified figures we have, the non-performing loans, NPLs, ratio stood at 11.6%, which is still high compared with most historical levels and with other EU countries.  Further work is needed on NPLs.  We will also be bring forward an action plan to reduce NPLs at European level, working on several directions, requiring banks to put sufficient means or to create sufficient buffers to cover losses if new loans become non-performing, to tackle delays in debt recovery, and, in terms of insolvency and loan enforcement frameworks, to open up secondary markets.  We will bring forward a blueprint on how to set up national asset management companies within the EU state aid and banking union framework.  Of course, Ireland has the National Asset Management Agency, which is already working.  Perhaps this work theme is not so relevant in the case of Ireland.  Those are our main findings in terms of the European Semester.  Overall, in Europe we currently have good economic development. The latest  figures show that last year we had 2.5% growth both in the EU as a whole and in the euro area.  We should be using this good economic momentum to continue the work on deepening the economic and monetary union, EMU.<\/p><p> I will say a few words on that work stream.  As the members will be aware, in December the European Commission put forward a package of proposals on how to proceed with deepening the EMU.  We consider the most immediate priority to be the completion of the banking union and capital markets union.  In the case of the banking union, all the elements are already on the table.  I refer to our bank reform package, which we put forward in November 2016, which mainly concerns risk reduction, and the ongoing work on reducing non-performing loans.  Also, last October we came forward with some ideas on how to unblock the discussions regarding the European deposit insurance scheme.  We believe it is important to reach an agreement on the fiscal backstop for a single resolution fund.  We believe this can be done on the basis of the European Stability Mechanism or, potentially, as we propose to transpose it to the European monetary fund.<\/p><p> Looking forward in terms of deepening EMU, we want to reach two objectives to strengthen the resilience of the EMU and to improve the crisis management tools of EMU.  In terms of resilience, there are the risk reduction measures, which I already described, but also a continued focus on structural reforms.  We have some proposals on how we can further support structural reforms in member states.  We propose a structural reform delivery tool as a support mechanism and we propose to extend our existing structural reform support programme.<\/p><p>In terms of crisis management tools, we already have the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, which we propose to strengthen and transpose into the European monetary fund, anchored in a European Union legal framework.  We propose to create a euro area of fiscal stabilisation function to help countries to address large economic shocks, asymmetric economic shocks, and this euro area of fiscal stabilisation function could take place in a form of European investment protection scheme.  The problem is often that investment is the first item to be cut in times of fiscal strain and then it undermines the recovery and potential growth of a country.  Therefore, we propose this European investment protection scheme to sustain a level of investment during the crisis.<\/p><p> We also propose to have a dedicated convergence facility to support those EU member states which are working towards euro adoption.  Primarily, I am talking about technical assistance and, in some cases, it can also be financial assistance.  It will send an important signal that the euro area is open and transparent to non-euro countries, that we do not want to create new dividing lines in Europe and that we are willing to support those countries which are working towards euro accession.  That, at a glance, outlines the main ideas and elements of our deepening of the EMU package.  Those are my introductory remarks and I am open to hearing members' comments and taking their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018020100002#A00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Valdis Dombrovskis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":995,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Dombrovskis.

I would like to raise a few issues with him.  I note his list of responsibilities includes proposing measures to make financial services work better for consumers and retail investors.  A key consumer issue in Ireland regarding financial services is the very high mortgage interest rates charged to Irish consumers.  In Ireland, the official Central Bank Statistics show that for all new mortgages, whether they be variable or fixed rate, 3.18% is the average rate.  In the eurozone the equivalent is 1.83%.  We regularly see publicity around interest rates as low as 1% to 1.5% across Europe and consumers here are paying, in some cases, more than 4%.  We do not have a fully functioning Single Market in the area of financial services.  Therefore, people in Ireland find it difficult to understand why they cannot access cheap mortgage rates that are available elsewhere in Europe.  Does the Commissioner have any plans to deal with that issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018020100002#B00300","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517475600,"counter":997,"content":"<p>Yes, we had been dealing with and continue to deal with this issue.  Since the crisis we have seen certain weaknesses in the organisation of the financial systems, so the financial sector integration has reduced and financial sector activities increasingly were taking place along national borders.  It is certainly an issue.  We are now looking at ways that we can promote such cross-border financial sector activity.  Currently only 7% of European citizens use cross-border financial services.  We are not talking about large-scale integration.  Among other things, we are assessing cross-border loans, namely, what are the obstacles to cross-border loans.  Our analysis shows it is mainly to do with loan enforcement frameworks.  If a bank is to provide loans or mortgages with a collateral across a border in another EU member state, there is at least a perception of the financial sector in terms of the banks and their associated costs if there is a need for loan enforcement in case the loan becomes non-performing.  We would work with the country, especially if the loans are not very big, to enforce as a collateral.  We will bring forward some proposals in this area.  We will put forward a proposal on accelerated extrajudicial collateral collection mechanism while providing safeguards to customers towards some kind of aggressive loan collection practices.<\/p><p>That could be one mechanism to address this obstacle in terms of cross-border loans.   From the point of view of the European Union, we would be willing to see more financial integration, more cross-border financial services and therefore more competition, which eventually would result in lower interest rates for consumers.  That is something we are very much willing to support and facilitate.  It is part of our work on a retail financial services action plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018020100002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Valdis Dombrovskis","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":999,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.  I suggest to him that it should be a priority because if we are to have a full Single Market for financial services and at a time when all of the larger banks are being regulated directly by the Single Supervisory Mechanism, which is European-wide, it should be the case that all consumers, certainly those within the eurozone, should be able to avail of products being sold by banks that are regulated by the European-wide regulator.  That seems perfectly logical to me.  What people will want to know from the Commissioner is when he expects to see practical progress in respect of this issue because Irish consumers are paying way over the odds not just in regard to mortgage rates, which apply to residential customers, but business customers as well, and also in regard to insurance where, again, we do not have access to products that are being sold elsewhere in Europe.

It is not the only measure we are assessing in terms of the provision of cross-border financial services.  We had been doing that already through the payment services directive as regards payment services.  We also see obstacles in areas on cross-border money transfers, for example.  We are a single European payment area but it is actually a single eurozone payment area, not an EU payment area, so we propose to extend it to the entire European Union.

One relates to non-performing loans, which the Commissioner addressed in his opening statement.  The rate in Ireland is falling but it is still high.  The way we would like to see banks reduce their non-performing loans is by reaching agreements with borrowers and restructuring loans but what we find here in practice is that the main banks are reducing their level of non-performing loans by selling loan portfolios to international funds, commonly known here as vulture funds.  That is the main method being used here to reduce the level of non-performing loans so while it might improve the balance sheet of the financial institution concerned, it can create other knock-on problems and consequences, particularly for the borrower whose loan may now be owned by a fund that takes a much more aggressive stance by way of foreclosure, enforcement and so on.  It is the Commissioner's objective to reduce non-performing loans but does he have any view on how that should be done?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018020100002#C00400","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517475600,"counter":1002,"content":"<p>As regards non-performing loans, it is also related to the Deputy's previous question.  If banks held a high share of non-performing loans, it means they are suffering losses on those non-performing loans and that cost is passed to the customers.  That results in, among other things, higher interest rates, which banks are charging Irish customers, and we see the same tendency in other countries with a high non-performing loans ratio.  Ireland is not among the countries with the very highest level of non-performing loans.  The three countries with the highest levels are Greece, Cyprus and Portugal, but in any case this is an issue.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned in my introductory remarks our non-performing loans action plan on which we are working for direction.  The first is the prudential regulations as regards buffers.  Banks need to build for non-performing loans and we will be coming forward with a proposal for new loans which may become non-performing.<\/p> <p>  The second is insolvency and loan enforcement frameworks where we are doing some benchmarking.  We do not believe it is realistic to achieve a harmonisation in that regard because systems are very different and countries are very reluctant to change them.  We are doing the benchmarking, therefore, which we can then address through the European semester to see what is working in insolvency systems, what is not working, what are the best practices and then, through country-specific recommendations, show the countries possibilities to address this problem.<\/p> <p>  The third is the secondary markets of non-performing loans.  One problem is loan enforcement practices, which the Deputy mentioned.  There have to be strong consumer safeguards in that regard and also consumer protection organisations which fight against aggressive practices.  That is clearly not acceptable.  From the point of view of financial stability, in terms of a spread between bid and ask prices, we see there is an information asymmetry that needs to be addressed if we want this market to be functional.<\/p> <p>  Fourth, I already mentioned the blueprint for national asset management companies.  Ireland already has a national asset management company, which is working.  Recently, the European Commission also found that the way it was set up is in line also with EU state aid rules.  There had been some complaints so the European Commission had been assessing that and found it to be in compliance.<\/p> <p>  Those are the four work directions of non-performing loans.

I want to explore the area of the European semester and economic governance.  I will explain where I am coming from.  I was in the European Parliament from 2011 to 2014 when some of these measures were introduced, including the six pack, the two pack, austerity, and the fiscal treaty.  What we saw was an example of the shock doctrine of using a crisis of capitalism to enshrine some of the neoliberal laws in European law and to reduce democracy at a European and national level.  That is the effect of those laws.  What democratic legitimacy does the Commission have to be engaged in instructing, directing or recommending governments to implement certain budgetary decisions?  In the Commission's engagement with Italy, it stressed that the adoption of the 2018 budget with no watering down of its key provisions would be crucial.  It underlined the importance of sticking to the important structural reforms, notably as regards pensions.  What democratic legitimacy does the Commission have to be demanding so-called structural reforms from democratically elected governments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018020100002#D00200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517475600,"counter":1007,"content":"<p>First I will address the broader question of EU economic policy, including the Stability and Growth Pact, and then I will come to the question on democratic legitimacy.  Something that a number of countries have experienced during the crisis, including Latvia, which is the country I know best, Ireland and a number of other countries, is that if they want to pursue contracyclical fiscal policies during the crisis, and that is what has been discussed, they also need to pursue contracyclical policy during the good times, meaning they have the fiscal space or room for manoeuvre in case of economic shocks.  Unfortunately, for those countries that had not been doing so before the crisis, there was no fiscal space or room for manoeuvre during the crisis and countries were being shut out of the financial markets.  The other question is how a country can finance its debt and deficit.  What are the sources of finance?  That is where the question of restoring financial stability and the EU rules on restoring financial stability came in.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the democratic legitimacy of the European Commission and the decision-making, first it must be said that the European Commission has rights and obligations that EU member states with their democratically elected parliaments and appointed governments have delegated to it.  It is enshrined in the EU treaty which has been ratified by all EU member states and where the role of the European Commission as a guardian of the treaty is also foreseen.  At the same time, it must be said that any decisions that are taken at EU level are Council decisions.  When we come up with draft decisions as a European Commission, whether on the fiscal or structural reform side, they are draft decisions and those draft decisions have to be approved by the Council.  It concerns fiscal decisions, any other decisions and any legislative proposals.  They are called legislative proposals because the Commission comes up with a proposal.  It is for co-legislators, the European Council and the European Parliament, to make the binding decisions.<\/p> <p>  On structural reforms, it is also important not to mix certain elements.  Italy is in a preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, as is Ireland.  We address country-specific recommendations on structural reforms to member states, but first, as the name suggests, they are recommendations.  Second, those proposals, in any case, are endorsed by the Council.  That is how the structure works and that is where democratic legitimacy comes from.  Its functions are delegated to the Commission by EU member states with their democratic decision-making process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018020100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Valdis Dombrovskis"},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":1008,"content":"<p>I will respond to two points.  Mr. Dombrovskis said the rationale for the fiscal rules was the idea that the crisis resulted from irresponsible public spending and rising debt, etc.  That is not the reality across the world or, in general, across the European Union.  It certainly was not the reality in Ireland.  In Ireland, pre-crisis, we had a debt-to-GDP ratio of 25%, which was as low as Germany's.  The reason it exploded was because of a private sector banking collapse that was then taken onto the shoulders of the public.  None of the fiscal rules that existed, if they had existed pre-crisis, would have made a difference to the crisis.  The idea that it is a response to the crisis does not hold water.<\/p> <p>  In defending the democratic legitimacy of the process, Mr. Dombrovskis put significant weight on the fact that the Commission proposes and goes to the European Council and that the governments are at the European Council.  What he did not say is that the voting process at the European Council is turned on its head.  Instead of needing a majority or a qualified majority to pass the Commission proposal, is it not the case that when it comes to economic governance proposals, a reverse qualified majority is required?  In other words, to reject something, there has to be a substantial majority of member states.  How is it democratic to reverse either a simple majority process or, even worse, to have a reverse qualified majority process?  How can it be claimed that there is endorsement by the Council for proposals when that process has been reversed in that way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018020100002#D00400","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517475600,"counter":1009,"content":"<p>On the first question, the fiscal rules existed in Europe before the crisis.  The Stability and Growth pact set a 3% limit on government deficit and a 60% limit on debt.  It all existed before the crisis.<\/p><p>What was done after the crisis is that, first, a European semester was introduced as an annual cycle of fiscal and economic policy co-ordination, so it was recognised that a more systematic overview of the member states' fiscal and macroeconomic policies is needed.  A macroeconomic imbalances procedure was introduced because it was recognised that countries not only face fiscal problems, but also macroeconomic problems and there was more emphasis on prevention such as the preventative arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, the setting of medium-term budgetary objectives and aiming for a balanced budget in the economic cycle.  Those were the things that were introduced.<\/p><p> As regards Ireland, we are fully aware that many of the Irish fiscal problems stem from the collapse of the banking system and an unprecedented scale of bailouts which Ireland undertook.  Nevertheless, that did not remove the question that if those decisions were taken, what are the sources of financing of the debt and deficit.  This question, nevertheless, was still there and those bailouts, which we saw in a number of countries was the reason for introducing the banking union.  As members know, the basic principle of the banking union right now is not for a bailout but a bail-in, meaning that first the shareholders and creditors of a bank take the losses and the taxpayer is not first in line to pay for the mistakes of the banking sector.

There is a structural reform clause to support structural reforms.  There is an exceptional circumstances clause which has been used, for example, in the case of natural disasters and also in the context of the migration crisis in 2015.  There are different possibilities which are available according to EU fiscal rules.  When and which of those tools are used and when and which of those tools are requested is also the competence of the Irish authorities.  I discussed that also yesterday with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  It is also clear that it is important to find the appropriate timing.  When an economy is growing like now by 4% to 5% a year, which is the Commission forecast, and if anything the outcome may be at least as good, if not better, as our autumn forecast then it may not, therefore, be the best moment to trigger all the flexibility clauses.<\/p><p>If there is a Brexit that triggers large negative economic consequences then those clauses are there and can be triggered.

While it is a new proposal and needs to be discussed by EU members states and by the European Parliament and eventually agreed, if it becomes part of the decisions that are taken in the context of deepening economic and monetary union then, once again, it is possible to use.

A significant number of the people we represent have not enjoyed any lift in their quality of life.  Much work remains to be done.  I would not like that statement to go without comment.<\/p> <p>  You said in your opening statement, Mr. Dombrovskis, that the performance of the banking sector has returned to normal.  It is far from normal.  Small businesses cannot get banking loans.  I presume you are aware of the tracker mortgage issue in this country.  Significant numbers of people have not been paid or put back on the correct rates.  Banking is far from normal.  If fact, if something is not done in banking we will get back to a situation where the banks will act as recklessly as before.<\/p> <p>  You referred to the broad tax base.  Our corporate tax continues to be talked about in Europe.  It is central to our economic well-being and development.  We would not like to see interference from Europe that would in any way damage our prospects of being able to secure further outside investment in the country.<\/p> <p>  You referred to banking union, Mr. Dombrovskis.  This committee has written several times to Mario Draghi in respect of his appearance.  I have written to him on a personal level in respect of the tracker mortgage issue.  His response has been quite pathetic in terms of understanding the issues we face and our efforts to deal with them.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to non-performing loans.  You said that the resilience of the Irish banking sector has improved significantly.  It has not.  It is living on taxpayers' money.  A vast amount of money was paid in by the Government to keep the banks afloat at a time when Europe did not do many favours for this country by insisting that we could not burn the bondholders.  That is what has us in this situation that we are not in.  The Commission is pushing for non-performing loans to be dealt with.  However, it has to understand that, up to recently anyway, the banks completely ignored country-specific recommendation No. 3, which you cited earlier, Mr. Dombrovskis.  You referred to write-offs for viable businesses and households with a special emphasis on resolving long-term arrears.  The banks have persecuted small businesses and individuals.  We have significant levels of deaths by suicide, family disruption and trauma, all from the fact that the banks refuse to deal with the issues before them in a way that shows some degree of compassion and humanity.<\/p> <p>  It is my opinion that Europe stands idly by and watches as our citizens are punished for something they did not inflict upon themselves.  I am simply giving you my views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018020100002#H00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517475600,"counter":1050,"content":"<p>I will comment first on a procedural point.  When discussing economic, financial and fiscal issues with a parliament, typically I like to have an open exchange of views.  You referred, Chairman, to some written remarks and not to the speech that I delivered.  In a sense I have not read out that statement.  This point was made clear to colleagues at the beginning of this meeting.  That is exactly the problem but let us clarify this point.  I stand by the statement, by the way - that is not a problem.  There was strong insistence from colleagues that they wanted a written statement from me.  However, I am saying that I prefer not to deliver a written statement in meetings such as this.  I prefer to have more open discussions.  It would probably be better to refer to what I was actually saying in the meeting and to check against delivery.  It is not that I am willing to deny anything that I have written.  It is simply a procedural point.<\/p> <p>  I will come back on the substance of some of the points raised.  You referred to the broad-based recovery, Chairman.  You may agree or you may not agree, but the assessment of the Commission is that the Irish economy has made a remarkable turnaround.  We see it in the fast economic growth and decreasing unemployment.  We see it in the rapid development in many sectors of the economy.  We are not saying that everything is solved.<\/p> <p>  Let us consider the EU economic policy priorities - they are equally valid in Ireland.  We are saying now that we have economic recovery.  At the same time, we must work to make growth inclusive, address income inequality and restart the process of convergence both within and among EU member states.  That is our focus.  Our economic policy priorities indicate that is exactly what we need to focus on now.<\/p> <p>  The next set of country-specific recommendations is in development.  I am talking more generally rather than prejudging specifically the country-specific recommendations for Ireland.  They will help to focus on the reduction of income equality and on the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, recently agreed by member states.  They will help to put more emphasis on addressing the special social problems that you have raised, Chairman.<\/p> <p>  You referred to the banking sector, Chairman.  We see once again that the level of non-performing loans in Irish banking sector has reduced rather substantially.  Actually, it has been one of the fastest reductions.  Of course we are aware that this entire issue is sensitive and we need to tackle it with strong consumer safeguards.  It is a matter for national supervisors and national consumer protection institutions to prevent aggressive loan-collection strategies, something also emphasised during this meeting.<\/p> <p>  You raised the question of the European Central Bank and comments by Mario Draghi, Chairman.  I cannot comment, because we must respect the independence of the ECB.  The European Commission does not comment on the decisions of the European Central Bank - it is an independent institution that responds for itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018020100002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Valdis Dombrovskis"},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":1051,"content":"<p>I thank the vice president for coming today.

I am the chief financial officer of Ulster Bank Ireland DAC and I am joined today by Ms Elizabeth Arnett, head of corporate affairs.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, we are in a close period and therefore we cannot discuss issues which may trigger discussion of financially sensitive information regarding provisions or disclosures.  There may be some questions that stray into this territory.  I will be happy to take those questions away if I cannot answer them and come back to the committee where I can.  We are here to discuss the progress made regarding resolution of the tracker mortgage redress issue.  I will give an overview of this and then we will be very happy to take questions, which I am sure committee members have.<\/p> <p>  As committee members know, our examination is ongoing and we have, as part of our phase 2, identified just under 3,500 customers who are impacted.  The impact on these customers and the length of time it is taking to pay redress and compensation is unacceptable and, rightfully, we are being challenged on this.  I repeat the apology that Ulster Bank has made to our customers in this regard.<\/p> <p>  When the Central Bank tracker mortgage examination letter arrived in our bank we took a number of months to consider how to respond, but by March 2016 we had begun the process of establishing our programme.  In hindsight what we should have done was mobilise somewhat earlier and have deliberations concurrently.  By doing it the other way we probably added three months to our programme that potentially could have been avoided.<\/p> <p>  The work involved in identifying impacted customers is one of the largest and most complicated projects ever undertaken by the bank.  We have more than 200 people working full time on the programme.  I know this is no consolation to people who have been waiting too long for the redress and compensation to which they are entitled, but let me try to explain the challenge of the process in more detail.<\/p> <p>  Ulster Bank started with 300,000 customers in the scope of the examination.  They were customers who were active, redeemed or sold between 2001 and 2015.  Customer journeys were segmented into different categories, which required different levels of review.  By way of example, these customers include those who drew down on a tracker rate and did not move to any other product or margin at any time.  There are approximately 64,000 of these and we could discount them from the process quickly.  Of the 300,000 mortgages, we carried out an in-depth review of over 7,000 to determine whether or not they were impacted.  As I am sure the committee appreciates, this involved a lengthy process of rebuilding customer files, locating original hard copies of documentation and putting together a full journey of what those customers went through.  This process was made difficult in Ulster Bank because we were dealing with five mortgage systems across two banks extending for a period of over a decade and a half.  There was a high degree of variety in these accounts.  We found over 1,600 different journeys, with some customers having up to 20 different points in that journey.  By way of example, a journey includes mortgage drawdown, product switches, any rate changes, any forbearance or special arrangements and mortgage redemption.  This process identified just under 3,500 impacted customers and is set out in the phase 2 report we submitted to the Central Bank.  As of quarter three of 2017, we made a provision of &euro;211 million for this project, which includes administration costs and compensation and remediation to customers.<\/p> <p>  In designing the examination, the Central Bank framework requires that we look retrospectively at our loan book and apply a contractual, regulatory and, very importantly, customer lens to determine whether there is an impact.  The vast majority of the 3,500 customers were impacted due to ambiguous and potentially confusing terminology in our documentation, and as a result, these customers did not get the correct rate.  I do not wish to appear to minimise the nature of the impact, but rather to give the committee an understanding of what we have found as a result of our work to date on the examination.<\/p> <p>  The ambiguity in the documentation we produced presented circumstances whereby our subsequent actions certainly disadvantaged our customers.  The requirement to be clear in all communications with customers is the minimum standard to which we must, and do, hold ourselves.  In this regard, we did not meet the standards and we failed our customers.  We deeply regret this and apologise unreservedly to all impacted customers.  We are putting this right, accepting the pace is frustratingly slow for our customers and for ourselves.<\/p> <p>  In total, the transparency and ambiguity issue to which I have referred affected approximately 88% of the 3,500 customers.  The other 12% were primarily due to operational errors and the absence of required warnings.  Approximately 2,500 of impacted customers are still with Ulster Bank and we have returned them to their correct rate.  We stopped the harm as quickly as we could.  As the committee is aware, this happened on a phased basis, mostly during the first quarter of 2017 and the back end of 2016.  For customers who are no longer with Ulster Bank, we are working through their remediation, with a commitment to complete this and our commitment on the overall 3,500, by the end of the second quarter of 2018.<\/p> <p>  For customers who lost their homes as a result of the tracker mortgage issue, we have a special process in place on top of the standard remediation.  For example, where we identify customers who have lost their homes as a result of the loss of a tracker rate, we communicate with them, appoint a single point of contact for them, arrange a meeting and offer an upfront initial payment of &euro;50,000 in advance of completing the full redress and compensation process.  We commenced the process of paying redress and compensation in September and to date we have paid more than 1,200 customers.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of key principles for us in this phase of the examination.  It is very important for us that we put each customer back to the position he or she would have been in had the error not occurred.  This involves reconstruction of each customer account using the correct interest rate; quantification of the amount of interest overcharged at the incorrect rate, and reversal of that overcharge; calculation of the monthly repayments that should have been paid by the customer and a refund of the difference between that total and what was paid by the customer; and restoration of the mortgage balance to what should now be outstanding, following reversal of the interest overcharge and refund of repayments.<\/p> <p>  The letters we write to customers are designed to complete a picture for them.  In some cases these can contain up to 30 pages but they also include a summary.  They contain a full financial statement going back to the month when the impact happened and provide a month by month statement for the years the impact happened.  Customer accounts, in calculating redress amounts require manual intervention and calculations.  At present, this cannot be systemised because of the multiple variations that exist in each customer journey.  This necessitates additional quality control and assurance checks.  In calculating redress and compensation for even straightforward cases, there are up to 120 separate data points that can move each time there is an additional payment on the account.  This means the calculation is very time sensitive.  For live Ulster Bank customers, a short period opens up each month when all of the data is collected and reviewed, the calculations are made, the calculations are checked, the letter is compiled and checked and then issued before the next payment is made on the account and the data points have changed.  This has been a slow and challenging process, and I would not even begin to express how difficult this has been for customers.  We are focused on paying what is due to all impacted customers as quickly as possible.  There is no advantage for us if we drag our feet on making this right and there is certainly no advantage for our customers.<\/p> <p>  We have more than just a regulatory or contractual obligation to our customers.  We believe we have a moral obligation to be fair and to put things right as quickly as possible when it goes wrong.  We also accept and acknowledge the focus of this committee, the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank in this matter and holding us all to account.  Ulster Bank has certainly learned lessons from this and, while we are still in the process of finalising our programme, we are applying these lessons across the bank.<\/p><p>Throughout this process, our people on the front line - helping customers and dealing with queries - have worked tirelessly, and that is despite how the public may feel about those of us at senior level.  I would like to draw that distinction.<\/p><p> To close, I emphasise again that we are working to finalise our numbers.  We will continue to engage with the Central Bank as regards a phase 2.  While we expect some additional customers to be impacted upon, we do not expect the issues to be on the same scale.  Despite this, we have failed.  This has not only impacted on our tracker customers but society's trust in banks and, indeed, our credibility as an industry.  We will continue to work hard to complete this programme, learn from it and rebuild trust in our bank.  We are serious about our commitments to our customers and we are listening and learning from the experience of this programme.

It took this money from them.  We have AIB telling us that it has 500 people working on this.  Whatever the 200 people in Ulster Bank who were working on this in January were doing, the first port of call is to pay back these individuals.  Ulster Bank's great achievement in January was to give 197 customers back their money.  When did Ulster Bank first find out that these individuals were impacted by it?  It is a beautiful word - a nice industry word.  These people were robbed by the bank because it told us in December 2016 that it was aware that 2,000 people were impacted, or robbed, by the bank.  It is not the case that Ulster Bank only found this out a couple of weeks ago and now has to do all the calculations and all the rest.  As the bank knew from December 2016 that these customers were impacted, how are members supposed to accept that a bank regulated here by the Irish State is in such disarray that it cannot return money it wrongly possesses in its accounts to its customers at least a year and one month after knowing and admitting it wrongly held that money?  Is that not the case?  Ulster Bank knew for more that a year and one month that 2,000 customers had their money wrongly taken from them by the bank.  As of today, the bank has not given back their money to 800 of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018020100002#O03500","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517475600,"counter":1203,"content":"<p>The figures quoted by the Deputy are correct in terms of progress.

Would it not fit it better to tell NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, no, actually we are not paying a dividend, we have a duty and responsibility of care to our customers here in Ireland and we will invest that to make sure this will never happen again and that we have robust systems?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018020100002#P03100","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517475600,"counter":1248,"content":"<p>Can I respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018020100002#P03200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Stanley"},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":1249,"content":"<p>Of course Mr. Stanley can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018020100002#P03300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517475600,"counter":1250,"content":"<p>As I said earlier, the issue is with legacy systems that are no longer there.  We had five mortgage systems and that is the complexity of going back into systems that are closed down, extracting the information and rebuilding customer files.  We now have two and in effect most mortgages are on one.  That absolutely has been a challenge of the past.  It is not there today.  During the course of 2017 we completed that migration and we now have only two mortgage systems.<br\/><br\/>In terms of investment in systems, those are RBS's systems, not Ulster Bank systems <i>per se<\/i>.  RBS invests &euro;1 billion a year in IT and systems upgrades and we are the beneficiaries of that.<\/p><p> It is happening both in our mortgage systems and our mortgage processes, and indeed other investments across the bank.  <\/p><p> I will conclude by commenting on the dividend, which was also raised.  Ulster Bank is excessively capitalised at this point.  That, as the Deputy is aware, is taxpayers' money that came in from the UK, and was needed, in order to capitalise the bank.  The European Central Bank, ECB, our own Central Bank, and indeed our own parent company, are quite comfortable with the view that it was appropriate to make that dividend.  We remain the most capitalised bank within the Republic of Ireland, certainly the most capitalised of the main banks.  That is why the dividend was repaid.

It is absolutely disgusting that Mr. Gerry Mallon is not here today.  This is a scandal for which Ulster Bank has had to make a provision of &euro;211 million, yet he does not see fit to come before the committee to answer questions.  He should consider changing the bank's name from &quot;Ulster Bank&quot; to &quot;Ambiguous Bank&quot;.  It is hard to even ask intelligent questions.  There is so much fudge around when everything happened or did not happen.  I find it absolutely exasperating that he is not before us today, benefiting as he is from the bank.  I will try to confine my questions, but as others have said, we get more letters from Ulster Bank customers than from those of all the other banks combined, and that is not by accident.  There is nothing ambiguous about that.<\/p><p>We must also remember that in December 2016, Ulster Bank promised that all customers would be written to by the end of the year.  Perhaps Ulster Bank did write to them.  I will give the witnesses an example of one customer.  Since January 2016, he has received the same letter over and over again.  I laughed earlier when Ms Arnett referred to a &quot;high degree of variation&quot;.  There certainly is not a high degree of variation in Ulster Bank's contact with these customers.  I do not accept that the degree of complexity prevents Ulster Bank from communicating effectively with its customers, because some of these calculations can be made by the homeowners themselves, as indeed they have been.  These are customers who are paying 3.75% interest as things stand.  They know they have overpaid by, say, &euro;300 a month over ten years, so they know the overpayment amounts to &euro;30,000.  They know that is what is due to them, compensation aside.  As such, it is extremely frustrating for us and for them to see that we are here two years later.  They are still opening their envelopes, getting the same thing over and over.  <\/p><p>There are so many contradictions in what the witnesses say about the way they treat customers.  Mr. Stanley's opening statement claimed:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;The letters we write to customers are designed to complete a picture for them.  In some cases these can contain up to 30 pages but they also include a summary.  They contain a full financial statement going back to the month when the impact happened and provide a month by month statement for the years the impact happened.&quot;<\/blockquote> <p>Very good.

One is based on behaviour and culture and the other is operational changes.  On operational changes, first and foremost, we are looking to ensure that our documentation is very clear and there is no ambiguity within it.  We have simplified our mortgage products to remove any ambiguity.  We have looked at our full mortgage process to see if we can identify any risks within it.  One might argue that if that had happened prior to 2000, looking at tracker mortgages and what aspects of risk were there, we might not be here today.  Those are the types of steps that we have taken to examine the banks operations and how we can address the issues we have identified.<\/p> <p>  Importantly, we are examining behaviours and how our values as a bank, and have come a long way in how we expect our staff to behave towards customers.<\/p><p>We have come a long way in that regard in terms of our code, standards and policies and how we work that into the expectations of what staff do and how they behave.  We survey every staff member, of whom there are 75,000 as we are part of the RBS group, across the entire bank to identify where, for example, staff members feel it is not acceptable or encouraged to raise issues in their section of the bank.  We want to have a challenge culture such that a member of staff can challenge something with which he or she is not comfortable.  We have put a big focus on risk management, in particular in Ulster Bank and very much led by the board, and being very proactive in terms of identifying risk to customers.

At one point prior to the meeting I was willing to accept that Mr. Mallon would not be here.  Every business goes through changes and Ulster Bank is no exception to that.  I have seen change in businesses.  However, having reflected on that and the fact that, according to the witnesses, Mr. Mallon is working out six months' notice, Ulster Bank has a brass neck like no other I have seen because Mr. Stanley and Ms Arnett have put an opening statement before us this morning that would lead members to believe that Ulster Bank is putting the customer first.  We have a moral obligation to be fair and to put things right as quickly as possible when we get it wrong.  However, Mr. Mallon did not turn up here this morning but has a number of months yet to serve in the bank, which reflects very badly on it.  Ulster Bank tried to get a different date for this meeting, in spite of other banks also being in a closed period, which is nothing short of obstruction of the process of the committee and our examination of the affairs of Ulster Bank in the context of tracker mortgages.  The scant information that has been put before the committee today is a further example of almost an unwillingness to understand the scale of the difficulties it has created for people.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses could spend the day dealing with statistics and so on but I am going to look at facts.  For seven years, Ulster Bank contested every case with Padraic Kissane and it learned nothing in that time.  I will take the witnesses to correspondence from Ulster Bank customers, as referred to by other members.  The committee is defending Ulster Bank customers but Mr. Stanley and Ms Arnett should be doing so as that is their job.  All they are doing is playing with words and I do not accept half of what they say.  We have received correspondence from a lady who was reinstated on her tracker in January 2016 and, to date, has not received a letter about redress.  Before Christmas, she telephoned Ulster Bank to find out when she could expect to be repaid the money it wrongfully took from her.  She was told it could not give her information and that nobody could tell her when that might happen but that it would be addressed in the second quarter.  She had to pay considerable fees for various advice to deal with Ulster Bank in the earlier stages of her efforts to get what was rightfully hers.  She will probably have spent between &euro;6,000 and &euro;8,000 on advice by the time the process concludes.  Will Ulster Bank refund her that money?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018020100002#V01400","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1517475600,"counter":1485,"content":"<p>Does the Chairman wish me to answer that specific question or does he want------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018020100002#V01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Stanley"},{"type":"speech","time":1517475600,"counter":1486,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Stanley to answer that question.

If she is the figure for change, she is not making a great job of it because she told me she would contact those customers immediately, but did not do so.  As of yesterday, she had not done so.  Customers are still waiting to be contacted, as indicated in the first letter I read out, while this letter, written yesterday, indicates that Ms Arnett has not contacted the individuals whom I was told she would contact.  She gave that commitment.  The person who wrote that letter was written to in November 2017 in regard to his or her tracker loans, one of which has been offloaded to a vulture fund.  I asked for immediate intervention in that regard because it was unfair and wrong.  The vulture fund has since attempted to enter the building, change locks and cause nothing but distress for the people involved.  I do not know how Mr. Stanley and Ms Arnett can sit there, knowing this has happened, and say what they have about their customers.<\/p><p>When Ulster Bank wrote to the customer it disclosed information on at least half a dozen other customers not associated with this.  Mr. Stanley was asked about data protection earlier.  This is a data protection issue, it is obviously a customer issue and is an issue in which I asked the bank to intervene.  It is still ongoing.  The bank is still giving no relief whatsoever to the individuals concerned.<\/p><p> Senator Horkan referred to questions to do with switchers.  Deputy Jack Chambers and other Deputies have written to the committee because they are also receiving correspondence.  They are asking the same questions.  Ulster Bank switcher customers have not even received the courtesy of having it confirmed they are impacted and will be dealt with in due course.  The witnesses might take note of some of these issues as we go through them because I will ask for an answer on each and every one of them.<\/p><p> In another letter from a customer, the person says the terms and conditions within the contract to the effect that the tracker was for the life of the mortgage have now been changed.  This person's money has been returned, which amounted to almost a year's net wages plus a small amount for compensation.  The terms of the contract have been changed to favour the bank.  Will the witnesses explain this to us?  It raises questions about switchers.<\/p><p> These are just a tiny sample from the volume of correspondence we have received.  Will customers be refunded for overpayments during the time they were with AIB?  This involves another bank and Ulster Bank.  Another customer was waiting 17 months for the bank to rectify a situation and, having notified the bank of the person's personal, health and financial situation on 26 November 2017, as well as receiving confirmation from the bank at a further meeting on 7 December 2017 that the customer would be treated as a priority, the customer had to write emails to us on 26 January because the bank did not respond.<\/p><p> None of what the witnesses are saying adds up in the context of a batch of emails I have received about how the bank is treating its customers.

I will ask Mr. Stanley about a case where an individual took out a tracker mortgage and, when the European Central Bank, ECB, interest rate increased, that person's rate increased.  However, when the ECB reduced its rates, Ulster Bank wrote to the customer to say that the new minimum monthly payment was a certain amount but as the customer was already due to pay more than that, the bank had not made any changes to the amount it collected from the person's bank account.  That effectively meant that the bank held the interest rate at a higher level which obviously shortened the term of the mortgage but did not reduce in line with the ECB's reduction.  This customer wrote to the bank to instruct it that only the minimum amount should be deducted but the letter was ignored.  Was this common practice within the bank, that when the ECB's rate reduced, it did not automatically involve a reduction in the tracker mortgage customer's account?  This individual was aware of his rights even though the bank did not afford him his rights when he asked for the rate to be reduced because the payment would still be above the minimum.

The norm should be that as interest rates go up or down, the payment levels should change accordingly.
