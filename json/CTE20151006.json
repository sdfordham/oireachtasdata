We wish to outline the case for increased support for the sheep sector and the specific proposals the Irish Farmers Association has put to the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on behalf of sheep farmers.<\/p> <p>  The sheep sector is the third largest farming sector in Ireland, with over 34,000 producers and an output value of &euro;300 million per annum.  The sector is very important in terms of the number of farmers involved, strong export earnings of over &euro;220 million and the very positive social and environmental contributions it makes in rural areas, particularly in remote areas and on hills where it is not possible to conduct any other type of farming enterprise.  Sheep farming is particularly important in counties Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Kerry and Wicklow and is also strong in counties Roscommon, Cork, Wexford, Meath, Tipperary, Sligo and Carlow.  I was informed earlier by the vice chairman that it was particularly important in County Lout also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Downey"},{"type":"speech","time":1444136400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>And County Leitrim.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#G00400","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444136400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I am sure that given the interest of members in their own counties, they will support the proposals we will be making today.<\/p> <p>  A study conducted in 2013 by Professor Alan Renwick from UCD showed that, due to the multipliler effect, for each &euro;1 of output produced on sheep farms, an additional &euro;1.33 of output was generated in the economy and that each &euro;1 of support for the sheep sector underpinned a figure of &euro;2.70 of aggregate output in the economy.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Total sheepmeat production amounts to 58,000 tonnes per annum, and Ireland is the third largest exporter in the EU with exports of 46,000 tonnes.  Our main markets are France, the UK, Belgium, Germany and Scandinavia.<br\/><br\/>There are eight key meat plants involved in processing lambs for export and a larger number of small abattoirs servicing the domestic butcher trade.  Lamb consumption on the domestic market accounts for about 15,700 tonnes with retail sales valued at &euro;102 million.<br\/><br\/>Incomes on sheep farms are challenging and direct payments are hugely important in helping to maintain viability.  The Teagasc 2014 National Farm Survey shows an average sheep income of &euro;14,551 or only about 44% of the average annual earnings.<br\/><br\/>The sheep sector has not fared well in previous CAP reforms.  In the original MacSharry reforms, the ewe premium system strongly supported incomes and drove numbers, which increased from below 2 million ewes in the late 1980s to almost 5 million in the 1990s.<br\/><br\/>Under the Fischler reforms with the move to decoupling, ewe numbers declined rapidly again dropping back to 2.2 million.  The IFA worked hard to get support for the sector and various initiatives were undertaken to stabilise numbers, including the Malone report and the introduction of &euro;18 million under the sheep grassland payment, financed from unused CAP funds.<br\/><br\/>The sheep grassland payment scheme was cut in the 2012 budget down to &euro;14 million for 2013 and &euro;3 million was transferred to the sheep technology programme, or STAP scheme.  Payments at farm level reduced from about &euro;8.50 per ewe back to &euro;6.35 per ewe on a maximum of 210 ewes. <br\/><br\/>In the most recent CAP reform there were no specific policy elements agreed for the sheep sector either under pillar 1 or pillar 2, unlike the beef sector where the suckler beef genomics scheme from the pillar 2 RDP was introduced.  This is worth &euro;52 million per annum to the beef sector.<br\/><br\/>As part of the current CAP reform, the IFA lobbied strongly for a coupled payment for sheep, which was rejected by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and his Department.  Instead, the Minister incorporated the sheep grassland payment into the single farm payment of sheep farmers and increased its value to &euro;15 million through unused funds and modulation.  However, we now have a situation where we do not have a targeted sheep-specific payment that will support and develop the sector.<br\/><br\/>I would now like to hand over to our national sheep chairman, John Lynskey, to go through the finer detail of these proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Downey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444136400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Chairman, Deputies and Senators, in order to maintain and grow the national sheep flock there is a need for increased targeted direct support for sheep production from a combination of EU and national funds.  Support should be targeted at active producers.<br\/><br\/>A number of EU countries have introduced coupled payments for sheep as part of their CAP 2015-2020 plans.  As reported in last week&rsquo;s <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>, 22 member states have introduced varying levels of coupling for sheep.  The average payment is &euro;12 per head.  A total of &euro;486 million, or 12% of coupled payments, is being allocated to sheep.  In France, payments are varying from &euro;16 to &euro;27 per head.  In Spain, the range is from &euro;8 to &euro;13 per head.<br\/><br\/>Through a combination of CAP and national funds, there is a budget of &euro;580 million per annum in the rural development programme for 2015-2020.  The IFA worked hard to secure matching funds for the rural development programme.  New schemes are being rolled out through GLAS, knowledge transfer, beef genomics and TAMS II. <br\/><br\/>Sheep farmers are entitled to their fair share of, and access to, these funds and schemes.  The IFA is insisting that sheep farmers get the best deal possible.  To maintain the national ewe flock, the sheep sector requires targeted sheep-specific payments to the equivalent to &euro;20 per ewe.  The IFA is demanding that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, starts providing funding for this, with priority access to a number of schemes and the allocation of &euro;25 million for a direct payment.<br\/><br\/>Sheep farmers must have priority access to the GLAS payment of up to &euro;5,000 per annum.  All qualifying sheep farmers should be accepted into the scheme.<\/p><p>In addition, mixed grazing involving cattle and sheep should qualify as a payment measure.  The latest move to limit the scheme and exclude farmers from the second phase is not acceptable.  The changes to the low-input permanent pasture and traditional hay meadows measures effectively halve the value of those measures, which are vital for sheep and cattle farmers.  This must be addressed and 50,000 applicants must be allowed join.<\/p><p> For commonage farmers, plans must be implemented in a flexible way in order to maximise participation in line with the IFA commonage strategy.  The restrictions on GLAS+ must be eased so that hill sheep farmers and commonage farmers can qualify for the extra payment of &euro;2,000.<\/p><p> The current sheep technology advisory programme, STAP,  has been very successful, with more than 4,000 sheep farmers participating.  This success must be built upon and the IFA is proposing that a target of 10,000 participants be included in the new knowledge transfer scheme for sheep in 2016.  That scheme must be simple and practical in nature.  Mixed cattle and sheep farms must continue to qualify for a level of separate payment.  Likewise, mixed tillage and sheep farms should also qualify for additional payments.  The IFA has made its views very clear to the Minister on the unacceptable situation in respect of the making payments to advisers and facilitators as opposed to directly to farmers and also on the actual level of these payments.<\/p><p> TAMS II must have a significant and dedicated level of funding for investment in the sheep sector.  The decision of the Minister to exclude sheep fencing and technology equipment in the recent TAMS II announcement was wrong and must be reversed immediately.  The Minister must include these items under the amendment currently being prepared on the Rural Development programme to be submitted to Brussels.<\/p><p> Payments for areas of natural constraint, formerly the disadvantaged areas scheme, should be restored to their pre-2008 levels.  This would involve a restoration of payment rates at farm level and restoration of the payment status of farmers in split holdings.<\/p><p> The Government, in conjunction with Bord Bia, must adopt a strong market access policy to open up new high-value markets such the US, China and others, and remove the access restrictions and difficulties associated with TSEs for both sheepmeat and live animals.  We also need to develop market outlets for light lamb.  Other policy areas that are important for sheep producers include the need for Teagasc to maintain a strong independent sheep research and advisory programme, with Athenry as a centre of excellence.  In addition, Teagasc needs to increase the numbers of sheep farms in the BETTER farm programme.<\/p><p> Bord Bia promotional funding for Irish lamb on the domestic and export markets must be maintained in addition to EU funding for generic promotion of lamb.  There needs to be a worthwhile and transparent price incentive for lambs from a Bord Bia quality assured farm.<\/p><p> Sheep Ireland is working hard on sheep breeding.  It is very important we have a well-funded, focused and practical sheep-breeding improvement programme implemented for the benefit of sheep farmers and the sector.  It is essential that this be closely linked to the knowledge transfer programme and Teagasc.<\/p><p> Regarding the most recent discussions on imposing compulsory electronic tagging, EID, for all sheep, the IFA has made the views of sheep farmers very clear to Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Department.  The &euro;2 million cost involved for sheep farmers is excessive and the derogation on lambs direct to slaughter must be maintained.  In addition, the unique situation of hill sheep producers must be accommodated and central points of recording must be available to reduce paperwork and bureaucracy.<\/p><p> In summary, the IFA is requesting the backing of this committee in respect of increased supports for the 34,000 plus sheep farmers operating in the sector.  This sector is very important and deserves its fair share.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Lynskey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444136400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lynskey and Mr. Downey for their presentations.

There might be a small number of suckler cattle and sheep and the dependence on income from sheep is very high.  The CSO figures show that the overall number of sheep in the June livestock survey was 5.16 million.  This is up 1.3% on the 2014 figures but it identified a fall in the number of breeding ewes.  In Australia and New Zealand, the production levels are around 86% of the overall sheep production in the world, but they also have a fall in the number of breeding stock.  The sheep sector is at a crossroads.  Farmers do not know whether to stay in sheep production, invest and continue breeding, or to have dry stock.<\/p> <p>  There are major demands on sheep farmers in spring when the ewes are lambing.  It is not an attractive way of life, especially for younger farmers, and there is an issue, which I think the witnesses have touched on when they identified a need for an incentive for breeding animals.  The figures would back that up.  I think a decoupled payment for breeding ewes should be looked at.  While the figures have remained fairly stagnant in the past four or five years, there has been a fall in breeding stock.  If that fall continues, we will not be able to supply the emerging markets.  The emerging markets in Europe are countries such as Germany, Sweden and the Northern European countries.  We are exporting more at present to the United Kingdom and France but production of the breeding stock is up about 7% in the UK.  That will obviously lead to an increasing internal supply in the UK.  To try to deal with that, we must consider the emerging markets.  The Far East is also an emerging market.  The supply of lamb in the emerging economies is not able to meet the level of demand.  There are opportunities in these markets.  <\/p> <p>  I agree that Bord Bia has a role to play but the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine initially has a role to play in bringing about a decoupled payment for sheep, whether that should be an across the board payment per ewe up to a certain maximum number, similar to the previous payment of either &pound;10 or &pound;20.  I think it is the right way to go.  It is the only way we can incentivise production within the sector.<\/p> <p>  GLAS was mentioned as were the difficulties with the commonage.  The commonage framework plans being implemented at present are causing huge difficulties.  Some farmers want to have one plan in place.  This is causing significant difficulties for farmers in my county with commonages.  It is leading to farmers wanting to opt out of the new commonage framework plans, which is disappointing.<\/p> <p>  Bord Bia has identified emerging markets and has conducted extensive research in identifying market access.  It might be an idea for the joint committee to engage with Bord Bia to ascertain what work it is doing to target some of those emerging markets.  It may well say there is a lack of available supply, which goes back to breeding ewes issue.  <\/p> <p>  Traditionally, lamb prices have been volatile.<\/p><p>Over the past two years there have been peaks and troughs in prices.  They declined going into the middle or end of September and picked up again for the Christmas market but that is a cyclical issue every year.  Price stability affects the lambing season because one can lamb at a certain time and hold on to lambs if one has after grass.  I ask the  witnesses to comment on prices in the lamb sector.  Would a decoupled payment for breeding ewes bring some price stability?  I know that prices are driven by the market and that the delegation will probably identify that fact.    <\/p><p> The presentation has been helpful and useful.  I support what has been said, particularly the suggestion of a decoupled payment.  A lot of payment schemes, such as the TAMS, are very important to farmers who wish to invest in their farms but it takes investment to draw down funding.  I would like to hear the thoughts of the witnesses on the following matter.  I know a lot of farmers, and the delegation probably has the figure, who are up in years and want to hand the farm over to a family member or someone else.  There is a lack of incentive for them to do so and one is nearly paid for doing nothing.  I believe that an inbuilt production payment would greatly assist the sheep sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#K00300","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444136400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Downey and Mr. Lynskey for their presentations today.  Those of us who come from the west will fully understand and appreciate their contributions, suggestions and ideas.  One realises, particularly when one comes from hilly land and areas of mountain ranges, that people must make a living out of land that is far inferior to other parts of the country.  Survival is down to the diligence, commitment and strength of the people involved in the sector which has helped in no small way to keep rural and peripheral Ireland vibrant.  That vibrancy is down to the people who farm that type of land, particularly the sheep farmers.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by the statistics outlined by the delegation that there is an annual production of 58,000 tonnes and that 46,000 tonnes of it represents the third largest export in Europe.  That fact shows the value of the product to rural Ireland.  I was also struck by the fact that the average income is &euro;14,500.  For a considerable period I have fought here against the cutbacks to farm assist, etc.  How many of the people involved in hill farming and sheep farming depend on the farm assist payment?  How have the cutbacks to farm assist, over the past number of budgets, affected the livelihood of these people?  A small contribution from the State can make the difference between surviving and not surviving in the areas that I referred to.<\/p> <p>  I believe that a decoupled payment for ewes would be a good move.  It would be  very helpful if the Government made a statement to the effect that it was prepared to concede to such a measure.  It would make a huge difference to the overall production of sheep and lambs.  The measure would give an element of certainty to the people who produce and work at that level.  I support such a measure.  The delegation mentioned a payment of &euro;20 per ewe.  That would be money well spent by the Government.<\/p> <p>  The delegation mentioned market access and the opening of trade to the US, China and other countries.  Sheep farming has been the poor relation when it comes to farming.  There needs to be positive discrimination towards ensuring that the people involved in the sheep sector get the best access to markets.  It is important we ensure that people are not discriminated against in that regard.<\/p><p>The witnesses mentioned that the strong independent sheep research and advisory programme in Athenry was being maintained as a centre of excellence.

I agree with almost everything they said.  It is vitally important we help sheep producers.  They mentioned the sheep grassland payment, which was absorbed into the single farm payment and which brings us closer to the maximum more quickly than it should.  Something has to be done about that.  The coupled payment would be a way out of the problem but we have to be careful not to drive the numbers up and leave ourselves with the problem of overgrazing.  Maybe if a coupled payment was put in place up to a maximum of &euro;150 or &euro;200, it could help the smaller sheep farmer and it would take less in the way of funds at a time when the money may not be there.<\/p> <p>  Another way we can help the sheep farmer would be in respect of the &euro;1,000 that was lost in the budget cuts of 2008 and 2009.  I have raised this on a number of occasions.  Perhaps it could be restored by &euro;500 over two budgets, if not by &euro;1,000 all in one.  There are 34,000 sheep farmers with 3.5 million sheep but we do not want to go back to 5 million sheep overgrazing on the hills.  Even with commonage frameworks in place we still see a bit of overgrazing here and there around the country.  We have to be careful not to damage the environment.<\/p> <p>  Another problem we have been raising for a while concerns sheep exports to Northern Ireland via the marts.  Sheep going from a farm can travel freely but if Northern Ireland people want to come down to Wicklow or Carlow, as they often do at this time of the year, to buy ewes to breed them, there is a difficulty getting them from the marts to Northern Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  On the coupled payment, we see &euro;52 million going into beef genomics and something along those lines should be done for the sheep sector.  The STAP programme is very good in its own way in bringing farmers out and getting discussions going but we have to target sheep farmers, particularly young farmers starting off, to encourage them to stay with the business.  We do not want numbers to fall any more.<\/p> <p>  As other members have pointed out, farm assist is a problem and we regularly get calls on that subject.  We have to support those people who are dependent on sheep farming and the farm assist will help to boost their income in difficult areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#M00200","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1444136400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the members of the IFA for their presentation.  As they outlined, the sheep industry is a very important part of our overall agricultural package.  It supported the economy when we were in the doldrums and it is important we do not lose sight, as we have done previously, of the role agriculture plays.  Not every acre of land in this country is suitable for dairy or beef production and a lot of sheep production is in areas of natural constraint.  I agree with Mr. Lynskey that we should try to restore the payment under the old disadvantaged areas scheme, now known as the area of natural constraints scheme, back to its 2008 level.  It is important, not only for rural Ireland, to keep people in active farming in those areas.<\/p> <p>  It is important farmers in beef and sheep production are allowed draw a knowledge transfer payment for both sections rather than a joint payment and we will have to lobby the Minister on this.<\/p><p>Fencing should be included in TAMS II.  We can spend up to &euro;100,000 on a milking parlour and get support from TAMS but if somebody spends up to &euro;5,000 on fencing, which is very important for his or her type of farming, that must be included in TAMS II.  The committee must take that up with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p><p> Many have expressed support for coupled payments.  As a nation we have moved away from coupled payments.  I always supported them for sheep and suckler herds.  We have progressed the suckler herd into the beef genomics programme to try to improve the quality of the suckler herd.  We could bring up a similar scheme for sheep.  We would be starting from a low base because we do not have the research criteria.  Something like that would be better than a coupled payment which might damage the industry by increasing numbers for the sake of increasing them, whereas it would be important if people were paid some sort of incentive for improving their breed, their herd and sheep flocks.<\/p><p> Young farmers are very important.  Maybe the IFA witnesses could tell us how many young people are involved in sheep farming.  It was not a sexy thing to be in.  Sheep farming is a hard way of life.  One can put a cow up a crush but when you want to do something with a sheep you have to catch it.  It is a physically demanding job.  Young people will not go into it unless they can get a financial return.  Lamb prices have been fairly steady and good for the past year but because prices were depressed for three or four years there was no incentive for people to stay in sheep production.<\/p><p> It is important that fencing be included in TAMS II.  The knowledge transferred is that farmers are entitled to both payments.  I question the coupled payment but there has to be some support, in a different way and given the areas of natural constraint.  With the economy picking up and a few more quid in the coffers, it is time to restore those cuts because the areas involved in sheep production are those under natural constraint and it would be a way to keep people in active farming in these areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#M00300","speaker":"1125","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444136400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I welcome the IFA representatives and thank them for their presentation.  I generally support the idea of helping the sheep industry in any way possible because it is a tough sector of business to be in.  If a coupled payment was announced where would it come from?  There are 3.5 million ewes in the country.  Will that come from the rural development plan or is there scope within the rural development programme to get more on top of GLAS, TAMS, knowledge transfer and the other schemes?  Is the door closed for another scheme within that programme or must we go back to the European kitty for an extension?  I would like that clarified.  The concept is good but as Senator O&rsquo;Neill said we do not need to increase numbers for the sake of increasing them.  We need quality.<\/p> <p>  The knowledge transfer programme has been very successful and that could be developed further with farmers coming together.  I hope I am wrong but I think getting young farmers involved in the sheep industry will be a huge challenge.  As Senator O&rsquo;Neill said, it is not &ldquo;sexy&rdquo; to be involved in the sheep industry.  It was not sexy to be involved in agriculture during the so-called Celtic tiger years, not alone the sheep industry.  I hope we will not go back down that road.  Agriculture has been the driving force behind the rebuilding of this economy and it needs to be developed and protected for the future.  The key is to get more young farmers involved and create an incentive for them.  In some parts of south Carlow there are commonage issues.  Senator Comiskey spoke about over-grazing.  There may be under-grazing soon.  The majority of sheep farmers who have rights on hills are elderly farmers who have nobody coming after them.<\/p><p>At more than 80 years of age, they will not go up a hill to run around after a sheep for half the day.  What will happen to them and to those rights in the future are major issues to be teased out.  It was a mistake not to include them in the TAMS.  Hopefully, the Minister will row back on that in respect of sheep fencing.  I tabled parliamentary questions in that regard last week and I hope there will be a bit of a row back, which would be helpful.

Sheep are important as part of a mixed farming enterprise and they play a pivotal role in grassland and pasture management and environmental enhancement.  I have a brother involved in the industry but none of my nieces or nephews are too interested in it because it is not attractive.  Sheep farming is labour intensive, which is lost on many people.  The hole in the bucket for sheep farmers is the failure to have their entity specifically identified as such within the CAP reform structure and to have a specific payment for them.  I do not ever fear a return to the late 1980s and early 1990s when Ireland had 5 million sheep.  Everyone in the place had a sheep, including those who did not know the difference between a sheep and a cat.  We do not want that again.  I can recall what happened.  Land was taken willy nilly just to get the sheep.  That is a road to nowhere.  We were up that road and we are now on a road to sustainability and we are trying to ensure that.  That is why any aid that is secured must be targeted.  It should be targeted at the flock.  It is no use having a flock owner with 10,000 sheep.  In the west, in particular, there has to be a cut-off point.  This takes a little thinking.  There is no use diving in, being halfway across the pool and drowning.  We have to think about this and work it out properly.  I have no choice to support this because there are significant sheep farmers around Ballynacargy where I come from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#O00300","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speech","time":1444136400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>The Deputy might want them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#O00400","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speech","time":1444136400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>They have always voted for me up to now because they had no one else.  The IFA has identified a figure of &euro;25 million and the issue is how we secure it.  It is important because many people are digging in and there is a constrained amount available.  This will be supplemented by giving access to a number of specific schemes.  It is a little irritating that significant grant aid can be secured in one sector but a sector such as this is the poor relation with little done in respect of fencing and management issues.  Money could be provided and it would only require a small amount.<\/p><p>It is small money because at that level &euro;2,000, &euro;3,000 or &euro;5,000 is the equivalent of &euro;150,000 at another.  The TAMS II scheme must be looked at again because it could be an area of interest.<\/p><p> I am also supportive of the idea that any support for which we can argue and secure should be directed at active farmers.  That is a matter about which I feel strongly.  The provision of support for farmers who are on their farms night and day and get up at 3 a.m. with weanlings and so on is very important.  <\/p><p> It is also important not to omit market initiatives that could be taken.  I have no doubts about the role played by Bord Bia, Mr. Aidan Cotter and others.  We have the best beef and sheep marketing board in Europe and it can continue to play a constructive role in marketing and other related areas, even in the home market.  On a trip to France in the early 1990s I recall going to the big Rungis market at 4 a.m. and remember distinctly how preferential treatment was given to home product over Irish product, some of which had been brought in from my own area, Kilbeggan.  I wonder if that is still the way it is?  In trying to break into these markets I wonder if home produce is still given preferential treatment?  Notwithstanding the fact that there is equal access to markets and everything else, are we still at the stage where countries always hoist their own flags?  If that is the case, we should hoist our flag and make sure domestic consumers also appreciate the value of the very good product we produce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#O00500","speaker":"1063","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444136400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank members for their comments, all of which were positive.  Many people talk about the west and small farmers, particularly sheep farmers, but we need to lose sight of and move beyond that issue at this stage.  Quite simply, we want to have a balanced industry across the country.  In order to have a viable sheep sector we need to have lowland and upland sheep.  It is clear from all of the reforms and support mechanisms put in place that direct supports drive numbers and output.  There is a concern, which was expressed by some members, about the effect this can have on the environment and associated issues, but if we can drive numbers and output, it will secure a supply of product to keep the factories in place and jobs secure.  On top of this, while we develop and break into new markets, we can guarantee a continued supply over the full year.  There is no point in getting into a market for a couple of months and then being out of it for the rest of the year; it is simply not viable to do so.  That aspect is of critical importance to us.  <\/p> <p>  On the environmental side, many have talked about commonages and our position on them.  In terms of what we need to consider, we have to be clear on what has always been our position.  We need individual plans for individual commonages.  Once we have done this we have to revisit and examine the need for flexibility to allow active farmers to farm commonages in the correct way.  This can be measured and done on a planned basis, but we need to have a plan to make sure it will happen.<\/p> <p>  GLAS presents a huge problem for us because we see the exclusion from it of low input grasslands.  This will have a huge effect on farmers through the halving of the amount of land in respect of which they can submit applications.  That has to be reversed.  Put simply, if the Minister takes something out of the scheme, surely additional measures should be included to act as a counterbalance if there is overuse of a particular measure.<\/p> <p>  Another important issue raised was succession and the need to get young people involved in the industry.  Members have read our pre-budget submission in which we raise the issue of the phased transfer of farms from one generation to another.  We need to deal with that process in a stronger way.  In addition, we must ensure the leasing incentives in place will continue to work.  I will leave the question of farm assist to Mr. Kinsella who might be able to give more details and outline the current position on the scheme.<\/p> <p>  This is a low income sector which relies on a suite of schemes and payments.  I refer to the sheep technology adoption programme, STAP and the farm assist scheme, but what is vital is a direct payment which we see as essential in the future.<\/p> <p>  A few members mentioned the facilities in Athenry.  I want to make it absolutely clear that there is a need for a centre of excellence for the sheep sector.  The facilities are available in Athenry, but that initiative has to be driven and we need to get real results from it.  <\/p> <p>  I will leave the issue of tagging to the chairman, if he wishes to address it.<\/p><p>Senator Comiskey raised the issue of how vital it is to rural areas to have these schemes in place.  The issue of exports to Northern Ireland continues to be a problem for us.  We need to examine this, both on the cattle side and the sheep side.  There must be give on this because we are excluded from direct sales to our nearest neighbour and our cattle have been discounted in those markets.  That is not acceptable and we need to look at that area in more detail.<\/p><p> Restoring the disadvantaged areas payment would be a huge vote of confidence in this whole area.  Allowing farmers to participate in two of the discussion group payments is essential.  The value of these discussion groups and the knowledge that has transferred directly to farmers has been phenomenal.  One of the key things to emerge from discussion groups is the value of paddock grazing and rotational grazing.  To make that happen, it is essential that one has proper fencing and yet we have the targeted agriculture modernisation scheme, TAMS II, which excludes that.  It is a no-brainer to me.  Payments need to be made in that respect.<\/p><p> Schemes should be an incentive to improve, not just a payment for having sheep.  Deputy Penrose stated very clearly the difference between a cat and a sheep.  While that might be a stretch, we want people who want to farm these areas and learn the skills associated with farming difficult areas.<\/p><p> While overgrazing is a problem, a whole new set of quotas from Europe has been put in place.  We have the environmental quota which restricts the number of animals that can be put in an area.  The risk of overgrazing in commonage areas has been reduced because there will be individual plans for each of these areas with which farmers will have to comply.  I do not see that as a risk.  These can be used flexibly to manage it; to put extra sheep to get it under control and then put a correct management figure on it.<\/p><p> Deputy Penrose raised the issue of the Rungis market in France.  What he saw happen there in the past has actually increased.  The renationalisation of European markets is absolutely clear.  We see what is happening in the UK with the little Red Tractor food standard symbol.  I always say we want to be in the little trailer behind the red tractor, not in the skip.  If they are bringing us along in a trailer, we are selling on an equal footing.  If they put us in the skip, we are dumping in there.  We are the largest exporter of beef to the UK and 90% of our agricultural produce goes there.  We can damage markets just as quickly as we can protect and look after them.  The French market now has a flag system that is making a difference.  We were promised a free European market but it is going in the opposite direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Downey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444136400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Across the board, the impression has been given that sheep farming is the poor relation, which is absolutely correct.  Once that is realised, we can move on.  We need our fair share of the supports.  This is why we want to ensure the sector, the poor relation, get its fair share of the supports available to maintain it.  In 2002, when we were down at around 1.2 million ewes, the IFA fought a battle for the sheep grassland scheme, which was introduced in 2008.  It was not a huge payment but enough to grow numbers to 2.5 million ewes.  The numbers stabilised over several years and, over the past two years, lamb prices have been reasonably stable.  However, ewe numbers have dropped.<\/p><p>We see a drop because this payment has slipped from being a targeted support for sheep into the CAP payment.  This is where we are at and why we are here looking for support to get a fair share to maintain sheep numbers, maintain meat factories around the country and maintain the markets mentioned.  Therefore, it is vital that a support is available to maintain the numbers.  We do not believe there is any basis for the fear of overgrazing and of driving numbers to the highs of the late 1990s if the support is targeted correctly to the sector to support productive farmers willing to do a good job, producing lamb.  There is a market deficit in Europe.  Reference was made to the increase in sheep numbers in the UK.  The UK can consume the exact amount of lamb it produces, but it imports a cheaper New Zealand lamb and exports some of its own.  That is the position.  Sheep numbers are falling right across Europe, so the prospects are there of a market for our lamb.<\/p><p> We have pointed out that full electronic identification, EID, across the board would cost sheep farmers in the region of &euro;2 million or &euro;2.2 million per year without any noticeable benefits to them.  In our discussions with the Department on the matter, it said there is no issue on traceability where lambs go direct to slaughter from the original farm where the lamb is produced.  The Department does not have a problem with that position and we are looking for the derogation to continue.  In the case of light hill store lambs, which are sold for approximately &euro;25 to &euro;50 per head, placing a tag costing in the region of &euro;1.40 to &euro;1.60 per head is an excessive charge for the sector.

It is very clear there is broad support for those proposals.  That is related to the fact that, first, the people here are in touch with their sheep farmer constituents on the ground and, second, our national sheep committee is also at that same place so there is a general consensus on what is the right thing to do, and there is consensus in the committee in that regard, which is positive.<\/p> <p>  In a broader sense, it is very important for the sheep sector that we maintain our critical mass.  I would be very concerned if we were to move toward or fall below 2 million ewes.<\/p><p>That would be a serious situation because at that stage we would lose factories, markets and customers and we would not get them back because we would not have the critical mass.

That was a pretty serious blow and we need to ensure we do not lose another.  In that regard, we have clearly identified today what needs to be done, as outlined to the committee.  Twenty-two countries across Europe are not silly.  They have identified this and taken a decision.  It is not an easy decision and it gets complex, as Mr. Pat Smith said.  The funding comes from CAP Pillar 1 for those going down a coupled route or, alternatively, it is some combination.  We have &euro;580 million per annum in RDP funding over the coming years.  There are adequate resources in the system to try to prioritise some level of payment for the sheep sector and that is what we are asking the committee to support.<\/p><p> Mr. Downey highlighted one figure that stood out for me.  Professor Alan Renwick from UCD identified that every &euro;1 of support to the sheep sector delivers &euro;2.70 in overall economic output in the rural areas we are all trying to maintain and support positively.<\/p><p> Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill asked about farm assist.  I do not have the precise figures for the number of sheep farmers eligible for farm assist; we can get those.  There is an increase in these remote rural areas where sheep farming is important.  That is directly linked back to the reduction in the level of direct payments that have gone in in the past.  I refer in particular to REPS and the disadvantaged area cuts that a number of members of the committee clearly said need to be addressed.<\/p><p> Senator Comiskey and a number of others asked about the Northern Ireland issue.  On sheep, it is very specific.  There are two markets here.  There is one for breeding animals coming from the Chairman's county and another of other counties.  Under current EU regulations, live breeding animals may not be exported to another EU country unless they have been tested and the flock has been certified as TSE free, which is almost impossible in an Irish context.  As Mr. Downey said, we need discussions with our Northern colleagues to resolve that trade issue whereby we are prevented from trading on the cattle and sheep side with Northern Ireland in an uninhibited way that can let that market free up.  We need to bear in mind that approximately 400,000 or 500,000 lambs come south for slaughter and we cannot send our breeding animals back up north.  That is not acceptable and needs to be addressed.  We have looked at it very closely and it is very difficult to address within the regulation.  It needs more attention.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for this opportunity.

The point has been raised at every joint Border committee meeting.<\/p> <p>  I thank members their contributions to this discussion.  I come from the country which has the highest average flock.  I am also a sheep farmer.  Sheep production in this country comprises two categories, namely, low-land flocks, which are mainly big commercial flocks, and upland flocks, both of which have a role to play.  As stated by Mr. Downey, we need to have this industry across all sectors.  Deputy Penrose made the point that the industry contributes enormously to good soil and grassland management and, in particular, to the control of diseases such as ragwort.  It is easy to identify a farm that has sheep because there is never any ragwort evident on it.  That is a very basic, simple fact of life.<\/p> <p>  Sheepmeat, which is probably the healthiest red meat on the market, is in danger of being defined as a luxury product as opposed to a product accessible to the masses.  Chicken is probably the greatest competitor of sheep, pig and other meat products.   <\/p> <p>  On the points raised during today's meeting by the IFA, there is widespread support for the TAMS to include fencing.  As has been stated, sheep will never stay where they are put.  They must be controlled.  It is important GLAS and other commonage schemes provide for sufficient numbers of people who want to produce sheep.  Sheep must be part and parcel of the plan.  In other words, this should form part of the incentive of having sheep in the uplands.<\/p> <p>  With regard to marketing, I have already addressed that point.  On EID, I would like to float a suggestion.  I agree with the proposal in relation to the two derogations.  However, in my opinion, two yields should derive from EID tagging.<\/p><p>One advantage is that it does away with paperwork.  If a farmer decides to sell animals and they are EID, the responsibility is to get feedback from the mart or whomever with a paper or electronic readout that is theirs, so they just tag them and bring them in.  There should be a common sense approach to lost tags and lost animals, especially on uplands.  This could form part of a genomics-type scheme to deal with TSE or scrapie.  A number of animals are tested - maybe 5% per annum - and that might be agreeable to achieve scrapie-free status, especially for sires, in particular, where the target has to be.<\/p><p> Those are some of the ideas that should be examined in greater detail.  However, the coupled payment has to be incentivised for improved animal health and production.  One is not going to get it otherwise.  The knowledge transfer must form part of that because we have seen the value of it.  To get 4,000 out of 34,000 is a start but it is nowhere near acceptable when one considers that probably half the country's dairy farmers are part of discussion groups.  That should be the ultimate target.  <\/p><p> In the early 1980s, New Zealand had 70 million sheep but it is probably back down to half that number now.  Lamb production, however, while not the same, is very nearly the same through better flock management, grassland and management skills.  That was only gained by knowledge and research.

Accompanying me today are IFA national dairy chairman Sean O&rsquo;Leary, IFA national liquid milk chairman Teddy Cashman, IFA general secretary Pat Smith and IFA dairy executive Catherine Lascurettes.<\/p> <p>  The end of 31 years of quota creates a real opportunity for Irish milk producers, who operate cost-competitive, grass-based production systems, to supply fast growing global dairy demand for high quality, sustainably-produced dairy products and ingredients.  However, this positive outlook comes with major challenges around volatility of prices and input costs in particular.  Indeed, dairy farmers all over the world are currently living through a difficult period of sustained low milk prices.<\/p> <p>  Extreme income volatility for dairy farmers has been the norm since 2007.  Farmers will need tax policies and milk price instruments to help them manage this reality.  In addition, farmers will need well-resourced advisory services to help them improve efficiencies further.  The Government must also ensure that the banks give farmers access to flexible, internationally competitively priced finance with variable repayments to reflect income variations.  At the conference of parties, COP, in Paris in December, the Government must secure climate change legislation which gives farmers credit for their low carbon footprint in the global context, and which does not prevent them from expanding sustainably.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to our national dairy chairman, Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Leary to present the issues in greater detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Downey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444136400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>There is a positive outlook for dairy, but there will also be cyclical price and income challenges.  World population is growing rapidly, with the equivalent of the population of Germany being born each year.  It is projected to grow to 9 billion by 2050.  Most of the population growth is predicted to occur in emerging countries and as numbers grow so will the percentage of those emerging populations classified as middle classes.  This is important because the emergence of more affluent middle classes always coincides with changes in diet.  Consumers in those countries will be ambitious to move from poorer quality vegetable protein to higher quality animal protein, often supported by government health related policies, such as the Chinese school milk scheme.<br\/><br\/>The long-term outlook as predicted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Food and Agriculture Organisation, OECD-FAO, market analysts and confirmed by most experts is for demand to grow somewhat more slowly than in the previous decade, at around 2% per annum, with global supplies chasing it at a slightly slower pace.  There is huge potential for countries that are capable of producing high-quality dairy products and ingredients efficiently and sustainably to supply this growing demand.  Ireland is one of the very few countries well placed to capitalise on this opportunity.<br\/><br\/>Volatility in milk prices and input costs has, however, multiplied over the last decade.  This is a result of much greater levels of trade, the quasi-abolition of market supports in Europe, and the greater prevalence of weather events across the world.  Economic and geopolitical events, such as the absence of China from the market, the current low oil prices and the Russian ban on EU food imports, have also played a part in worsening price volatility.  Farmers will have to learn to manage the impact that the extreme fluctuation of prices will have on their income in order to supply this growing demand and fulfil the sector&rsquo;s economic potential.<br\/><br\/>In respect of solutions for the short and longer term, right now the biggest issue for dairy farmers is cashflow or, more to the point, how their cashflow will evolve over the coming months in the face of low milk prices, high superlevy and tax bills and repayment commitments.  Come next spring, we will have the added challenge of lower milk cheques as relatively smaller volumes and lower constituents mean lower milk price value.<br\/><br\/>The early payment of up to 75% of the basic payment scheme, BPS and rural development programme, RDP<b><\/b>will provide welcome short-term assistance.  The distribution of Ireland&rsquo;s &euro;13.7 million share of the EU targeted aid, which we have called on the Minister to match with national funds as is explicitly permitted by the EU and to distribute equally among all the farmers concerned, will also be of some help.<\/p><p>It is also vital that all rural development programmes be fully funded, and that TAMS<b><\/b>is administered efficiently and promptly to allow farmers carry out their investment plans in good time.  However, the type of cash flow pressures we are seeing right now will be part of the dairy cycle over the coming years.  A suite of policies and instruments must be developed and offered to farmers to help them manage their income for the longer term.  The setting up by Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, of the Dairy Forum is welcome in this respect, and it must be used by the Minister to put pressure on all stakeholders &ndash; including banks, industry, Government and the EU - to deliver long-term viable solutions to the challenges of farm income volatility.  <br\/><br\/>The &euro;500 million EU aid package voted by Council on 7<sup><\/sup>September, which enhances APS for dairy products, increases promotion budgets and makes &euro;420 million worth of direct payment available to EU dairy farmers, will provide some assistance.  However, the EU Commission and Council have shied away from doing the one thing that would actually help put a floor on dairy markets and turn them around faster &ndash; increasing the so-called intervention safety net so that it is more in tune with actual production costs.  The Minister must keep this issue on the agenda and progress it, not play the EU Commission&rsquo;s game and wait for markets to recover and leave the issue unaddressed, to cause difficulty again when the next price trough arises.<br\/><br\/>Banks and other finance providers must come under greater Government pressure to make available to farmers competitively priced, flexible financial products, which allow farmers to take repayment holidays or go on interest=only repayments without re-pricing or re-negotiation costs.  The Minister must also seek maximum leveraging of the European Investment Bank funds to support the sector, including farmers.<br\/><br\/>With all the stakeholders around the table of the dairy forum, we want to see the Minister drive greater engagement from industry around fixed price and margin contracts and other forms of optional price-margin hedging.  As yet, too few farmers have access to or even understand the potential value of such contracts to help them manage their business for the long term.  A crucial piece in addressing income volatility will be to tackle the EU Commission on state aid rules, in order to increase our ability, at national level, to deliver individualised tax-based solutions. <br\/><br\/>IFA has proposed a detailed scheme to allow farmers to put away funds in good years, to be returned to their taxable income for investment or in poorer years.  Such schemes exist in New Zealand and Australia, and in a smaller, more restrictive way, in France.  It is essential that we provide this type of individualised flexibility to assist farmers in managing their volatile income.<br\/><br\/>With budget 2016 only a few days away, I also take this opportunity to thank members for attending our lobbying session last week.  The land mobility initiatives facilitated by last year&rsquo;s budget decisions are immensely valuable for new entrants and expanding dairy farmers.  However, more can be done to facilitate farm investment.  I remind the committee of IFA's proposals to encourage lifetime transfers and farm restructuring by phasing transfers through partnerships and to accelerate capital allowances for sole traders, among others.<br\/><br\/>One element which the forum did not discuss at its inaugural meeting, and which we cannot and must not shy away from, is the need for efficiency benchmarking at processing level, with a view to identifying savings and removing costs, including through co-operation, and even consolidation.  This is an exercise which the industry itself must undertake, but it must be part of the focus driven through the dairy forum.  Only an optimally efficient dairy processing and marketing sector will be able to deliver on its fullest potential for the Irish economy.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Ireland&rsquo;s sustainability credentials in milk production, being measured through the Bord Bia sustainable dairy assurance scheme on every dairy farm, and promoted through the Origin Green campaign, must be given the fullest recognition in Paris at the COP later this year.<br\/><br\/>Liquid milk is facing a particular challenge.  One of our team today is our national liquid milk chairman, Mr. Teddy Cashman.  He has invited the members to the launch of the IFA Liquid Milk Handbook later this week, and can talk to members later on of the particular concerns we have on the sustainability of specialist, contracted liquid milk suppliers in the post-quota era.  Expansion opportunities do not exist outside of exportable milk, and with intrinsically higher feed and labour costs in delivering milk counter-seasonally, there is a real need to reassess payment structures and regulation within the liquid milk chain to secure fresh, locally produced milk supplies for a sector worth over &euro;500 million at retail level.<br\/><br\/>I will hand back to IFA President, Mr. Eddie Downey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444136400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>It is very clear that Irish dairy farmers with the right supports and help have a bright future in growing their business to supply quality products for a growing global demand.

With the correct suite of instruments and policies available to them to opt into, farmers can learn to better manage this extreme volatility.

This is obviously a vitally important area as we have come out of the era of quotas.  I think quotas were in place for approximately 32 years.  Many farmers viewed the end of the quota era as an opportunity to invest, getting away from the super levy culture and moving into investment.  The financial crisis came and had a major impact, which was touched on in the presentation.  Intervention and production opportunities were also touched on.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the dairy industry produces a commodity and one is dealing with the markets.  All the markets are volatile.  In the US, there is the change in the interest rate and the Chinese market has gone through the floor, all of which are having an impact right across the board.  In the most recent milk auction in New Zealand, prices were up 16%.  However, 16% of a very low price is not a great deal.<\/p><p>The demographics of the world population present great opportunities.  Incidentally, the European population up to 2050 will fall by approximately 50 million.  Most of that increase in population will be in the emerging markets or in Third World countries.  The population growth will be most evident in places like Syria and Iraq.  There will be opportunities but it is about getting to those markets.  <\/p><p>The<i>Journal of Agricultural Economics <\/i>has looked at the difficulties dairy farmers are experiencing in Ireland, in particular investment opportunities which are being lost as a consequence of no finance being available.  A paper by Conor O'Toole and Carol Newman in that journal examined the challenges dairy farmers are facing, in particular smaller and medium sized dairy farmers as a result of having no reserves in place and not being able to withstand the current challenge which the larger farmer might be able to withstand.  They called for policy intervention at Government level, similar to the call from the IFA, that is, for the Government to get tough with the banking sector and to provide some level of fluidness in regard to being able to lend to the dairy industry as an industry with growth potential in the Irish economy.  That has to happen.  Some form of Government-sponsored or European Investment Bank loans  may be the only alternative to a fluid banking sector.  Do the delegates have a view on what can be done by way of policy intervention in that regard?  Do they have suggestions or recommendations?<\/p><p>Do the delegates have views in relation to the EU market mechanisms, such as intervention, export refund or private storage aid, which was introduced and then taken away in September?  They mentioned the possibility of intervention.  Intervention may be required but obviously it will lead to difficulties with storage and so on.  However, one would hope that when the markets improve, one could sell on the product.<\/p><p>What about the export refunds?  Does the delegation believe that it would form part of a solution at European level under the regulation and the protocols available to Commissioner Hogan?    <\/p><p> No one envisaged the price volatility in the dairy sector - in fact, the price has dropped off the cliff.  The price has gone from a high of 43 cent to about 29 cent.  According to Bord Bia's figures, the average price per litre is lower than that at the moment.  The price was rising from June 2014 but since January 2015, it has fallen off the cliff.   Quotas have obviously played a role in the price drop. <\/p><p> In a nutshell, will the delegation identify the two or three main solutions, from a public policy point of view, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine implement?  What solutions does price volatility call for?  Will the delegation explain its solutions in a nutshell so that the committee can use its resources to ample potential to try to raise these issues?  There are approximately 200 dairy farmers in my own county of Donegal.  This issue has affected a lot people who invested heavily in this sector because they expected that the abolition of quotas would bring about financial rewards.  Unfortunately, many of the smaller or medium sized dairy farmers will go to the wall unless there is some form of intervention at a policy level, whether using European tools or in regard to banking, and the economics back this up.  In regard to banking, one will only borrow from the banks if one seeks to invest.  Why would anyone invest in a sector if there is no policy support for a three-year or five-year period?  I would like to hear the thoughts of the delegation on my points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#X00300","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444136400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation from the IFA.  We spoke about the sheep farmer being the poor relation with the previous delegation but as a dairy farmer, I know what it is like to be the poor relation at the moment.  This time last year, in advance of the abolition of the quotas, I was one of the first to suggest we produce a report at the beginning of the year, following consultation with all of the stakeholders.  That was very important.<\/p> <p>  I disagree with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill when he said that most dairy farmers did not expect a huge drop in prices.  I felt there was an expectation, but perhaps I was living in dreamland, that even though the long-term outlook was quite positive, the short-term outlook would be difficult.  As has been said here again, what was said at the time was that there were opportunities and challenges going forward.  The biggest challenges existed last year.  In my opinion, the superlevy situation was the biggest challenge.  This year we were faced with the biggest superlevy bill to come our way in quite a number of years.  That bill was the biggest challenge we faced in the short-term because the people who had invested heavily would be the same people who would have to pay back the superlevy.  <\/p> <p>  There are still massive opportunities.  During the summer or late spring, I attended the opening of a new Glanbia facility in Belview in south Kilkenny, as I am sure some of the delegates did.  Some people might say it is in Waterford but it is in south Kilkenny.  A point was made that day which I will not forget for a long time.  I think it was Mr. John Moloney who made the point that there are 75 milk producers in Ballyragget, County Kilkenny, who will over the next period put an extra &euro;10 million into the local economy of Ballyragget due to the extra milk they will produce.  That is a huge financial contribution to make to a local area.  That is the positive side of the development but there are challenges as well.  It is important to note that there are plenty of small areas with 75 milk producers that can develop in the same way over the next period.<\/p> <p>  As I said at the start of my contribution, we produced a report last March.<\/p><p>We brought in all the main stakeholders, the IFA, their colleagues in the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, the banks, processors and so on.  The dairy forum was up and running last week, which is very important.  It was probably born as a result of our deliberations at the time.  It is important to review where we are now in light of our report.  Before this meeting, I suggested that over the next few weeks, we should bring in all the stakeholders again, particularly the banks.  They have a huge part to play.  Several new producers are coming into the system now, such as young farmers, who may have borrowed heavily and will require assistance.  Someone suggested payment holidays or extending payment plans.  This time last year, I attended a Bank of Ireland briefing in advance of the abolition of quotas.  The bank was very proactive in telling us what it had on offer and that it would be able to handle volatility in the future.  I am not certain that is happening.  The dairy farmers I talk to are not entirely happy that what was promised last year has been delivered.  We need to investigate that.  There is only so much we can do in Ireland on this issue.  We are now playing with the big boys in the world market and we will have to get used to that.  We will have to get our house in order before we can play away.  <\/p><p> Twenty years ago we were getting 20 cent per of milk but now we are getting 26 or 27 cent.  The cost of production has increased by 50% in those 20 years.  That is why we must look at where the costs are and what we can do to reduce those costs.  Energy costs have increased a great deal, although they have reduced a little in recent times.  We must analyse where those costs come from and whether we can produce milk more efficiently.  Milk farmers are very efficient and produce a very efficient product but we must analyse that 50% again and how it can be pared back.<\/p><p> That is why I think it is important to have the processors in as well, when we have the opportunity.  Are they in a position to give a better price for milk?  They will probably say \"No\", but we must see what exactly they can do.  Our report mentioned the New Zealand lesson and people mentioned this from time to time and the Northern Ireland lesson.  We must learn lessons from them.  New Zealand was in a similar position to us 20 or 25 years ago, producing probably the same amount of milk as we did pre-quota and the prices went through the roof.  There have been serious consequences there, such as animal welfare and mental health issues.  Farmers there did not go down the efficiency road and analyse where the costs arose.  We must learn from that.  There was a similar situation in Northern Ireland.  There are obviously issues that can be dealt with at European level, which would be very helpful.  The package of measures that was announced was helpful to a certain extent, as was bringing forward the 75% of the single farm payment.  The downside of that, however, is that there is only 25% left at the end of the year, making coming into springtime challenging.  There are pros and cons.  There are huge challenges but there are also huge opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#Y00200","speaker":"968","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444136400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Where I come from is not a huge dairy part of the country.  I saw when the quotas went up in springtime last year, the huge investment people made and it is vitally important the banks do not put pressure on farmers.

With our current strong, positive outlook, there is a chance for the future.  The banks should not tighten up on farmers at this time.  I have spoken to farmers who are experiencing serious cash flow problems, particularly small farmers who do not turn over much milk.  Many farmers use their co-operatives where they sell their milk to get their feed and so on.  In June and July, they had small cheques coming in.<\/p><p> It is crucial that the EU intervention price be increased.  There was an opportunity to do that and it should be examined again.  The &euro;500 million aid package will be a help and, as Deputy Deering said, providing 75% of basic payment is welcome but when we get to December and January, farmers will be in difficulty because that is the time they need money as the spring approaches and they have to spend a great deal of money on feed and so on.  The outlook is good but there will be a difficulty for the next few months and it has to be managed for farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#Z00200","speaker":"1124","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444136400,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank the IFA dairy representatives.  It is important that we ensure that the industry continues to grow at a sustainable level and that farmers can make money.  We received a briefing document before the meeting, the first line of which is a post by Oliver Moran on Ireland, which is on the Agricultural and Rural Convention website.  He states: \"Having had a massive economic crash in 2008, one driven in part by an unsustainable property bubble, Ireland seems to be rushing headlong into another potential troubling bubble called milk.\"  While the prices over the past few years were not unsustainable and it was great that everybody benefitted, five or six years ago, milk was 18 cent a litre.  We are relying on a world market.  The price of a barrel of oil is currently less than $50 a barrel whereas it cost almost $200 a barrel less than 18 months ago.<\/p> <p>  We need to examine how we provide support to ensure people remain in the industry.  When we joined the EEC, people over-extended in the late 1970s with their investments and banks took possession of their farms eventually.  We cannot allow that to happen again.  As Oireachtas Members, we can make statements and lobby the Minister but when the IFA, as the main farming organisation, meets the banks, it  must ensure they are honest and truthful in the way they deal with farmers.  They extended the hand of friendship, brought them in and gave them the money they wanted.  As Deputy Deering said, when bank officials appeared before the committee to discuss the expansion of the dairy industry, they could see problems coming down the line.  The briefing document refers to the European Milk Board and reports from France, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Germany and even New Zealand highlighting problems.  I hope these are short-term problems but the Russian situation is causing a major issue for the dairy industry while China's lack of economic growth is causing another issue.  We have opened all the markets we can and farmers cannot deliver more efficiencies.  We have the most efficient dairy farmers in the world at this stage and that has been borne out by Teagasc figures.  Farmers have delivered the efficiencies and it is now up to us, as legislators, and the co-operatives, which are controlled by shareholders, to make sure the primary producer is not squeezed.  In every agricultural sector, the retailer is taking the profit and we have to change that.<\/p> <p>  Senator Comiskey mentioned the supports the EU Commission has provided for the dairy industry and he said he would like an increase in the intervention price.<\/p><p>The price is now 22 cent per litre.  If we increase it to 35 or 36 cent, it will make the co-ops lazy.  They would see they had a level at which they could sell into the market at 25 or 26 cent and, accordingly, would not try to market it.  We must ensure all markets are exploited.  It is all about efficiencies.  Regarding the banks, we cannot see people who are overextended being closed down.  I hope this is only a minor blip and the view is that the price will return.  It might not return to the level of 43 or 44 cent a litre, but if it gets to 30 or 31 cent, it will be all about efficiencies.  As farmers have geared up for higher production, they are producing more, perhaps at a better price.  We have the most efficient dairy farmers in the world such that they cannot cut their costs anymore.  We must, therefore, ensure the cost of imports such as fertilisers and oil is not allowed to rise in the world market.<\/p><p> The Government has supported agriculture for several years, particularly in the past two budgets through the farm partnership scheme and tax breaks.  I agree that farmers should be allowed in their tax income to put funds away in good years for investment in poor years.  The Department of Finance has to examine that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#AA00200","speaker":"1125","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444136400,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I am not surprised at what has happened because the committee, under the Chairman, carried out a detailed analysis of the issue of market volatility in the dairy industry.  The Chairman anticipated it well.  We heard from the Irish Dairy Board, the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, Teagasc and other interested parties.  I remember saying at the time that the Food Harvest 2020 proposal to increase milk production by 50% was ambitious and that one had to hasten slowly.  I was warning people who had no knowledge of the dairy industry to be wary of getting stuck into it.  That warning was prescient.  We understand what it is like for efficient farmers.  What must it be like now for those who are inexperienced?<\/p> <p>  The average price of milk last year was 38 cent per litre because of various world factors.  In New Zealand there was a drought in 2012 that led to a large price increase.  In 2013 there was a drought in America, with a cold snap in the European Union.  It is a function of the market.  Demand rises because of various events which are mainly weather-related.  The Fonterra Co-operative Group in New Zealand had warned about price volatility and I was not surprised at the turn of events in the price of milk.  It is a global issue.  Production expanded because of various events which, as I said, were mostly weather-related.  Then the market and consumer preferences changed.  There was a downturn in the Chinese economy, which resulted in a decline in demand in China for milk.  It is important, therefore, that the marketing bodies and processors continue to sell Irish milk in the way they did before.  I recall when the committee was dealing with the issue of milk prices that we had the banks in.  They are offering all sorts of financial product.  I am always concerned about people who come offering incentives, which is grand on a fine day.  However, it is on the cold day when one has no shelter, that one needs help.  <\/p> <p>  Questions were being asked about how we should pay the superlevy fine which was &euro;100 million but which was reduced to &euro;60 million, thanks to the appeals system.  The banks made all sorts of suggestion such as having prompt pay systems.<\/p><p>They were going to do the devil and all.  Bank of Ireland had set aside a fund of &euro;1 billion to assist in meeting the 2020 targets and wondered why nobody was using the AgriFlex loan facility.  Farmers in Ireland have a very low level of debt in comparison to their counterparts in other European countries.  The banks had various suites of financial options for farmers but the only point they put forward with which I agreed was that dairy farmers should take a \"better-before-bigger\" approach when considering expansion.

In the context of tax, the Government is obliged to take income averaging and various other issues with which farmers are faced into account.  We need short-term solutions to address what, I hope, are short-term problems.  That is the issue.  Some things have been done.

A major opportunity has come along for farmers who have been operating with their hands behind their backs for 30 years.  Farmers could not expand their enterprises.  We came late to the European Union from that point of view and, therefore, we were disadvantaged.  In the intervening period, farmers in New Zealand increased output four times over while we stood still.  That is the reality.<\/p> <p>  The removal of the milk quota has made no difference to the price.  The price has increased by 0.8%.  That is not the issue.  As was quite rightly pointed out, what have affected us are global changes such as, for example, those in the financial sector, what has happened in China and America, falling oil prices and, of course, the Russian ban.  We trade in a commodity which must be traded at a world price.   It is how we manage the givens in the market and get it to deliver a sustainable situation for the family farm units here that is at issue.  We pride ourselves on our family farm units.  We do not want to see them disappear, nor do we want them to become huge units.  We want to continue to have family farms.  That is why we put forward our policy.<\/p><p> Everyone has identified the banking system as being critically important, which it is, but we need flexibility in it.  Every time I met the banks, I made it clear that we want sensible lending to farmers.  We want the lending stress-tested properly and we want to know if the farmers will be able to make the repayments.  We have no ambition to end up with a situation such as that in New Zealand, where debt levels have gone through the roof, or the Netherlands, where debt levels are at &euro;18,000 per cow, which is unsustainable.  We do not want to arrive at such a point, lumbering our family farmers with that type of debt level.<\/p><p> We need a sensible approach to lending.  However, there is also a responsibility to manage the loans sensibly.  The banking system has to provide more flexibility to deal with short-term problems.  No one built a milking parlour for one year.  I do not like it when a farmer starts jumping up and down saying he is going to go broke.  My view is very simple.  The farmer built a milking parlour for 20 or 30 years.  We want parlours to be built for 20 or 30 years and we want sustainable industry.   I met a man at the ploughing championships.  He told me he is after taking out a lease on land at &euro;300 an acre for the next ten years.  He says that the milk price is going to break him but his problem is not the milk price.  We need to get that message back to farmers and I will happily live with that.  We also have to get the message back to the farmers on the ground to be sensible with the measures they take.  <\/p><p> The other big issue is volatility.  We have proposals in our budget submission.  We need to examine them and see if we can get something that works sensibly, which will allow a farmer, if there is a good year, to put a few euro aside in a tax account or wherever and bring it back in later.  No tax will be foregone because the averaging system will take it out of it in any event.  Let us allow the farmer the power to manage his business and use it in the most efficient way.  I think that can be done. <\/p><p> Another big issue raised concerns oil prices, which are down.  Grain prices are also down.  Is this a short-term problem?  How long will we be seeing low prices?  The problem is that grain prices continue to be low.  When grain prices are low, American farmers drive milk production and will continue to do so.  They also have forward contracts for milk, which will potentially elongate this problem.  Political intervention is required.  There has been a complete failure on the part of Commissioner Hogan and his team to examine the intervention system.  They keep telling us that it will take eight to nine months before they review the system and are at the other end of it.  We need to start that eight or nine month process.  This should have happened and we should be two months or so into it already.  Everyone in this room has stated this fact already but the key point is that this is a commodity which is being traded by commodity traders.<\/p><p> Commodity traders do not come into a market when a price has fallen.  They stand back.  By not looking at intervention, the signal has been given that we are going to allow the price to fall.  If we had put our hands up and said we were going to look at the intervention system, the signal would have been clearly given that there is a floor and that we had better get back in and buy the product we want for the next number of months.  Traders would have re-engaged.  That is the position that should have been taken and why there has been such a failure.  It is not that intervention would have had a huge effect.  There would not have been a huge buy-in or laziness on the part of the co-operatives to buy into the intervention system at an increased price from where that intervention is as of now.  The markets are stronger than it.  We want the intervention system and the prices to take account of the current cost structures.  It is as simple as that.  We want that put in place.  <\/p><p> The cost of doing business, including the costs of energy and fertiliser, is another issue.  Four major companies control the fertiliser market.  Is there a cartel in operation?  The market has four major companies and a levy, which protects one major player, on imports into Europe.  This is crying out to be examined.  One major company in Europe is protected by a levy to stop other product coming in.  This is manipulation of the marketplace which is placing extra costs on farmers and needs to be examined.  <\/p><p> Investment, banking and flexibility are important issues but farmers must take responsibility as well.  We cannot simply say that the industry is wrong or that the price is wrong.<\/p><p>Farmers have to make good solid investment and that means having good quality advice from Teagasc.  Farmers have to be advised of the level and the cost of borrowing at which they can operate.  The co-operatives need to be efficient and farmers together with the co-operatives need to co-operate in generating more efficiencies.  Given the size of the milk pool, there are certainly question marks over the number of co-operatives.<\/p><p> Russia made a political decision to stop the export of European products into Russia.  It was a political decision to put that ban in place.  The consequences of that political decision are clearly being felt on family farm units all over Europe, particularly in eastern Europe.  The political system in Europe needs to stand up and take responsibility for that and make good decisions.  The failure on intervention stands out as a failure.<\/p><p> It was AIB bank which came up with the phrase \"Better before Bigger\".  We are absolutely clear that is how it should be.  If a farmer cannot make money with 50 cows, he should not have 200 cows.  Farmers should start and get the processes right and then build up from that point.  We want to build the industry.  It involves sensible banking, good control of costs and Government intervention by way of taxation and other supports.<\/p><p> My colleague Mr. O'Leary will add to my contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#CC00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Downey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444136400,"counter":79,"content":"<p>The president has covered many points.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill mentioned in his contribution that dairy farming is a commodity business.  Largely that it is true.  As an exporting nation we find ourselves more exposed than other countries.  However, it is not just a commodity business and Ornua has been working on developing the brand - developing the Kerrygold brand - and moving it up the value chain.  That investment which had already taken place did in some ways shield us from the worst effects of the fall in milk prices.  The effects of the fall in prices happened faster in Europe and in New Zealand where they had a higher cost base.  To a degree, as has been said around this table and in the report, volatility was not a surprise.  It will always be part and parcel of milk production.  The timing was a surprise, with the quick fall from the high prices down to the current price level.<\/p> <p>  Teagasc has said that one third of dairy farmers will lose money in production this year.  The fall in prices in the middle of an expansion phase is the major part of the problem.  Farmers invested from cash flow, maybe through lack of the financial products.  This was obviously a mistake, as investment should be longer-term.  A number of issues have made this problem worse.  The valley of the trough went lower and is lasting longer than we expected.  It is not the normal 12 months to 18 months cycle of highs and lows.  That is another lesson for which we have to plan.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill asked what we were going to do about that level of volatility.  The president referred to solutions to deal with volatility.  What has also helped some farmers in some processor areas is the ability to lock in margin.  Glanbia has done this.  Other co-operatives have developed fixed price contracts, not tying in the margin.<\/p> <p>  What we were pushing for at the forum was that the Minister would push the industry toward looking at further long-term volatility coping solutions.  We are a small country in the overall scheme, however, we have a number of plus factors and our structure is good in terms of farmer ownership.  We have the power and we have to push it in terms of getting co-operatives working closer together and developing products.  Initiatives are being taken by Ornua in terms of developing a hedging index, which will allow farmers to consider hedging as well as developing products so that they can hedge forward at an industry level and by extension tie in milk price over a period.  That will give farmers some security.  That is not for everybody.  All of these options come at a cost and we cannot lose sight of that.  However, when farmers who are heavily exposed in the level of debt they carry, and the new entrants in particular, can tie down their input costs and the margin in general it will give them a far greater coping mechanism.<\/p><p>This is something we have to measure.  <\/p><p> Referring briefly to the issue of intervention, the Commissioner has taken a steadfast position against it.  He has said to leave the market do its work and that we will be out of the downside more quickly.  We have stated consistently that there should be a review of emergency levels and have called for a review.  The Commissioner has said such a process will take too long.  There will be another volatility crisis in the next number of years followed by others.  It is provided in legislation that the EU must review the intervention levels to reflect the costs of production and the market at a point in time.  We need this to happen.  This is not just about the response but is something that has to happen and will bear fruit further down the line.  <\/p><p> I will not deal with the issue of the retailer and the middleman and who gets the margin, which is more Mr. Cashman's area, except to say the milk sector would be more exposed to the problem.  Mr. Downey has dealt with most of the other issues.  Mr. Cashman might deal with the issue of liquid milk and where the margin goes, which is an area that has to be examined. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#EE00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444136400,"counter":81,"content":"<p>On retailer margins, legislation was introduced this year relating to competition.  Our biggest problem with it is that it did not go far enough in terms of having an Ombudsman, as is the case in the UK.  Below-cost selling is also not banned any more.  Those kinds of instruments are helpful to keep things in line.  I have stated in the past that we need legislation and not aspirations to make these things work.  We have heard many aspirations but have not seen enough done on the legislative front to ensure they are realised.  This is about fairness.  When we speak of the product chain in Ireland or any other market, there is the retailer, the processor and the farmer.  We are farmer representatives but it is fair to say that each link in that chain needs to be paid.  Money is being transferred and the economics work through the economy for that to happen.  We are looking for a clear portion of the retail price to be passed back to the farmer to ensure our costs of production are covered and we can make a margin.  We do not begrudge others in the chain their margins or their businesses but we need enough to keep us alive and to ensure there is fairness in the system.  What was introduced in the retail legislation in Ireland has not gone far enough.  Commissioner Hogan has made noises around this issue at a European level.  I attended a National Milk Agency meeting today.  One of the issues the chairman raised at the meeting was how prices for dairy products have crashed so hard across Europe and in fairly mature retail markets such as France, Germany and the Netherlands.  A huge amount of the produce of those countries is sold to big home populations.  We have a low population relative to our dairy output and are largely an exporting nation.  Those other countries would not face the same scenario.  There has been a certain amount of use or abuse or whatever way one might want to describe it of the situation by the retail sector to gain more margin.  The sector has been opportunistic in some markets.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to the retail scenario, my view is that this concerns fairness.  As a matter of fairness, there should be proper remuneration at every point along the chain.  Farmers carry the greatest cost.  We also return possibly the most to the economy because we source our raw materials here.  Unlike foreign direct investment, to a large extent, all the input costs come from the Irish economy.  The money is transferred around the economy and benefits everyone.  The same scenario applies to the 75 farmers in Ballyragget mentioned earlier.<\/p><p>In the context of the retail scenario, it is about fairness and having proper legislation in place because aspiration does not work and what is required must be properly legislated for.

A large swathe of the EU market supports were done away in 2007 or at the end of the previous Common Agricultural Policy, the one that has just finished.  The situation prior to that was that, by and large, we had a global market with relatively low prices and an EU market with much higher prices.  The logic of the export refund measure was that one was bridging the gap between the two, but that is no longer the case.  Today, skim milk powder and whole milk powder prices would be similar for such products coming out of the EU for export, and also, for example, on the Global Dairy Trade, which, incidentally, this afternoon went up another 9.9%, so markets are righting themselves, as we speak.  They have a way to go, as was pointed out, but they are going in the right direction.  However, it is cyclical.<\/p> <p>  We no longer have a budget for market supports at European level.  We now have to tap into the so-called crisis fund.  Such a fund can only be generated out of a levy on farmers' basic payments.  I would have some reservations about export refunds in terms of how useful they can be at present.  The current Common Agricultural Policy does not do a great deal to address the issue of volatility.  There is much more work to be done around providing information that can be used through the milk market observatory to establish indices and to do the kind of thing that can be done by the USDA in the United States, namely, providing hedging mechanisms and options that are readily and simply available to farmers.  The Commission should take an interest in this area.  For all sorts of the WTO-related reasons, I do not think we will see export refunds being relevant again, particularly in the context of their being no fund for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#GG00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Lascurettes"},{"type":"speech","time":1444136400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Did Deputy Deering wish to make a comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#GG00800","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1444136400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I have a few brief points.

What has been said for some time is that the prices being paid for milk were below the cost of production and that they were unsustainable.  New Zealand was more exposed than other countries in that it was exposed to the Chinese market and when that market was closed, it found itself in difficulty.  There have been four positive GDT auctions in New Zealand.  Obviously, the volumes are a little lower, but it was working hard to try to change sentiment, which is what we were seeking to do in Europe through the use of intervention measures.  Sentiment plays such a strong roll in the market and it has changed.  We have seen spot prices climb week on week in Europea.  Last week they were up, on average, about &euro;30 a tonne across the product range, with the exception of cheese.  The market has, therefore, turned around.  The next job is to get milk prices to rise.<\/p> <p>  To return to the issue of contracts, their duration and so forth, it has saved us to a degree with prices coming down.  It is the lag effect, but it will probably work against us if prices start to rise.  From talking to farmers at the national ploughing championships two weeks ago - members will have heard this also - they are looking to seeing the price start to change next spring resulting in a positive sentiment.  I hope that will be reflected in a positive vibe in the market.  <\/p> <p>  In the other big market, the US market, an increase in production in the region of 1.4% on an annual basis is what is being talked about.  Demand is increasing in that market also.  The currency factor is a plus for us.  <\/p> <p>  The culling rate in New Zealand is quite high.  A reduction in the region of 6%, 7% or 8% in this production year is being talked about.  If that were to happen, we would see lower production.  The overhang of product and the likes of the APS introduced by the Commissioner can play into this also.  We will see a gradual price increase, the bottom having been reached, but nobody is saying it will be immediate, rather it will be slow.  If farmers receive that positive message, they will react with more confidence.  Despite what many have said, I do not think farmers jumped headlong into it.  They took account of what was going to happen and what their capacity was within the farmgate to expand.  There was pent-up frustration having been held back for 30 years, but, by and large, the plans made over a period a time will stand up to the pressure.<\/p><p>The immediate pressure of cashflow in an expansion mode is something at which we must look.  Maybe the brakes have been put on a little bit by this price fall but I think the right supports have to kick in at the right times, that is, from Government, the banks and the processing industry, which has to get itself together in terms of efficiency and benchmarking.  With the monitor farms and the greenfield farms, farmers can measure efficiency and not everyone measures up.  Where are the efficiency and benchmarking measures within the processing industry and how does one processor measure up against another and against its international counterparts?

It may be a scary fact but unless it is nurtured properly, to use Mr. Cashman's words, by all concerned, that could be the scenario.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#JJ00300","speaker":"968"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444136400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>To respond, we will launch a document on Thursday, 9 October, in the Alexander Hotel which covers many of those issues and it is timely because of the end of quotas and the different opportunities available to farmers now.

There is a lot behind that.  On the Competition and Consumer Protection Bill, which I hasten to add we asked the IFA in to discuss, we were staunchly in favour of legislation underpinning the Ombudsman.  We have been told the regulations are ready to be published and the implementation of what is there should be a good step.  We will see if it is enough but if it is not, I think it will have to be led by Europe.  A previous Commissioner, Mr. Ciolo, put, for the first time, a reference to the producer organisations into the CAP to give power to the producers to negotiate without having to fear the Competition Authority, as it was in the past, and which the witnesses are aware of.  From that point of view, there is work to be done.<\/p><p> We should not forget the liquid milk producers.  Ironically, it is the one the consumer in Ireland is most familiar with but almost takes for granted because the milk is on the shelves, yet it is probably the most vulnerable at the moment.  It certainly needs to be watched.  Sometimes it is the fear of loss that spurts some kind of initiative, which seemingly happened in Britain.  That is something that we should keep an eye on as well.  <\/p><p> The State-aid rules have been referred to.  It would be interesting to see how France got around that and whether there was a certain trigger point, when the price hits a certain level above that, from which a fund is extracted directly rather than from the farm profits from the price of the milk, and put into a holding fund that triggers back in as a support when it gets below a certain point.  Maybe that is because such a process does not constitute State rules and is actually farmer funded directly.  There might be a way around that.  The other issues were the contracts, in particular, for liquid milk and a recognised percentage margin which should be backed up by the legislation and regulations from the Government.  <\/p><p> We will bring in the banks and if we have time, depending on what happens, we will bring in Ornua and Bord Bia as well.  They are important players from the point of view of a long-term industry.  This industry will be the main driver of the Irish agri-food sector from the point of view of output and production, along with beef.  Certainly dairying is the one in which there is big room for expansion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015100600002#JJ00700","speaker":"1103","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444136400,"counter":101,"content":"<p>To remind the Chairman, &euro;13.7 million is coming from Europe and the opportunity is there for us to match it here at home.

Some people might say at times that farmers need to be protected from themselves but I would reject that.  There were one or two funds introduced by some processors last year and that was used to support milk prices in recent times.  If some products or initiatives are introduced by processors, the important thing is that there is a transparent system, that farmers see that if money is there and is not being passed onto them directly, that it is put into an alternative fund and that it is transparent and does not reflect back on base milk price.  It is a question that some farmers are asking of their processors - the fund is put in place but is it then being used to subsidise a lower base milk price?  There is not the same situation in dairying as there is in beef with regard to farmers and processors but I think whatever systems will be put in place in future will have to be voluntary and transparent.

I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. Brendan Griffin, the director of licensing, and Mr. Keith Johnson, the director of marketing and membership.  I thank members for the opportunity to address the committee on the topic of our recently published report, The Socio-Economic Contribution of Music to the Irish Economy.<\/p> <p>  We commissioned Deloitte to undertake this study.  Consultations were conducted with IMRO members and with key industry representatives, including artists, labels, publishers, songwriters, management companies and retail and broadcast personnel.  The findings demonstrate real opportunities for the sector, which currently supports over 11,000 jobs and contributes almost &euro;500 million annually to the Irish economy.<\/p> <p>  The report highlights a number of areas where action could be taken, including finance, market access, intellectual property, education, training and collaboration.  It outlines a number of recommendations, including: establishing a music industry task force with representatives from Government, the business community and industry to reinvigorate the sector and encourage collaboration; appointing what we have termed an \"IP tsar\" to consider the impact of intellectual property and copyright legislation and enforcement in both music and technology industries; the development of advanced training courses for music professionals to focus on the business of music education, particularly for early career musicians; greater collaboration among the music, tourism, gaming and technology sectors; greater support for musicians, many of whom are self-employed, in accessing finance and ensuring any fiscal supports are effective and appropriately structured; and the establishment of a music office, Music Ireland, to act as a focal point for the music industry, similar to the Irish Film Board, which would provide assistance to individuals in the music sector and those looking to enter new overseas markets.<\/p> <p>  These policy interventions have the potential to increase activity and jobs in the sector.  The music industry is fully committed to taking the lead on these initiatives but Government support remains crucial in terms of the speed at which progress can be made.  There is a will within the music industry to push forward but collaboration is the key if we are to maximise the positive effects on Ireland's reputation for culture and creativity.

I am delighted they have come before the committee because there is no doubt music is one of the most important industries we have at present.  In the context of tourism, it is huge.  One need only read the various surveys carried out over the years, in which people were asked what they did while they were in Ireland, to discover that the vast majority engage with music in some form, whether at a festival or a concert, in a pub or whatever.  There is also the community aspect of music, which plays an important role in strengthening people&rsquo;s morale and encouraging them in many other ways.  The statistic of 11,500 who gain employment through music is only a small part of its monetary aspect.  It does provide very important employment.<\/p> <p>  I compliment IMRO on the report.  It is exceptionally well done.  There has been wide consultation with all the partners involved in music.  There is no doubt that the message - not just the statistics but what IMRO hopes to achieve - is very well laid out.  What does IMRO see the task force, which is central to its vision for the future, doing?  Does it see it as an official or semi-official task force, possibly appointed by the Government?  All of that is important.<\/p> <p>  The almost 50% decrease in sales of recorded music in recent times is a huge challenge and has happened in a very short period.  Does IMRO feel the task force has a role to play in that regard?  The music offices are interesting as IMRO seems to be trying to give status or an official profile to the importance of the music industry.  At one point the report refers to the things we take for granted, which is quite right.  The witnesses might touch on that when they respond.  We do take for granted what is there.  If we were dealing with any other industry, whether construction or agriculture, it would be a constant topic of debate and discussion.  IMRO is right to try to bring music as a career and a community and broadcasting expression centre stage.  Do the witnesses think the task force is sufficient?<\/p> <p>  IMRO refers to financing and I presume that, as in all areas, it must set out its stall about where that is most needed.  I agree that up-and-coming artists make a very big decision and take a huge risk when setting out.  We all know of people who buy their first guitar or whistle and work away at home hoping that some day they will reach a stage where they will be accepted as important and develop a career.  Can something be done in that regard within the educational system?  Music forms an integral part of education but more often perceived as a cultural expression or a hobby.  Very often, guidance counsellors direct young people towards the type of employment they might consider.  Is there something within the educational system that might be of assistance in that context?  The manner in which IMRO has laid out the results of its survey and the report is quite graphic and straightforward.<\/p><p>The figures are clear, but Mr. Finn is requesting the committee to consider sending a recommendation to the appropriate Departments on the issues he has raised in order that they might be considered in a proactive way rather than leaving them on the long finger.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015100600002#D00200","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444137300,"counter":114,"content":"<p>That is a good suggestion which we can discuss later in our deliberations.

We would see it being appointed by the Government, with representatives on it from the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Communications and Natural Resources and, possibly, Finance.  We would require representatives from at least three of these Departments.  The music industry and wider commercial expertise from outside it should also be available to the task force.  In, particular, the task force should comprise people from within the industry, together with representatives of the various Departments involved.  It should be time limited and not have an open-ended remit.  We believe that within a period of two and a half to three years it should be in a position to drive home most of the recommendations made in this report with the intention of having them become Government policy across the various Departments.  We are talking about a focused group, with industry and departmental experts working over a relatively short period.  It would provide strategic leadership and direction in tackling some of the main issues we have identified in the report.<\/p> <p>  The Senator rightly pointed to the significant fall in sales of recorded music, in particular in the past five to six years.  IMRO has been to the forefront in ensuring the licensing of new online services providing music, be it through streaming or downloading.  This makes music available to consumers in a form they want and at a time they expect.  That means that the creative community is receiving remuneration for the use of its work in the online environment, but that does not mean that all uses of music in the online environment are licensed.  In the report we have called for the appointment of what we have termed \"an IP czar\" who would be a copyright expert to lead policy in the area of intellectual property and copyright.  There are significant opportunities not just to follow but also to lead European policy in this regard.  <\/p> <p>  There are significant problems with the manner in which European copyright legislation is being implemented in member states.  The safe harbour provisions in the European copyright directive, for example, provide opportunities for those who wish to minimise their licensing fees to do so.  This is one area where we believe significant progress could be made.  The creative community is suffering because its remuneration has dropped alarmingly in the past five to seven years.  That is at the expense of large technology companies the income of which is entirely dependent on the use of creative works, but the commensurate level of remuneration for these works bears no relation to the use the companies derive from them.  Therefore, there needs to be a rebalancing of the remuneration of the creative sector compared to the benefits the technology industry generates.  This issue is high on the agenda in Brussels and Ireland could and should take a leading role in dealing with it.<\/p><p> We believe a music office would provide an opportunity to have more structured support for the music sector.  In many organisations, such as the Arts Council, Culture Ireland, First Music Contact and IMRO, funding is available for new entrants into the industry to break into overseas markets.  We believe if that was centred in one music office, in the same vein as the film board acts for film, it would be far more beneficial for new entrants into the industry and could lead to significant growth.  In many cases, the domestic market is not big enough to sustain a career in the music industry currently and many of our new entrants need opportunities for overseas earnings to subvent their income, especially at the start.  We would see a music office as possibly providing repayable grants over a period of time, depending on the levels of success.  We believe it would be self-funding.  Most of the recommendations in our report are not overly expensive in terms of draws on the Exchequer.<\/p><p> Financing is related to the point the Senator raised and also to the area of a music office.  The banking sector and some arms of the State engaged in promoting industry do not seem to understand the creative industries and how they deliver returns to the country not only in terms of copyright but through other invisible earnings.  The Senator rightly pointed out the benefits that accrue to tourism directly because of the availability and the popularity of music as an entertainment medium throughout the State.  Our tourism industry has grown substantially in recent years.  The principal reason many people come to Ireland - research has borne this out - is because of the entertainment value music provides them with when they arrive here.  The indirect benefits of music to the economy are also significant.  My colleague, Mr. Keith Johnson, will deal with the issue of education and training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015100600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Victor Finn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444137300,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Education and skills development and continuous development are important across any industry, particularly in the music industry.

We note there is a requirement to bolster this area in order to give a gear change to the industry as we move forward.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the schools and third level, it is important to build on what is currently happening in schools and to have a better co-ordinated approach to music education.  It is not that this is not happening within the schools sector, it is just that very often there is not a co-ordinated approach and, in many cases, music is not seen as a viable career.  We want to foster a notion that there is a long-term career path and an expectation that one can develop a career in music.  Putting in place mentorship programmes for students would be an important aspect of any programmes that would emerge from any initiatives with which a music office might assist.  <\/p> <p>  We would also like there to be a greater contribution towards initiatives that encourage creativity through teaching at primary and post-primary levels.

The Senator has already touched on many of the questions.  As a music lover myself and someone who loves going to concerts and festivals, as well as growing up in a pub, I understand the importance of music.  At home when I was younger, I would have been guilty, like everybody else, of streaming or downloading music and songs which is obviously a significant problem for the smaller artist, particularly Irish artists.  What does the Irish Music Rights Organisation see as its role in educating people of the damage that this does?  How would it encourage people not to do this?<\/p> <p>  There has been much change in film viewing over the past several years.  No longer do only television channels show movies but one has YouTube, Snapchat and other different social media formats which have made it easier for people to get involved.  This has also made it more difficult for people to make money and promote themselves.  How does IMRO see itself in the social media aspect of this?<\/p> <p>  The Government could do more to help.

I do not want to minimise the problem because it is still an issue but it is not as big a problem as it once was.  Some of the newer methods of distributing music online, for example streaming, are now fully licensed.  In the online area, we have adopted a three-pronged approach.  There is education, especially in the youth area with a schools programme, part of which highlights the importance of copyright and earnings for the creative community and, in particular, musicians.  The second stage is to ensure all services are licensed, as much as we can.  The third stage is enforcement.  If a provider is not licensed, we seek to have them licensed.<\/p> <p>  There are two tiers in how streaming works.  There is premium streaming where one pays a monthly membership fee to stream on a monthly basis.  Then there is free streaming which is supported by advertising.  Both are legal services.  The streaming services would like people to transfer to the premium model.  This model is delivering reasonable returns to copyright owners.  We are still in this evolving market where streaming services are trying to migrate people from the advertising model to the premium service model.  They are being slowly successful in that but it will take more time for it to bear more fruit for the creative community.<\/p> <p>  Side by side with that, one has services which allow access to music online where they are refusing to be licensed or they are what we would term under-licensed, in that they are claiming the exceptions available to them under the safe harbour provisions.  Some very large companies claim exceptions to copyright regarding many of these uses that go through their networks.  This continues to be an issue and needs to be addressed, not just at Irish level but at European level.<\/p><p> In relation to radio and the amount of airplay artists receive, we think that is an issue the task force would be ideally suited to address, once it is made up of industry experts and people from the relevant Departments.  It is one issue that could be addressed.  I would also add that given the development of downloading, streaming in particular, and curating of content on streaming services, radio continues to be very influential in discovering new artists, both online and on social media.  I agree that social media are also very important in that role; therefore, we should not just confine ourselves to concerning ourselves with the issue of radio.  That environment is also changing by the day, but, nonetheless, it is an important issue and something we would like to see a task force address at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015100600002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Victor Finn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444137300,"counter":122,"content":"<p>The delegates are very welcome.

Recent research into Alzheimer's disease has shown the benefits of music and how taking up a musical instrument can help to prevent Alzheimer's disease.  The benefits are so good, but the information does not get the airplay it deserves.  Music is important in the economic sphere and enterprise, but it should also be considered from the health perspective.  It is taken for granted.<\/p> <p>  We all know that tourists go to Irish pubs, but they do not even have to come to Ireland to hear Irish music because the concept of the Irish pub has travelled, as has Irish music.  I compliment Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s group, Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, and the support it provides for traditional Irish musicians.  A plan for Irish music is required and the task force is necessary.  The Chairman said he would look further at the recommendation that a task force be set up.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the tax exemption to be spread over a period of years.  I presume the proposal has already been sent to the Minister for Finance.  One could have a great three or four months in one year, but it might not be the same in the next year.  That is a matter that should be examined, in addition to having a music office.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. Finn clarify the position on people who transfer from being represented by a label to being represented by IMRO?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015100600002#H00400","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444137300,"counter":125,"content":"<p>The easiest way to answer the Senator's first point is, if someone has rights to a musical work, that is, he or she is a songwriter, and is an artist who releases on his or her own label, he or she is entitled to copyright protection from IMRO for the musical work and its broadcasting.<\/p><p>Artists are entitled to copyrights from IMRO in terms of musical work and the broadcasting of it.  Such artists are also entitled to royalties from Phonographic Performance Ireland, PPI, which is the representative body for the record labels.  If the artist is own-label, he or she would be entitled to join both PPI and IMRO concurrently.  There are separate rights and the artist would receive separate payments in respect of them.  Many artists now release on their own labels and are, effectively, SMEs; it is a small cottage industry for them.  They are entitled to join both organisations.<\/p><p> I agree on the health benefits issue.  We deliberately themed the discussion around the social and economic benefits of music.  The health benefits are certainly well documented in research.  I thank the Senator for bringing that to our attention. <\/p><p> We have asked for the artist's exemption to be evened out over a period of years rather than it having to be availed of in any one given year.  The earnings from an album, for example, can occur over a period of three, four or five years and it would be a fairer exploitation of the exemption that is available, especially to up-and-coming artists.  It is only available up to a certain level.  It is particularly directed at smaller-earning artists and is therefore directed where it is particularly needed.  We would like to see it extended over the four or five year period.<\/p><p> Did the Senator have any other questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015100600002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Victor Finn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444137300,"counter":127,"content":"<p>It think that was it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015100600002#J00200","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1444137300,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests this afternoon.  I strongly agree that the music industry greatly contributes to the overall economy.  I believe music and its many offshoots have a massive impact on tourism, in particular.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; would support me in saying the Fleadh Cheoil was an enormous success in promoting Irish culture and heritage and the Irish music tradition nationally and internationally.  It has also been extremely beneficial to tourism in Sligo and the north west for the last two years.  It brings huge numbers of visitors to Sligo town and the wider region.  The Fleadh brought an estimated 400,000 in 2015 and over 350,000 in 2014.  It is also estimated that in 2014, the music festival was worth almost &euro;40 million to the local economy in Sligo and would have been closer to &euro;50 million in 2015.  Local hotels, restaurants, pubs, small businesses and the general public all benefited financially from the promotion of the festival.  Many residents leased out their rooms.<\/p> <p>  While the rewards to the local economy were enormous, only &euro;90,000 in specific Government funding was allocated to the Fleadh Cheoil in 2015.  I am sure we will all agree that this was returned in full by the spending that took place over the duration of the event.  There could be greater support offered, with a possible focus on promoting certain acts - for example, new and emerging artists.  I am sure the witnesses would all support that.<\/p> <p>  The second example I want to discuss is the Sligo Live music festival.  I see from the witnesses' report that IMRO is prominently involved in the sponsorship and promotion of music in Ireland, including Sligo Live.  The festival has been running for the past 12 years and has grown into a major music festival in the north west.  Only yesterday I met a delegation of the Sligo Live organisers, and I have with me the programme for this year's festival, which takes place from 21 to 26 October.<\/p> <p>  It is unfortunate that specific Government festival funding for Sligo Live was drastically reduced by 60% in 2015.  For over a decade, the festival had always received in the region of &euro;50,000.  This year, that was reduced to &euro;20,000.  No festival can receive that large a grant cut and be expected to provide the same level of service.  Both young and very well-established artists are playing the festival.  This needs to be re-examined in the near future.<\/p><p> F&aacute;ilte Ireland's policy on the funding of music festivals seems to have changed this year.  I will seek a meeting with F&aacute;ilte Ireland in that regard because the loss of a festival such as Sligo Live would have a major damaging effect on Sligo's tourism product.  Sligo Live is more than a music festival in that it offers new artists the opportunity to grow and develop and it attracts music tourists to the region, which is only beginning to expand its tourism potential.  It takes place in October when the tourism season is over and there are few festivals taking place elsewhere.  It is unfortunate that this year the Sligo Live festival is in a very challenging position financially.  I would be fully supportive of greater investment by the Government in the Irish music industry.<\/p><p> What percentage of IMRO funding is available for sponsorship of festivals around the country?  How does IMRO undertake the allocation of funding?  What is IMRO's stance on the funding of music festivals such as those I have listed?  Does IMRO have a part to play in the development of the smaller music festivals throughout the country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015100600002#J00300","speaker":"1082","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444137300,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Although our primary role is to collect and distribute royalties, we do have a long-standing policy of fostering and developing new music creation throughout the country.

Sligo Live is a festival we have sponsored for a number of years, principally the new and emerging artists stages at the festival.  We also sponsor Sligo jazz festival, and have done so for a number of years.  We have also sponsored the Other Voices festival in Dingle, the Christy Hennessy song contest in Tralee, which will take place at the end of the month; and Song School, which is the national programme where IMRO members go into schools to teach children about the craft of song writing and the need to respect copyright.  BEO is another schools programme which was initiated in Donegal and has spread throughout the country as well.  We provide support for a large number of song contests and festival, principally the smaller ones.  Typically, the funding we provide is a small amount of money.  Not only do we provide financial support, we also provide promotional support.  We use our network of communications channels to help provide promotional support for the various different events taking place around the country.

We have asked Deloitte as part of the research to do a cost-benefit analysis on the benefits accruing, as opposed to the cost to the Exchequer.  It informed us that for every one euro invested, between &euro;4.10 and &euro;7.40 could be generated by the industry.

That is putting it bluntly, but I could be more sharp about it.  The directors of IMRO include Mick Hanly and Eleanor McEvoy.  Obviously, there is a very small population base and if a performer cannot break into the island off this island, it is quite limited in terms of earning a living, which is a pity for gifted people.

I know that there are some very good c&eacute;il&iacute; bands in Cork, but they are not as good as the Kilfenora C&eacute;il&iacute; Band which has been around for more than 100 years.

Technology is everything now.  The great thing about the fleadh in Sligo is that it has brought it into an urban environment.  I came across people living in my estate who generally would not talk about traditional Irish music and who, because it was on television, as people do with their fingers when they are not texting, changed channels.  It is amazing that in an urban centre, probably for the first time ever, music is fed into people's homes on their television screens and most are impressed by the number of young people who are playing.  These young people from throughout the country are fine musicians and it is technology meeting what is our traditional music, which is very positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015100600002#K00500","speaker":"1038","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444137300,"counter":135,"content":"<p>The committee might be interested in the statistic that 1.1 million people watched the fleadh cheoil on television.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015100600002#L00200","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1444137300,"counter":136,"content":"<p>On TG4.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015100600002#L00300","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1444137300,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Yes.

The regulation further specifies that the macro-economic forecasts upon which the budget is based must be either produced or endorsed by an independent body.  Ireland, like the vast majority of euro area member states, has taken the endorsement route with the endorsement function assigned to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC.<\/p> <p>  The endorsement process for budget 2016 has been under way since mid-September, culminating in a presentation by my colleagues and I to IFAC last Thursday.  For the annual budget, as distinct from the stability programme, IFAC has a role in assessing just the short-term projections, namely, those for the current year and the following year.  I can report that last Friday, IFAC formally endorsed the Department's economic projections for 2015 and 2016.<\/p><p>The numbers are 6.2% real growth in 2015 and 4.2% in 2016.

We sent this to the clerk on Friday last.  We will put this on the Department's website this evening.<\/p><p> The economic projections we are presenting are based on the technical assumption of a budget package amounting to &euro;1.2 billion for next year, which is the latest stated policy position.  It was set out in the stability programme update, SPU, that was published last April.  It is a purely technical assumption and does not represent the Government's policy position.  The economic forecasts that will be presented on budget day will take account of all budgetary measures.  As the Minister has outlined in his letter to the Chairman of the committee, we are not in a position to discuss the fiscal situation or the implications for policy.

Let us turn to slide 3.  As members will be aware, commodity prices have fallen significantly in the past year, in particular oil prices have fallen sharply, owing to a weak global demand and robust supply.  To put it in perspective, oil prices excluding the very peak of the global downturn in early 2009, have suffered the largest year on year decline since 1986.  Ireland as a net energy importer should benefit from this decline.<\/p> <p>  Let us now turn to slide 4.  Currency developments are acting as another significant tailwind for the Irish economy, with the euro depreciating sharply against both the dollar and sterling in the past year.  To put this in perspective, it is the largest year on year depreciation of the euro against the dollar and sterling since the inception of the single currency in 1999.  Both these factors are acting as significant tailwinds for the Irish economy.<\/p> <p>  Let us now turn to slide 5.  External demand remains reasonably solid with our main trading partners performing relatively well.  The graph shows quarterly GDP growth rates for the US, the UK and the euro area, which collectively make up approximately two thirds of Ireland's exports.  The US is performing well with steady job gains underpinning the consumption and recovery there.  One can see a slight blip in the first quarter, which is mainly due to one-off factors such as labour disputes at west coast ports and the extreme weather conditions on the east coast.  One can also see there was a resumption of robust GDP growth in the second quarter of this year of 1% relative to the previous quarter.  The UK economy also continues to grow steadily with strong domestic demand and, importantly, the growth outlook in the euro area is picking up, perhaps not as fast as might be expected, given the tailwinds, but it is moving in the right direction.<\/p> <p>  Let us turn to slide 6.  This slide summarises our external assumptions.  Our external GDP growth assumptions come from the OECD's interim economic assessment.  The main difference relative to the stability programme update, SPU, is the marked decline in the US GDP growth rate.  Again, this is mainly due to the very weak key 1, which I touched on earlier.  There has also been a pick-up in the growth outlook for the euro area for this year relative to the SPU.  As required, we make the technical assumption that exchange rates are unchanged as of end September going forward.  As a result our exchange rate assumptions are broadly in line with those at SPU. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100600002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Power"},{"type":"speech","time":1444147200,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Let me interrupt Mr. Power.

That is a useful place to start, given the external environment that Mr. Power has described.<\/p> <p>  If we look at the recovery in recent years, it commenced with an export led recovery and then firms started to invest in machinery and equipment in recent years.  We had positive investment growth and in the past year or two we had growth in consumption by households.  In the first half of the year, when one looks at the monthly trade series in respect of goods or overall exports in the national accounts, growth has been extremely strong.  We see double digit growth in goods and services in each of the first two quarters.  If we look at the monthly trade data, we will see year-on-year growth relative to the same month in 2014.  This growth is in double digits.  Let us take the example of July, merchandised trade was 25% higher than in July 2014 and plus 22% in June.  That is not just in the foreign sectors of the economy.  If we look at what we might consider to be indigenous sectors, products that are exported by Irish companies, such as food and tobacco, we are seeing from the monthly trade data robust large high single digit figure growth as well in those areas.<\/p> <p>  On the services side, it is interesting that there was double digit growth in the first two quarters this year, mainly driven by ICT services.  Turning to import growth, given the structure of the Irish economy we have had consumption growth in the first half of this year and last year.  Let us think about the types of things that households have started to consume.  We had a record number of car licences, in the order of 100,000 by August this year, which is the first time this has happened since 2008.  The consumption of white goods has increased.  These products are imported into the economy.  We have had quite high import growth as well.  In the second quarter of this year, there was an importation of a patent of intellectual property into the economy, so service imports may to some extend may have overstated the import growth.<\/p> <p>  That describes the external situation in terms of the economy.  We will move to domestic demand and this is illustrated in slide 9, with the investment story.  This is important and it is what the private and public sectors are doing in terms of construction.  This is a complex graph, unfortunately I do not have a screen but we have the overall investment series, which is GDFCF, Gross Domestic Fixed Capital Formation.  It is expressed on a quarterly basis back to the first quarter of 2014.  We have four sub-components.  In the past we probably thought about investment in terms of just building and construction and machines.  Due to recent methodological changes by statistical agencies, we have things like intangibles showing up in investment, that is, investment in things like R&amp;D and other types of intangible assets as well.  Aircraft has also become more prominent.  There was a methodological change this year.  Ireland has a very large aviation leasing sector and as of the national accounts released in the summer of this year, all the purchases of aircraft by leasing companies, regardless of where those aircraft are used, are regarded as investment by Ireland.  At the same time they show up as imports as well because we import aircraft.  There is no impact on GDP, although in the future it will give rise to fee income by the leasing companies, which is a service export in future years.<\/p> <p>  What stands out this year is the positive growth in core medium enterprise, that is, what is happening in factories.  We also had positive growth in intangibles.  In the second quarter of this year a large patent was brought on shored by an Irish company.  This will give rise to fee income to patent income going forward.  That did not give rise to GDP in the second quarter of this year because it was imported.<\/p> <p>  Let us turn to the next slide, which deals with residential house building.  We are forecasting approximately 13,000 units this year.  This is a 16.5% growth in new housing.  We can see how the curve has progressed.  It is coming off a low base.<\/p> <p>  Slide 11 deals with commercial real estate.  This data from CBRE are quite important.  They are showing vacancy rates in the Dublin area for office accommodation.  In the first half of this year, the vacancy rates were in the order of the mid 2000 levels.  There is big demand side pressures which we think will give rise to investment in the medium term.<\/p><p> Let us turn to the next slide.  I have already mentioned machinery and equipment investment by the private sector.  I want to be clear that foreign companies in Ireland do not have too many financing constraints.  They are able to borrow on liquid capital markets internationally.  This graph gives some consideration to what is happening in the SME sector - so Irish companies - and it uses some data that we collect from the RedC SME credit demand survey.  There are two panels here - turnover and profitability.  I will focus the committee's attention on the blue bars on each of the panels which show that an increasing number of respondents have reported higher turnover and higher profitability in the last six months.  This suggests what is happening in the trading environment for SMEs.<\/p><p> The next chart, which is number 13, speaks to credit growth.  Again, we are looking at the SME credit status from the Central Bank of Ireland's credit, money and banking statistics.  Since winter 2013, we have seen a rise in new lending to the SME sector right through to the second quarter this year - it is on a continuous upward trend.  That speaks to our view on what might happen in terms of investment by the private sector.  That concludes investment.<\/p><p> Slide 14 is about the household sector.  In 2014, after a number of years, the consumption by households finally turned positive, in the order of about 2%.  In the first half of 2015 it was about 3.5%, which is large in relative terms compared to recent years.  This is consistent with what we have seen in the retail sales data.  The retail sales index has been extremely strong right throughout the year.  By end of August 2015 it was up 9% year on year and that is not only driven by car sales.  If one looks at core retail sales, it was up about 6%.  It speaks to positive consumption growth for the year.<\/p><p> Slide 15 shows recent quarterly growth.  It brings together what I have just been speaking about.  We have seen quarterly growth in the first two quarters of this year of about 2% but that was 7.2% year on year in the first quarter and about 6.7% in the second quarter of the year.  The level of GDP passed its pre-crisis peak in 2014 and the level of GDP per capita passed its pre-crisis peak in the second quarter this year.  That is per head of population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100600002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444147200,"counter":161,"content":"<p>What is meant by the pre-crisis peak?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100600002#F00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444147200,"counter":162,"content":"<p>In 2007 the total amount of GDP <i>per capita<\/i>was at the peak level of income per person and we passed that in the second quarter this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100600002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1444147200,"counter":163,"content":"<p>The second quarter of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100600002#F00400","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444147200,"counter":164,"content":"<p>The second quarter of this year in terms of per person-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100600002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1444147200,"counter":165,"content":"<p><i>Per-capita<\/i>incomes are the same as they were at the peak of the Celtic tiger.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100600002#F00600","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444147200,"counter":166,"content":"<p>They are slightly higher.

This is a technique that we use called a carryover analysis.  It is a guideline for what we think GDP will be for the year if the same level of GDP that we saw in the second quarter continued in quarters 3 and 4.  In other words, if it did not grow, but went sideways.  We can see in the blue bar at the right of that panel that if that was the case overall GDP would be in the order of about 5.7% for the year.  We forecast that it will be in the region of 6.2%.  One can see very high investment growth of approximately 21%, assuming that the trend in the second quarter continues into the third and fourth.  We do not think that will be the case.  The figure was probably overstated because of this big patent acquisition.  The figure for consumption of approximately 2.6% assumes that the level of consumption by households was the same in the third and fourth quarter as it was in the second, but we have seen from the retail sales data that has come out that the momentum has continued into the third quarter, so we think that the growth has continued in the third quarter and this carryover analysis would be on the conservative side.<br\/><br\/>My final slide talks about the current account.  The current account is the balance of payments, which is Ireland's position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the rest of the world.  There are four things going on in the graph.  The line, again consistent with other charts, is the overall current account balance, which is in surplus.  As a percentage of GDP, it is up around 5% in the second quarter.  The components of that are that the goods balance - goods exports minus goods imports are shown on the brown line.  The blue line is services, services exports minus services imports, and green is the income balance, the flow of money in and out of the country.  We forecast a surplus in the balance of payments in 2015 of approximately 6% to 7%.  That is a very good position for Ireland to be in.  It speaks to the external sustainability of Ireland.  Our exports are greater than our imports and we are paying our way in the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100600002#F01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444147200,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Let us turn to slide 19 and look in a little bit of detail at the outturn developments and what we have seen happening in the labour market.  Latest quarterly national household survey data to quarter 2 tells us that there has been quite a strong pick-up in the volume of employment growth in the first half of this year, which totals in the region of 2.6%.  In terms of the contraction in the levels of unemployment, levels are down since peak by about 117,000.

We will look in a little more detail at those drivers in the coming slides.<\/p> <p>  Slide 20 looks at what has been happening in terms of average wages over the last couple of quarters.  For the first half of this year, there was an average wage growth of 1%, although that disguises what is happening between the public and private sectors.  All of the recovery and wages are predominantly driven in the private sector where they have been growing at 1.4%, as opposed to a slight contraction on the public side.  In terms of the sectoral colour of what happened in the first half of the year, there has been some quite significant wage strength in certain sectors - the wholesale, retail and trade sectors were up 2.1% in the first half of the year.  There was also some evidence of wage strength in the ICT and administration sectors.<\/p> <p>  The next slide informs our outlook for the labour market, particularly the employment volume projections for this year.  The chart on the left combines what we have seen in terms of the change in employment volumes contrasted with what the vacancy rate suggests.  A two-quarter lag of the vacancy rate operates as quite a good predictor for volume growth in employment in a given quarter.  The sharper decline in the number of vacancies relative to the contraction in employment volumes over 2009 and 2010 in the chart points to evidence of labour hoarding during the crisis.  The pick-up implied in vacancy rate data, certainly for the first half of this year, underpins our outlook for employment growth for the second half of this year of about 2.8%.<\/p> <p>  The next slide shows our outlook for the pick-up in labour supply.  There will be an uptake of about 15,000 in volume terms for 2015.  This is split broadly evenly between contributions from participation rate pick-up and also from the demographic channel.<\/p><p>In 2014 there was quite a significant drag coming through the participation rate effect but that is lifting and turning positive for the remainder of the forecast horizon.<\/p><p> An overall wage bill projected in 2015 at just under 5% is driven by a small positive contribution from the pick-up in hours worked, as we might anticipate, given the cyclical recovery in the labour market.

We had several months of falling prices, starting last December, and as a result the average inflation rate this year is still negative at -0.1%.  This is mainly attributable to falling oil prices, which continue to act as a major drag on headline inflation.  If, however, we consider core inflation, excluding volatile energy prices and unprocessed food prices we see that core inflation is up 1.1% on average this year.  Core inflation is being driven by increases in the price of services.  We anticipate that, as the impact of lower energy prices wanes, headline inflation will move back broadly in line with core inflation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100600002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Power"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444147200,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Short-term growth dynamics are benefiting from several tail winds - trading partner growth, which is fairly robust, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States; a fairly accommodative monetary policy stance and the associated depreciation of the exchange rate, which is beneficial to exporters;  and trade gains associated with falling commodity prices, in particular oil prices and on the back of all these favourable developments we expect output growth of 6.2% for this year.  This is yielding positive developments in the labour market.  We expect employment growth of just under 3% this year, approximately 53,000 jobs, and an unemployment rate that will average approximately 9.5%.<\/p> <p>  For 2016, on the assumption of a continued recovery in our key export markets this should support export growth of approximately 7% for next year.  Our base line assumption is that domestic demand continues to strengthen as headwinds subside further.  In overall terms we expect output growth of approximately 4.2% for this year.  On the nominal side, some of the factors that have been holding inflation back this year should begin to subside and we are expecting an inflation rate just north of 1% for next year.  In the labour market we expect employment growth of 2.4%, which is approximately 47,000 jobs, and unemployment should average approximately 8.4% for the year.<\/p> <p>  Our assessment is that the risks to the baseline situation are tilted somewhat to the downside.  There are some upside risks if oil prices fall further but on balance the risks are tilted to the downside.  They are mainly external in origin.  The main cloud on the horizon is China where growth dynamics are unclear.  There are certainly mixed signals at the moment.  What appears to be going on is that the investment-driven growth model is running out of steam with declining returns to investment and the transition from that sort of investment-driven growth model to a more sustainable growth model.  There is a concern that it may not be an entirely smooth process.  This is having a spill-over effect in terms of emerging market economies and we have seen capital outflows and pressure on currencies.  Some currencies in emerging market economies are pegged and there have been devaluations, for others there have been depreciations.  Advanced economies are potentially affected through several channels, the key ones being trade, exchange rate and, potentially, the financial market.<\/p> <p>  There is also the risk that the euro area could disappoint once again.  Its performance in the past has to an extent flattered to deceive.  There are risks in respect of financial markets.  We are in a position of extraordinary monetary policies in advanced economies.  The policy rate is at the lower bound and central banks in advanced economies have been adopting non-standard techniques, including quantitative easing, QE, and so forth and this has prompted a hunt for yield, capital inflows to emerging market economies and a compression of risk premia on the periphery of the euro area.  Term and other risk premia are at historically low levels.  There is a concern that, given the uncertainty in emerging market economies, the potential for monetary policy normalisation in the US, this could trigger capital flight and a decompression of risk premia with implications for the cost of capital.  They are the main downside risks.<\/p> <p>  We acknowledge the uncertainty with regard to economic forecasts.  Our forecasts, like all forecasts, are contingent.  They are contingent on making various assumptions regarding world growth and so forth.  What we try to do is to construct a fan chart around the central scenario and the probability distribution is based on previous forecast errors.  The fan says that our baseline is that nominal gross domestic product, GDP, in 2016 will probably be of the order of &euro;223 billion but there is a 90% probability that actual GDP will be within the range of &euro;207 billion to &euro;240 billion with a 50% probability of GDP being in the range &euro;210 billion to &euro;230 billion.  We are trying to highlight the uncertainty of the forecasts and to model what that might mean in terms of where GDP could end up.<\/p> <p>  We provided another 20 slides to the council.  They are econometric and technical in nature.  We are quite happy to go through them but the main points of our narrative of the forecasts are contained in the 30 or so we have given the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100600002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1444147200,"counter":177,"content":"<p>In the context of the framework for the forthcoming budget and changes to the new national fiscal framework, now that we have entered the preventative arm of the pact, one of the key rules is expenditure benchmark, which will allow expenditure to grow only with reference to potential GDP within the context of the medium-term economic strategy.

We will move from assessing the headline deficit to progressing and improving the structural deficit.  Under the reforms of the Stability and Growth Pact introduced in 2011 as part of the six pack rules, a complementary pillar was introduced.  It is called the expenditure benchmark.  What it is trying to do in terms of operation is to ensure that expenditure moves in line with growth in the tax base, the tax base being determined by the potential growth rate of the economy.  It is designed to address situations like those which prevailed in Ireland and Spain where expenditure was increased permanently on the basis of cyclical revenue.  That is the reason for looking at trend growth rate in the tax base over a ten year horizon.  It is the rationale for introducing this expenditure benchmark.<\/p><p> Initially, in terms of the code of conduct - it is not a legal document but more of a gentleman&rsquo;s agreement as to how this will be operational - it was agreed that in order to give more certainty, the ten year timeframe would be assessed every three years.

It was done on a three year basis.  We felt that because there was a backward looking element that it took into account the very negative potential growth rates from too far back.  As a result there was discussion between the Minister and his ECOFIN colleagues and the Department then produced a technical paper which we submitted to the directorate general of ECOFIN, which monitored us for compliance with the pact.  It said we had a very strong economic case &ndash; this was back in April or May - and it agreed that it would be reassessed for all member states on an annual basis.  This meant that our potential growth rate, on average, over the horizon was moved up by three or four percentage points.  It went from 0.7% up to 1.9%.

I can elaborate if the Deputy would like.<br\/><br\/>I think there is a problem on the inflation front, both in Ireland and in the rest of the euro area.  As members know, we have the non-standard monetary policies from the beginning of the year, I think it was March when quantitative easing was introduced.  That was because there had been a de-anchoring of inflation expectations.  There were two or three years in which the rate of inflation was well below the ECB's target and it was beginning to feed into expectations.  The euro system will buy &euro;60 billion of both private and public sector bonds in order to try to re-anchor inflationary expectations.  What has happened since then?  Inflation remains very low.  In September in the euro area, headline inflation was still in negative territory.  Core inflation was running at 0.9 % to 1% but headline inflation was very low.  If one looks at some measures there has not been any significant re-anchoring of inflationary expectations.  That is a problem and it creates a problem for us and for others in the sense that falling or very low inflation increases the real interest rate, so it is a <i>de facto<\/i>tightening of monetary policy.  It makes the debt burden much more problematic.  It places a premium on deleveraging and further balance sheet repair, like a Richard Koo's balance sheet recession, and it also makes the relative price adjustment more difficult.  Countries on the periphery of the euro area need strong growing economies, such as Germany, to have high inflation so that they can improve competitiveness by running an inflation rate of 1%.  If Germany and other economies are running 0.2% or 0.3% they have to be in negative territory to improve competitiveness, which is problematic from a debt perspective.  <br\/><br\/>I have laboured the point a little but the answer to Deputy Rabbitte's question is that yes, I would sleep a little bit better if inflation was a little bit higher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100600002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1444147200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100600002#J00600","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1444147200,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

The reason is that there is a labour supply increase.

Moving to a change of economic ownership means that if an Irish resident aircraft leasing firm purchases an aircraft from Seattle, for example, and then sends it directly to a large aircraft firm in France, it is not crossing the Irish Border but the leasing firm is based in Ireland so it is included in the Irish capital stock.

This is a project somebody within the permanent government just kept pursuing.  We have gone ahead with it and it is as useless as people predicted it would be.  We cannot keep doing that.  The article by Colm McCarthy in <i>The Sunday Independent<\/i>about the metro to the airport argued that it would be slower than the bus from Bus&aacute;ras, the bus from Lucan and the bus from Sandymount.  Why is this the case?  It is because we already have a tunnel to the airport.  It does not conform to the Government's own guidelines.  Maybe we can say that this was just something we throw out because there was an election coming up but having published it, we will put it through the mill.  However, there was no evidence that the Irish Government's economic evaluation service had any input into what was announced.  <\/p><p>The ESRI thinks that house prices are six times average incomes.  They are still high by international standards.  From watching the Irish economy, Mr. McCarthy knows that there are so many people who regard high house prices are economic growth.  At six times average incomes, they are high by European standards.  We tried it at 12 times average incomes and wrecked the place.  I do not see that Irish banking has been reformed.  The auditors will move to the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority in June 2016, about eight years after they produced audited reports on Irish banks that were completely useless and cost us &euro;64 billion.  <\/p><p>I see an awful lot of things that are wrong.  That nice data is a good exercise in itself but perhaps economics should be more about resource allocation and less about doing twiddly little bits of forecasts and so on because that is the kernel of economics as far as I am concerned and that is where I saw Rip Van Winkle.  There is a load of people in Ireland who would be quite happy to wake up and pretend it is 2007 again.  They include builders with massively high costs, which is why we are unable to house people.  The houses the Minister brought in for &euro;65,000 seem to be okay but there is nothing less than &euro;250,000 elsewhere.  What does Deputy Boyd Barrett think of it?  He would not go for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100600002#O02300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1444147200,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I would not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100600002#O02400","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1444147200,"counter":350,"content":"<p>We have all these sheltered sector industries and policies.  I would like the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council to inquire more into them because if we keep doing those, we could kill the golden goose again despite the favourable international things mentioned by Mr. McCarthy like the accommodative monetary policy and a very favourable exchange rate.  This is why I want to see reform if I get back the next time.  We have staunched the decline and that is a fantastic achievement.  I do not underestimate it for a second but an awful lot of the underlying problems are still there, which makes me worried about the future.  We might have a good year but in respect of 6.2% growth, what is the stimulus package doing?  Is that a repeat of the magic money in the Celtic tiger era?  Most people outside Ireland say 6.2% is pretty good.  Those are my thoughts.  I thank the witnesses for the exercise.  I hope it provokes more debate but my key point that we should not do it all over again because it has been such a disaster.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the labour market, the OECD notes the decline in graduate starting pay by about &euro;4,000 per year from &euro;27,000 down to &euro;23,000.  The growth of the so-called precariat compared to what we traditionally regarded as jobs is a serious aspect of a labour market.  There may be a lot of younger folk who have just entered the labour market wondering why people in secure jobs are saying that this is a wonderful labour market.  It is not that wonderful if one is in the precariat.

Barrett said - we have seen a big jump in corporate profits.  We have some of the highest growth levels anywhere in Europe, but because of fiscal treaty requirements, particularly as they relate to the debt burden, there is very little latitude to do anything.  In fact, we are, effectively, debarred from translating buoyant economic growth into investment in the economy or redistributing the dramatically increasing profits through various means.  Is that, more or less, the picture?  We are not allowed to do this and will not be allowed to do so for whatever number of years because of the fiscal rules.  We are, therefore, in a straitjacket.  We see massive profits and economic growth, inflating wealth which is probably concentrated in a few hands and which we are not allowed to put back into the economy through public spending, capital investment or anything that might benefit the people who have been hit the hardest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100600002#P00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444147200,"counter":357,"content":"<p>No, I disagree with the Deputy.  The rationale behind the fiscal rules is that cyclical revenues cannot be used to finance permanent increases in expenditure.  That is what was done in Ireland until 2007.  It is also what was done in Spain and some other countries and it meant that once the crisis hit, cyclical revenues collapsed overnight and we were left with a massive structural deficit.  The fiscal rules are aimed at preventing this from happening again.  What they do not do is state we cannot invest, redistribute or spend here, there or wherever the Parliament chooses.  That is a matter for the member states involved to decide.  What the fiscal rules do state is that if we want to do this, we must be able to finance it.  In other words, if a country wants to invest more, it has to be able to finance the investment or take it from somewhere else.  It is about redistributing towards priority areas.  The fiscal rules leave plenty of scope for member states which are not in a straitjacket.  They are about ensuring fiscal sustainability and that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.  There are flaws in the rules, but, by and large, they are good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015100600002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1444147200,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

It makes all of us very proud.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to attend the meeting today.  I am joined by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, HSE director general, Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, deputy director general, Ms Laverne Mc Guinness, and members of the HSE directorate.  Our last quarterly meeting was in May and I took that opportunity to update the committee on progress on our 2015 work programme - 25 actions under five major themes.  I welcome the opportunity to give a further update on those actions today.<\/p> <p>  Before I do that, a major focus of attention at present is budget 2016.  Discussions are under way between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  As nothing has been agreed at this stage, I am not in a position to go into any detail about what is contained in budget 2016 for health, or for any other sector.  I am sure the committee will understand why that is the case.<\/p> <p>  What I can say is that the Exchequer funding in 2015 provided the first increase in seven years for the health services and was very welcome.  However, pressures are arising in a number of areas, particularly in expenditure on hospitals, demand-led schemes and legal settlements.  The committee will also be aware that during the year, the Government decided to spend additional funds in a number of areas, including general practitioner, GP, care without fees for children under six years of age and adults aged 70 or over, and a new programme to manage diabetes in general practice.  The Government also committed additional funding of almost &euro;100 million to address the issue of delayed discharges and emergency department overcrowding, as well as another &euro;51 million to address long waiting times for public patients.<\/p> <p>  There will be a Supplementary Estimate to account for the additional investment in the services over the course of 2015.  It is not yet possible to quantify exactly the level of the Estimates that will be required given, in particular, the uncertainty around demand- led schemes and legal settlements.  My officials continue to work closely with the HSE to ensure that the greatest degree of budgetary control is exercised.<\/p> <p>  Getting back to the actions for 2015, the first theme is Healthy Ireland.  Tomorrow, I will publish the results of the first Healthy Ireland survey.  It gives us an up-to-date picture of the health of the nation in areas such as nutrition, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, weight, sexual health and well-being.  The last survey of this type was carried out in 2007, so it is a timely and important update which will help to inform our policy choices in the years ahead.  Committee members have been invited to the launch and I hope to see many of them there tomorrow in the GPO.<\/p> <p>  I plan to publish the general scheme of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill very shortly.  Alcohol misuse is a blight on our economy, society and health services and the Bill will give us new powers and tools to tackle it.  The Department is also developing regulations on tobacco packaging further to the approval by the Oireachtas of the underpinning legislation last spring.  As the committee knows, it is subject to legal challenge and we are now addressing some other issues that have arisen relating to the appearance of tobacco packaging.  We will do this through technical amendments to the Act which we will shortly bring to the Government for approval.<\/p> <p>  On obesity, the Department recently published the results of its public consultation on how we can work together to address the challenge of overweight and obesity.  We are using the results to finalise, by the end of the year, a new obesity policy and action plan.  This is a major personal and public health issue, in particular for our children.  It is vital we address it now, not just for our children but also for their children.<\/p> <p>  Through the course of the year, we have been phasing in regulations and measures restricting the use of sunbeds to people over 18 years of age.  In August, we published guidelines on test purchasing to help environmental health officers to enforce the Public Health (Sunbeds) Act and protect young people from the dangers associated with the use of sunbeds.<\/p> <p>  The second theme is patient outcomes and patient safety.  I have taken a personal interest in emergency department overcrowding and have secured almost &euro;85 million in additional funding this year to alleviate the problem.  This has allowed us to reduce the waiting time for the fair deal nursing home support scheme from 15 weeks to four, which in turn has reduced delayed discharges in hospitals from 850 at its peak to under 600 now, freeing up 250 acute beds every day.  It has also allowed us to open another 150 community beds, including Dublin&rsquo;s first community hospital at Mount Carmel.  More community beds will be opened before the end of the year.  It has also allowed us to increase investment in health services and keep patients out of hospital altogether or allow them to get home earlier, thanks to community intervention teams, day hospitals and acute medical admission units.  This will continue.<\/p> <p>  While we have seen an improvement in patient experience times in our emergency departments, that is the length of time a patient spends in the emergency department before being admitted or sent home, and a fall in the numbers of people waiting on a trolley for more than nine hours, morning peak overcrowding has not improved and is still worse than it was at the same point last year.  The next steps are to open approximately 300 additional hospital beds across the country in November and December.  The director general and his team are visiting the worst affected hospitals to see what can be done to address other blockages, such as diagnostics and rapid access to outpatients.<\/p> <p>  It is also clear that we need more weekend discharges and more evening ward rounds to reduce length of stay, and senior decision makers reviewing patients shortly after or before admission to reduce unnecessary admissions and length of stay.  I understand the distress and hardship that all of this causes to patients, their families and, of course, staff.<\/p> <p>  On the long waiting times for public patients, a total of &euro;51 million in additional funding has been made available to hospitals to enable them to reach the 15 month maximum waiting time, either in-house or through outsourcing if necessary.  To date, 5,770 people have benefitted from this initiative and have had a procedure or operation done that would not have been done otherwise.  A total of 970 of those were done in the private sector.<\/p><p>Some 48,702 people have had an outpatient appointment under this initiative, 14,000 of them in the private sector.  So most of it has been done in house.<\/p><p> In tandem with the additional funding, the HSE launched a new initiative to ensure that hospitals comply with the new maximums and address any outstanding long waits for inpatient and outpatient procedures.  Hospitals that breached the 18-month maximum waiting time in August began being fined from September.  It is accepted, however, that for some subspecialties the capacity simply does not exist in the public or private sectors or even abroad.  Therefore, an exemption is made for these.<\/p><p> The third theme is universal health.  Since we last met, we have put in place GP care without fees for those the under six and over 70.  This represents the first step in the phased introduction of a universal GP service and is benefiting more than 300,000 senior citizens and children.  Last week we launched the diabetes cycle of care for medical card or GP-visit card holders who have type-2 diabetes.  To date, 30,000 patients have been enrolled.  I hope this can serve as a model for other common chronic diseases to be managed in general practice or a primary care centre rather than a hospital clinic. <\/p><p> The authorisation of the VHI by the Central Bank at the end of July is an important milestone.  Lifetime community rating is in place and there are now 93,000 more people with health insurance than there were at the start of the year.  While there have been increases in many premiums, the age of double-digit annual increases is behind us.<\/p><p> I am a strong believer in universal health care, by which I mean access to affordable health care for everyone in a timely manner.  However, the foundations have to be put in place first.  These include addressing some of the significant capacity constraints that exist in our health service, the full implementation of activity-based funding, the establishment of the health-care pricing office on a statutory basis, a new, fairer drug reimbursement scheme and the further development of the hospital groups and community health care organisations.  It should not be rushed but we can do something every year to significantly improve access to health care, which might be considered universal health care in steps.<\/p><p> The fourth theme is reform.  I am very much behind the hospital groups.  The CEOs and their senior teams are now in place and I hope to appoint the remaining boards as soon as possible.  Legislation is being prepared to establish the children&rsquo;s hospital group trust on a statutory basis and legislation to establish the other hospital groups can be done within two years.  Nine community health care organisations have also been established.  Together, these reforms will enable the creation of a purchaser-provider split and the establishment of a commissioning body.  They will also provide for the HSE to be dismantled during the term of the next Government.<\/p><p> One of my priorities is to ensure that activity-based funding is embedded across the health service.  The HSE health care pricing office has published an implementation plan which sets out objectives up to 2017.  This is a great opportunity to use ABF to improve the quality and efficiency of inpatient and day-case treatment, expand ABF into other services such as those relating to outpatients and, after that, beyond the hospital walls and into primary care.<\/p><p> The fifth theme is investment in modern infrastructure and facilities including ICT.  Earlier this week the Government approved a capital envelope of more than &euro;3 billion over six years for health and public private partnerships to the value of &euro;150 million.  This will allow works to begin on the four major national hospital projects next year, subject to planning permission.  These are: the new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital on the campus of St James&rsquo;s and the satellite centres in Blanchardstown and Tallaght; the new National Maternity Hospital to be co-located with St Vincent&rsquo;s; the new National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire; and a new national forensic mental health hospital in Portrane.  It will also allow significant progress to be made on five major national programmes: the national radiation oncology programme in Cork, Galway and Beaumont; a major &euro;300 million programme to refurbish or replace community nursing units and residential facilities for people with disabilities; to continue to provide ten new primary care centres every year; relocating the three remaining stand-alone maternity hospitals, Rotunda, Coombe and Limerick; and a major investment in new ICT, including important projects such as the individual health identifier, online GP referral, the electronic patient record and a new financial system.<\/p><p> I wish to address the challenging area of recruitment in the health service.  The challenges are real and well known.  Less well known perhaps is the very real progress being made.  By the end of July of this year, the HSE had filled more consultant posts than it had during the whole of last year.  The number of consultants employed in the year from 31 August 2014 to 31 August 2015 increased by 72 net - from 2,623 at the end of August last year to 2,695 at the end of August this year.  At the current rate, we could see as many as 130 additional consultants appointed this year.  The vacancy rate is now falling and stands at 170, which is 6.3%.  There are now almost 300 more consultants than when the Government came to office.<\/p><p> While it continues to be difficult to fill vacancies in some specialties and hospitals, overall the picture is improving.  The new pay scales agreed with the IMO at the Labour Relations Commission mean that post-CCST experience and relevant higher qualifications are now recognised for incremental credit, making posts more attractive financially.<\/p><p> There are now 5,500 non-consultant hospital doctors, the highest ever, and 1,000 more than when the Government came to office.  Notwithstanding the difficulties in some rural and deprived urban areas, the number of GPs with GMS contracts is stable.  This is a somewhat different picture than others would have us believe, but these are the facts.<\/p><p> While overall nursing numbers are down on those which obtained in 2008, the number of midwives, advanced nurse practitioners and clinic nurse specialists is now at an all-time high, with plans for further recruitment.  As of the end of August, there were 44 more nurses working in our health services than at the start of the year and 578 more than this time last year.  In July, the HSE launched a new campaign to attract 500 nurses and midwives back to Ireland from the UK and elsewhere to fill vacancies.  As of two weeks ago, over 300 applications had been received and were being shortlisted for suitability.  Early indications suggest that the vast majority of the graduating class of nurses in 2015 are staying in Ireland, which is very encouraging.  The spend on agency staff so far this year is &euro;11 million less than last year.<\/p><p> In conclusion, 2015 is a story of real progress in some areas but of growing challenges in others.  We have reduced waiting times for the fair deal to less than four weeks, reduced delayed discharges to the lowest in many years, stabilised the health insurance market to allow more people get covered, and extended free GP care to the youngest and oldest as the first phases of universal health care.  We are turning the tide on recruitment of nurses and consultants.  However, emergency department overcrowding and long waiting times for public patients persist as serious challenges, as does financial control across the health service.<\/p><p> I will now allow the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and the director general to provide their updates and I will be happy to take questions later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#B00500","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I wish to speak about two areas, one of which is the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  At the start of this year I sat around the table with the directorate with responsibility for mental health - of both adults and children - to examine the waiting list, which was substantial and stood at 3,206.  The group did an incredible job of analysing the waiting list to identify the delays, who was waiting longest, the nature of their diagnoses, the treatment they were waiting for and how they were going to be seen.  As a result of that, between March and August the number of people on the list decreased by 30%.  We are particularly focused on those waiting longer than 12 months for their first appointment.  It was pointed out to me that people who are waiting longer than 12 months are not the urgent cases requiring immediate attention.  Nevertheless, I can only imagine what it must be like to have a child in those circumstances and to be waiting for that long for an appointment.<\/p> <p>  We have been reducing the waiting list month on month since March.  During July and August we reduced it by a further 20%, bringing it down from 300 in July to 241 in August.  One particular area accounts for almost half of the remaining number and we are looking at a particular targeted intervention where we are insisting on that number being reduced dramatically.  As soon as we have eliminated those who have been waiting longer than 12 months from the list, we will move on to people who have been waiting for more than nine months.<\/p> <p>  This is happening at a time of increasing demand.  This is not a static figure and demand for the services is increasing.  I compliment the director and her staff.  The initiative was very well thought out and had many elements within it.  It was done on an area-by-area basis.  All teams in each area were asked to come on board.<\/p><p>One particular initiative by a consultant and some of her staff cleared a waiting list in four weeks.  It is not always about additional resources although, naturally, when we are talking about children and their mental health, the appropriate type of resources are important.  In this instance, it was about a different way of doing things and I am glad to see that progress is being made.<\/p><p> On speech and language therapy, we intend to take a serious look at the waiting lists.  We have difficulties in certain areas, such as Kildare, west Wicklow, Cork and Dublin north.  There are difficulties with accessing treatment in Cork north Lee, Wexford, Laois and Offaly.  We have to approach this in a very targeted way and intend to start that process very shortly.  That will be within the primary care section.  We intend to look at the backlog and intend that it will be dealt with over the next four to six months.  This will cost approximately &euro;1.5 million as a once-off cost.  We are putting in place a long-term approach so that the numbers will not start to rise again.  It is about doing things differently, taking an in-depth and intensive look at one particular area.  I thought the committee should know that there is good news as well, despite some of the things we hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#C00200","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I am joined by a number of my colleagues.  Members will know the usual suspects, although  Dr. Colm Henry is not here so often.  He is the national clinical adviser and group lead for acute hospitals.<\/p> <p>  The committee has had written replies on many issues, so I will not cover those.  I will say a word on performance and activity against the 2015 national service plan.  The number of delayed discharges had fallen from a peak of 850 on 4 January to 557 at the end of July.  Additional funding of &euro;74 million to be provided by Government via a supplementary has assisted in alleviating pressures in acute hospitals by providing additional nursing home placements.  There has been a reduction in the number of patients waiting for nursing home support scheme, NHSS, funding, which is now 544, below the target range of 550 to 580.<\/p> <p>  The national service plan 2015 prioritises a reduction in waiting times for hospital care with a focus on those waiting the longest so that nobody will wait longer than 18 months at the end of June and 15 months by year end.  In July 99% of adults were seen within this timeframe for an inpatient or day case procedure and 97.5% of patients were waiting less than 18 months for an outpatient appointment.  Plans are being finalised to ensure that the year-end maximum wait time of 15 months is achieved.<\/p> <p>  The percentage of ECHO emergency ambulance calls responded to within 18 minutes and 59 seconds reached 77% and the response to DELTA calls reached 67% during the month of July.  Some 14,476 people were in receipt of a home care package during July, 11.8% more than last year.  There were 725,200 personal assistance hours provided to adults with a physical and-or sensory disability for the first seven months of the year, an increase of 67,346, or 10.2%.<\/p> <p>  As the Minister of State has mentioned, the number of children and adolescents waiting longer than 12 months for a first appointment with a child and adolescent mental health team was 300 at the end of July, which is a reduction of 146, or 32.7%, compared to 2014.  In mental health services, difficulty in filling staff vacancies remains a significant challenge to providing timely and appropriate care.  A number of recruitment campaigns are under way to address this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt.

The plans address capacity and escalation challenges at group and hospital levels to deal effectively with surge requirements.  Additional funding of almost &euro;10 million has been approved and will be provided by supplementary to support additional capacity in hospitals, palliative care and social care services.  This is in addition to the &euro;74 million that was approved earlier this year for delayed discharges. <\/p> <p>  Group CEOs are working to have the additional acute capacity in place during November in order to prepare effectively for the winter.  This funding provides for an additional 300 beds compared with the equivalent period last year.  In addition it is hoped to open beds that are closed for essential upgrades and for infection control purposes.  As a result of these combined initiatives it is hoped to have 440 additional beds open during this the winter period.<\/p> <p>  The additional funding for social care of &euro;74 million will ensure that the wait time of four weeks for fair deal is maintained and that additional transitional care and home care package services continue over the winter period.  In the equivalent period in 2014, due to funding constraints, fair deal was 14 weeks.<\/p> <p>  Members will also be aware that I recently announced that I will chair the emergency departments, ED, task force implementation group.

Diabetes currently affects approximately 200,000 adults in Ireland, over 85% of whom have type 2 diabetes.  Ongoing care of diabetic patients has traditionally been undertaken at hospital outpatient departments.  This changes from this month with the introduction of a cycle of care for type 2 diabetic GMS patients involving two scheduled GP visits per annum for registered patients.  This initiative is part of the ongoing review of the GMS contract, which has already brought extended access to GP care to children under six and adults over 70 in 2015.  This current measure is a significant step forward in the management of chronic medical conditions in primary care and is expected to benefit approximately 70,000 patients. <\/p> <p>  This concludes my opening statement and together with my colleagues, I will endeavour to answer any questions the members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I propose that we suspend until after the vote.

Having listened to the opening remarks one could be forgiven for thinking that we are, at times, living in parallel universes regarding what is stated as happening in the health services and what is actually happening at the coalface.  There is evidence every day of the week in emergency departments throughout the country.  Concerns for the well-being and safety of patients in emergency departments are highlighted consistently by front-line clinicians and other clinical staff to the point where we are threatened with industrial action.  While we try to put the best slant on the situation we do have to accept that there are huge challenges facing patients and people who use the health services every day.  This has an ongoing, daily impact on those who work on the front-line services across our hospitals.  I am not trying to exaggerate, the figures are available and speak for themselves.<\/p> <p> There is a daily increase in those who are waiting on hospital trolleys.  It causes huge discomfort to many people who present for care.  The staff are expressing genuine concern about the difficulties posed and about patient safety being compromised.  Emergency consultants say that people are dying - not that they may die - and statistically there is no doubt that people are dying due to waiting inordinate lengths of time on trolleys in emergency departments.<\/p> <p> We have situations where people are prepped for oncology treatment while in our emergency departments and on corridors.  It has happened, for example, in Letterkenny and in Galway.  For all of the advances that are claimed, the reality is very different when one goes to the coalface.  I understand that the Minister has said he visited 16 emergency departments throughout the country and has seen the situation at first hand but there is no doubt that a little sprucing up is carried out when he visits these departments.  That is the reality of life.  People want to put their best foot forward and not let the side down.  I am sure that when the Minister for Health calls to an emergency department every effort is made in advance to ensure that it is presented in the best possible light.  This is only human nature and it is why I do not believe the Minister is seeing the coalface as it is, raw and jagged, on a daily basis.<\/p> <p> I do not expect the Minister to announce the budget for 2016 but what I did expect last year was some effort in trying to bring forward a realistic budget to sustain the services as outlined in the 2015 planning.  That has been sadly lacking also.  We now have a budget deficit of approximately &euro;0.5 billion, with carryover from the previous year of more than &euro;630 million.  We have a consistent problem of being incapable of assessing roughly, even to the nearest &euro;100 million, the requirement for the health services.  This is without any policy changes in terms of delivery of health care.  The demographic make-up of our population has been ignored, scandalously, over the last years.  There is no point in pretending.  Year in and year out the budget is incapable of delivering the basic services.<\/p><p>Let us acknowledge and accept that, so that when we are funding the health services for 2016 meaningful Estimates are compiled that will underpin the services we commit to providing.  We talk about demand-led schemes and so forth, but even with the increase in some of those schemes, the bottom line is that the Minister started off this year with &euro;0.5 billion less than he should have had.  He walked out of the D&aacute;il knowing that.  Mr. O'Brien probably knew it and most of the senior officials in the HSE knew it as well.  It was simply unsustainable from the start.<\/p><p> If there is to be some redemption, the Minister should at least try to bring forward a realistic budget for the basic services.  I accept there are still restraints on the Government.  I do not expect the Minister to bring forward this year the &euro;1.9 billion that is required to leap-frog our services to a sustainable level based on the demand, demographics and the expansion that is required across the services, along with the need for extra recruitment, capital investment and so forth.  All of that is required, but we are still in challenging financial times.  However, a realistic budget, at least, should be brought forward for basic service provision in our health services.  Otherwise, whoever is Minister next year will be flapping around again next August and September trying to pretend that they will get to the end of the year when, in fact, they know from the start of the year that it simply cannot be done.<\/p><p> Regarding the emergency departments and overcrowding, we can only pass responsibility for so long.  There are many reasons that there is overcrowding in emergency departments, including lack of capacity across the general hospital system.  Even within the lack of capacity, the utilisation of that capacity and the blocking of a flow of patients through our hospital system, I cannot accept that enough is being done.  Reference was made to the announcement that 300 extra beds would come on stream in December.  I would bet any man or woman here my bottom dollar that by the end of the year all of those 300 beds will not have come on stream.  If I am proven wrong, I will gladly give them my dollar.<\/p><p> The planning concepts that go into winter-proofing for the demand for our emergency services appear to be lacklustre, to say the least.  Last December, there was a meeting of the new emergency department task force.  It published its plans in April this year, but we now find we are back to where we were again, with over 600 delayed discharges, now planning the beds for November and December and cancellations of outpatient and day cases on a continual basis.  That is not a recipe for improvement.  It is no recipe for improvement to put one patient ahead of another in terms of elective surgery versus what happens in our emergency departments.  I can understand it when an extraordinary emergency happens, but this is happening every day.  It is no longer an unusual occurrence.  There were thousands of cancellations of elective surgeries and day case and inpatient appointments in the first six months of this year.  We have huge difficulties.<\/p><p> The Minister said he is a strong believer in universal health care.  When he references reform of the health services, the establishment of the community health care organisations, the move to purchaser-provider split, the commissioning body being established and so forth, the single thing underpinning all of this is universal health insurance.  Why did the Minister not flag what is a flagship policy of this Government in terms of universal health insurance, and why has there been no meaningful debate on it?  On this side of the House we are of the view that there is now only a pretence about universal health insurance.  Perhaps I could get clarity on what is the common purpose in the Government programme, a stated policy that universal health insurance would be delivered in 2016 and that the building blocks would be put in place in the preceding five years.<\/p><p> Finally, in terms of motivating staff to work across the health services, Mr. O'Brien is taking charge of the emergency task force.  Obviously, he has vast experience because of his efforts in the special delivery unit, where he could see across all sections.  With regard to the rolling of heads, how does he consider that in terms of motivating staff?  Was there any investigation into how that e-mail leaked to the public?  It is a rather distasteful e-mail.  Has there been an investigation of how it fell into the public's hands, because it would appear that whether it was done by subterfuge or otherwise, it was obviously an intentional leaking to put it into the public domain?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#F00300","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":379,"content":"<p>We are agreed that emergency department overcrowding is not just a matter of emergency department performance, and I fully concur with that view as expressed by the task force and in the response to questions I posed in advance of today's meeting.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the measures that the emergency department task force report has commended in terms of the reduction of delayed discharges, could the Minister or Mr. O'Brien advise if additional public nursing home beds are in train?  Are they being provided and, if so, where, and what about home care supports?  I note that the response I received refers to developing and extending additional and alternative access routes to urgent care, \"thereby enabling appropriate admission avoidance\".  I presume that should have read \"inappropriate admission avoidance\".<\/p> <p>  With regard to opening a further 173 community beds, where are those beds being opened?  There is reference to 149 of the beds being open now, with the remaining beds being progressed.  Clearly, that is not enough.  Where are they situated?  The recruitment of staff is essential to the additional bed capacity.  I cannot emphasise that enough.  Can we have an update on the campaign to bring nurses home and the recruitment of nurses who have left the country?  There are concerns that the exercise is not as successful as one would have hoped.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the number of delayed discharges falling from a high of 830 in December last to 728 in March and 573 last August, is this a real development or is it reflective of a seasonal pattern?  How do the figures across those months compare with 2014?  On the same issue regarding the 30 day moving average of the IMNO trolley watch, that has reduced from 370 in March to 233 at the end of July.  Is that also reflective of progress or is it seasonal?  How does it compare to 2014?  It is also stated that some hospitals might require particular support in respect of the diverse size and functions of the different hospitals in dealing with this overall issue.  What hospitals might require particular support and how would those supports translate into actions?<\/p> <p>  It is indicated in the response I received regarding winter planning that Mr. O'Brien hopes to have the final winter plans agreed at a meeting today, 6 October.  Has that meeting taken place and has that been achieved?  Is there a sign-off on the winter planning programme and what does it entail?  It is planned to have an additional 300 beds open by the end of November.  Again, what hospitals are involved and what are the numbers for those hospitals?  Are all hospitals included or are some excluded?<\/p> <p>  With regard to emergency departments, is consideration being given to someone being in charge, that is, an emergency department manager who would have an overview of the operation of the emergency department?  It is a view and opinion offered by many people who experience an ED presentation that there does not appear to be somebody with an overview and oversight of the throughput of people from when they first present until they get to meet with an appropriate front-line staff provider.<\/p><p>The response states graduate nurses are being offered permanent contracts with a view to retaining them in our system and that it is essential we introduce measures to retain the existing nursing complement.  I am still talking about emergency departments when I say the response continues that detailed plans have been agreed to expedite the build component where it has been identified.  Will the delegates indicate in what hospitals that aspect has been identified and what steps will be taken where it has not been identified as part of addressing the emergency department crisis?  <\/p><p> I posed a question to the Minster on universal health insurance in terms of the necessity for further research.  He stated it was not possible to introduce a full UHI system by 2019, but he then stated something on which he, others and I are all of one mind, that is, there was a commitment to universal health care.  Is that the end of UHI?  Would the Minister like to elaborate on the matter as that certainly appears to be the case?<\/p><p> My final question relates to the HSE's presentation of a detailed submission to the Department of Health which has been described as confidential.  However, it is in the wind that an additional &euro;2 billion will be sought in budget 2016.  I ask Mr. O'Brien to confirm if that figure is accurate.  The figures for last year were provided or emerged, as the case may be.  Will the Minister confirm if there will be a Supplementary Estimate this year because of the shortfall?  Is it the case, as has been suggested, that hospitals that have recorded an overspend will face into 2016 with a weight around their necks, thus making an already difficult and bad situation even worse?  How does the Minister intend to address the so-called overspend on demand-led services across hospital sites?<\/p><p> The Minister has made a presentation.  On consultants posts, he states the vacancy rate has fallen and now stands at about 170, or 6.3%.  Is that the full figure?  Is the number of locum covered posts included?  Is the number given, 170, the net figure?  In other words, are there posts that will be permanently filled and are there individuals who will hold locum appointments on a temporary basis?  Will the Minister tell us exactly what the figure of 170 represents?  <\/p><p> I ask the Chairman to bear with me as I am almost finished.  The Minister continued: \"Notwithstanding the difficulties in some rural and urban deprived areas, the number of GPs with a GMS contract is stable.\"  In that instance, has he taken into account the age profile of the current complement of GPs located across the country?  How can he assess the issue of stability when clearly some areas have not been adequately provided for?  <\/p><p> My final comment is to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has acknowledged what I want to say.  I refer to the fact that children and adolescents have to wait for more than 12 months for a first appointment.  We have noted the reported reduction, but it is simply not good enough, as we know that there is hardship.  One only needs to see one case in order to appreciate the immense hardship that waiting involves for a parent or parents.  A reduction is never good enough, even if it means a reduced figure of 146 who are waiting for more than 12 months for an appointment.  It is an indictment of the system that such delays continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#G00200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#H00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that I am delighted, as a Deputy for the area, that there will be a new rehabilitation hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I thank the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for their input into the matter.  The new hospital will be deeply appreciated by the people of D&uacute;n Laoghaire and patients who come from all over the county to use the National Rehabilitation Hospital.<\/p> <p>  All the Minister has heard are complaints and criticisms.  Some &euro;44 million has been put into the fair deal scheme and I appreciate that the measure has improved the system.  <\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the following.  I have heard from members of the general public and people who work in hospitals that once a patient gets into the system, the experience is fantastic.  There is a survey that proves that 90% of patients believe their care and experience are fantastic.  Hospitals are doing great work, but we need to look at where the pinch points are.  <\/p> <p>  On those who are deaf-blind, the organisations involved came to Leinster House when Ms Carol Brill outlined her experience.  As a sufferer of usher syndrome, her eyesight and hearing are declining.  The organisations have strongly advocated for the recognition of dual sensory disability.  Ms Brill said the strong hearing aids she needed cost &euro;4,000.  She is in receipt of a disability payment and has found it nearly impossible to afford to pay for such expensive hearing aids.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to consider the matter seriously.  Members and staff cried while Ms Brill described her experience in losing her eyesight and hearing.  <\/p> <p>  I have tabled a question about nursing homes.  I have heard that nursing homes are being investigated by HIQA, that they do not have an adequate number of staff and that they are in danger of being closed down.  The prospect of closure is serious. <\/p> <p>  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland assured us that they would undertake various measures to improve the position.  One suggestion was that a call centre be created, but that has not happened.  The Department allocated 16 new staff to the board in September which was appreciated.  Please forgive me if I do not have the exact number, but approximately 2,016 nurses have applied but many of the application forms are unfinished or have parts missing and have to be dismissed as a consequence.  There are 852 applications on the desk awaiting approval.  Why have the newly appointed 16 staff and whoever else is available not got through that number of applications?  Representatives of the board were here in July and I have learned from Nursing Homes Ireland that the position on registration has worsened and that nothing seems to have improved.<\/p> <p>  I ask for the study of gerontology to become part of the registered training for nurses.  In Australia and Canada there are various nursing categories including registered practical nurses, auxiliary nurses, complementary nurses, enrolled nurses and advanced care practitioners.  Will the Minister consider adopting the same model of nurse training here?  Nurses must undergo a three-year training programme.  Will the Minister consider introducing training to enable individuals to become advanced care practitioners?  <\/p> <p>  In Ireland junior doctors must work in hospitals for a period of one year.  I have advocated that they stay for two years to give something back to the service for the education they have received.  Could a similar provision be applied to new nurses?  We need to encourage them to stay in the country.  They are paid for a number of years during their training.<\/p><p>It would be good for the country if they gave back something and worked here for at least a year before emigrating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#H00300","speaker":"1004","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy who got more than the allocated time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#J00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#J00300","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I will answer as many of the questions as I can.  The Minister of State will take some and Mr. Tony O'Brien may wish to respond to some of the questions specifically put to him.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the emergency departments, I mentioned that I have visited about 14, two in the past five days.  I visit with notice, at short notice, and also with no notice at all.  What Deputy Billy Kelleher said is entirely correct.  It is true that for any Minister going anywhere, not just to hospitals, he will know from his experience that there will be people who will put the best foot forward and they want to make things look their best.  One will also find the opposite.  There will be people who will turn up who have a particular problem or a particular issue and know the Minister is coming and will want to confront him or her with it.  I am wise to that.  I am not so naive to think that people do not know when the Minister is coming and do not plan for it in their own way.  <\/p> <p>  There is, of course, much variation in emergency departments, some are very over-crowded all the time with patients on corridors and in the middle of floors and on clinical areas, which is very risky.  In other areas it occurs in cubicles and in private side rooms where at least there is a degree of privacy and people have access to monitors and medical gas and pretty much everything they would have on a ward.  Of course, there are other departments where over-crowding only occurs at certain times and at certain periods.  All 28 emergency departments are different.  While we have done some of the generic things that can help everyone, such as turning over the fair deal more quickly and a few other things, we are at the point where we really need to have bespoke solutions for each different department because they all have different issues.  About 11 different factors can cause over-crowding and they happen to different extents or not at all in all different emergency departments.  Once again, Mr. Tony O'Brien and his team are going around to those departments to see what can be done, not necessarily in the departments themselves but in the hospital and also with community services to ease the position.<\/p> <p>  I was very clear about the budget last year.  It provided the first increase in seven years but it was based on the existing level of service and some improvements such as Hepatitis C drugs, GP care fees and a few other things.  We also made it very clear - Mr. Tony O'Brien specifically pointed it out on the day - that the service plan published did not include, for example, provision for demographic demands.  We did not hype it up.  We made it clear on that day that there were certain risks.  That question was specifically asked and answered honestly.  We also pointed out that there were some savings that were going to be difficult to achieve and many of them were not achieved.  We are still going to try to achieve them nonetheless.<\/p> <p>  However, things did change during the year and we decided to do more.  The Irish Medical Organisation got a better deal out of us than we had anticipated on the under sixes that had to be funded.  We decided to go ahead with the diabetes cycle of care to show that we meant business in terms of moving chronic disease into the community.  The decision was made on the fail deal scheme.  A decision was made on the winter initiative and also some new drugs appeared that turned out to be very expensive and they had to be paid for.  These things can happen and they did.  There will be a Supplementary Estimate as a result, in addition to unplanned overruns in other areas, but it is a combination of the two.  <\/p> <p>  The additional beds being in place before the end of the year are funded to be in place from 1 November.  Everything is being done to get them open by then.  About 100 beds are closed at the moment for various other reasons, such as wards being renovated and so on, and we are keen to get them opened as soon as possible in October-November.  They are in addition to the 300 extra beds that are being opened that do not currently exist.  They are across about 29 locations.  Sometimes they are in the acute hospital and sometimes in a district hospital nearby.  Some 26 of those 29 are on track, three are delayed.  It is inevitable when one is opening up new wards and new beds in 29 departments that three or four of them will run late.  I can already say that the Deputy's prediction is correct in that not every single one of them will be opened.  We will run into some issues somewhere, whether it is a building issue or a staff equivalent issue but the intention is to get them all open and they are funded to be opened from 1 November.<\/p> <p>  On the emergency task force implementation group, it is important to point out that it is no longer a task force but an implementation group.  It will meet regularly but implementation is not going to be achieved at meetings in Dublin.  Its purpose is to oversee implementation at this stage.  Implementation has to happen on the ground in hospitals and in community services which are interdependent.  I have every confidence in the staff on the ground that they will pull out all the stops to do everything possible to get us through the winter.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about universal health insurance.  The position is that we have the research that has been done by the ESRI and KPMG on the costings in particular and also the outcome of the public consultation.  I intend to bring that to Cabinet to publish it and, while publishing it, to outline the next steps towards universal health care, of which UHI is just one potential model.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the consultant vacancies, the 170 that I mentioned, pretty much all of those are covered by a locum.  At the moment it is unusual to have an actual vacancy that is not covered by somebody and almost all of those 170 are covered by a locum.  In addition, there are people in temporary posts and short-term contracts, that is, where people are taken on for a year or two years.  They are not considered to be vacancies.   People are on temporary or short-term contracts.  That happens for all kinds of reasons to encourage people to take up a post or just to fill a vacancy where it is important to do so.  That is not particular to consultants or the health service.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the facts on GPs, there are 2,300 GPs who currently have a contract with the HSE.  That is a stable number and has been much the same for the past couple of years.  The number of GPs on the Medical Council's specialist register is at an all time high.  The number of doctors registered in the country is approaching an all time high at almost 20,000.  For all the doctors that are leaving the country there is a greater number who are either coming in, coming back or graduating and that is often not appreciated in some of the commentary.  Currently, there are about 20 vacancies for general practice posts, which is about a 1% vacancy rate, and there are particular difficulties in some rural areas and also in some urban deprived areas.  Sometimes when people talk about a particular rural vacancy, the list has already been taken on by a GP in a neighbouring village or a neighbouring town, yet it is still referred to as a vacancy even though it is not going to be filled.  It is sits there on a vacancy list indefinitely.  Maybe after a certain point, rather than just describing it as a vacancy we accept the fact that area is being served by the neighbouring village or neighbouring town instead.  <\/p> <p>  GPs are aging.  That presents a very significant challenge in the coming years.  Also we will need more of them if we are to extend GP care without fees to other children or if we are to bring more services into primary care.  Therefore, we will need a significant increase in the number of GPs in the coming years.  The number of training posts has been increased this year.  As part of the contract discussions with the IMO, the first module is on rural practice and phlebotomy and the third module is on urban deprived areas.  These are specific topics that are being negotiated with the IMO.  It might not be a case of just going back to the incentives of the past, we may need a new set of incentives but it is a matter that is currently under negotiation.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor asked about other types of health professionals.  Her question is very pertinent.  We have health care assistants who do a very important job and do many things that nurses or orderlies would have done in the past.  Beaumont Hospital is piloting what is called physician assistants who can do many of the things that doctors or doctors in training currently do.  Other countries have theatre assistants that do many of the things that Irish theatre nurses do.  That is something we need to explore and develop.  It does cause concern the same as any change in the health service.  It causes anxiety when people see their jobs and roles being threatened, therefore it has to be done in a planned way and with sensitivity.  Similar to interns, so far as I know, nurses have to stay for what is called their pre-registration year.  It is not a full year, it is a certain period time, but they have to stay for a certain period and I would not hold the view that we should impel any health care worker to have to stay in the country.  Many other people are trained at the cost of the Exchequer and they migrate too for all kinds of reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#J00400","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":387,"content":"<p>True.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#J00500","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I do not think one could do it just for health care workers and not apply it to others too.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about community beds.

I am not certain we will ever reach the point where a service of this nature, that deals with very vulnerable children and their families, is perfect but we are doing a variety of things.  Targeted interventions will happen and we are going to build up services in primary care, including funding two additional Jigsaw projects, one in Cork city and one in the very centre of Dublin city.  These projects will ensure the service does not always have to rely on intensive, acute units such as CAMHS.  CAMHS is spread across a huge area but when we started to look at the list we discovered there were a lot of young people on that list who were referred by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, for a diagnosis of their educational needs.  There is a mix.<\/p> <p>  One of the questions related to psychotropic drugs and young people.  There is a safety element in CAMHS in so far as only a psychiatrist can prescribe and we should be very careful not to lose that element.  We are determined that those who need child and adolescent mental health services will be the people in the service while we will provide services to those others who do not need the same level of intervention.  The two new Jigsaw projects will be pivotal in all that and building up psychology and counselling services in primary care will equally contribute to ensure not everything is left to CAMHS, which would be unfair.  We will bring counselling and psychology services through primary care to people under 18 and this will also be hugely important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#K00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":391,"content":"<p>To correct myself, I cited the reduction rather than the actuality as of July.

Sometimes, it is not always obvious why people sitting in a waiting area are seen in a particular sequence.  The more acute patients often arrive, unseen, via the ambulance department entrance.  It is important, though, particularly at times of pressure, that people in the waiting areas are kept up to date and we are looking at ensuring people understand the dynamics of what their waiting period is likely to be at any point in time.<\/p> <p>  I was also asked about the HSE submission to the Department but it would not be appropriate for me to go into any great detail on that.

It is a welcome relief to my children, all of whom have young families, that they do not have to pay &euro;60 to a doctor every time one of their children gets sick.  What takes away from all of the good news in this area is the unacceptable mental health service waiting lists.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's remarks on this issue.  A young nephew of mine was recently diagnosed with Tourette's syndrome.  His parents had to jump through many hoops to get him into the mental health service.  Having scoured the Internet for information and so on about his illness, they are now able to make sense of it.

This week is mental health week, the theme of which is dignity in mental health.  What is the status, operation and budget of Sea Change, the Department's initiative to reduce the stigma around mental illness?  There is no need for me to elaborate on the need to eliminate the stigma around mental ill-health and mental health services.  One in four people will at some stage of their lives suffer mental ill-health.  We know that stigma is one of the main reasons people do not seek help in time or accept their condition.  This is a challenge we must face.  The Department's initiative was put in place by the previous Minister with responsibility for mental health and disabilities to help address this issue.<\/p> <p>  On the Government's programme for the development of the mental health services, with the exception of one year, &euro;35 million has been allocated each year for this programme.  Am I correct that level of funding was required year-on-year to meet the cost of staff recruitment and maintenance of services?  By my calculation, this means that an additional &euro;495 million has been invested in mental health services.  I have a few questions in this regard.  <\/p> <p>  The programme provides for recruitment of additional staff.  I have been informed that the HSE experienced difficulty recruiting people to some of the professions.  I understand that 1,400 staff were to be recruited.  How many have been recruited thus far, given the likely expiration of that programme and bearing in mind the Government's situation?  Why was funding provided for the recruitment campaign only spent in the fourth quarter of each year despite that it was available from 1 January?  In many cases, this funding carried over into the following year.  This means budget allocations for particular years were not spent.  What became of that money?<\/p> <p>  What progress has been made on the planned closure of beds in 19th century psychiatric units which were identified as unsuitable for modern psychiatric treatment?  Prior to the crash, the HSE proposed to dispose of some of its properties and to use the funds derived in that regard to invest in capital development of the service.  Following the crash, the value of many of the properties in our cities which were previously utilised for the provision of services in the mental health was greatly reduced.  Given the value of these properties is now increasing considerably is consideration being given to the disposal of those properties, with a view to investing moneys derived in that regard in capital projects in the mental health services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#L00500","speaker":"1056"},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Minister of State and delegates from the HSE for attending today's meeting.  My first question was about the HIQA report on the inhumane treatment of residents in certain HSE residential centres for adults and the reason it had not been published.  I understand it has since been published following a freedom of information request.  What was the difficulty around publication of that report, leading to it only being published on the basis of a freedom of information request?  I received only a one line response to my written question on that matter.  I am interested in hearing from the Minister why that report was not published in the first instance.<\/p> <p>  This meeting is the first opportunity we have had to engage with delegates from the HSE on the performance report since its publication in July.  Uncharacteristically, accident and emergency departments were under huge pressure in July.  On 1 July, there were 300 people waiting on trolleys.  There has been much discussion today around what might happen in the winter months.  I am interested in hearing about what happened in July that there were 300 people on trolleys.  The Minister mentioned that there are 11 reasons for overcrowding.  Perhaps he would elaborate in that regard.  Given there were 300 people on trolleys in July, the provision of additional beds may not be the only answer to this problem.<\/p> <p>  The performance report references surgery.  It also states that 95% of people presenting with an emergency fracture at Waterford hospital, which is in my constituency, are seen within 48 hours.  The percentage of people likely to be seen within that timeframe in other hospitals is as low as 50% or 60%.  What are the reasons for that?  I am sure people having to wait more than 48 hours for treatment for a broken hip is also contributing to overcrowding in accident and emergency departments.  The HSE target waiting time for a routine colonoscopy is 13 weeks.  Alarmingly, the rate of achievement in this regard for Tallaght hospital is 19%; Beaumont Hospital, 25%; Tullamore hospital, 33.5%; Waterford hospital, 44%; and St. Luke's hospital, 45.4%, which may be the reason there were 300 people on trolleys in the middle in July.  It frightens me to think what we are facing into this winter.<\/p> <p>  This morning I was at an outpatient clinic in University Hospital Waterford that was running two and half hours behind schedule, which put huge pressure on people working in the unit.  There is something very wrong if even in the middle of July there are 300 people on trolleys.  <\/p> <p>  Another issue of concern is that the rate of achievement of the target of 20 weeks in respect of outpatient appointments for children.  In Crumlin children's hospital, it is 49%; in Galway, it is 48%; in Letterkenny, it is 55%; and in Waterford, it is 52%, which means only 50% of children are being seen within the 20-week target.  What is happening in this regard?  <\/p> <p>  As I said, this report was only published in July and this is the first opportunity the committee has had to examine it.  That the 95% target in respect of treatment times for hip fractures and access to routine screening is not being met within the allocated time is very serious.  Equally, targets set by the HSE in respect of outpatient appointments for adults and children are not being met.  Are these some of the reasons there were 300 people on trolleys in July and, if so, what are we facing into in the winter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#MM00100","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I would like clarification on some of the figures provided in response to my questions.

We are waiting on the manufacturers to confirm when they will be available.  While some vaccines will be able before the end of the year, they will only be fully available in the new year.  A catch-up programme will be organised for children who did not get the BCG vaccine.  I take the point in regard to the provision of more information and reassurance for parents who may be concerned about it.  It is not a public health threat at this stage but I can understand why people would be worried.  There are only a handful of countries in Europe that vaccinate all children with the BCG vaccine.  The Health Information and Quality Authority is actively considering whether we should discontinue vaccinating all children with the BCG and focus only on high risk groups, which is what most other countries do.  However, that is unconnected to the fact there is a shortage of the vaccine, which should be resolved in the next few months.  The fact that most countries no longer vaccinate for BCG means there are only a relatively small number of manufacturers making it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#MM00300","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":407,"content":"<p>On Deputy's Neville question regarding recruitment, of the 1,144 development posts approved for mental health from 2012 to 2014, 405, or 96%, of the 416 development posts for 2012 have started.  Some 427, or 88%, of the 477.5 development posts for 2013 have started and of the 215 development posts for 2014, 81 have been recruited, of which 77 have started.  As of 31 July 2015, a further 88.5 are at various stages of recruitment.  Recruitment is well advanced.  I do not believe this year should be the end of that initiative.  There is a high turnover of staff in this area.  Given the special circumstances of staff who work in our mental health services, they have an entitlement to retire at an earlier age, although many of them choose to stay on and are very committed to their positions.  It is important this process of recruitment continues into the future.  Included in the data provided earlier are an additional 268 posts, which were made available to CAMHS over 2012 to 2014.  Approximately 205 CAMHS posts have been filled to date.  CAMHS, thankfully, is a very small service.

However, I recognise that because this vaccination has been carried out generationally, its current unavailability to mothers and parents is a cause of concern.  As the Minister said, there is a Europe-wide shortage of that vaccine.<\/p><p> Deputy Conway raised the HIQA report.  That report was done as a briefing for a sub-committee.  It was never intended to be published in the first place.  If it was done as a report for a sub-committee, technically, it probably becomes the property of the health sub-committee.  All HIQA reports are published as a matter of course but, on the other hand, if HIQA completes a report, we cannot compel it to publish it.  It can be accessed through a freedom of information request and other such measures, but that report was originally completed for a Cabinet sub-committee.  That is something we must keep in mind.<\/p><p> Deputy Neville asked about the budget for Sea Change.  Every year Sea Change has been funded from the Department of Health.

With regard to what A Vision for Change proposes in terms of acute units being on the site of acute general hospitals, we have very few of the aforementioned facilities left.

There has been much progress on scaling down and closing institutions but, importantly, mental health services have done very well out of capital investments.  Although we have not had a very significant income from the sale of sites, we have had significant investment.  In this regard, one should bear in mind all our relatively new child and adolescent units.  We have a significant number of new purpose-built acute units.

The information will be available from quarter one of 2016.  It will be included in the performance reports relating to that period.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Ciara Conway made a number of important points about how accident and emergency pressures and other pressures are affecting the system.  The relationship is the other way around from the one posited by the Deputy.  It is the accident and emergency pressures that have had an adverse impact on the capacity of the system to provide a range of services.  However, with regard to gastrointestinal endoscopy, as of 27 August, 16,311 people were awaiting routine scopes.  Some 50% of them were waiting for no more than three months at that stage.  The HSE has identified a requirement for a strict application of standardised referral criteria in addition to a review of demand capacity and a clinical review of need.  With regard to urgent colonoscopies, there is a four-week access target, and a policy of zero tolerance applies to any breaches.  There were some breaches in the earlier part of this year.  The accountability framework has been successfully deployed to address those.  While the pressures are significant and are continuing, and while it is true that the 8 a.m. trolley figures in July were of concern and remain so, there has been an increase in some other activity in acute hospitals.  For example, the combined inpatient and day-case discharges for the period between January and August show an increase of 0.3% over the same period in the previous year.  One thousand and ninety-three additional people have been provided with inpatient procedures, and 56,138 more people have been assessed by outpatient services than were planned to be assessed by this point, or by the end of 2015.  None of that takes away from the centrality of the Deputy's point.  The reason we are engaged in the process in which we are now engaged regarding emergency departments and all the contributing factors is that all the measures taken before, while they had an individual impact, did not have the collective impact we would have hoped for or expected in terms of emergency department trolley pressures.  That is why we are stepping up a level at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":430,"content":"<p>Would it be true or fair to say the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has now given in excess of &euro;100 million for the trolley crisis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#P00700","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444145400,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Across the piece, approximately &euro;135 million, including the &euro;10 million we have not started to spend, concerns additional beds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#P00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":432,"content":"<p>What is it going to take?

Mr. O'Brien stated the steps taken did not have the desired impact or were not as far-reaching as he had hoped.  What will it take?  I am in no doubt but that we have the commitment of the staff, who are under considerable pressure.  I do not question their motivation or commitment to the job in hand.  The moneys have been made available but I cannot square the circle.  Money is being given when sought - it has been asked for a number of occasions in recent years - but we are still facing a very difficult time, first and foremost for patients and their families.  The airwaves will be aflood with very sad stories of very sick people.  Simple steps, such as general practitioners being allowed to install IV facilities in nursing homes, have still not been taken nationally.  It may have happened in certain areas.  Very sick old people have to come from HSE facilities to an accident and emergency unit to obtain the service they require.  We have been talking about this now for a number of years, yet we have not seen a sea change nationally.

To quote that great philosopher Eamon Dunphy when he spoke of football: \"It is a game played on grass, not on paper.\"  This is why the real focus is now on very targeted interventions in each of the 28 hospitals.  The focus is to be on the particular choke points in each.  I am also seeking to be realistic because we cannot make trolleys disappear.  Our aim is to make sure that this coming winter will be better than last winter, at a minimum.  Ideally, we desire a return to 2013 levels.

It might not be for Mr. O'Brien to answer Deputy Conway's point but I contend that since he is talking about playing on grass and bearing in mind that we are not doing too well where I come from, the ground hurling indicates we are investing money and making resources available.

There was money in the last budget but the Supplementary Estimate figure for the period to date this year is approximately &euro;84 million.  It would be incorrect to characterise that as all having gone towards dealing with emergency department overcrowding.  The largest proportion of the funding was for the fair deal scheme.  Most of the people who benefited from that went from their home into a nursing home.  That was good because, had they not gone to a nursing home, they could have ended up in a hospital before going to a nursing home.  It would not be correct to characterise the expenditure as having been entirely devoted to this particular issue.<\/p> <p>  Emergency department overcrowding is different in every emergency department, but it is predominantly caused by factors that are not actually in the emergency department.  In some hospitals, it is evident that there just are not enough beds.  That is probably not true in most hospitals.  In some, the problem is associated with the average length of stay.  There are various factors.  One can even find that when additional beds are provided in a hospital, that hospital, having been relieved by the additional beds, slows down a bit and the patients that were staying for four days end up staying for five.  That is what eats up all the additional beds, leaving one back where one started.  It is almost like one of those machines with 11 or 12 different dials that almost all need to be in the right place.  It is extremely difficult.  At least with surgical waiting lists, one can sign a cheque, if needs be, and have the operations done.  With the emergency departments, there are so many different moving parts and they are all different in different places, making it very difficult.<\/p> <p>  We should acknowledge a point I have not had a chance to make to the media, but I will make it if I get a chance.  If one compares the nurses' figures for this month with those of last month, one notes there are actually improvers.<\/p><p>St. James's is one example of where, in conjunction with the fair deal scheme, the hospital was able to reduce the number of late discharges and then use the additional capacity to ensure things ticked over.  Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown was also able to reduce the number of late discharges for similar reasons.  The Midland Regional Hospital at Tullamore, even though it can be very overcrowded, is substantially less so than this time last year.  Even though the situation is worse nationally, some hospitals have shown significant improvement but other hospitals, where there were never trolleys, have become unbelievably worse.  That is what makes it so difficult.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#P01200","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444145400,"counter":437,"content":"<p>We are now seeing some hospitals that never had a problem with delayed discharges and, therefore, did not benefit from the release of funds to combat it are now having to deal with higher category triage patients who are sicker and need to stay longer in hospital and that is eating up the bed stock that would otherwise be there.  This is, by any standards, what people a generation below me call a wicked problem.  There is no simple solution to it.  It is not static in that the level of demand that the acute hospital system is facing this year is qualitatively different from the demand that the system faced in previous years.  This is not necessarily by volume but certainly by complexity and by age profile of patients.  As I said, we will be pursuing solutions vigorously in the 28 hospitals.

One issue related to an incident which resulted in a bruise on a resident, which had been recorded but not adequately investigated.

I have never declined the committee's call.  I would advise the committee to call me sparingly on the following basis: an appearance such as this takes about a working day out of my life in terms of preparation and the time I spend here.  I would not want the balance between the time I spend here and the time I spend out there, trying to sort out the problems, to be the wrong one.  Obviously, however, at the committee's discretion, I will be here to answer its questions and brief it accordingly.<\/p> <p>  I will visit Waterford hospital next week.  With regard to the issue of ambulances, there are certain protocol situations whereby emergency departments can be taken off call.  These are predefined arrangements which would lead to ambulances taking patients to different locations.  It should not, however, be the case that ambulances are turned away, having been sent, unless there is an off-call protocol in place.  We will certainly examine that issue.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the build matters referenced in the answer, these are about the immediate in nature and relate to Galway hospital and South Tipperary General Hospital, for example.  This is about refurbishing an area that was formerly a physiotherapy department, which has had to be relocated to another place to create 20 additional proper bed bays with full medical gases and so on.  That work is under way.  There are other major projects involving emergency departments, such as in Limerick, but what is in the question has more to do with immediate actions for this winter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I asked about the paediatric element.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#R00400","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1444145400,"counter":449,"content":"<p>The schedule we will provide will include both the capital and the revenue costs.

Some concerns have been expressed by parents of children who have received the vaccine and some 860 cases have been referred to the HPRA.  Can a meeting be facilitated with the parents of children who have been adversely affected by the vaccine, given that there is genuine concern?  While I would always advocate vaccination in terms of public health, I would like to see that this would at least be taken on board and that a co-ordinator would be established in the HSE or the Department of Health to deal with complaints and to collate any information in regard to whether there are potential trends on this issue.  To date, I have not been satisfied that the people receiving the vaccine are being informed of the potential side effects or that there is enough public awareness around the adverse effects it can have on some people.  I ask that this matter be examined.  I would appreciate it if a meeting could be arranged with the organisation that is advocating and raising concerns on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#R00600","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":451,"content":"<p>Responsibility for vaccines and vaccine safety lies mainly with the chief medical officer and I will certainly ask him to meet any group.  I should say that of the 860 adverse events reported to the HPRA, the vast majority are the normal kind of side effects people have from all kinds of vaccines, like somebody getting a sore arm, fainting and so on.  What I would be very concerned about in this case is sending out the wrong message to people that, somehow, the HPV vaccine is dangerous.  There is no evidence that it is and the European Medicines Agency is carrying out a review to confirm that.  On the other hand, there is very strong evidence that it prevents cervical cancer, which is why it is given.  It is the only vaccine that prevents cancer, so it is modern miracle in that sense.<\/p> <p>  The committee will recall the scare we had previously in respect of autism.  Quite a number of parents at that time believed - and some still believe - that the vaccines caused autism because they were administered around the time the symptoms of autism often develop.  We have to be very careful not to allow these kinds of ideas to take hold because if somebody has a disease or illness they cannot explain, the natural thing is to blame something that happened around that time.  Vaccines are often blamed, although it is very rarely proven that they are the cause.  Nonetheless, the European Medicines Agency is carrying out a review to reassure people there are no long-term side effects from the vaccine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015100600002#R00700","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1444145400,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I thank all of our witnesses and the officials for attending.
