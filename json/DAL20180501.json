It is particularly objectionable that she was forced all the way into the High Court before settling her case.  The State denied until then that a breach of duty occurred in not informing her of the false negative smear test.  The State and Minister subsequently apologised after the court settlement.<\/p><p>It is genuinely shocking that the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, was not informed about the case by his departmental officials until Monday, 16 April in a memo which referenced wider issues.  He should publish the memo, as agreed.  I am disappointed that we have not yet received it.  Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly and I had discussions this morning with the Minister and his officials, during which it was revealed that there had been intense discussions between departmental officials and CervicalCheck about the case in advance of it being brought.  However, the Minister was not told about these discussions.  What was their nature and why was the Minister not brought into the loop at that point?<\/p> <p> We know that in July 2016 the former clinical director of CervicalCheck sent a letter to clinicians in which a three-point plan was outlined.  The last of the points was that in cases in which a woman had died, the clinician should simply ensure the result was recorded in her notes.  It was that clinically cold.  One could argue that the intention of the plan - to deprive a family of such vital information - was illegal.  The senior management team of CervicalCheck would have been aware of and approved the plan.  The question is who else at senior level in the Health Service Executive, CervicalCheck and the Department was aware of it.<\/p> <p> The memo prepared for the Minister anticipated adverse publicity in the event that the case became public.  Some of the information in it appears to be inaccurate and false, as it gives the sense that women were informed of their results.  However, we now know that, contrary to the impression I got from the memo, women were not so informed.  The failure of the Department and, latterly, the Minister when he was informed to anticipate the earth shattering nature of the case is very worrying.  The frenzied reaction and appalling communications of the State and its services since have created genuine worry and shock across the country.  It took so long to find out how many women had died.  Seventeen women whose cases were reviewed have died and up to 162 were not told their results.  There have been 8,000 calls to the CervicalCheck helpline.  The failure to anticipate this matter in order to prepare for it and have the homework done in advance of the case becoming public is genuinely shocking and must be reflected on.<\/p> <p> Three years ago, in November 2015, it was announced that open disclosure would be legislated for in the context of the health information and patient safety Bill and that a packet of measures would be brought forward by the Taoiseach in his then role as Minister for Health.  The Bill has not yet been completed.  This morning the Minister and his officials stated there was a culture of paternalism within the medical profession.  The Bill was brought forward after the scandal surrounding the death of a baby in Portlaoise.  Nearly three years later, it is extraordinary that it has not been progressed and that the open disclosure commitment made by the Taoiseach, on which he subsequently changed his mind, has not been provided for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525179900,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I say once again how saddened I was to hear about the case of Vicky Phelan and emphasise the extent to which I feel for her and her family.  I am full of sorrow that she was not diagnosed sooner and wish her and her family the very best on the difficult road ahead.  I pay tribute to her for her bravery, particularly in calling on women and men to go for cancer screening which we know saves lives.<\/p>  <p>  I am very angry on behalf of the approximately 160 women who were not told the results of the audit.  Even though it would not have made a difference in their case in terms of treatment, the prognosis or outcome because they had already been diagnosed with cancer at that stage, they should have been told.  It was information pertinent to their cases, lives and health which they had a right to know.<\/p>  <p>  I know that this controversy is having a huge impact on the women of Ireland.  It is about women's health and lives and many women now feel very vulnerable and are worried.  It comes after a very difficult year with controversies surrounding issues such as #MeToo, sexual harassment, difficult rape trials and other matters.  This country has not always treated women very well and even today perhaps treats them very badly, as evidenced by issues such as mother and baby homes, the Magdalen laundries, the marriage bar and the hepatitis C scandal.<\/p><p>That is why I am determined to get to the bottom of this matter and establish the facts.  We do not yet know all the facts, and I ask people not to jump to conclusions until we do that, but we do want to establish the facts.  I am determined to restore confidence in our cancer screening and I also want to ensure that this does not happen again.<\/p> <p> In terms of the actions that will now take place, there will be a statutory inquiry led by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  We believe that is the best and quickest way to do it.  We need answers in months, not years, and it has the skills and the statutory powers to do so.  We have also offered a repeat smear test.  Any woman who is concerned about her smear test can go to her general practitioner, and if they agree an additional test is warranted, that will be done and paid for.  We also plan to move to a more accurate test and will be one of the first countries in the world to do so.  We are moving to a HPV-based test for cancer screening.<\/p> <p> Every patient who has been affected will be offered an individual clinical review.  The approximately 160 who have not been contacted will be contacted today or tomorrow and will be offered an individual clinical review about their case.<\/p> <p> As I mentioned, we will now bring forward legislation for mandatory open disclosure to build on the legislation for voluntary open disclosure passed by the D&aacute;il only a few months ago.  I have asked the Attorney General to examine if there are any outstanding cases that are similar that we may now be able to settle quickly without requiring further legal actions.<\/p> <p> To answer one of Deputy Martin's questions, the Minister was only informed of this case in the week before it was settled.  He was informed that the case against the HSE was likely to be dropped or struck out, and it was.  He was informed that the case against the laboratory was likely to be settled, as it was.  The note reads that patients were informed and that the message had been passed on to doctors to inform their patients.  We now know that was not the case in most circumstances.  He was also informed that the Department did not consider this to be a patient safety incident as it fell within what they believe to be the normal error bars of screening tests.<\/p> <p> In terms of publishing the note, that note will now be published.  The Minister did not want to publish the note until he had the permission of Ms Phelan to do so.  He has that permission now, and if it has not been done already, it certainly will be done today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100004#B00200","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525180200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has commented a number of times that it would have made no difference if women had been told about this in advance.  He is making that from a clinical perspective in terms of the actual diagnosis of cancer and the response to it, but I suggest it would have made a hell of a difference to the women involved, and to their families, because in not informing the women their families were being deprived of vital information.  When a family loses a mother, they lose a lot in terms of the subsequent care of children in such a family and in the duty of care to the spouse of a woman who has passed away as a result of cancer, or indeed any illness.  That goes to the heart of this case, and that is why Vicky Phelan fought so hard.  Families have needs.  It seems to me that the fact there was a deliberate policy decision that, in the event of women having died, the information was merely to be noted on a file and the family denied that information, which is their entitlement in terms of knowing the circumstances surrounding their mother's death, is truly shocking.<\/p>  <p>  What is extraordinarily disconcerting is that senior people within CervicalCheck in particular approved of this policy.  It seems to me that someone must have known at senior level within the HSE because the State Claims Agency does not act in isolation.  It is a Government agency.  It takes instructions.  It is under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, yet in recent days the Government has been articulating a view that it is somewhere out there in the ether and that it does its own work independent of anybody.  That cannot be true.  Likewise, senior people in the Department of Health must have known because it was said to me this morning that there were intense discussions between the Department of Health and CervicalCheck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100005#C00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1525180200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>There will be more time later in the day.

I am the Taoiseach, a doctor and also the brother of two sisters and know that a lot of women are afraid today.  The 160 women who know that they have cervical cancer but who may not have been told about their previous false smear test result will be told this today, if they have not already been told.  They will be offered an individual appointment this week in order that their clinical case can be discussed.  I also know that a lot of women are very afraid today that the HSE knows that they have cancer but has not told them.  That is a real concern for women, but I want them to know that that is not the case.  There is nobody today with a diagnosis of cervical cancer who has not been told by the HSE.  There has been a misunderstanding and I reaffirm that point very clearly.  I reassure people that there is no one walking around today with a cervical cancer diagnosis from whom that information is being withheld by the HSE.  I also reassure women who have had smear tests.  One of my girl friends with whom I spoke over the weekend was very concerned.  She had a smear test in the past couple of months and is now very worried as to whether the result was accurate.

I understand some of them have still not been contacted, but if I have that wrong, the Taoiseach might correct it for me.  Of course, for some of the women affected by the scandal there will be no telephone call, no news, no disclosure and no truth because 17 of them are dead.  They passed away not knowing that their cancer should have been caught earlier, that their treatment programmes, prognosis and possibly outcomes could have been different.  They died unaware that this information was known to the HSE and others.  They had been kept in the dark, not because of some communication error but because of a toxic culture of concealment within the HSE and a refusal to take responsibility, a culture in which women were literally allowed to die before fault was admitted.  Vicky Phelan's solicitor has described what he regards as a cover-up within the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  The root of the scandal is found in the decision in 2008 to outsource screening.  At the time the Government was told of the dangers of this move, that it would jeopardise women's' health and their lives, but it went ahead with it.  Subsequently the flaws in the system were highlighted, not least by members of the quality assurance committee.

Obviously, I tried to spend as much of the weekend as I had free reading up on it and trying to understand it.  Even now, I do not think it is the case that anyone or everyone in this House knows all the facts.  That is why it is necessary to have the statutory inquiry that has been initiated by the Minister, Deputy Harris.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to proceed with outsourcing to the laboratories in the US was made in 2008.  The Deputy is correct when she says that Mr. Tony O'Brien was the head of the cancer screening service at the time.  To this day, there are differing views on whether that was the right decision.  It is important to mention some facts that might not yet be in the public domain.  Approximately half of smears are read in laboratories in Ireland and approximately half are read in laboratories in the US.  Three different laboratories are used - two in the US and one in the Coombe Hospital.  We do not yet have any evidence that there are significant statistical differences between the numbers of false negatives emanating from each of these laboratories.  If there are such differences, we need to know that is the case.  We should not jump to conclusions until we know that such differences exist.  Of course that will have to form part of the inquiry.  Three laboratories are used.  It probably makes sense for us to use different laboratories because it allows us to see if there is an outlier for some reason.  We now need to examine that.  I am told that the audit which was done did not show any significant statistical differences between the results of the three laboratories.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to speak more generally about cancer care in Ireland.  I know this is about women's health and women's lives.  Like everyone in the House, I am among the many people who are very worried and upset about this.  I do not think we should lose sight of the wider truth that cancer care in Ireland has improved considerably in recent years.  More people now survive cancer than ever before.  We have better treatment, quicker diagnosis and more prevention.  Cancer screening works.  In 2011, the incidence of cervical cancer in Ireland was 14 per 100,000.  It is now ten per 100,000.  Such a big decrease in a relatively short period can be attributed to things like the HPV vaccine and the screening programme.  I want to encourage everyone who is offered BreastCheck, CervicalCheck or BowelScreen to go ahead and take up the appointment.  These initiatives save many lives.<\/p>  <p>  It might be useful for me to explain briefly how population cancer screening works.  Before we had screening, a person was not diagnosed with cancer until he or she had symptoms.  A person went to his or her doctor if he or she was bleeding from somewhere, was jaundiced, had a lump or a bump or had lost weight.  A person might have been diagnosed with cancer on foot of tests organised by his or her doctor and he or she then received treatment on that basis.  Cancer screening has changed all of that.  Cancer can now be detected before it is symptomatic.  A key factor is that these tests are not diagnostic.  It is a screening test, rather than a diagnostic test.  For that reason, it is not 100% sensitive or specific.  There is a margin of error.  If 1,000 women are screened for cervical cancer, for example, in 980 of those 1,000 cases the woman will be given the all-clear and can be confident that she has the all-clear.<\/p><p>In 12 of those cases, the cancer will be detected.  In approximately eight from 1,000 cases, it will be missed.  It is an error of approximately 0.8%.  That error is not necessarily because anybody is negligent or incompetent.  Even with two sets of eyes, or four eyes, looking at every film, there is an error rate of 0.8%.  We need to explain that and try to get that message across.  I want to encourage people to go for those smear tests, to have that BreastCheck and send back the colorectal screening.  These tests are not 100% but they pick up many cancers early.  By picking up those cancers early, people's lives are saved.  Whatever we do in this House over the next couple of weeks, let us make sure that message keeps coming through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100007#E01100","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525181700,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Do not underestimate the level of public understanding of the importance of screening.

Of the 162, we now know that 17 have died.<\/p>  <p>  The only audit carried out was of those who had developed cancer.  Is it true that no other smear test result has been rechecked?  Women and their families need reassurance that their health will be our paramount consideration in the days ahead and that they will receive the best advice, the best healthcare and the best support possible.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, established a helpline.  However, it is not clear who should be ringing it.  Has a particular group of women been identified?  Is there a concern about a particular age cohort, region of the country or date on which the tests were taken?  There is not so far an identifiable cohort of women that the HSE believes is at risk; therefore, all women who have been tested are anxious and all are suspicious about their test results.  <\/p>  <p>  The first port of call for any woman concerned is likely to be her own general practitioner, GP.  As far as we know, no guidelines have been provided for GPs on how to deal with the concerned calls they are receiving.  The Government's first duty was to reassure women and put all of the necessary supports and guidances in place.  Will all women be retested?  That is the logical next step in providing reassurance, but is it a practical proposition?  <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach also announced yesterday that a statutory inquiry would be established through the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  When HIQA carries out an inquiry, it is based on examining the systems and processes in place in a particular health facility.  It was not set up under the Act to carry out a fact-finding inquiry to answer all of the questions that arise in this matter.  It also cannot cross-examine witnesses under oath and I am advised that it is highly unlikely that it will be able to make findings of contested fact against any individual.  The Department of Health, of course, does not come within HIQA's statutory remit.  For these reasons, I ask the Taoiseach to think again.  Will the Government establish a proper inquiry to investigate what happened?  A commission of investigation is obviously required.  Will the Taoiseach begin the drafting of terms of reference for a commission of inquiry and begin today to consult all interested parties?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100009#G00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1525182300,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I do not know if this was the only audit carried out.

I thank the Irish Medical Organisation and the National Association Of General Practitioners for their co-operation.  The Minister has been in touch with them.<\/p><p>If a woman is concerned, she can go to her general practitioner.  If it is appropriate and they decide that a repeat smear test should be done, it can be done and we will meet the cost of that.<\/p> <p> Again, I want to reassure the women of Ireland that our screening service is safe.  It is not 100%, although no screening service is because there are false negatives.  If a woman goes for screening there is a very good chance that, if she has cancer, the cancer will be diagnosed early and, as a result, she will get early treatment and a far better outcome and prognosis.<\/p> <p> Again, I want to pay tribute to Vicky Phelan for putting that message across.  Despite what has happened to her she is sending out the message clearly that people should continue to attend for their smears, breast checks and that the same should apply to men and women for colorectal screening.<\/p> <p> I was asked about the Health Information and Quality Authority inquiry.  The Department of Health will, on a voluntary basis, agree to be covered by that.  It is not in legislation but the Department has agreed to do that and arrangements will be made to do exactly that.  HIQA is the body that has powers.  It is the body that has done investigations into the health service before in Portlaoise, for example, and in respect of a death in Tallaght Hospital.  HIQA has the expertise, knowledge and the statutory power of compellability.<\/p> <p> I appreciate the Deputy's suggestion that a commission of inquiry might be an alternative and I cannot rule out that being necessary in the future.  However, I would point out that commissions of inquiry take a long time.  It is three years, for example, since the commission of inquiry on the Grace case was announced.  The Siteserv inquiry could go on for many years.  One thing Vicky Phelan has said, and I think she is right, is that she does not want an inquiry that goes on for years.  A report could be received by a future Government perhaps.  What we want is an inquiry that gives us answers quickly.  The risk with a commission of inquiry, of course, is that everyone goes legal and lawyers up and it takes years before we get a report, with probably no answers at the end of that.  That is why I am calling for the co-operation of the House in supporting the HIQA inquiry, which we believe will get answers quickly, and, if not, then we will consider a commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100009#G00500","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525182600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I have a second question.  I have re-read the Act that established HIQA.  It is very constraining in terms of what the authority can do.  It refers to how HIQA must ensure that an investigation does not interfere or conflict with the functions of any other statutory body.  HIQA can appoint an approved person with the approval of the Minister.  It has limited power to demand production of relevant documentation.  It has no power to direct the attendance of a witness, to direct a witness to answer questions or to demand or receive sworn evidence.  Witnesses are not given any immunity in respect of the evidence they give.  In the absence of any provisions, it is unlikely - I am advised legally - that the authority can come to any adverse findings against named individuals that might be contested.  That is not appropriate to address the degree of issues that are rocking the country right now and I call on the Taoiseach to think again on that.<\/p>  <p>  The first priority is to provide reassurance to women today.  In truth, the only rechecked smear tests that we know about - the Taoiseach may say there are others - are for the 208 women who got cancer subsequently.  They have been rechecked.  I would love to hear some reassurance on that point.  In the case of all the other smear tests, has there been a systematic recheck?  Can the Taoiseach give reassurance to women who are looking in that their smear tests have been rechecked too and that there is no concern?  The Taoiseach says that any woman who has a concern can have another test.  Is it possible to have rechecks for the thousands of women who may want that now?  Is that a practical proposition?

As part of the clinical audit process, these notified cases were re-examined and 277 cases were flagged for further cytology review.  In 208 of those cases, the cytology review recommendations differed from the original test and what I understand is done with all of these smear tests is that every single one of them - all 3 million - have already been looked at by two people, by two sets of eyes.  There is a quality control process as well that does a cycle of rechecks to make sure that the laboratory is up to standard.

The response of the health service to the hepatitis C scandal, the deaths of babies in Portlaoise hospital, the cases of national maternal deaths and catastrophic injuries, symphysiotomy etc. has been to admit nothing and make patients jump through emotional and financial hoops to prove their case.  That has been the history of this State.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE eventually came out yesterday and confirmed at least 208 women, who have since been diagnosed with cervical cancer, were initially told their tests were negative, and of those, 17 women have died.  In 173 cases women would have been given a different clinical treatment if earlier smears had been read correctly and 162 of the 208 were not told a review had been conducted by CervicalCheck or of the outcome.  Cian O'Carroll, the solicitor acting for Vicky Phelan, for whom I have huge respect and admiration - we should be not only angry but livid about what is after happening in these cases - believes all 1,482 cases should be subjected to independent review.<\/p>  <p>  Could this situation have been prevented?  In 2008, the then Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government made a political decision to outsource our smear testing to private companies overseas.  Why?  It was because they made a political decision of not resourcing the services here.  Sam Coulter-Smith, a former master of the Rotunda Hospital, said he warned the Government a decade ago against testing being moved to private companies overseas because he was worried that resulting problems would mean cancer cases being missed.  He said: \"Our cytology system in the Rotunda Hospital, which was well developed, fully accredited and world class, with very good quality assurance systems in place and numerous people analysing smears - two looks rather than one - the quality assurance was at a much higher level than the US.\"<\/p>  <p>  Dr. David Gibbons, who was chair of the cytology-histology group within the national cervical screening programme, with a number of his peers, has stated that they raised with the then CEO of the National Cancer Screening Service, Tony O'Brien, their serious concerns.  He said he warned Tony O'Brien when he saw the figures from the United States were showing one third fewer high grade dysplasias compared with Ireland.  It was 1.8 in Ireland and 1.2 in the US.  He was concerned about a mismatch of systems.  Ireland tests for cervical cancer every three years where the US system would test annually.  He predicted in 2008 that up to 1,000 women per year would be affected and that this would become apparent in ten to 15 years down the line.<\/p>  <p>  That has happened.  It is a reality for the women affected by these reviews and it must be seriously taken on board.  Somebody has to be answerable for this.  People in this country are sick and tired of these cases.  In the hepatitis C case the CEO walked away with a gold-plated pension and people like Brigid McCole had to go to the courts to fight their cases.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate the call from the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy that Tony O'Brien or somebody should be held to account.  The political system should be held to account for this as well.  An international peer review is being done on the screening.  The Taoiseach said approximately half are done in the United States or outside the country and the other half are done here.  We should have a clinical assessment of the exact number that came from the US and from here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100011#J00300","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1525183200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Deputy Collins, your time has expired.

The way the audit worked is that if a woman was diagnosed with cervical cancer between 2008 and 2014, they went back and checked all of the smear tests to see if there were false negatives or false positives.  To reassure people, in all 1,400 cases those smear tests were rechecked already.  That is the way this audit cycle works.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the laboratories, I hope I answered already - if I did not I am happy to repeat it or clarify - that we are moving towards a new more accurate test.  No test is 100% accurate.  There will still be false positives and false negatives, but we are moving to a new test which is a HPV-based test for cervical cancer screening.  That new test will come in later in the year.  That offers us an opportunity to reconfigure the laboratories and review which laboratories we use.<\/p>  <p>  Whatever we do, it should be based on facts.  We are letting women down and letting people's health down, in particular women's health, if we make decisions that are not based on facts.  As I explained earlier, 50% of smears are checked in cytology laboratories here in Ireland and 50% are outsourced.  Three different laboratories are used - two in the United States and one in Ireland - and so far there is no evidence that any of those laboratories is less accurate than the others in terms of false negatives in a statistically significant way.  Whatever we do, it must be based on facts.  We should not merely sack somebody or change the laboratories for some reason.  In the interests of women and their health and doing what is right, we must base our decisions entirely on facts and evidence.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of resignations, it is worth noting that the head of the programme, its clinical director, Professor Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, has already stepped down.  We accept that she has made that decision, taking accountability for the appalling communication failures that occurred.  However, it is also important to note that she is somebody who was involved in bringing in this programme over the years and as a consequence, helped not only to save many women's lives but also to ensure many women had much less invasive operations because their cancers were picked up earlier.  We should be balanced in our response and recognition of that.<\/p>  <p>  On the duty of candour issue, as I said, duty of candour is already in the medical council guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  On the decision taken last November on mandatory open disclosure, this commitment was given to Deputy Clare Daly, who brought the amendment forward and made some good points in that debate in the D&aacute;il, by the Minister both verbally and in writing that on foot of the legislation for voluntary open disclosure, which was passed by these Houses a few months ago, he would bring forward mandatory open disclosure in line with the programme for Government in cases where it is a serious reportable incident or error.  The Minister is developing that legislation.  It will be in the patient safety Bill.  The Minister expects to bring a memorandum to Cabinet next week and we will get that legislation done as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  If people think that merely changing the law or guidelines will resolve this problem once and for all, it will not.  What is required is a change of culture in our healthcare.  We need to move towards a culture of truth and that is something I would like to speak about later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100012#K00600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1525183800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I honestly believe this is not merely a communication failure.

If corners are cut it does not work.  More often than not, in the longer term one pays more both financially and in terms of the human cost.  At this point we should be looking at bringing all our screening back.  Even if we bring in new HPV screening, it still has to be checked to World Health Organization standards.

I want to make sure we can restore confidence in our cancer screening service.  If one takes the entire audit, which I think included 1,400 cases in total, there were 208 false negatives.  That is 208 people who had smear tests that were reported as normal but who then went on to develop cancer.  We cannot say how many of those were false negatives yet within the margin of error.  We cannot say for certain.  Very sadly, those 208 people have cancer.  Some of them are very sick and 17 have passed away, very sadly.  We cannot say with certainty that had there been a different test done in a different lab that those cancers would have been picked up.  I see from one of the notes today that a slide was looked at by eight specialists - eight cytologists.  They are scientists who are experts in this field.  Eight of them were asked to look at a sample.  They were told the woman had been diagnosed with cancer; five of the eight could not see the cancer cells and three could.

At the time the heads of the Bill had been published but in May 2018 the Bill remains in Schedule B.  It has been around for a long time.  In 2015 it was specifically stated mandatory reporting of events which had resulted in deaths or serious harm would be introduced.  A year later this was changed at the request of the Chief Medical Officer.  This happened around the time of the Portlaoise scandal.  Will the Taoiseach explain why it is taking so long for the legislation to be enacted?  He will be aware of the scandal in Portlaoise which, as I understand it, provoked the major announcement of this legislation and a suite of other measures, but there is no sign of it being placed in the Statute Books any time soon.

The Minister will bring forth a memo in that regard in the next week or two.

We also passed the Legal Services Regulation Act, which brings in pre-action protocols.  The point of pre-action protocols is to speed up cases and make sure people do not get stuck in the courts for years.

In 2015 the Government pulled the plug on mandatory open disclosure as a statutory duty of candour.  The Taoiseach was on the record that he thought it was a good idea, but on the basis of information or advice, he backed away from it.  That was a mistake but that is what he did.  The Taoiseach now tells us that the health information and patient safety Bill, which is on the B list, is being fast-tracked.  Is there not a contradiction inherent in this?  It sounds to me that the Taoiseach was not keen on this proposition and he is now moving under pressure.  I welcome the fact he is moving on the matter but I would like the Taoiseach to tell the House, not in some vague way, exactly when we will see this legislation.  Do not pretend this was something on the to-do list when clearly the Taoiseach had wrongly backed away from it.  That was a mistake.  Now, because of this appalling turn of events, it is back on the Government's agenda.  This is the correct thing to do.  There should not have been a delay but we are where we are.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the Taoiseach will explain how something that is being fast-tracked could be on a B list.  This does not make any sense to me.  Is the Taoiseach moving it on to an A list or is there some kind of supercharged approach to this now?  It needs to happen quickly.

In addition to the awareness campaign of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, the Minister of State with responsibility for data protection, Deputy Pat Breen, has been involved in a range of activities to promote awareness and regularly meets business groups and representative bodies to ensure everyone is aware of their privacy rights and obligations under GDPR.

Such protection of citizens' privacy rights is more important now than ever, particularly given the presence of such global technology giants as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn and many others.<\/p>  <p>  On the information published on Facebook scraping, impacting on more than 50 million members of the public, belatedly, policies are being introduced by companies to seek the user's permission to use his or her data for other companies.

Will the Government give further consideration to the appropriate digital age of consent because the protection of young people is more frequently in the minds of all citizens when we see to what young people are being required to sign up?  Children younger than 16 years should be protected from this.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il that the Government was considering legislation to protect journalists' sources following the alleged data breach at INM.  He may recall that on Tuesday he said it was time for the Government to dust down reports on the issue.  Has that dusting down been completed and is there a commitment to legislate in this area?  We all agree that the protection of journalistic sources and a free press from interference is an important bulwark of our democracy.  It is a concern for all of us that there would be a doubt about who might access journalists' sources and certainly the activities of a free press.  Last week I looked at the ranking of Ireland in terms of journalistic freedom and it is reasonably high.  We have to make sure we maintain and improve that status by having protections for journalists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100019#R00400","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1525187700,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin mentioned the unique role of Oireachtas Members in serving their constituents.  I echo what he said.  I know that it is a concern, certainly among members of my parliamentary party and the Cabinet, that we should not bring forward data protection laws that would restrict Deputies and Senators in doing the work they have been doing for years and decades in serving their constituents.  When this issue was discussed by the Cabinet, as part of its decision, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Attorney General were mandated to examine the unique role of the Oireachtas Member to see if any exemption or exception might be appropriate when it came to communications between Oireachtas Members and their constituents or about Oireachtas Members and their constituents.  At the same time, however, we need to be mindful of the fact that, as legislators, we probably should not impose laws on others that we are not willing to impose on ourselves.  That is something we have to bear in mind, but it is part of the ongoing considerations.<\/p>  <p>  On the Murray report and protecting journalists' sources, I did dust it down and look at it.  It is still under consideration as to whether we can legislate to protect journalists' sources.  We have identified three complications and certainly would welcome the advice of Deputies in other parties on how we might overcome them.  The first is the definition of a \"journalist\".  Journalism is an unregulated profession.  We know what a doctor is because to protect the title one is registered with the Medical Council.  We know what a nurse is because it is a protected title and one is registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Board.  We know that also to be the case for physiotherapists and teachers.  A huge number of professions are regulated.  One cannot just call oneself a teacher or an architect.  They are regulated professions.  One must register with a professional body and uphold a certain code of conduct and there is a mechanism by which one could be struck off the register.  Journalism is not in that space.  It is an unregulated profession.  I know that there is a press council, but journalists are not regulated in the way other professions are.  One does not have to register; one cannot be struck off and there is no fitness to practise body, which creates a complication.  It is difficult in law, therefore, to define what a journalist is.  Particularly in the current era when there is a huge amount of social media, there is the emergence of the citizen journalist who is somebody who may have another job, be self-employed or have a business but who may also be a journalist on occasion, perhaps for an hour a day or whenever he or she likes to be a journalist.  We would need some way to define what a journalist is before we could protect their sources.  That is a complicated task when it is not a regulated profession in the way other professions are regulated.  It is not a protected title in the way other titles are protected.<\/p>  <p>  There is a second reason we would not protect sources for other people.  As politicians, we are often given confidential information by people.  I am sure people in other walks of life are also given confidential information.  Would we apply it more widely?  I imagine some of it is covered by D&aacute;il privilege, but it may not all be covered.  There may be other professions for which we could also consider this.  We would also have to consider exceptions.  For example, there is legal privilege whereby lawyers have protections.  Doctors, for example, are protected by doctor-patient confidentiality, but in no cases are these protections absolute.<\/p><p>If the High Court orders a doctor to breach patient confidentiality, he or she must do so.  There are certain conditions under which doctors are expected to breach doctor-patient confidentiality, for example, if a patient poses a danger to other people.  Again, we would have to consider under what exceptions journalists could be required to give up their sources.  Would it be following a ruling of the High Court, for example?  All those things have to be thought through.  I have not thought them through yet or determined the right answers and certainly we would welcome the advice and views of other parties in that regard.<\/p> <p> The Government made a decision last year to accept 13 as the age of digital consent, based on recommendations made by organisations and individuals that work with children who are best able to advise us on the balance of autonomy versus safety.  Advice was sought from the Children's Rights Alliance, the Ombudsman for Children as well as Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, the special rapporteur for children.  They all recommended that we opt for 13 rather than 16.  I understand that some parties have reconsidered and changed their position of late.  Of course, people are entitled to do that.  I will not criticise anyone for changing his or her view because we all do that on occasion, as facts and contexts change.  I assume that this will go to a vote at some point over the next period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100019#R00500","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Functions","time":1525188300,"counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100020#S00200"},{"type":"question","time":1525188300,"counter":225,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[17817\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100020#S00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the work of the international, European Union and Northern Ireland division of his Department.

Yesterday's all-island civic dialogue on Brexit in Dundalk was a very good initiative which was particularly enjoyed by the young people who were invited to participate.  Mr. Barnier is also due to visit Newry, Derry and Dungannon and it is very important that he makes those trips.  I was pleased to see that the Taoiseach visited Warrenpoint and Lurgan.  Those visits were also extremely important and I am sure the Taoiseach did not miss how warmly he was welcomed by all sections of the community.  In that context, the obnoxious, racially charged and very discourteous remarks made by a person formerly known as Mr. John Taylor, now known as Lord Kilclooney, are to be absolutely rejected.  In my experience, such remarks do not represent the attitude of the vast majority of people from any side of the community, where people carry themselves with considerably more dignity and courtesy than that.<\/p>  <p>  I was interested to hear Mr. Barnier's comments in respect of the Border, the backstop and the answer to the Irish question.  I also listened very carefully to what the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste had to say.  I want to reiterate that I am very concerned that these matters have slipped from December to March and now on into June.  We are being told that June, rather than being a red line or a definitive date, is now a stepping stone.  That is a very dangerous game to play.  It is a deliberate strategy on the part of the British Government to play down the clock and I ask the Taoiseach to give his views on this again.  I would like to hear him firm up the Dublin position in respect of June and to reiterate to Mrs. May's Government that we need an answer and that it needs to come forward by June with its proposed solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100020#S00700","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1525188300,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Lord Kilclooney, also known as Mr. John Taylor, would be well advised to apologise for the slur that he attempted to cast on the Taoiseach.

That said, the DUP heavily criticised the Taoiseach for his informal visit to Armagh and Down because local politicians were not informed in advance.  There is a long-standing tradition south of the Border that when events of significance to local communities are taking place all public representatives, including Members of the Oireachtas and councillors, are invited.  Given that he is still in the early days of being Taoiseach, is it his policy when he is presiding at significant public functions on either side of the Border to ensure that all local representatives are offered the opportunity to be present?  The comments by the DUP are evidence of very strained relations.  Has the Taoiseach been able to do anything to improve communications with the DUP?  Does the Taoiseach have any plans to improve the relationship between his Government and the DUP?  Who is in charge of protocol for these visits?

Two days before those protests began I begged the Taoiseach to condemn and speak out against any likely Israeli armed attack on those protests but the Taoiseach ignored me in the D&aacute;il that day.  I have asked the Taoiseach about this every week since then, as the death toll has risen to 42.  Unarmed protesters who represent no threat to human life have been shot down by Israeli armed forces.  Those forces have admitted, in the face of protests by Israeli and Palestinian civil society, that they are using the rules of war and military engagement to deal with unarmed protesters.  The UN has spoken out on this.  Last week Mr. Ilan Baruch, the former Israeli ambassador to South Africa, compared what has been done in the last few weeks to Bloody Sunday.  He said that these events are Palestine's Bloody Sunday but are happening week in, week out.  He condemned the European Union, including Ireland, for its failure to use diplomatic means to deter Israel from such direct and brutal violence towards unarmed, non-violent Palestinian demonstrators.  He asked if Irish and EU leaders preferred profitable economic co-operation with Israel over upholding international human rights.  He went on to say that firing live ammunition at non-violent, unarmed demonstrators is \"an act of inconceivable brutality, yet standing indifferently on the sidelines is inconceivable, too\".  He accused European governments, including the Irish Government, of doing exactly that.  Where is the condemnation?  Where are the expulsions and sanctions?  We have absolute, deadly silence.  Teenagers are being mowed down by snipers and nobody is doing anything.

I think the remarks of former MP Taylor can be considered in a similar vein.  One of the core elements of the work of this division relates to Brexit.  The timetable is not clear.  I have been criticised by Government Ministers for rearticulating, to some extent, what the T&aacute;naiste had said about the June deadline.  If the June deadline is not reached, we will have to question whether it will be possible to get agreement by October.  The T&aacute;naiste made remarks to that effect on the BBC.  The Taoiseach said around the same time that he did not mind if this slipped to October.  His position was quoted by the UK Secretary of State for Brexit, David Davis, in his effort to ignore the June deadline.<\/p> <p> We all got a sense yesterday that this will be resolved in October.  That was the clear impression yesterday.  The Taoiseach might have a contrary view.  There is talk of substantial progress by June.  Has anyone defined what \"substantial progress\" means?

Many leaders stayed well into the day to speak to some of the young people who were in attendance.  I thank leaders for that.  This valuable dialogue has taken place on a number of occasions.  It is not just about politicians talking to politicians - it also involves politicians talking to farmers and business leaders etc.  I am delighted that someone from the Orange Order attended yesterday's meeting.  It was very welcome.  It was very useful to have young people and people from all the different sectors in attendance.  It was great to have Michel Barnier here in Ireland.  He visited Dundalk and he went to the North as well.  He heard from stakeholders and explained to them the EU's position with regard to Brexit.  The EU is willing to make special treatment and special provisions for Northern Ireland that it cannot make for the UK as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding my visit to the North yesterday, I had the opportunity to visit the port of Warrenpoint, which is one of the few ports in Ireland I had not previous visited.  As a former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I like my ports and airports.  I also visited the Jethro Centre in Lurgan, which has received funding from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It serves both communities but has its origin as the Protestant parish centre.  The visit I enjoyed the most was my visit to New-Bridge Integrated College, which is one of the integrated education secondary schools in Northern Ireland.  It is called New-Bridge because it is halfway between Newry and Banbridge and takes kids from both towns.  It was really great to have a glimpse or an insight into what a shared future might look like in Northern Ireland.  It is attended by kids from both communities and none.  Many kids from new communities and migrant communities, including kids from Asian backgrounds, are there too.  It gave me a great sense of what the new Northern Ireland might look like.<\/p>  <p>  My visit to Northern Ireland yesterday was deliberately low-key.  I can tell Deputy Burton that I have to judge on the day of each visit what is the purpose of the visit.  It was very much a low-key visit.  I did not have an entourage of local politicians or politicians from the Twenty-six Counties of the Republic with me.  I did not invite a big gaggle of media personnel either, although one or two journalists turned up.  The particular reason I took this approach was that the only people I have met on my most recent visits to Northern Ireland have been officials and politicians.  When I have tried to interact with people, I have found myself surrounded by officials and politicians, with the media snapping me and asking me questions.  I wanted to talk to everyday people in a low-key manner about their concerns with regard to Brexit and about their hopes for the future.  I wanted to hear from young people who live near the Border in Newry and Banbridge on how they feel about these issues.  Approximately 40% of the traffic that comes into Warrenpoint, which is a very important port, turns left and comes across the Border into the Republic of Ireland.  I also had a really interesting visit to the Jethro Centre.<\/p>  <p>  Regardless of what others might have to say about it, I certainly felt very welcome in Northern Ireland and I intend to visit again.  There will be low-key visits and there will be full-protocol formal visits as well.  I have to say that any time I go North of the Border, I feel very welcome on all sides.  The protocol is that I contact the Northern Ireland Office.  That is done by my protocol department.  We have to do that because they provide security.  We had some Police Service of Northern Ireland security with us.  In the absence of an Executive, it is not possible to contact an Executive or Government in Northern Ireland.  There is no Executive, so I contact the Northern Ireland Office instead.  I saw Lord Kilclooney's tweet.  I had thought it was a parody account, but seemingly it is not.  It is for real.  That is all I will say about that.<\/p>  <p>  The EU position with regard to June and October, which of course is Ireland's position because we negotiate as a group of 27 member states, is outlined in the guidelines.  We will meet again at the June Council meeting to review progress.  As the T&aacute;naiste has said, as I have said and as Michel Barnier has said, we need to see real and substantial progress on the text of the withdrawal agreement by June.  If the withdrawal agreement does not contain a protocol on Ireland and on the Irish Border, there will be no withdrawal agreement.  I think we are all very clear in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100021#T00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1525188900,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Is that October?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100021#T00300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1525188900,"counter":236,"content":"<p>The deadline for finalising the withdrawal agreement has always been October.

The national development plan involved a significant tour of the country.  University heads and those in institutes of technology love to greet members of the Government in the forlorn hope that the visit and their hospitality would be followed by numerous grants from the Government.  Billions of euro have been promised all over the country and part of this relates to the metro project.  I have visited Na Fianna and Home Farm and the two local schools are also seeing an impact.  Many of these projects have had no serious in-depth cost appraisal or analysis, and some serious economists have pointed out that despite the promises, there has only been a cursory economic analysis of things like the metro and other big projects.  There were promises without any great analysis.  I was once advised by a very wise city manager who has passed to his eternal reward that one must be very careful of engineers planning, as they tend to go as the crow flies and they do not very often look at what is in the way.<\/p><p>What is striking about Na Fianna is the extraordinary human resource, cultural, community and sporting endeavour that it represents.  It has 3,000 members and is on 11 sites but this is its home.  It is not just a GAA club but it is a community centre.  It is the hub of the entire community.  The value of voluntary human endeavour, which civilises a society and ensures an <i>esprit de corps<\/i>in communities, would be wiped out without a moment's thought by a proposal such as the metro.  It is extraordinary that in the Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, analysis, this area is not even identified as an obstacle.  There are six major obstacles identified ahead of the plan but this is not identified as such.  Home Farm has a pitch adjacent to the site.  It needs a more holistic appraisal by the Government, and the Government must discuss this with TII and argue that it should go back to the drawing board and reconsider the options, and most notably this option.  It has an impact on so much human capital.  We have gone on about this in the north inner city and there is a project team dealing with the importance of human capital.  This project would wipe that to naught and utterly destroy that human capital for a long time to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100022#U00600","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1525189500,"counter":251,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach mentioned the expenditure planned in arts, heritage and culture in Project Ireland 2040.

I am often criticised in other parts of the country for delaying and postponing transport projects.  The biggest one I postponed was the one that affected my constituency.  I refer to Metro North and Metro West.  It was a difficult decision, but it had to be done, given the state of the country's finances at the time.  The new proposal is even better.

It is important to reiterate that the commission is an independent statutory investigation.  It was established by the Oireachtas in 2015 to examine the experiences of vulnerable women and children in mother and baby homes during the period 1922 to 1998.  It is due to report in February next year.

I am continuing to work with Galway County Council and relevant Departments to ensure appropriate decisions are taken regarding the future of the site.<\/p> <p> I know all Members are agreed on our collective desire to respect the dignity and memory of the children who lost their lives.  The experts have advised us on what is possible.  A public consultation on these options has recently concluded and I expect to bring proposals to Government in the near future.<\/p> <p> The commission is now more than three years into its programme of work.  At its request, I extended its timeline for reporting to February 2019.  I appreciate that many former residents were frustrated by the necessity for the 12-month extension of time even though they recognise the complexity and breadth of the task.<\/p> <p> There are simply no shortcuts to truth and accountability.

This has a negative impact on their ability to serve children seeking asylum.  It is in direct contravention to the Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2001, which asks all Government Departments and agencies to collaborate in the protection of children.  For example, Tusla social care workers highlighted that many children seeking asylum are deported with very little warning.  There is no engagement with the social care worker.  It is wrong and very worrying.  The open nature of direct provision means sometimes children can be exposed to unsuitable persons and behaviours.  We all accept that direct provision can be an inherently stressful experience causing additional mental health and educational issues.  The opportunity for children to go on to further education is hugely important.  Unaccompanied minors who are placed in foster care are discharged from State care at 18 years old and, essentially, must enter direct provision or be entirely cut off from State support.  While the Department maintains that these minors have the same right to an aftercare plan as any other child in foster care, that is far from the reality.  Will the Minister consider those issues?  Are there any steps she will take to alleviate those challenges?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100027#Z00300","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1525192500,"counter":314,"content":"<p>Tusla provides dedicated aftercare supports to the group of young adults who reach 18, after they are 18.

It is important to note the independent commission of investigation has to date made no findings about abuse or neglect in any of the homes within its terms of reference.  In these circumstances, it is not possible for the Government to put in place a redress scheme for matters within the scope of this investigation prior to the commission submitting its findings and conclusions.<\/p>  <p>  In the interim, the Government has agreed to consider the health and well-being needs of former residents.

The then Government decided not to extend the scheme and it has been closed to new applicants since 2011.  This decision has been reviewed on a number of occasions by previous Governments and most recently following the publication of the commission of investigation&rsquo;s second interim report last year.

That is why we took a long time to deliberate on the report, with a detailed analysis by officials of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and other Departments of the rationale for some of the commission's statements.  The consensus from a series of discussions which involved the Attorney General, the Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs, Public Expenditure and Reform and Education and Skills was that there would be insurmountable difficulties in reopening the redress scheme or scoping an alternative scheme, whether statutory or non-statutory.  One of the primary reasons for this is that to date the commission has made no finding about abuse or neglect in the homes.  That makes it extremely difficult for the Government to decide to offer redress.  As a bridge to the final report, having understood and empathised with the concerns, particularly those expressed by the Bethany Home institution, I encouraged and achieved consensus with other Ministers that the Government could begin discussions with the former residents to examine meaningful targeted supports, particularly health and well-being supports, that could be provided for them prior to receiving the final reports of the commission and the Government's decisions which would follow them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100028#AA00200","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1525193100,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I do not doubt that the Minister feels for the survivors, but they have been listening to that response for decades.

It will be kept under review in 2018 in the normal performance of monitoring engagement between Tusla and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I am confident that with the implementation of the obligation for mandated reporting Tusla is responding, has put measures in place and, as the Deputy is aware, has worked with an inter-departmental group for the last couple of years so that other Departments were prepared also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100030#CC00200","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1525194300,"counter":348,"content":"<p>We supported and welcomed the introduction of mandatory reporting when it was brought in.

Last year the One in Four charity raised its concerns about Tusla.  It explained that Tusla was not adequately resourced to monitor two out of three of the cases the charity had raised with a credible report of child sex abuse that had been made.  The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, has raised its doubts over Tusla's ability to protect children given the repeated failure of many Tusla care facilities to pass HIQA inspections.  Yet again I am sure the Minister is in negotiation with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe,  for her Department's budget.  She will be looking for an allocation for extra resources and I am sure it will go back to the workforce plan Tusla will be putting forward.

I have confidence in that.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, I will be looking for more resources for Tusla for a number of our priorities.

This does not necessarily make a family that has not been allocated a social worker feel any better about it.  I appreciate this and I have empathy.

These rules are a necessary component of any Government scheme and ensure that Exchequer funding is used for its intended purpose.  In 2010, only one ECCE year, or 38 weeks, was available.  I enhanced this in 2016 and, on average, children benefitted from 61 weeks.  From this September, the additional investment I secured in budget 2018 will enable all children from the age of two years and eight months to be eligible for two programme years.<\/p>  <p>  While children will be eligible for two years of ECCE, not all parents choose to avail of it.  There are two factors that prevent absolute standardisation of how much time children will utilise from the two years available.  As Deputies are aware, school entry occurs at one point in the year, September, but children are born across the full year.  Parents can opt to start their children in school at either four or five years of age.  I fully accept that the use of age limits in a scheme such as this creates a situation whereby a child can fall just outside the age range.  Under current rules, children born in January are most affected.  However, we have to place an age cut-off at some point, whether this is at two years and eight months, or higher, or lower than this.  The scheme as it exists provides eligibility for two years but enables parents to decide how much of ECCE is in the best interest of their child.  I have asked for a consultation with the parents of children with disabilities, as I think the Deputy is aware, with regard to how the age limits affect them and I am due to receive the report on this consultation in late June.  I will be happy to update Deputies as soon as possible thereafter on any changes to the scheme as a result of this consultation.  I am conscious that age-based rules can be somewhat confusing, but my Department will continue to promote good communication of the ECCE scheme, so that parents and providers are clear about the rules involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100031#DD00700","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1525194900,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and acknowledge that the ECCE scheme has been extended to the two years.

Can the Department look at this in another way so that two years before a child starts school, he or she would be allowed to enter into the ECCE scheme?  I know what I am saying is simplistic but age has been a barrier here and it has been so prescriptive that the childcare providers themselves have to know exactly who they will get funding from.  I can see it completely from their point of view.  Parents might choose to let their children be that little bit older or younger and, as the Minister said, children born in January are particularly caught.  Is there any way the Minister can work with the Department?  She did it already, which I have to acknowledge, with the upper age limit.  She has already overcome that obstacle.

His death was a terrible tragedy for his family.  I offer my condolences to his parents, brother, extended family and all of his friends.  I bring forward this Topical Issue and mention the death of Mr. Harry Boland because, unfortunately, his tragic death meant that he was the sixth cyclist to be killed on the roads this year.  It is regrettable that the number of deaths of cyclists on the roads has increased in the past two years.  In 2017, 15 cyclists were killed on the roads, an increase on the ten killed in 2016.  So far this year six cyclists have lost their lives.<\/p>  <p>  I raise this Topical Issue to ask the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, who I am pleased to see in the Chamber to devote more attention to improving the safety of cyclists on the roads and more resources to ensuring there is sufficient infrastructure in place to protect them.  If we are serious about protecting cyclists, we must increase the level of Government investment in cycling infrastructure.  I cycle around the city and it is a very efficient and environmentally friendly way of travelling around it, but, regrettably, I cannot say it is very safe.  The biggest threat to cyclists is posed by the proximity of very large vehicles.  To diminish that threat, we must segregate and protect cyclists from large vehicles.  Unfortunately, the level of investment by the Government in cycling infrastructure shows that it is not devoted to improving the safety of cyclists.  The Minister may or may not be aware that approximately 95,000 people cycle in Dublin each day.  I am sure there are very large numbers of cyclists throughout the rest of the country.  We know from an answer given by the Minister to my colleague, Deputy Robert Troy, that the level of investment in cycling infrastructure has decreased significantly in recent years.  The Government spent &euro;16.3 million on cycling infrastructure in 2011 and &euro;18.8 million in 2015.<\/p><p>Regrettably, in 2017, the Minister's first full year in charge of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, only &euro;7 million was spent on improving cycling infrastructure.  I also know from my colleague, Deputy Troy, that the Minister has announced that this year only &euro;8 million will be devoted to cycling infrastructure.  It is a derisory amount.  It marks a significant decrease in the amount of money Government is spending on cycling infrastructure.<\/p> <p> If the Government is serious about trying to promote cycling and ensure that cycling is encouraged among our population, it must play its part in trying to make cycling safer.  There always will be dangers and threats on the road but it is imperative that the Government tries to ensure that cycling is made safer for citizens who use it.  The Minister and his Department should be aiming for 10% of his budget to be spent on cycling and walking facilities.  In fact, the United Nations recommends that it should be in the region of 20%.<\/p> <p> I would like to hear a commitment from the Minister that steps will be made to spend greater resources of the State on making cycling safer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100032#EE01500","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525196100,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I would first like to join Deputy Jim O'Callaghan in expressing my sympathy to the family of Harry Boland, who as he says was the sixth cyclist killed on the roads this year.  I thank him for raising this issue, which is a very serious one to which we are paying a great deal of attention, and we acknowledge the need for improvements in this area.<\/p>  <p>  My highest priority in all areas of transport is safety.  Tragically, many lives are lost on our roads each year, with 55 people killed to date in road traffic incidents in 2018.  That figure includes the six cyclists to whom Deputy O'Callaghan referred.<\/p>  <p>  We have made a great deal of progress in recent years, and 2017 saw the lowest number of road deaths ever in Ireland at 159.  However, no one is complacent about this issue.  My Department and I, working in conjunction with the Road Safety Authority, RSA, the Minister for Justice and Equality, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the local authorities, are continuing to implement measures under the road safety strategy to ensure the number of fatalities and serious injuries on our roads will continue to fall.<\/p>  <p>  Cyclists are particularly vulnerable road users, and we are addressing the issue of cyclist safety through a variety of initiatives.  The current road safety strategy, which runs from 2013 to 2020, contains measures to promote the use of personal protection equipment and high visibility clothing and developing a standardised road safety cycling proficiency training programme for schools, the Cycle Right programme.  Cycle Right was launched in January 2017 and rolled out during the year to as many primary schools as funding allows.  Cycling Ireland administers and manages the Cycle Right scheme and maintains a web based public register of qualified and approved Cycle Right trainers.  This new cycle training initiative, which includes an on-road element, will result over time in an increase in the number of children choosing to cycle to and from school safely.<\/p>  <p>  The RSA continues to work with cycling groups to promote cycle safety and to produce advertising campaigns aimed at the public, with a particular focus on the need for drivers to take extra care when sharing the road with cyclists.  We are also improving our cycling infrastructure.  There has been significant investment in this area in recent years, and that is continuing.<\/p>  <p>  As part of budget 2018, I secured a significant increase in Exchequer capital funding for cycling infrastructure over the period 2018-2021.  Capital investment of more than &euro;110 million will develop cycling and walking infrastructure in the greater Dublin area and regional cities over the next four years.  Budget 2018 also saw an increase of &euro;30 million in the multi-annual allocation for Greenways, bringing the total for 2018 to 2021 to more than &euro;55 million.  In addition, more than &euro;0.75 billion is being invested in reconfiguring the bus network as part of BusConnects, and this will entail construction of new cycling facilities alongside bus routes.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I announced earlier this year that I will bring in new regulations prescribing a minimum passing distance for vehicles overtaking cyclists.  As all overtaking offences under road traffic law reside in secondary legislation, my officials have already submitted draft regulations to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for consideration and settling.  I understand it has been sent for legal advice.  These provisions will assist in improving cycling safety and in changing driver attitudes to cyclists.<\/p>  <p>  Taken together, I believe these measures will provide increased safe infrastructure for cyclists and contribute to a change in behaviour which will enhance cycle safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100033#FF00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1525196100,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response and I agree that cyclists are particularly vulnerable road users.  However, what I have not heard from the Minister is a commitment that he and the Government will take steps to improve road safety for cyclists.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned some figures in his answer.  Unfortunately, he cannot get away from the fact that infrastructure spend in 2017, which was his first full year as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, was only &euro;7 million.  It also appears to be the case that in 2018, that spend will be only &euro;8 million.  That is not sufficient.  The Minister and the Government need to give a commitment that they recognise the importance of cycling and that they recognise that it is a form of transport that needs to be encouraged among young people and older people.  However, that cannot happen unless people believe their cycle ways and the manner by which they can cycle will be safe.  Currently in this city, in other cities and in rural areas it is not safe.  The only way it will be made sufficiently safe for more people to use them is if there is delegated and allocated space on the road for cyclists.  We do not have that at present and we need to ensure that occurs.  It will lead to a huge increase in the number of people who are using cycling if they believe they and their children will be safe when they are out cycling on the roads.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister has indicated that he will shortly bring in a statutory instrument giving effect to the minimum passing distance legislation.  That is a proposal my colleague, Deputy Robert Troy, has been very much to the fore in putting forward.  However, that will be of very limited effect unless it is combined with a commitment by Government to ensure there will be cycle paths throughout our cities and rural areas.  The Minister should visit cities such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam.  He will see how those progressive cities have devoted huge amounts of resources to facilitating and encouraging cycling.  It would be to the benefit of society as a whole but, regrettably, when we have a Government that will not commit investment in the infrastructure we will find ourselves in a situation where people will not feel confident about cycling around the city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100033#FF00300","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1525196100,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I acknowledge much of what Deputy O'Callaghan said, although I have done quite a lot of it already.

I said in the initial part of my reply that I got a significant increase in Exchequer capital funding for cycling infrastructure over the period 2018 to 2021.  Capital investment of more than &euro;110 million, which is a lot of money and is a huge increase, will develop cycling and walking infrastructure in the greater Dublin area and regional cities over the next four years.  That is directly targeting safety and improving the infrastructure, which is what Deputy O'Callaghan also referred to as being necessary for safer conditions for cycling.  That is exactly what we are doing.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to that, the introduction of the minimum passing distance was greeted with a great deal of surprise.  It is quite revolutionary.  It is extremely unpopular in certain areas but it has been done exclusively for the benefit of cyclists.  It is something which has provoked hostility in other areas but it is a recognition of the fact that we must do this, and it will be implemented at the earliest possible time in order to protect cyclists.  As the Deputy said, it will not produce a panacea.  The Deputy also spoke about the need for advertising.  The RSA has embarked on a campaign encouraging the minimum passing distance, MPD, which has had a huge effect on public care in terms of overtaking cyclists before it is even implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100033#FF00400","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ferry Services","time":1525196100,"counter":388,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100033#FF00450"},{"type":"speech","time":1525196100,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for taking this matter.  The Minister is aware of the issue with Inishmurray Island where the Marine Survey Office under his Department has directed that no licensed craft may land on the island.<\/p><p>This is a very serious matter.  As the Minister is not personally familiar with Inishmurray island, I will paint a picture for him.  Inishmurray island is the Blasket Islands and Skellig Michael rolled into one.  It is the site of a monastic settlement founded by Saint Molaise in 520 AD.  People have been landing on the island for 1,500 years.  In more modern times, 102 residents lived on the island at the turn of the last century.  They raised cattle on the island and brought them to the market on the mainland regularly.  They also fished there.  For the past 30 years, Inishmurray has been a very important aspect of both the Sligo offering and the Irish offering in terms of tourism.  Indeed, if Members who live here in the Pale broadened their horizons and thought a little bit more about what we have up there, then maybe \"Star Wars\" could have been shot on that island.  It certainly has scenery that equals Skellig Michael or the Blasket islands.<\/p> <p> The Marine Survey Office, MSO, has unilaterally taken action which will put boat people out of business and inhibit former islanders - members of the Brady and Herrity families who are still alive - and many hundreds of descendants who have a tradition of visiting every single year.  The Minister must work on a cross-departmental basis to get an immediate derogation for landing on Inishmurray island until such time as a permanent solution can be identified and put in place.  Even if the Minister was to make the money available today to design and build a new pier or whatever the MSO deems necessary, it would be four years before anyone could set foot on the island.  I appeal to the Minister to work with everyone involved to get a derogation on landing on Inishmurray island immediately and then to knock heads together to ensure that a more permanent solution is put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100033#FF00500","speaker":"1346","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525196700,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for dealing with this Topical Issue matter today, which is very serious.  Last week the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Griffin, attended a meeting in Sligo on the matter of boats landing on Inishmurray.  Representatives of F&aacute;ilte Ireland attended, as did boat owners, skippers and families from Inishmurray.  Up until 1957 people were living on the island and people have been landing there for hundreds of years.  The MSO has done these people a disservice.  The monastic site has been mentioned.  There is also a graveyard on the island and families go back out to tend the graves of their deceased family members.  I understand that it was once more difficult to embark and disembark on Skellig Michael than on Inishmurray.  Perhaps if \"Star Wars\" had visited the latter, we would not be in this situation.<\/p>  <p>  We have an obligation to those skippers who have paid up to &euro;200,000 for their boats.  Why would they risk their boats in terms of landing on the island?  They have their own insurance for passengers to embark and disembark at Inishmurray.  One of the boat owners had 30 groups scheduled to visit Inishmurray during the summer, but unfortunately, due to the inclement weather, only ten of those scheduled visits took place.  Would a disclaimer suffice until such time as the island receives funding for proper landing facilities?  We need a common-sense approach to resolving this matter.  Sligo is part of the Wild Atlantic Way which is being promoted to tourists.  Inishmurray is a major hub in north Sligo and it is vitally important that the Minister would ensure that those in the MSO who made this decision reverse it immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100034#GG00200","speaker":"1343"},{"type":"speech","time":1525196700,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue which has been raised with me many times by Ms Marie Casserly, a local councillor with whom both Deputies will be familiar.

In 2008, officials from the MSO carried out an assessment of the landing facilities at Inishmurray island and deemed the recognised landing on the island to be wholly unsuitable for landing passengers.  As a consequence, no passenger licences have been issued which include Inishmurray on their plying limits.  It was recommended that no such licences be issued until such time as the appropriate landing facility has been provided.  No passenger boat licences have been revoked due to this issue and those passenger boats which have the appropriate licences may approach the island so that passengers may see the island and take photographs.  It was brought to the attention of the MSO that certain boats were advertising trips to the island and as such may have been operating outside the terms of their passenger boat licences.  As safety regulator, the MSO has a responsibility to ensure the safety of passengers and officials of the MSO contacted the owners of these vessels to remind them of their obligations.<\/p>  <p>  I should make it clear that this issue relates to the issuing of passenger boat licences.  A passenger boat is defined in the Merchant Shipping Act 1992 and includes a boat carrying up to 12 passengers for reward or while carrying up to 12 persons to or from their place of work.  It would not include persons using a boat by themselves or while carrying friends or family as non-fare paying passengers.  Such vessels may be considered to be recreational craft which do not require passenger boat licences but may still be subject to other regulation.  The Department recently updated its code of practice on the safe operation of recreational craft.<\/p>  <p>  The solution here is simple, namely, the provision of an appropriately safe landing facility.  This is a matter for the owner of the property on which the facility would be built and the appropriate local authority, which in this instance is Sligo County Council.  I am mindful of the importance of tourism to the local economy in Sligo and elsewhere.  That said, passenger safety is a top priority.  Once an appropriate landing facility is provided, officials of the MSO will assess it and any passenger vessel proposing to use it with a view to granting the appropriate licence.<\/p>  <p>  On the basis of the concerns raised about Inishmurray island, the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Griffin, travelled to Sligo last Tuesday, 24 April, to meet locals and listen to their concerns.  As a follow-on from this, the Minister of State agreed to facilitate a meeting as a matter of urgency involving agencies that may be able to deliver a solution which would ultimately enable the MSO to reassess the matter.  Obviously, as the MSO is the regulator, it would not be appropriate for that office formally to advise on the matter.  I hope that such a meeting will chart a course of action to remedy this issue, address the safety concerns and enable tourism to the island to develop.  Deputies will be aware of the fact that this proposed meeting will take place very shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100034#GG00500","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1525196700,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I am glad the Minister mentioned local councillor, Ms Marie Casserly, but it seems that even she is not capable of getting the Minister, his departmental officials or the MSO to see common sense.

The Department is kicking this out on the never-never.  The MSO has been intimidating boat owners, telling them that they will be reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and prosecuted.  Are there any brains in the Department at all?  People have been going to Inishmurray island for 1,500 years.  They raised and sold cattle, fished and supplied food to people on the mainland.

I have spelled it out.  Like any responsible politician, I am not prepared to allow people to take risks by bringing fare-paying passengers to places that are deemed to be unsafe, regardless of whether they are islands or tourist spots.  The moment it is safe to do so, the relevant authorities will give those involved the go-ahead to resume bringing passengers to the island in order that it can retake its position as a very worthy tourist destination.

The programmes in question covered the issues of gambling and foster care and troubled young people, the latter of which is being raised by five Deputies by way of a Topical Issue.  Although I can only talk about my own area, CHO area 2, I can empathise clearly with what the young people on the programme said about child and adolescent mental health services and facilities in general.  It is shocking to think that at the end of January, some 6,181 children were waiting for a primary care psychological appointment.  Most of the 1,200 high priority cases within that cohort have been waiting for approximately 12 months.  I cannot understand why we have to wait for children to become acute before there can be an intervention.  Why do we have to wait until they are in sixth class before there is an intervention?  Why do we always have to wait until they are nearly on the brink of self-harm before there is an intervention?  As we know, child and adolescent mental health teams are not completely filled.  While we have the teams, we do not have the full complement of staff.  I wonder what the Minister of State and the Department of Health are doing to recruit to fill the teams.  To be honest, we do not have a functioning child and adolescent mental health service or functioning child and adolescent mental health teams.  When one of the 11 components needed is missing, it can be a key driver that spreads throughout many other services.  I wonder how the Minister of State intends to address the issues raised last Thursday night.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100035#HH02100","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1525197300,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to speak about serious mental health cases among young people.  On RT&Eacute;'s \"The Big Picture - Young and Troubled\" broadcast last Thursday we witnessed some heart-rending examples of the distress being experienced by young people with mental health issues and their families as they tried to access child and adolescent mental health services.  Unfortunately, the stories we heard from these brave families on RT&Eacute; last Thursday night are reflected across the country.  The Government consistently states it is doing all it can, but the facts speak for themselves and I will provide some recent examples.  A significant number of children are still being placed in adult units, some for up to six weeks.  Some of them have to sleep on chairs or in hallways.  At the end of January, over 6,000 children were waiting for a primary care psychology appointment.  Over 1,500 of them had been waiting for more than one year.  There is a similar situation in child and adolescent mental health services, with over 2,500 children on the waiting list, of whom 351 are on the list for over one year.  Barely over half of the number of staff needed to provide a basic child and adolescent mental health service are in place throughout the country.  When we engage in early identification and integrated intervention, we can help to reduce significantly the burden of mental ill-health on young people.  We do this by identifying symptoms and warning signs at an early stage and, having done so, providing expedient and suitable care.  Mental illness is particularly receptive and responsive to early intervention.  The mental health system for young people seems to be geared towards triage and crisis intervention.  When will the Government provide access to the timely and appropriate early intervention that is desperately needed by young people with mental illnesses?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100035#HH02200","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speech","time":1525197300,"counter":419,"content":"<p>A friend and constituent of mine, Ms Daniella Russell from my home village of Ardfert, was featured on RT&Eacute;'s \"The Big Picture - Young and Troubled\" broadcast last week after her mother, Joyce, had been forced by the State to bring her daughter to England to be treated on foot of the HSE's refusal to give her treatment in a specialist facility in Dublin.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, emailed my office the day before last week's programme was aired to tell me that Daniella's mother had requested referrals to Lois Bridges, a private unit in Dublin that offers alternative forms of treatment to those with eating disorders.  The girl is skin and bone and very lucky to be still alive.  The HSE has advised that there are beds available in the Sliabh Mis unit and wishes to ensure all options within our own services have been explored sufficiently.  Unfortunately, our own services have been explored but not successfully because they are not sufficient.  My office was contacted yesterday by the mother of a 17 year old girl from County Kerry who had just been released from University Hospital Kerry after trying for a second time to take her own life.  Last June, or almost 12 months ago, a request was made for funding to start dialectical behaviour therapy, but it has not yet been approved.

How many more documentaries will we have to watch before the country wakes up?  I got angry last week when I was told by one of two witnesses who had to appear without prejudice at the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care that they had been threatened by management for coming here to tell us the truth.

The state of mental health services is very clearly a crisis and an emergency.  Last week we saw the RT&Eacute; programme \"The Big Picture - Young and Troubled\"; it was an excellent piece of public service broadcasting.  The matter enters the heart of the public debate every so often, but for the young people affected, in particular, it is an ongoing and daily issue.  Day in and day out, they wait for appointments.  The Minister of State is aware of the particular interest in this issue in Cork as there has been much concern expressed in the past 12 to 18 months as the suicide rates in the city and county are above the national average in recent years.  The Cork and Kerry area accounts for a substantial part of the mental health waiting list, making up 29% of the total.  Last year there were approximately 120 people waiting for more than 18 months and that pattern is replicated nationally.  There are approximately 250 young people waiting for longer than 12 months for an appointment with CAMHS at this time, which is scandalous.  These young people find themselves portrayed as statistics, but the reality is that day after day they go about trying to live fulfilling lives by attending school or work and trying to find satisfaction or hope in life and all the while they wait months for appointments.  Some of them could be in crisis.  As there are not enough mental health professionals available, they are in the difficult position where they have to try to triage in what is a most severe crisis.  As many of the young people who are waiting are in a very severe crisis, mental health professionals must try to establish whose cases are the most urgent.  It is a fish and loaves job, as there are not enough professionals to go around.  Young people are suffering as a consequence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100036#JJ00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1525197900,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies who spoke and took the time to ensure we could raise this matter on the floor of the D&aacute;il following last Thursday's programme which highlighted many of the issues debated in this House in recent times in protecting youth mental health and particular issues surrounding the specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, CAMHS.  Overall, the programme adopted a balanced approach, showing both the positive and negative aspects of the system.  It referenced the increasing demands, good practice and the service improvements required.<\/p>  <p>  I stressed on the programme that youth mental health had to be viewed in its widest sense and seen as more than just the specialist CAMHS.  A priority for the Government is improving all aspects of prevention and early intervention, including progressing implementation of the 2017 report of the national youth mental health task force.  Our aim is to improve access to services by examining options such as seven-day cover, 24-hour cover, developing a national telephone and text helpline and other digital information and supports, as access to early intervention and the signposting to services clearly need improvement for service users.<\/p>  <p>  Mental health remains a priority for the Government.  This is reflected by the additional &euro;35 million we gave in the last budget, bringing total HSE funding in the area to over &euro;910 million.  The HSE service plan for 2018 is developing CAMHS against a background where the population of children is growing and the demand for CAMHS saw a 26% increase between 2012 and 2017.  Approximately 18,800 referrals are expected to CAMHS this year, with approximately 14,300 being seen by this specialist service.  A particular issue that came through strongly on the RT&Eacute; programme was that of service variation around the country, particularly in accessing services, addressing urgent cases and tackling waiting lists.  The HSE launched a standard operating procedure in 2015 for both inpatient and community CAMHS.  The executive is reviewing its operational procedure and this review is expected to be completed by mid year.  We expect it to reinforce the message that services must be delivered equitably across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Other CAMHS-specific measures included in the HSE service plan for 2018 include increasing the number of CAMHS referrals to be seen this year by 27% compared to the number in 2017.  The measures will also seek to provide a seven-day per week service for CAMHS to ensure supports for young people in line with Connecting for Life.  They will also improve day hospital services within CAMHS and develop eating disorder specialist community teams for young people, with a range of \"talking therapies\" such as dialectical behaviour therapy.  The executive is also enhancing access by older adolescents to specialist mental health services, with continued appropriate placement and care in CAMHS-specific settings.<\/p>  <p>  There have been widely acknowledged difficulties in recruiting and retaining specialist CAMHS staff, while recruitment efforts have been ongoing, notwithstanding a serious shortage of suitably qualified CAMHS consultants at both national and European level.  A key approach to reducing pressures on CAMHS is the decision by the Government to increase access to counselling services in HSE primary care services.  The recent appointment of 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists will go some way towards developing such a service for teenagers and young people.  The genuine and serious issues raised on the recent RT&Eacute; programme will receive full and proper consideration by the Department of Health and the HSE in the context of our collective efforts to improve all aspects of mental health services for young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100036#JJ00300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1525197900,"counter":424,"content":"<p>Each Member will have one minute in which to reply.

It was only awarded &euro;15,000.  The service was to provide support for an entire county - the second biggest in Ireland - but seemingly it did not meet the needs threshold.  The needs had been identified by teachers, schools and Tusla as being met by this very good and working early intervention group.

That goes to part of the problem to which I alluded in that we seem to triage and deal with crisis interventions instead of dealing with people when they first show early signs of having a mental illness or difficulty.  The HSE launched a standard operating procedure in 2015, but it is ineffective when there are not enough staff in place to operate or implement it.  Everything is being funnelled into CAMHS and GPs are in a desperate position because they either send people to emergency departments or must prescribe drugs for them.

Only 32% of respondents felt that the service was beneficial to their child.  This is not a reflection on the dedicated and committed staff.  The problem is a lack of resources.  The Minister of State said he intends to employ more people in that service.  It is not just a sticking plaster approach that is needed.

While CervicalCheck has audited all cases notified to it, I have been informed that a potentially considerable number of cases will not have been subjected to an audit of their screening history.  These are not new cases of cancer, nor is it a group of women wondering if they have cancer.  These are women who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer and treated as such but their cases have not been included in a clinical audit.  Having identified this issue, the SIMT will take steps to identify any additional cases of cervical cancer that occurred during this period and which were not audited.  The screening history of these additional cases will be established, and if any of these women were screened through the CervicalCheck programme, their case will be reviewed in further detail with cytology review where necessary.  This is an evolving situation but I am giving as much information to this House as I have as soon as I have it to be transparent with the D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  We are all here, I think we can agree, because Vicky Phelan spoke out.  I recognise that to do so cannot have been easy for her or her family.  Her courage and tenacity has done a great service to the women of Ireland and her actions will ultimately lead to improvements for all.  I think the background to the case is well understood at this point, but I want to be very clear about my own level of knowledge prior to the case becoming public and with regard to the information note I received on 16 April, which I have published today with only personal information redacted.<\/p>  <p>  I was not notified at that time of the information which later became available, information such as the correspondence chain between doctors and the clinical director of the programme.<\/p><p>The full implications became clear to me only on Wednesday, 25 April, when Vicky Phelan spoke, and on Thursday, 26 April, at which point I acted swiftly.<\/p> <p> The note outlined the details of an individual case.  lt informed me of a legal process that was already underway.  It informed me that mediation discussions had been held on 9 April and pre-trial discussions had been held with a judge on 10 and 12 April.  It said that the matter may progress to the High Court on 19 April but that the case was likely to be settled before going to court.  It said that the claim against the HSE was likely to be dropped in the absence of any bad faith by the HSE.  It informed me that my Department had been advised by the National Cancer Control Programme that it did not consider this to be a patient safety incident.  It informed me the National Screening Service had assured the Department that no quality issues have arisen in respect of the UK laboratory that performed the 2011 test referred to in the case.  In an appendix with background information, the note outlined the clinical cancer audit process, including the fact that all current and historical clinical cancer audits had been communicated to treating clinicians in 2016 and that more recently women are informed of this audit process and have the option to request information on the outcomes of these reviews.  It was not clear until after the details of this case became public that this process was not ensuring women were informed.  Once I became aware of that I ordered immediate change, as is well documented.<\/p> <p> Since 2008, a total of 3 million smear tests have been carried out by CervicalCheck.  The cervical screening test is not a diagnostic test; it is a screening test.  It is a test to indicate the possibility of pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions and to identify women who require further investigation or follow-up.  Tests can produce false positive and false negative results.  Women are screened at three-yearly intervals but cervical cancer may develop in the interval between a negative screening test and the next scheduled screening in any cervical screening programme.<\/p> <p> It is a fact that the current primary screening test used by CervicalCheck is a cytology test that produces a not insignificant number of false negative results.  I can, however, confirm that primary human papillomavirus screening will be introduced later this year.  I took that decision in February and it will be introduced by October.  I understand that the accuracy of HPV testing is significantly higher than liquid-based cytology testing, which is the testing used now.  HPV testing is expected to result in fewer women receiving a false negative result.  I am also of the view that testing for the HPV virus will be a more appropriate strategy for the cohort of women who have received vaccination against HPV.  My decision to approve primary HPV screening was informed by a HIQA health technology assessment.  The assessment found that HPV screening would benefit women by making the screening process more clinically effective as well as reducing unnecessary tests for most women.  The HSE has advised that 1,482 cervical cancer cases have been audited by CervicalCheck covering the period from 2008 to 2018.  The audit found that the majority of these cases involved patients who already had been referred for further investigation or treatment by CervicalCheck.  In the case of 208 patients who were the subject of a detailed cytology review it found that the review differed from the original test.<\/p> <p> Last Friday, the HSE established a serious incident management team.  The team worked through the weekend to confirm the number of women involved and the extent to which the audit results had been communicated to them.  Yesterday, it was reported to me that 162 of the 208 women involved had not been informed of the outcome of the audit process.  Over the past two days we have been communicating with these women and I believe significant progress has now been made.  Obviously, there will be a small number of cases where we might not succeed in initially making contact, such as a case where a woman may have moved abroad.<\/p> <p> Like all Deputies, I was very sorry to learn that 17 of the patients involved have since died and I would like to sincerely express my sympathies to their families on the record of the House.  Obviously, as yet we do not know the cause of death of these individual women but we will work with the families to ensure that is established.  A helpline has been in operation since Friday and appropriate clinical staff will follow up on specific clinical questions.  Between Friday and the close of business yesterday, approximately 6,000 calls were received.  Unfortunately, there were some technical issues with the telephone line but I am informed that the HSE had worked to address this.<\/p> <p> I am conscious that some women will be worried that they might have received an incorrect smear result and they might want a further test to be reassured.  I have heard many women say that in recent days.  This was one of the most persistent issues that came in through the helpline we established.  I have, therefore, asked CervicalCheck to make the necessary arrangements to enable any woman who has had a CervicalCheck smear test and whose general practitioner considers that the woman should have a further test to access such a further test without charge.  These arrangements are currently being worked through and will be confirmed this week.  I wish to thank the doctor representative organisations for their co-operation and support in this matter.<\/p> <p> Vicky Phelan's case has highlighted a number of major weaknesses in how people experience our health service.  I believe that immediate actions are required to address these weaknesses and to provide assurance to the public with regard to the quality and performance of the cervical screening programme.  Given the gravity of the situation as well as the impact it has had on Vicky Phelan and a number of other women, I think it is vital that we ensure we put in place a process to allow all of us - patients, doctors and policymakers alike - to understand exactly what happened and what steps we need to rectify the situation.  I have, therefore, directed HIQA to commence a statutory investigation to examine the clinical and managerial governance of CervicalCheck.  This investigation will place a particular focus on the quality assurance systems, clinical audit processes and communications with patients.  It is crucial for all of us to get this information.  A statutorily empowered investigation by HIQA, the body established by these Houses for this very purpose, is the most appropriate way forward in this instance.<\/p> <p> As part of this investigation an international peer review group will be established to examine our cervical screening programme against international best practice and standards.  HIQA has been asked to identify any implications that may apply to other cancer screening programmes.  This will ensure that any learning will have wider impact and serve to improve all our screening programmes.  I am conscious, while looking at a programme and how to improve it, that individual women have been impacted and we need to ensure they can get independent clinical answers.  I have now decided to appoint an international expert clinical panel to provide all women concerned with an individual clinical review.  A liaison nurse specialist will be appointed to ensure the women involved receive all the support they require.  I met the Irish Cancer Society this afternoon to ask that the society would meet the panel and ensure the panel and the relevant processes are put in place in a way that is supportive of women patients as well as to ensure women get the answers they need.  The work of the expert panel will be completed as soon as possible.  I hope it will have its work concluded by July.<\/p> <p> Since 2008, CervicalCheck has undertaken tendering processes to award contracts for cytology testing of cervical smear tests.  In 2013, the national cytopathology training centre at the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital was engaged to carry out some of the laboratory tests.  Currently, the testing of cervical smear tests is carried out by three institutions with approximately 50% of the testing done in Ireland and the remaining 50% done abroad.  I realise this has been the source of much public discussion in recent days.  I have been assured that all three laboratories meet quality assurance standards and are certified by the relevant national authorities.  However, the introduction of HPV testing later this year as the primary screening mechanism for CervicalCheck, with cytology as reflex test, will involve a reconfiguration of laboratory work.  It will also provide an opportunity for further tendering processes to be undertaken for any laboratory work carried out outside the public sector.<\/p> <p> This issue in recent days has shone a real spotlight on our open disclosure practices or lack thereof in some cases.  Of course open disclosure involves an open and consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare.  It is a human experience for all involved and one that should not be hindered by other concerns and fears.  The HSE open disclosure policy has been in place since 2013 and the HSE committed to its full implementation in the HSE service plan this year.  The Medical Council Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners sets outs the duties of medical doctors in respect of open disclosure and duty of candour.  It states that patients and their families, where appropriate, are entitled to honest, open and prompt communication about adverse events that may have caused them harm.  When discussing events with patients and their families, doctors should acknowledge that the event happened and explain how it happened; apologise, if appropriate; and assure patients and their families that the cause of the event will be investigated and efforts made to reduce the chance of it happening again.<\/p> <p> The Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 includes provisions for open disclosure of serious events including certain protections for information given to the patient at an open disclosure meeting.  This approach creates a safe space for healthcare staff to be open and transparent with patients, who can be given as much information as possible as early as possible, including an apology.  In the course of D&aacute;il consideration of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill, I gave a commitment to bring forward separate legislation to provide for mandatory open disclosure of serious events.  I wish to acknowledge the work of Deputy Clare Daly in this regard.  I intend to bring a memorandum to Government next week proposing a patient safety Bill.  This Bill will include measures to support patient safety objectives and to provide for mandatory open disclosure to patients of those serious events which will be the subject of mandatory external notification.  I will prescribe a list of reportable events that are required to be notified by public and private providers and this will include screening.<\/p><p> There has been much criticism about the way the State handled Vicky Phelan's legal proceedings.  I accept that criticism.   I think there is a difficulty with our tort laws in that they are slow to provide for persons who have suffered harm within the health care system.  However, the State Claims Agency is delegated to manage all claims against the State and neither I nor my Department has any role or function in this regard.<\/p> <p> There also have been calls for greater accountability across the health system.  For my own part, I am clear that accountability and good governance are central to the organisation and functioning of the health system.  I have called it out in recent days where I did not see that come to the fore.  As part of my Department's response to Sl&aacute;intecare, it is proposed to examine how best to strengthen accountability in our health care system.  Other jurisdictions have managed to do this, therefore, why can Ireland not?  Steps will be identified to consider how accountability for all staff across the health service can be strengthened.<\/p> <p> My Department also expects to publish a new code of conduct for health and social care providers this month.  This will be an important driver in the delivery of the patient safety agenda, both in terms of policy and service delivery.  The code will apply to all service providers and individuals who come into contact with a user of health or social services.   <\/p> <p> I want to assure this House and, more importantly, the women of Ireland that I am taking every possible action to ensure that an incident such as this does not happen again.  I acknowledge the very difficult circumstances that Vicky Phelan and her family are now in, and I would like to thank her for her bravery in bringing this to light.  I still think it is bizarre that doctors had information in relation to patients that they did not share with their patients.  That paternalistic attitude is something that should concern us all.<\/p> <p> In all of this debate, however, it is important we do not lose sight of the fact that many cancer screening programmes have resulted in the lives of many women being saved.  We must do all we can to ensure women continue to attend for smear testing.  We acknowledge things went wrong but we are determined to put things right.  I hope the actions I have outlined will help in that regard.  Tomorrow the Joint Committee on Health with meet relevant officials from the HSE, CervicalCheck, the National Cancer Control Programme and my Department.  I expect all those agencies to be upfront and forthwith and I do not expect a commencement of any investigation to stop that exchange of legitimate democratic debate here in our Parliament.  <\/p> <p> This evening I will continue to do what I have done since this incident came into the public domain and since I have known all about it, which is to be as transparent and open as I can, and I hope to work constructively with colleagues across this House to put this right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100037#KK01600","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525199700,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Stephen Donnelly who has ten minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100039#MM00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1525199700,"counter":446,"content":"<p>The withholding of important information from patients is completely unacceptable.  What we have seen so far in the case of CervicalCheck is nothing short of an outrage.  It constitutes a fundamental breach of trust between patients, their doctors and the HSE and it has led to widespread fear and anger across Ireland in the past few days, and I will speak to that shortly.<\/p><p>Before I do so, I want to commend the bravery and determination of Vicky Phelan and of her family.  If Ms Phelan had not made the stand she did, what has happened in CervicalCheck would remain a secret.  Ms Phelan&rsquo;s lawyer has said that &quot;enormous efforts and energies were put into forcing her to remain silent&quot;.  If Ms. Phelan had not faced down those efforts, what has happened in CervicalCheck would remain a secret.  Ms Phelan&rsquo;s courage has laid bare a conspiracy of silence.  Her courage has ensured legislation on mandatory disclosure will be introduced.  It has ensured that many other women, also kept in the dark, will now be told the truth.  It has prompted Government to fast-track patient safety legislation.  It has led to an investigation being launched to see what was going on in CervicalCheck and to see if similar withholding of patient information is happening in other screening programmes.  For all of these reasons, and more, Ms Phelan&rsquo;s courage will lead to important changes in health care in Ireland, which I believe everyone in this House will support.<\/p><p>The focus this week must be on the 162 women who, like Vicky Phelan, were not told of screening errors.  It is imperative that all these women are engaged with quickly, and are provided with the support they need.  In the 17 cases where women are now deceased, their families must be met similarly.<\/p><p>The establishment of an investigation is also essential, and the Government&rsquo;s announcement on this is welcome.  As answers are required quickly, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, seems to be a reasonable choice to lead the investigation, at least in the first instance.  However, HIQA&rsquo;s focus is clinical quality, and this investigation must be broader than that.  At the core of this issue is the withholding of patient information, and Fianna F&aacute;il will support this investigation only if the Government can provide an assurance that this will be covered.  Specifically, HIQA must be able to investigate the question of who decided what, and who knew what in CervicalCheck and in the broader HSE.  The investigation must not be used by the Government to avoid answering questions in the short term.  There is very considerable public worry, and it is essential that information continues to be made available, including while the investigation is carried out.<\/p><p>There are many other questions that need to be investigated.  Why did it take two years for the HSE to inform Ms Phelan&rsquo;s consultant, Dr. Hickey, of the false negative?  The HSE has a policy of open disclosure.  Why then was the HSE telling doctors to use their judgment as to whether they should openly disclose, and in the cases of the deceased, why was the HSE saying that the doctors should simply make a note on their files?  Why did Ms Phelan&rsquo;s consultant not share the information about the screening error with her until the year after he found out about it?  When senior managers within the HSE were informed of the disagreement between Ms Phelan&rsquo;s consultant and CervicalCheck, why did senior management within the HSE not act to ensure all patients were told?  Why did the HSE adopt such an aggressive legal position in the proceedings brought by Ms Phelan?  Why was the HSE agreeable to a confidentiality clause?  Does this not run entirely contrary to a culture of open disclosure?  How are we meant to learn how to make things better in health care if agreements like this are met hand-in-hand with gagging orders? <\/p><p>There are important questions to be answered too regarding the Department and the Government.  When did the Department become aware of Ms Phelan&rsquo;s case?  Was the Department aware that it took three years for Vicky Phelan to find out about the screening errors and that these had been kept from her?  Was the Department aware, or did it suspect, that this practice was more widespread than the individual case?  Why did it take so long for the Department to prepare a note on the case for the Minister? <\/p><p>There are also questions for the Minister to answer, following on from the note he gave today, and I acknowledge he has made that note available.  Did the Minister make any follow-up inquiries of his officials based on the content of the note?  That is one of the key questions we want to understand.  The note states that the case was being taken for two reasons, the first is the error in the 2011 screening, which is the responsibility of the US laboratory.  The second reason was the non-disclosure of the error, which is the responsibility of the HSE.  Did the Minister ask why this non-disclosure happened?  Did he ask how many other screening errors there might be?  Did he ask how many other non-disclosures there might be?  The note also states, &quot;The State Claims Agency is of the view that publicity around the case and\/or settlement is likely.&quot;  Should this not have prompted further questions and earlier action?  The Minister did act when he found out about the scale of the issue last Thursday, but if these questions had been asked of officials when the Minister was given the note, they would have alerted him to the wider issue, which would in turn have led to quicker action from the Minister and the Government and avoided several very difficult days of concern in this country and avoided a lot of fear and a lot of confusion.<\/p><p>A further question is whether the Minister could or, to be fair to him, should, have intervened to stop the court case?  I would like to quote Ms Phelan&rsquo;s lawyer who said the following: <\/p><blockquote>The entire court process could have been avoided.  We have heard Minister Harris confirm that he was made aware through an information note on this case on the 16th of April.  That's three days before the trial began.  <br \/><br \/>While he said ... that the one time a minister cannot intervene is during a court case.  If that is so, there wasn't a court case at that time.  There was nothing preventing him from asking further questions or directing those through the State Claims Agency or through the Department of Health to prevent steps being taken to force Vicky Phelan into court.  <\/blockquote><p>That is a question that Vicky Phelan's solicitor has asked.<\/p><p>Vicky Phelan describes what has happened to her as &quot;an appalling breach of trust&quot;.  <\/p><p>Many people across Ireland feel the same way.  I have been approached by constituents.  I imagine all Members have.  People are scared.  People are furious that this has happened.  That an error in diagnosis or in screening would have been spotted, that the State would have waited two full years to let anybody know of that error and that one's own doctor would then have engaged in correspondence with the State as to who should tell the patient is simply outrageous.  The danger is that this appalling breach of trust leads to a lack of confidence in screening, and that cannot happen.<\/p> <p> The screening programme introduced in 2008 has saved many lives.  I talked to a consultant last night who told me that he reckons 400 to 500 women's lives are saved every year thanks to the cervical screening programme, but if we are to maintain confidence and if we are to rebuild trust, then many serious changes are need.  Mandatory disclosure must be brought in quickly.  It should be in by now but it is not.  We must move to a culture of transparency.  The default option of the State seeking gagging orders where it settles with patients must be reviewed otherwise how else will we learn from the mistakes that are made.  Critically, a way must be found for the public to seek justice that does not incur such high legal fees that one could lose one's house.  We all know how this works.  Somebody goes to a solicitor and gets a legal team.  He or she potentially incurs very serious upfront costs.  We know how the State responds.  The State walks in with an army of lawyers.  The State walks in with senior counsel and junior counsel, solicitors and experts and it is the individual citizen against the State. That fear and threat of legal costs is used as a weapon against people in this State and it is an effective weapon.  Ms Phelan could have been excused for not risking all of that in dealing with everything that she did.  She decided to fight.  She decided to put everything on the line.  It is incumbent on us all to make sure that we take some serious steps on what will be a long and tough journey to ensuring that confidence and trust is rebuilt and that we begin to have an era of transparency and genuine openness in this country when it comes to people's health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100039#MM00300","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525200300,"counter":448,"content":"<p>At the outset, I commend the bravery of Ms Vicky Phelan.  Without her determination and fight, this scandal probably would never have come to light and those affected and their families may never have known the truth.<\/p>  <p>  Truth, compassion, and honesty should be evident at all levels of our health service, and even more so at the higher institutional levels of our screening programmes, our hospitals, and the HSE.  Nobody is saying for a moment that a health service can be run without human error but when a mistake is made, there should be an apology and the relevant parties must be informed.  The reality could not have been more different for Ms Phelan and those women affected by misdiagnosis or, indeed, for the potential considerable number of cases only notified to us this evening.<\/p>  <p>  The scale of the problem is still not known.  That is outrageous.  There are women who are watching this who are very concerned.  There are women who are watching us this evening who are not aware of their own medical records.  That is outrageous.<\/p>  <p>  When we look at what has happened, we see the response of the State was to fight a terminally ill woman and her family, to force her to give evidence in a courtroom, to talk about her personal life, her health and her sex life in a room full of strangers.  It was then to try to force that same woman into a confidentiality agreement so that she could not speak about what had happened.  That was the response of the State.  The response was for CervicalCheck to tell doctors treating women to exercise their judgment on whether to tell them about the misdiagnosis and to \"simply ensure the result is recorded\" if any of the women affected by this had died in the meantime.  It should not be at the whim of a doctor to exercise judgment in whether to inform a woman where her health is at risk, and even more so in the incidence of a misdiagnosis.  We have the right to know.<\/p>  <p>  Where we should have truth, compassion and honesty, we had malice, vindictiveness and dishonesty.  How did the scope for this dishonesty materialise?  Why is it not mandatory for the health service to disclose errors and to always tell the truth?<\/p>  <p>  We saw it in this House on 8 November 2017.  On a vote on Report Stage of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill 2017, the Government, in concert with Fianna F&aacute;il, which abstained, voted through amendment No. 31 which ensured that the process for open disclosure would be voluntary and not mandatory.  I welcome yet another U-turn on this issue and I hope that we will now see mandatory reporting - voluntary reporting is simply not good enough.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in opposed making it voluntary.  We voted to make it mandatory but we lost.<\/p>  <p>  A year earlier in a Joint Committee on Health debate on open disclosure, I argued forcefully for mandatory open disclosure.  Indeed, I argued for it again on Leaders' Questions with the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, on 21 February last in light of the case of Ms Alison McCormack, who had a breast cancer misdiagnosis.  The practice of keeping quiet when things go wrong is often prevalent in our medical culture and only a statutory duty of candour will address the situation.  I welcome that the need for mandatory open disclosure with legislative underpinning is now accepted right across this House but it should not take a scandal to achieve this.<\/p>  <p>  The gendered nature of this scandal is not lost on me, my friends, my daughter, my mother or any of the women who are affected by this.  In fact, many women who contacted me have said they are not surprised at the failures of the health service and the State as regards how it treats women.  The Minister described it as \"bizarre\".  No woman who has spoken to me about it has described it as bizarre.  Unfortunately, it seems to be par for the course.  We are not surprised at the gendered nature of this.<\/p>  <p>  Three times in the past six months I have taken Leaders' Questions and raised significant issues which solely affect women.  In November last, I raised the issue of the drug Epilim and the side effects for children born to women who took the drug while pregnant.  In January, I raised the transvaginal mesh scandal, and in February, I raised the case of misdiagnosis of breast cancer.  Men often talk about historic injustices perpetrated against women in this State but when we women talk about it, we talk in terms of the present day.  This scandal reinforces for women why we should be afraid of the gendered nature of our health service and how the State treats us.<\/p>  <p>  The outsourcing of women's healthcare through testing of smears in the United States was warned against in 2008.  Concerns were raised at that time by Dr. David Gibbons, the chair of the cytology-histology group within the quality assurance committee of the National Cervical Screening Programme.  I want to know whether complaints were made at that time to HIQA and how HIQA responded to those complaints because when we know that we will be able to judge whether HIQA is, indeed, the correct authority to undertake this investigation.  The then CEO of the National Cancer Screening Service, the outgoing head of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, insisted that it would be possible for doctors to talk to the person who analysed the smear test in the United States through teleconferencing.  There is no evidence that this happened and the Minister might be able confirm that for us.<\/p>  <p>  The then Sinn F&eacute;in health spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, criticised the 2008 decision of the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government to outsource the screening service during a D&aacute;il debate, stating: \"The Minister for Health and Children would rather listen to corporate executives in the private health business\".  The Deputy went on to state that the \"HSE has awarded the contract for cervical cancer tests to Quest Diagnostics, a US company that has an unacceptably high rate of errors and has been convicted of fraud.\"  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has been proved right and the issue of outsourcing must be incorporated into any investigation.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister must explain to this House if any concerns were raised with the Department of Health over the past ten years regarding the outsourcing of these tests and if any internal concerns were raised about the efficacy of the tests.  Were any audits carried out on the companies concerned and does Clinical Pathology Laboratories still hold a contract with the State for smear tests or any other screening or diagnostic work?<\/p><p>The Minister says he became aware of Ms Phelan&rsquo;s case on 17 April.  Was he aware of the audits from 2014 and subsequent analysis of the misdiagnosis which was continuing since 2017?  Tony O&rsquo;Brien has said he only found out about the issue when he heard of Vicky Phelan&rsquo;s case from the media.  I find it hard to believe the Minister only found out on 17 April but it is even harder to believe that Mr. O&rsquo;Brien found out from the media.  I do not see it as plausible.  The State was being sued for a substantial sum of money.  Surely the nature of the case and the cost involved would have sent alarm bells through the HSE, the Department of Health and up to the level of Government.  <\/p> <p> The Minister articulated his lack of confidence in the leadership of CervicalCheck last week.  It will be interesting to ascertain his confidence in Mr. O&rsquo;Brien and in his role in this scandal.  Maybe it is the case that their fortunes are inextricably intertwined and it might account for his reluctance to relieve him of his duties.  The general public would also welcome a statement from Eunice O'Raw, general counsel for the HSE, on the decision of the HSE to fight the case of Vicky Phelan and on what information was provided to Ms O&rsquo;Raw regarding the case by the HSE and what information she provided to the HSE and the Minister.<\/p> <p> The toxic culture of concealment and harassment pursued by the HSE and the Government against women who have been wronged by this State is now in full public view.  It is a disgrace that the State, the Government and the HSE consistently behave the way they do when such cases arise.  It is unacceptable that agents of the State pursue victims of their failures and do so in such an aggressive manner.  They behave this way because they take their cue from Government.  The Minister must ensure that other affected women are not forced to fight the State through the courts as Vicky Phelan and others have been made to do.<\/p> <p> I will finish by saying that in the course of my work before I was elected, I had occasion to represent people who were engaged in a dispute with the HSE.  I have seen how vicious and aggressive it is when it pursues people.  I have seen people's lives destroyed by the HSE, some by virtue of the fact they were whistleblowers and others by virtue of the fact that they found themselves on the wrong side of a reported incident and of which they were subsequently found innocent.  I have seen what the HSE and the machinery of the State is like when it goes up against an individual.  For that reason, I commend Vicky Phelan on what she has done.  She should not have had to do it.<\/p> <p> Nobody believes the health service can be run without error or risk but they demand that it will show compassion and be truthful and honest.  That is not what has happened to date.  The people deserve better than this.  Vicky Phelan deserves better than this.  The victims of misdiagnosis deserve better than this.  Not only do the women of the State deserve better, but we demand better than this.  I hope for the Minister's sake that he has the answers the women of Ireland seek this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100040#NN00200","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525200900,"counter":450,"content":"<p>Here we go again - Magdalen laundries, hepatitis C, Brigid McCole, Susie Long, Rebecca O'Malley, a neighbour of mine, Amanda Mellet, who I brought to meet the Minister, and now Vicky Phelan.  We have a real problem in this country protecting women's health.  This issue is on the Minister's watch.  He needs to do the right thing.  I join with thanking Vicky for her openness and for the way she has put herself in the public spotlight.  I am sure she is watching me speak now and is listening to all of us.  She has put herself in a very difficult situation out in the open and she is doing it for the betterment of women across Ireland.  We need to stand with her and deal with this issue on her behalf because of the bravery she has shown.<\/p>  <p>  The most important thing we need to deal with is the 208 affected women.  They need our protection and support, our endeavours and a health system that will support them.  Of the 208, 46 have been told, two of whom have passed away, and 162 are in the process of being told, 15 of whom have unfortunately passed away.  We need to deal with the bombshell the Minister has just landed tonight, which I was not prepared for.  We need to know the number of cases that have not been audited.  The Minister has not told us in his speech.  It is a bombshell.  What number of women have not had their cases audited?  Are they recent?  Here is the real issue.  If they are not recent, what was the basis for not selecting them in the first place from the national cancer register?  We will be having questions later, but these are fairly obvious questions and worrying times.  This is a very live issue for the people and the women of Ireland.  I hope the Minister will be able to answer that in detail because it is concerning.  If the Minister has that detail, he has not given it to the House.  The shake of his head indicates he does not have it.  We cannot get near the detail of this without that information.<\/p>  <p>  We all have a duty to ensure there is public confidence in the screening process for cervical cancer and in the other screening processes.  It is a duty we should all honour.  The screening process along with the HPV vaccine, which our party has pushed, are essential to prevent women getting cancers throughout their lives.  We all have a duty to ensure that confidence is maintained in these.<\/p>  <p>  I met with officials from the Minister's Department for an hour and 20 minutes recently.  What did his Department know about the issue?  What did it know about similar cases?  I accept what the Minister is saying, that he did not find out until 16 April.  Was no human being in the Department of Health aware of this case or any similar case or issue preceding that?  It is an answer the Minister will have to give.  The words that jump out of the memo are: \"The SCA is of the view that publicity around the case ... is likely.\"   I do not think this memo would have ever seen the light of day only for the potential publicity that would surround it which we all know now is causing serious issues and worry for women across Ireland.  It says a lot to me about the Department of Health.  It says a lot to me about the political culture.  It says a lot to me about the way in which we administer health in the country that this note was justified on the basis of the potential publicity.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCP has an awful lot of questions to answer.  In the briefing note, it says that they do not consider this to be a patient safety incident, which it is not credible.  It is not acceptable and it is deeply worrying.  That it would put in the memo to Government is far more worrying than the clinical director resigning.  I took the trouble this evening to  look up the governance of CervicalCheck.  We all know about the resignation of the clinical director.  She reported to the head of screening, an assistant national director.  What is his role in this?  Where is the accountability?  The people are sick to their back teeth of the lack of accountability.  He reports to the national director of the national cancer control programme.  What was his role in this and did he have knowledge of it?<\/p><p>Who reports to the recently appointed chief clinical officer who reports to the director general who we now know found out from RT&Eacute;?  Does it not say a lot that the Minister knew about this issue before the director general of the HSE did?  There has to be accountability for all of the layers.  I know that this lady resigned after the Minister had expressed no confidence, but does he have confidence in the structure, in the people in it, or was it just because of weak media performances somebody had to be chosen to go under a bus?<\/p> <p> The investigation cannot be led by HIQA.  With respect, I completely disagree with Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly.  If the Minister goes down this route, he will end up with a commission of investigation.  This is a national scandal and, for many reasons, HIQA is not the organisation to carry out the investigation.  It has powers to investigate, take documents, go into organisations and seize computers, etc. but under the legislation, it only has limited powers to do so in certain circumstances.  It has no powers whatsoever to compel the attendance of witnesses, direct a witness to answer questions or take sworn evidence.  Witnesses are given no immunity in giving their evidence.  Given what we now know about medical candour and the profession, does the Minister honestly think that unless the witnesses have to do so, they will give all of the information needed?  HIQA will not have the capacity to cross-examine personnel, which will mean that in many cases the evidence given will not be able to used in the making of findings.  I guarantee, for all of these reasons, that if the Minister, with Fianna F&aacute;il, pushes this through, we will be back in this House looking for a commission of inquiry because the public will demand it.  I ask the Minister to, please, listen to me, measure this appropriately and do the right thing because we will soon be back debating this issue.  HIQA does not have the powers to deliver.  I do not believe it even has the capacity or the resources to do so, even it is the right authority.  The Minister needs to change his mind in that regard.  <\/p> <p> We need to act quickly.  General practitioners, GPs, have not been given guidance on what to tell people.  We need to ensure the women of Ireland know where to go with their concerns and that when they go to GPs or other medical professionals, there will be a structure in place such that their concerns will be addressed.  We also need a guarantee that resources will be available to deal with far more inquiries which will be needed and that all those being screened will have their problems addressed, too.  The Minister needs to give a guarantee to the House that all of this is in place and that everyone will have the information they require.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100041#OO00200","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525201500,"counter":452,"content":"<p>On behalf of People before Profit, I salute Vicky Phelan, a national hero, and wish her the very best of solidarity in the struggle she faces so bravely.  We know some details of what happened, but we do not know enough.  The Minister is conducting an investigation, etc. but the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine has asked him to publish the results of the 2014 audit.  When will that happen?  It is very important to know. <\/p>  <p>  We know that what happened in 2014 was the result of a policy decision and its consequences were debated and well known in 2008.  I am sure all Members have read the Official Report of the debate at the time.  There were very articulate cases made to the then Minister, Mary Harney, and the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government against putting the service out to tender.  It did not have to be tendered for.  She said it had been put out to tender \"for reasons of transparency, fairness and equity to make sure it got the best quality assured service\" and that \"80% of points were allotted for quality and turnaround time and 20% for price\".  We had a political choice in 2008 to invest in several laboratories based in Irish hospitals, using Irish experts and training new scientists in the Irish public service.  As in many other cases, however, where we justify privatisation and outsourcing, we use the excuse that the system is in crisis, that there is a backlog, that it takes months to get a result and that we have to go to the wonderful private market.  We treated cervical cancer screening, a vital service on which tens of thousands of women rely and for which they understand the need, like every other service or good and organised a tendering competition for it, inviting firms from around the world to bid for it and awarded it to the lowest bidder.  That is the logic of the market in privatisation.  That was the action of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government, with Mary Harney, in 2008.  The justification was that market competition and private companies were better than publicly funded and run health services.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2008 very definite and reasoned arguments were made in this Chamber against foreign multinational control of this vital service.  Many of the arguments were made by the then Fine Gael health spokesperson, Senator James Reilly, and Deputy Jan O'Sullivan of the Labour Party.  Their arguments were sound and clear.  The firm that won the initial contract, Quest Diagnostic, had been found guilty of repeated episodes of fraud in overbilling; several studies found that the detection rate for higher grade pre-cancers was low, while we know from several sources in Ireland that there were severe and real problems in allowing a US firm such as this to provide screening for cancer.  Dr. Gibbons warned that cases would be missed if we outsourced to the United States.  The union which represents workers and scientists in laboratories warned that the outsourcing of smear test screening would mean that we would lose the ability and expertise to conduct such screening in this country.  Many experts, doctors, scientists and consultants in the field were shouting at Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party and Mary Harney that this was bad, that it would cause problems, that women would suffer and that cancer cases would be missed.  They were ignored and the political decision was made to pursue tendering and outsourcing.  A couple of years later the very people who had railed and shouted against it got into power.  When Fine Gael and the Labour Party were in power, Senator James Reilly did nothing as Minister for Health and the subsequent Minsters for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, now the Taoiseach, and Deputy Simon Harris, did nothing about the issue about which they were so worried.<\/p>  <p>  The policy of outsourcing has continued and today we are hearing defences from the Taoiseach, the Minister and the HSE on the basis that the problem was not outsourcing but something else and that these things happen.  One thing is clear: the privatisation of the health system is ideologically driven by the main parties in the D&aacute;il and in every area where it has been implemented people have suffered, continue to suffer and, worse in this case, women have died and will die as a result.  We have no faith or belief the Government can address this crisis.  It might succeed in pinning the blame on something else, but the scandal is political and involves the political choices made by various Ministers and those in power.  If the Minister was a bus driver and crashed and killed 17 people, or even one person, he would be sanctioned by his employer and before the courts.  Heads have to roll in this D&aacute;il for what has happened.  It is not good enough to pass the buck.  \"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark\" and, ultimately, somebody will have to take responsibility and take the consequences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100042#PP00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1525202100,"counter":453,"content":"<p>We have a very patronising attitude to women in this society, as evidenced by the outrageous treatment of the women involved in this case, a paternalistic attitude among doctors to women, and a refusal to allow full disclosure to patients.  I want to speak about an issue which some of the parties in this D&aacute;il do not seem to be interested in, namely, privatisation, which has led to this situation.  The outsourcing of cervical smear tests in 2008 was part of the privatisation of health services.  A critically important part of health services for women was starved of funding and resources.  A HSE recruitment ban meant test backlogs inevitably built up and outsourcing became the solution.  This is the way in which privatisation is usually forced through.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals must account for themselves but the majority of parties in this D&aacute;il also must account for themselves.  In 2008, the then Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, was warned by senior people that private testing would be less rigorous and unsuitable for a three to five year frequency, that detection rates on tests carried out by Quest Diagnostics would be lower, at 85% versus 95% in the Irish laboratories, and that Quest Diagnostics had been fined $40 million for fraud and false claims.  In response, Mary Harney and the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government opted for value for money and we got the worst of both worlds, with less frequent and low-quality testing leading us to where we are today.  Dr. David Gibbons should be heroically saluted for warning about this ten years ago.  How prophetic was what he said.  It is likewise with Sam Coulter-Smith.  The Rotunda Hospital had a world-class testing service and the majority of parties in this D&aacute;il opted for testing on the cheap.<\/p>  <p>  Profiting from health had been good value for Quest Diagnostics.  Only two weeks ago, it reported revenue of almost &euro;8 billion and profits of more than &euro;1 billion in 2017.  It is a company that carries out 80 to 100 smear tests per staff member per day when a maximum of 50 per day is the National Health Service recommended rate.  In Ireland, 30 to 35 tests was the norm but nothing happened.  The unusually low percentage of negative results was highlighted but nothing happened.  The former Minister for Health and Children, James Reilly, and the then parties in power also did nothing.  The test results never reached the 1.8 average which is international best practice, the reason being that the system chosen was not as good as that which pertained in the US never mind in Ireland.  This outsourced service was retendered in 2010, 2012 and 2016 but no action was taken by those who were Ministers for Health and Children during that time, including Mary Coughlan and James Reilly.  Despite the warning issued by James Reilly to Mary Harney in 2008, he chose not to act.  The former Minister for Health and now Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and current Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, also have questions to answer in regard to why they did nothing about the low rate of results.  There were many debates in this House on the national screening programme down through the years but the nothing was done because the Government does not support public health services.  It continues to underfund them and to look for the next privatisation opportunity.  Thanks to this State, MedLab, the company which Vicky Phelan had to sue, has the contract for the privatised bowel screening programme.  Does the Minister propose to do anything about this?<\/p>  <p>  The brutal treatment of Brigid McCole by Deputy Michael Noonan was eventually exposed.  Despite all of the solemn undertakings, we now learn about the appalling treatment of the women in this case.  What will be the next catastrophic failure of privatisation in this country?  Will it be the privatised bowel screening programme?  Will the Minister stop cutting corners on women's health and return to a nationalised public testing laboratory system that is adequately staffed and carries out deep screenings?  The Minister said in his speech that a further tendering process will take place for testing carried out outside of the public system.  Following on from the platitudes we have heard today, this D&aacute;il must ensure that the testing system is returned to public ownership and adequately funded and staffed.  It is unbelievable that we do not have two pairs of eyes on every test result, as is standard in other countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100043#QQ00100","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1525202100,"counter":454,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Clare Daly, who is sharing time with Deputy Connolly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100043#QQ00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1525202100,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Mistakes happen no matter what systems are in place.  Tragedies happen and they will continue to happen, but the issue facing us as a society is how we respond to those mistakes and tragedies, how we treat the victims of those mistakes and tragedies and whether we learn the lessons.  I find the shock and horror expressed in some quarters a little hard to take.  The saddest thing about this latest scandal is that it is just the latest one.  It is not new to see the State Claims Agency taking people to war.  It has been doing this for a long time.  It is not new that the HSE drip-feeds information.  Even tonight, the Minister has been put in the unenviable position of coming in here with new information.  The Minister is continually being drip-fed and having to clarify information.  We need to get to the heart of what is going on.  This is the only way that we will serve Vicky Phelan and all of the other victims of our appalling health service.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister correctly said that this issue puts the spotlight on our open disclosure policy, which has been in place since 2013.  It has been a policy of the HSE since 2008 that all instances should be disclosed, which is coincidental timing in terms of this issue, but it is long known that this is not the case and that what we have had is not enough.  This was known in 2015 when we questioned the then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, on why there had not been a mandatory duty of candour inserted into medical contracts and why, given the weekly medical negligence claims and legal fees, a failure to disclose was not a criminal offence and so on.<\/p>  <p>  It was obvious in the discussions last year around the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill that there was a problem with open disclosure.  Lest anyone is confused, this is only about indemnifying doctors and nurses.  This is not an open disclosure policy, it is legal cover.  We made the arguments at the Committee on Health and Fianna F&aacute;il was swayed by those arguments and came on board.  What happened next?  I got more attention from the HSE than I have got in my life.  Over the summer, there were emergency calls and meetings arranged with the chief medical officer, all to tell us that we were wrong about our amendments.  We had a meeting with the Department of Health and the HSE in which we asked for the evidence to support their argument and we were told that making open disclosure mandatory would make it less rather than more likely that open disclosure would happen.  This was the line put forward by the Department of Health and the chief medical officer, the same line that was given to the then Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, when he came before the health committee in 2015 and argued for mandatory disclosure.  In my opinion, he genuinely put forward that view.  He made the point as a doctor that failing to live up to a duty of candour was the equivalent of a motoring hit-and-run.  He was fully signed up to mandatory open disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  The health committee, having heard from several stakeholders which said that mandatory open disclosure was necessary, did not recommend it.  What happened?  The arguments were made, the science and international evidence was produced and previous Ministers, Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues and others supported mandatory open disclosure, yet behind the scenes the HSE went to work and put out the argument that it was not the best way forward.  The HSE can dress it up whatever they like, but at the heart of that dressing up is a fear of litigation.  The HSE tells Ministers that this and that cannot be done because it will cost the State money.  It is symptomatic of problems in that organisation.  It gives me no pleasure to say, \"We told you so\".  We stand over the arguments we made last year.  Sadly, if they had been incorporated in the legislation, we would be further down the road and not moving after the horse has bolted.<\/p>  <p>  I am open to a HIQA inquiry in the sense that HIQA is good, but I echo the point that it is limited in its scope to an extent.  I think we have to go further.  In 1987, the New Zealand Government ordered a full-scale independent judicial inquiry into the deaths of 26 women who died in the 1970s and 1980s from cervical cancer, again a national scandal.  This inquiry was an independent inquiry along the lines of the Commission on Nursing in this State, which is what we need if we are to get to the root of this and get to the heart of way in which women's health and reproductive issues are dealt with, or rather are not dealt with, in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100043#QQ00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1525202700,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Not too long ago I praised the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, for his speech on the eighth amendment.  I warned the Minister that night that I would not be praising him permanently and I certainly do not praise him tonight.  The Minister's speech tonight is more of a spin than an elucidation of what has happened.  Reference was made to Brigid McCole who died in October 1996, just over 21 years ago.  There has been time to reason and learn from that.  At that time the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, acting for then Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan, warned Positive Action that unless it went quietly to the compensation tribunal it would face \"uncertainties, delays, stresses, confrontation and costs,\" and so on.  The State pursued Brigid McCole almost right up to the day of her death.  It said she had tried to sue under a pseudonym in order to keep her privacy.  The State also fought that.  I do not have to time to go into the details but we could see the full power of the State coming down on the body of a woman, Brigid McCole, and her family.  Here we are 22 years later with the same type of spin.<\/p>  <p>  The Brigid McCole case was absolute bullying but what is coming across now is more of a patronising attitude that \"we know best\".  As a woman, I do not want reassurance.  I do not believe that the women of Ireland want reassurance.  They would like full information so they can make up their minds on what screening they will access.  With regard to this specific issue, the women who are affected need full information.  The Minister told the House tonight that information is \"emerging\" as we speak.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has given Members a copy of a note in regard to the briefing memo.  The Minister's speech has a mistake in it.  On page 2 of the speech, the Minister refers to the note which said that the claim against the HSE was likely to fail or be \"dropped in the absence of any bad faith\".  That is not accurate.  The note had referred to exemplary damages and the advice from the State Claims Agency that the exemplary damages might not succeed because of lack of faith, not that the case would be dropped.  The note also mentions that there was no chance of the case settling because - I believe very bravely - the woman in question would not accept a confidentiality clause.  The lab had said that it absolutely had to have a confidentiality clause.  Deputy Alan Kelly has already referred to the extraordinary aspect that the National Screening Service and Mr. Jerome Coffey, the head of the National Cancer Control Programme had advised the Department in writing that this was not a \"patient safety incident\".  Perhaps the Minister will explain how anybody could possibly say this was not a patient safety incident.<\/p>  <p>  There is so little time.  I do not believe a HIQA investigation is the answer.  There are so many questions and to say that HIQA is the answer is certainly, at the very least, premature.  We need to establish the full facts and reports on how many women have not been contacted.  It is not good enough for the Minister to come to the House tonight to tell us that facts are \"emerging\".<\/p>  <p>  I received an email from a person who pointed out that a smear test in 2012 had a result that was interpreted wrongly, or a wrong result given.  This happened on two different occasions and radical surgery ensued in August 2015.  I understand that this person wrote to the head of the screening programme, but no reply was received.<\/p>  <p>  How many letters have been sent by women throughout the State that have not been replied to?  What other legal proceedings have been instituted, settled or are still pending?  How many cases have been settled with confidentiality clauses because the women had to cave in given their circumstances?  At the very least, all this information should be before the House tonight.<\/p>  <p>  It is extremely worrying to me as a woman when I have heard language being used on the radio over the last week or two, which seeks to reassure us.  Reassurance cannot, and should not, be given.  That is not our role at this point nor is it the Government's.  It is the Government's role to give full information and to set up a proper, independent inquiry that, with full information, will give some trust back to the women who have been affected and to the women of Ireland.  I do not want any platitudes nor do the women who are writing to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100044#RR00100","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1525202700,"counter":457,"content":"<p>It is extremely important that women, not the process of investigation, remain the focus in this regard.  While the process is important women should remain the focus.  Population health screening is an important part of our health service, and none more so than cervical screening.  Confidence must be restored in the cervical cancer screening programme because this programme has identified 1,482 cases of cancer over the past ten years.  The majority of those cases have been identified by the cervical screening programme.  Many thousands of pre-cancerous changes have also been identified, preventing people from developing cancer and preventing the progression of cancer in some people.  The importance of the scheme is without doubt.  Hundreds of thousands of consultations take place in general practice each year where sexual health is the subject of the consultation when people attend for screening.  This is also very important.  There are many aspects of the screening programme that must be maintained and confidence in the programme must be restored.<\/p>  <p>  The cervical cancer screening programme works for the vast majority of women in Ireland who engage on a regular three-yearly cervical screening smear.  The regularity is essential - one smear is a case in point.  If a woman has a regular smear it adds to the value of those smears.<\/p>  <p>  Like all screening programmes, cervical screening has its limitations and false negatives will arise no matter what the screening programme is.  These must be kept to a minimum by having a double reading, by having high-quality screening laboratories and by upskilling those who perform the screening.  This will keep mistakes to a minimum.<\/p>  <p>  This scandal is what transpires when mistakes are identified but the information is not transmitted.  This is the core issue.  The failure of open disclosure of false negatives to patients is unforgivable, and there may be additional false negatives now because we are hearing that not all cases have been audited.  It is true that disclosure would not have affected the treatment of these patients' cancer but that is not the point.  Disclosure would have helped the women to deal with their illness.  It would have provided them with knowledge and it would have given them the opportunity to take legal action if they felt they had been damaged or injured by the process and if they wished to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The issue now is that the process has trumped the patient.  This is so often the case in many health scandals; the process becomes much more important than the patient.  Governance and poor judgment are the key to this.  Such paternalistic attitudes towards transmitting information have to be eradicated from our health service.  In one sense Vicky Phelan was lucky in that she had the capacity, the will and the knowledge to pursue her case.  Many of the patients whose false negative results were not transmitted to them have not had that opportunity.  This scandal has arisen by not disclosing these issues for fear that the cervical screening programme had something to hide and by not being upfront and honest.  Being upfront and honest, admitting that a mistake had been made and transmitting the knowledge would have empowered the programme and the patient.  Admitting a mistake is very empowering for the person who admits it but it is also empowering to the patient who receives the information.  By not disclosing these issues we now have the current scandal and the lack of confidence in the cervical screening programme.  Quite often it is the cover-up of the issue that attracts the attention rather than the original mistake.  We have to recognise that it is most likely that the cervical screening programme did not wish to reveal the false negatives for fear of litigation, but now we are in midst of this scandal.  Open disclosure is the only way to go and mandatory open disclosure is extremely important.<\/p><p>We have to engage in a root-and-branch review of the cervical cancer screening programme.  We have to review outsourcing, the frequency and quality of testing, the governance of the cervical screening programme, the responsibility, and the transparency in it.  We have to review open disclosure and have mandatory disclosure.  We have to review compensation and try to restore credibility in the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100044#RR00200","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525203300,"counter":459,"content":"<p>Here we are again, debating once more the chronic and apparently unresolvable dysfunction within both the HSE and sections of the health service.  We know that at least 17 women have died.  We also know that this is far from the end of the matter and that in all likelihood, as time goes on, more women and families will emerge.  Children will be and have been robbed of their mothers' precious love.  Young girls and boys will now grow up with no mother to share their concerns and their hopes and dreams.  It is an appalling dereliction of care and a catastrophic failure that is making the people of this country sick to the core.  The infuriating thing about this is that we never seem to learn our lessons sufficiently well from the previous debacle and mistakes.  We all lament the deaths of these women.  We all praise and support the courage of Vicky Phelan and her husband and children, who are now enduring a living hell.  I salute Mr. Cian O'Carroll, a solicitor from Cashel, too.<\/p><p>All of this was brought to light out of the murky shadows of legal wrangling by a mother who was determined to find answers and to have accountability, on her own.  If Vicky had not done this, would we still be living in blissful ignorance of the shocking failures of oversight and governance that have brought us to this situation?  I say that we would.  The Taoiseach had the gall to say today that we should not call for the head of Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, head of the HSE, because, the Taoiseach said, &quot;everyone deserves a fair hearing&quot;.  My goodness.  How many fair hearings must Mr. O'Brien get before he is sacked?  What fair hearings have the unfortunate ladies who have died, and their families, got?  That is arrogance of the highest order.  What about fair hearings and fair procedures for the women and families caught up in this sickening spectacle?<\/p><p>Last week I criticised Uisce &Eacute;ireann on another matter by saying that it had displayed institutional arrogance.  The very same could be said of the HSE.  This is institutional arrogance and indeed political arrogance on the most horrifying scale.  What hope can any of us place in such a body as the HSE, the most senior management of which seem indifferent to the realities of human life and whose first response is to ring for the barristers at the first hint of trouble.  It is continuous and the barristers are creaming it all the way.  The person or persons involved are then bombarded with legal challenges and intimidated further, adding to already existing stress.  Where is the shame then?  Where is the mock rage or sense of outrage then, when we do this daily?  I salute the extraordinary courage of Vicky Phelan and all those women and families who have been dragged unwillingly into a scandal of enormous dimensions.  Agencies of the State have robbed them of peace and subjected them to an horrific ordeal.<\/p><p>At the very least it is a scandal which demands the resignation of Mr. O'Brien and the Minister, Deputy Harris.  The Minister is the head.  As I said earlier today, the governance structure of the HSE is absolutely clear.  The buck stops with the Minister, Deputy Harris, as the person who has overall responsibility for the leadership of those who direct and control its functions and who manage its business.  In light of that, it is completely unsatisfactory for the calls for resignations to be reserved to Mr. O'Brien, the CEO, whom the Minister defended here recently, saying he was right to call parents emotional terrorists.  I called the Minister a puppet of the HSE that day, and he is still a puppet.  This is disgraceful and the Minister must go.  Any objective observer who analyses the Minister's stewardship of the health service can only conclude that he has been an unmitigated disaster.  There are record levels of patients on trolleys, chronic lack of bed capacity, a recruitment and retention policy of front-line staff that has had abysmal outcomes and last but not least a systemically dysfunctional HSE that has caused dozens of lives to be lost.  What on earth will it take for the Minister to be sacked or to resign?  Has he no shame?  Look at Theresa May's Government.  She has lost four Ministers in a short time and nobody died.  This is manslaughter at least.  The garda&iacute; in any other country would be out arresting people and charging them with manslaughter or worse.  This is shameful.  It is wilful destruction of people's lives and families, perpetrated by the HSE <i>ad nauseam<\/i>.  The Minister came to Cashel with me and looked at pristine new building which was empty.  This is outrageous.  The Minister has to open it and put beds in it.  There is still not a bed in it.  The Minister has no say whatsoever in the HSE so he should stand aside and let in someone who can stand up and do the job.  The Minister is clearly unable, unfit and unwilling to do it.  Shame on the Minister and on his colleagues.  He must go now and bring Mr. O'Brien with him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100045#SS00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1525203300,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Eamon Ryan and Seamus Healy.  I pay tribute to Vicky Phelan, who has done this State some service.  We know something of this scandal that is unfolding because of her determination and courage.  Thanks to her bravery and refusal to sign a confidentiality clause, we are now beginning to find out just what happened behind this whole debacle.  Had it not been for that, we might not have known anything about this.  We were very lucky that Vicky Phelan is the brave person that she is.  This may all have been hidden behind a court case and confidentiality clause.<\/p>  <p>  The priority in all of this has to be the women concerned.  We have to ensure that everything possible can be done for them.  It has not been done up to now but at this point the Minister has to give an absolute commitment that everything possible will be done for those women in the provision of whatever health services and supports are required.  There is also a requirement that the Minister give a commitment that the State will not contest any cases that are in process or that might arise as a result of this scandal.  There can be no question of the State pursuing any of these women in the aggressive manner that we saw displayed with Vicky Phelan and many other cases through the years.  That has to be a priority.<\/p>  <p>  The other priority has to be all of those women who are now so nervous and are wondering if they will get a phone call.  For that reason, I think there was mishandling of this in recent days.  The information that was available to the Minister and HSE was not made available and huge uncertainty was allowed to develop over many days.  The Minister has made a shocking disclosure to us tonight, that there is a potentially considerable additional number of women who are not subject to audit and we do not have any information about them.  It is not acceptable to put all of this into an inquiry where we may or may not get answers in 12 months or longer.  Experience with other inquiries and tribunals is that we have been told that an issue is all a matter for an inquiry or tribunal.  That is not good enough in this case.  We have to get answers now, not in 12 months.  The Minister needs to come into this House in a matter of days when he has further information about that shocking disclosure that he made tonight.<\/p>  <p>  There is a fundamental question at the heart of this issue, about how it is that an audit was carried out, not acted on, why there was such a long delay in notifying the clinicians' concern and, more importantly, why there was such a delay or utter failure to notify the women concerned.  We need to know what policy is being pursued.  Is the Minister still talking about a situation that is utterly paternalistic where women are kept in the dark?  Will the Minister clarify that for us?  What is the policy in that respect now?  Will the Minister clarify, with regard to the duty of candour, when action will be taken and when the medical and legal professions will be faced down in this regard?  We have no more time to waste with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100045#SS00300","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1525203900,"counter":461,"content":"<p>We owe it to Vicky Phelan, her family and her courage and honesty to correctly set up a means through which to find out what happened, who was responsible, and how we can avoid it happening again.  I have listened to various views expressed in that regard.  I have a concern about the view that we should opt for a commission of inquiry because all Members know that in spite of constant promises to the contrary such inquiries take years and always have, which would not be in the interests of families caught up in this scandal.  I agree with Deputy Clare Daly that perhaps a way to approach this would be to immediately instigate an inquiry by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and set up a wider commission which would investigate how to create a patient-centred healthcare system and would consider the key issue of how to avoid a recurrence of what the Minister referred to as the paternalistic approach to medicine displayed in this case.  That commission would be key because the scale of the change we must make is huge.<\/p>  <p>  Any inquiry should begin with the question of what happened in 2008.  There was a clear D&aacute;il debate on the issue at the time.  Dr. David Gibbons and Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith have made clear that at the time they placed on the record real concerns with the policy approach that was taken.  I have asked colleagues and friends who were then in Government to recall the Government internal mechanisms around the issue.  To the best of our recollection, it was not a contentious issue.  Whether it was motivated by a desire to scale up the number of cervical smear tests in order to save lives or, as some have argued, an attempt to save money by contracting out that service must be investigated.  I have no recollection of it being the latter rather than the former.<\/p>  <p>  Neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister in his statement addressed the argument of Dr. David Gibbons which I heard yesterday that the divergence between an annual versus a three year screening system may have been the cause of some of the problems.  Although that question may have been answered elsewhere, I hope it will be answered here this evening.  The Taoiseach clearly stated that there does not appear to be a difference between the various screening processes being used in terms of the level of accuracy and so on but we must have more detail on that issue.<\/p>  <p>  We must have answers to key questions, such as who was involved in the 162 of 208 cases in which the information was not passed on and the reason for that.  Which clinicians were involved?  Who was responsible for that lack of disclosure?  The most numbing and frightening effect for everyone involved in the Irish health system is the question mark over whether a patient can trust that he or she is being told the right thing.  We must have further details on that issue.<\/p>  <p>  I listened with interest today to Members I respect and who have much experience in this area, and from them I heard the common theme that the lack of candour or disclosure may have been due to a fear of litigation.  That brings me back to the wider commission of inquiry.  I raised earlier with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, who answered my question on promised legislation, the issue of whether there are plans to move away from a legally based system to a no-fault medical liability system.  As Deputy Shortall and others stated, we must ensure that everyone involved in this process of inquiry will not be shut down by the fear of legal action.  How can that be done without a shift away from the current system?  As the Taoiseach stated earlier, there always will be a small percentage of false negatives or false positives.  Given that is the case, surely it would be better for us to move away from this being a legal process towards admitting fault, helping patients and being patient-centred in what we do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100046#TT00100","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1525203900,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I commend the bravery and determination of Vicky Phelan.

The scandal is the result of a toxic culture of dishonesty, cover up and concealment.  It is a profound ethical failure and an appalling breach of trust.  What is worse is that this policy of deliberate deceit was signed off on and agreed by the senior management of CervicalCheck.  It was not the decision of an individual.  The policy agreed by that committee deprived women of their absolute entitlement to know their medical conditions.  It was also fraudulent because it deprived women of their entitlement to claim compensation if they so wished.<\/p>  <p>  We must have accountability.

There is a great deal of public confusion, fear and anger on this issue.  Women have asked me if they might get a phone call to tell them the caller is very sorry but the woman has cervical cancer.  We know that is not the case and that the women who will be contacted have been already diagnosed with cancer.  However, it gives an indication of the level of fear out there.  I acknowledge the Minister coming to the Chamber and sharing the information as he did before a carefully-crafted response on the issue was prepared but I wish to get into the detail of it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister stated, \"While CervicalCheck has audited all cases notified to it, I have been informed that a potentially considerable number of cases will not have been subjected to an audit of their screening history.\"  CervicalCheck carried out an audit in the case of 1,482 women who had been diagnosed with cervical cancer and a review was warranted in 442 of those cases.  Some 208 false negatives were discovered and 162 of the women affected by those findings were not told of them.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of trying to understand how many more cases might be out there, a total of 2,100 cases are recorded on the registry between 2008 and 2014.  Assuming there were approximately 250 new cases per year - it used to be approximately 300 but has decreased - for 2015 to 2017, inclusive, and 2018 to date would total approximately 900 additional cases.  Therefore, from 2008 until now there have been approximately 3,000 cases.  CervicalCheck stated it has been informed in approximately 1,500 cases but a back of the envelope calculation suggests there may be approximately double that number.  I appreciate it may be unfair to throw numbers at the Minister in this manner and I am not trying to catch him out but does he have a sense whether we are talking about a few more cases, double the number or many times more?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100046#TT00400","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1525203900,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Donnelly for his important question.

I had been told, and I believe most Members of this House would have understood, that CervicalCheck was notified of all cases of cervical cancer by the national cancer registry.  I have said to this House consistently that CervicalCheck has audited all cases of cervical cancer of which it is aware.  That is true, but what is now emerging is that there are cases of cervical cancer known by the national cancer registry that are not known by CervicalCheck.  This has literally come to light from the serious incident management team's work.  That is the team we sent in to CervicalCheck to get to the bottom of all these issues on Friday.  I do not want to put out specific figures because, quite frankly, I do not know them but the figures Deputy Donnelly has presented sound about right based on my knowledge of the prevalence of cervical cancer in this country on a yearly basis.  However, that comes with a major caveat that I have not been given any figure in regard to the number.<\/p>  <p>  I need to say, however, because Deputy Donnelly's point about not causing unnecessary fear and concern above the level that is understandably already there is important, that these are women who know they have cancer.  The State does not have an audit or a file on them it has not shared with them but because they were never passed on to CervicalCheck or were never with CervicalCheck, they were never subject to the clinical audit to which cases like Vicky Phelan's or others would have been subjected.

I am very happy to offer Fianna F&aacute;il's support or co-operation if it is of any use, but I believe there needs to be clearer communication in terms of the exact points we are discussing now because, strange as we may find it, not everyone in the country is listening to the D&aacute;il debates.

I am asking these questions because it is our constitutional role to hold the Minister to account, and we need to know what happened from his perspective when he got the note.  The note references non-disclosures, the screening errors and that publicity is likely.  I acknowledge there was nothing in the note to tell the Minister that there were numerous cases and that there was a much bigger issue coming down.  That was not in the note, but I put it to him that there were several things in the note which could reasonably have led him to ask more questions, and maybe he did that.  My question is: further to the note, did the Minister make further inquiries as to the scale of this?  On Vicky Phelan's lawyer's charge, did he seek advice as to whether the State Claims Agency should be instructed to pull back from the situation?

Guidance for general practitioners, GPs, on how to deal with the issue of repeat smears and women who are coming into their clinics, of which I believe there are many, for understandable reasons, asking if they should get a repeat smear test or if their smear will be reassessed will issue this week.  Dr. David Hanlon, the Health Service Executive's clinical adviser on general practice, is working with the GP representative organisations on that as well.<\/p><p>I met the Irish Cancer Society today and it had some very constructive suggestions as to what we could do to help provide information to women.

It can be a very important conduit in terms of providing information to cancer patients throughout the country and to their families.<\/p><p>Deputy Donnelly asks a perfectly legitimate question that I should be asked, that I am happy to be asked and that this House has an obligation to ask, namely, what I did when I got the note.  I received this information note, which I have published with only personal details of the individual redacted, on my Department's website.  I received it just before 7 p.m. on the evening of Monday, 16 April.  I was in a meeting with the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, at the time.  I then had a meeting of Fine Gael Ministers and Ministers of State later that evening, Cabinet the next morning and pre-Cabinet from 8.30 a.m.  I suspect I read the note around Tuesday afternoon.  As the Deputy knows, the case was on the Wednesday or Thursday of that week.  I read it about the Tuesday afternoon, so a huge period of time had not elapsed.  That is an important point to make.  I was not sitting on a note nor did I have a note and days or weeks elapsed.<\/p><p>I read the note, and I have read it thousands of times since, as the Deputy can imagine, because when one reads the note now one reads it very differently from how I read it then.  I read the note as stating that an individual patient was taking a case against a laboratory and against the HSE.  Rightly or wrongly, I read it that the case against the HSE was likely to be dropped.  I specifically read the line that &quot;[i]n its view the case is likely to be settled shortly before going to court&quot;, never expecting this issue would go to court.  Regarding the section on clinical audit, I read it that all historical and current audits had been given to clinicians for communication onwards to patients.  If I read the note now, in the light of what I know, one would read it differently but I did not know about other cases.  I did not know about Dr. Flannelly's correspondence.  I did not even know what is emerging this evening.  I read the note as an information note to me, of which I get very many as a Minister, and not in the context of receiving a note today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100047#UU00400","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1525204500,"counter":470,"content":"<p>On the same question, and I appreciate we are all pressed on time, can we take it there was no follow-up from the Minister at the time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100047#UU00500","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1525204500,"counter":471,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100047#UU00600","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1525204500,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  The final question I want to ask is around this conspiracy of silence because this is not an isolated case of one official or one doctor.  The HSE has a 300 page policy document on open disclosure and yet what we have here is evidence of widespread and, I would argue, systematic withholding of patient information.  We know there is a circular stating that doctors should exercise their judgment.  We know that before 2015 there was no policy of even telling the doctors and that that decision was only taken in 2015.  We know that in 13 different hospitals, doctors did not tell their patients.  We know that Vicky Phelan's doctor got into correspondence with the HSE and CervicalCheck about who had responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth pointing out that Ms Phelan made the point in an interview that when she was told, she was told there was a query.  Perhaps she was being told in an open and forthright manner.  We are in no position to judge.  We are not privy to that conversation but Ms Phelan's assertion was that even when she was told, she did not register what she was being told.  She used the word \"query\".  She was told there had been a query.  It was only when she was handed her own patient notes and was sitting in a waiting room that she discovered what was meant by \"query\" was that there was an error in her screening in 2011, which is very different from a query.<\/p>  <p>  At this point, what does the Minister know in terms of who knew about this?  The question Ms Phelan has asked is who knew what, and who decided what?  I know this is early days but in terms of the HSE, we know that a senior official within the Limerick hospitals group was brought into the dispute between the doctor and CervicalCheck.  We know that was escalated to the head of acute hospitals for the entire HSE.  At a very senior level within the HSE, therefore, at least one person knew.  Does the Minister have a sense now of how widespread was the knowledge within the HSE?<\/p><p>Does the Minister have a sense of whether the Department was aware not specifically of Ms Phelan's case because we know that it was but of the suppression or even withholding of information from patients like Ms Phelan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100047#UU00700","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525205100,"counter":474,"content":"<p>What I have learned in recent days is that the only thing I can say with absolute 100% certainty is what I know.  That is why I want to have a statutory inquiry to establish the exact answers to the Deputy's very important questions about who knew what, when and where.  As the Deputy can imagine, in recent days and since last week I have spoken extensively with my departmental officials.  I am very clear that they have informed me that they had no knowledge of a suppression of information or certainly anything that emerged in the national media through the discovery documents presented in Vicky Phelan's case.  My officials will be before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and, rightly, should be asked questions about this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy makes an interesting point.  A clinical audit is really good.  If one is the Minister for any Department and one hears that there is to be a clinical audit or audits, one welcomes it because a clinical audit is good.

What is even worse is that we now know that for many doctors there was not even an exchange of correspondence.  Information was simply put on file, with the paternalistic view that Ms X or Ms Y did not actually need to know the information.  We need a statutory review.  Of course, we expect doctors to exercise their judgment, but I would certainly expect doctors with any information on my health or my health files to tell me.  That did not happen and it points to the need for this House to take very practical action on the issue of mandatory open disclosure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100048#VV00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1525205100,"counter":475,"content":"<p>On page 2 of the memo published it is stated the \"National Screening Service and Jerome Coffey, Head of the National Cancer Control Programme, have advised the Department in writing that they do not consider this to be a patient safety incident\".

It is absolutely outrageous that the NCCP would not consider it to be a patient safety incident.  The memo was prepared for the Minister.  I ask him to let me and everyone else listening know whether he regards it as a patient safety incident.  Does he regard it as something that should have that tag?

The fact that ten days elapsed is a source of serious concern.  The Minister received the note and then read it the next day.  As the Department had had it for ten days, 11 days had elapsed at that stage.  At any stage did the Minister ask if there were more women involved?  Did he ask if it was symptomatic of a wider problem within the health service?  In that regard, to be fair, the Minister has shared the information he had with the House.  He is correct in suggesting there would be uproar if he had not done so.  I fully appreciate that, but officials had all weekend to review it and we still cannot say with certainty what the numbers are.  The Minister is making his best guess and Deputy Stephen S.

When a cytologist who gave evidence to the HIQA inquiry into the case of Ms Rebecca O'Malley raised queries about the inferiority of the US screening, the chair of the inquiry advised him that the terms of reference of the inquiry did not allow it to consider this aspect of the matter.  He said that the question of outsourcing was outside the scope of the inquiry, but he offered to make a note of it.  As a woman who uses that service, I am absolutely reassured when I hear that someone made a note of this somewhere.  How many audits were carried out regarding these outsourced companies?  How regularly were they carried out?  How many of the teleconferences on which Mr. O'Brien has advised he relies for the exchange of information actually took place?  At what level did they take place?  Who was talking to whom?<\/p>  <p>  Have the contracts for outsourced smear testing been renewed since 2011?  Does the company, Clinical Pathology Laboratories, still hold a contract with the State for smear tests or for any other diagnostic work?  I think this is an extremely important question.  It appears from what happened in the HIQA inquiry I have mentioned that it will be precluded from looking at outsourcing.  If so, that inquiry will be deficient from the very beginning.  I am not alone in expressing the view - it has been expressed by clinicians - that the decision to outsource this service is at the root of this problem.  The then Minister for Health and Children in the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government of the time, Mary Harney, was quite prepared to say she believed the savings were in the magnitude of one third.  Mr. O'Brien would not comment on the cost of it at the time.  I voiced my opposition to it at the time.  At no stage do I recall anyone relying on quality or other evidence.  The then Minister was very quick to point out that we would be getting it cheap.  As we know, if one buys cheaply, one will pay twice.  I would be interested to know about the scale of the audit.  Were any concerns raised?  When the cytologist who was giving evidence to the Rebecca O'Malley inquiry advised that the tests in the US were inferior, was that flagged?<\/p>  <p>  I would like to go back to the note that was received by the Minister.  He has said it would be normal for him to get a formal note as a ministerial briefing.  He has pointed out that he gets many emails and I am sure that is the case.  Does he not think officials in his Department should have flagged this up to him as important?  From the moment they knew about it, they should have been asking questions about how many people were going to be involved in it.

I have heard the Deputy saying that as well.  It is more useful if I say a few sentences before she comes back in.

I do not believe the Deputy intends to do that.  She has been very responsible in regard to all of this.  She knows a lot about it.  I fully accept that there are legitimate issues to be raised regarding the laboratories we use.  It is also important to say that these laboratories are accredited.  According to a note that has been posted tonight on the frequently asked questions section of <i>www.cervicalcheck.ie<\/i>, &quot;the laboratory involved in the case reported in the media, CPL, is not one of the laboratories currently used by CervicalCheck&quot;.  The website names the three laboratories that are used: Quest Diagnostics in New Jersey, MedLab Pathology in Dublin and the Coombe Women and Infants Hospital in Dublin.  That is the factual information today.  As I said in my opening speech, when we move to HPV screening we will have an opportunity to reconfigure our laboratory services as well.  The Deputy can question officials from the HSE on what was audited when they are at her disposal at the joint committee tomorrow.  This matter will also be considered by the inquiry.  When I speak as Minister for Health about the laboratories we are using, I have to say that countries like the US are not exactly the wild west in terms of medical technology.  A great deal of progress has been made since the programme was set up and it was decided to outsource some testing to these laboratories, which was not a decision made by me.  We have gone from a situation pre-programme where we had 300,000 smears in Ireland to one where we have 250,000 smears.  We have gone from a situation pre-programme where the programme was showing no benefit in relation to mortality to one where we see mortality reducing by 7% a year.

Along with everybody in this House, I have been working in a responsible manner to try to put facts into the public domain and get to a point where we can establish answers for women, care for the women who have been let down and try to ensure we have a screening programme that can be improved as a result of Ms Phelan.  This landed this evening.<\/p>  <p>  It is important, however, to specify what this is.  I have made the point already but it is important.  This does not amount to more people at home with cancer who did not know they had cancer.  This does not amount to more people at home who had an audit that was not shared with them.  These are people who were not known to CervicalCheck who are on the national cancer registry, who have had a diagnosis of cervical cancer and who have received or are receiving treatment for cervical cancer.  They never benefited from the clinical audit process.  That is utterly unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  In light of what is happening this evening, I am very much moving in my mindset in the direction outlined by the Deputy earlier.  The Acting Chairman will probably tell me I have run out of time but I would like to interact with Deputies in this House.  I heard Ms Phelan make the point during the week that she does not want a long inquiry or tribunal, and I know nobody wants that.  HIQA has powers that could bring much good to this and we have used them with a number of other important areas, including the Portlaoise babies scandal and the case of Ms Savita Halappanavar at University Hospital Galway.  The authority has got to the bottom of things and made our services safer.  I also take the point there may be bigger and wider matters emerging.<\/p>  <p>  How we address this as an Oireachtas and Government is an issue.  Perhaps after the meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Health tomorrow we should review where we are at.  I am certainly willing to meet representatives of other political parties and groupings, as we have done with other difficult or important national matters, to work out how best to address this.  I cannot decide matters for the Government on the hoof on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  I nevertheless take the point.  I have heard from Deputies Shortall, Daly, O'Reilly, Kelly, Eamon Ryan and a number of other speakers - I apologise if I left out people - about the importance of getting the right mechanism to get answers.  I agree with Deputy Shortall that I do not want the mechanism to shut down debate in here or in any committee but it must have teeth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100050#XX02300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1525206300,"counter":530,"content":"<p>That is the point we made today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050100050#XX02400","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1525206300,"counter":531,"content":"<p>The HIQA mechanism has teeth but I am happy to engage with the Opposition on this.

There were one or two contributions tonight that were simply wrong, specifically the commentary relating to the Minister.  I believe what the Minister is saying but there is a real issue.  The Minister is managing a live process.  He was told something earlier and he acted on facts over the weekend.  This D&aacute;il debated facts that were wrong, and that cannot happen again.   The scenario in which the information came to the Minister tells me there is something wrong in the Department and the national screening process at the very least.  It tells me there is something wrong if people are afraid to relay such information to the Minister's Department. This cannot happen again because if it does, we will get into a different space and I do not want to go there.  This is too serious an issue. The political sideshow must end in the next couple of days because this is a serious matter. The Minister should send an email to everybody in the Department, the HSE and the national screening centre, asking that if people have any information, they should reveal it.  It has nearly gone to that. There are 15 people who could not provide the Minister with accurate data over the weekend.<\/p>  <p> I am glad the Minister made those comments about HIQA.  What will happen if HIQA is asking questions and requests people to turn up but those people refuse to do so?  Nothing happens and the people just do not turn up. They do not answer questions and they are not compelled to do so.  Where do we go then? The real issue is that HIQA does not have adequate powers, including power of compellability.  It cannot force people to answer questions or attend meetings.  People cannot be cross-examined.  As a result, we will end up with a commission anyway.  I will be helpful.  There is a need for a period to scope this and it cannot be open-ended.  This is to ensure it could be done quickly.

As the Irish Cancer Society indicated to me today, there are some women who have cancer who will be very sick and want answers.  We must be conscious of another process, the independent clinical review, which should get under way forthwith.  I am not suggesting the Deputy is saying we do not consider this.  That review will mean that every woman affected by this can have an appointment with a team of experts brought in internationally, a liaison nurse and the Irish Cancer Society feeding into how best to do that.  Those women should be able to find out their own facts and medical detail to know their cases were reviewed.<\/p>  <p>  There is a real issue here and there is a reason I declared I did not have confidence in the management of CervicalCheck.

That could be of significant help in providing assurance.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Cancer Society, ICS, had some excellent ideas today on how we could provide assurance and information to women.  That included the idea of the screening  programme writing out to every woman with factual information about the programme, some of the steps taken and probably an apology as well for all the stress and worry caused.  I am going to work with the ICS and other advocacy groups on how to best to build that assurance.  The Deputy is right.

Given the comments that were made earlier about the request to ask the Attorney General to settle cases without further litigation, how can the Minister stand over that in this instance and yet another arm of the State is actively defending cases in regard to the prescribing of Lariam, whereby not only is it defending the cases and adopting the exact same tactic but it is also continuing to prescribe that drug?

I note the State Claims Agency tells me that it settles 98% of clinical negligence actions out of court.  The Deputy has raised an important issue.  The State Claims Agency plays a very important role in this State and it plays an important role on behalf of all the agencies and Departments of the State.  The action the Taoiseach has taken is prudent in this regard, namely, to ask the Attorney General to do a body of work with the State Claims Agency to examine if there is a better way in regard to this case to make sure women can get access to the information and the support they need without needing to go to court.

If the Minister does not know about it now, I ask him to look into it.  It came off the back of a cervical cancer scandal and they took the whole system and changed the whole way they did business regarding particularly issues relating to women's reproductive health and they provided for individual input into the process.  There are huge lessons to be learned there.  I would like the Minister to give a commitment that he will examine that model - it is \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer in some ways - and also the Dutch model where we know an Irish woman was misdiagnosed in regard to cervical cancer in the Netherlands.

What I want to do is find a mechanism whereby we can: first, provide them with all the factual information, which I expect they would have had; second, provide them with an appointment with their clinician; and third, provide them with access to an international clinical panel that can objectively review their case, meet the woman and be co-ordinated by a liaison nurse.
