The number of acute beds available can fluctuate greatly over time for various reasons, including ongoing refurbishment and maintenance work.<br\/><br\/>While the number of resourced acute hospital beds is clearly an important factor in meeting service demand, acute hospital care is just one component of a healthcare delivery system.  The understanding and focus has shifted to a more holistic approach in which the aim is to provide services for  the patient or service user in the right place in the system where his\/her needs can best be met.  As set out in <i>Future Health  - A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2015,<\/i>the Programme for Government has committed to a fundamental reform of our health services.

In essence, the majority of patients, those who require only a routine straight forward level of urgent or planned care should be safely managed locally, with treatment being delivered at home or as close to home as possible.  Those who require true emergency or complex planned care can and should be safely managed in larger hospitals where all the relevant clinical expertise can be provided with consultant delivered high quality care available round the clock.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100063#WRA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Care Provision","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100064#WRB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[2333\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100064#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views that a sufficient number of community geriatric teams comprising a geriatrician and specialist nurse working in communities could help relieve pressures on bed occupancy in hospitals, particularly at times of over-capacity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1194","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":41,"content":"<p>Consultant Geriatrician posts are in general contracted to the acute hospital system with some exceptions.

For ECHO and DELTA calls (life threatening conditions), the 2015 response time target is for 80% of calls to get a patient-carrying vehicle on scene within 19 minutes.  The latest published data shows that, in October, the volume of ECHO calls rose by 5% compared to the same period in 2013, with DELTA calls up 10%.  The response time was met for 76% of ECHO and 67% of DELTA calls.  This is an improvement of 3.3% and 4% respectively on 2013. <\/p>  <p>  Response time targets only measure one aspect of ambulance performance and should be part of a suite of assessments.  Internationally, many services are moving to patient outcomes as a better indicator of performance.  The National Ambulance Service introduced a patient outcome target for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in 2014, and more are being developed.<\/p>  <p>  Achieving response time targets in rural settings is a difficult task for any ambulance service.  HIQA has acknowledged, in its own report, our geographic challenges and has recommended different rural and urban response time targets.  While that issue is under consideration, we are adapting ambulance services for the needs of rural populations through, for example, the use of rapid response vehicles and the Emergency Aeromedical Support Service (EAS).  The EAS has been very successful and has provided rapid access to appropriate treatment for very high acuity patients, where this may be have been difficult to achieve by road.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to strive to improve rural response times.  A &euro;5.4 million budget increase in 2015 will help address service gaps, particularly in the west, by reforming rostering and staffing additional stations.  We will also expand the number of Community First Response teams, especially in rural and sparsely populated areas.   The Intermediate Care Service, for non-emergency clinical transport, continues to free up frontline ambulances, and their highly paramedic staff for emergencies. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that, as well as the recent HIQA report, two other major reports on ambulance services, on national capacity and Dublin services, will be published shortly.  All three reports, when taken together, will provide us with very good information which will help drive service improvement.

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  The commonest noticeable evidence of infection is a rash called erythema migrans that is seen in about 80-90% of patients.<\/p>  <p>  Lyme borelliosis is diagnosed by a medical history and physical examination and can be difficult if there has been no erythema migrans rash.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies to B. burgdorferi produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIA's can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other spirochaete infections including syphilis, and certain viral infections including glandular fever.  In addition, sera from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results.  Samples giving reactive or equivocal tests in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests.  Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity.  Using this outlined two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme Disease. Testing for Lyme borelliosis is currently undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  There is an ongoing publicity campaign regarding Lyme Disease.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE is establishing a Lyme Borelliosis Sub-Committee with the primary aim to examine best practice in prevention and surveillance of Lyme Disease and to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise harm caused by Lyme borelliosis in Ireland.  This will involve raising awareness among clinicians and the general public.  It will explore ways to ensure these messages are brought to the general public with the frequency and in forms in which they can be most effective. <\/p>  <p>  Each year, as part of its ongoing awareness raising regarding prevention and treatment of Lyme Disease, the HPSC holds a Lyme Disease Awareness Week in which media releases are sent out with the intention that media outlets would take up the important Lyme prevention messages.  As part of last year's Awareness Week, a supply of information was made available to the public and attention was drawn to a \"Tickborn Disease Toolkit\", developed by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC).  This toolkit was modified for use in Ireland and posted on the HPSC website.  Indeed, the ECDC informed the HPSC that Ireland was the first European Member State to make such extensive use of this material.  Following the Awareness Week, a 100% increase of web traffic to the various Lyme Disease sections of the HPSC website was noted. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100066#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":95,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100066#WRD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":96,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[2355\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100066#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to publish the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":97,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the Government has approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.

Hospitals are expected to accept all patient referrals and prioritise on the basis of strict chronological order, other than in cases of evidenced clinical urgency including relevant cancer cases.  It is not unreasonable for larger tertiary referral centres to query why patients are bypassing recently developed suitable services in hospitals closer to them.  Attendance at the larger centre may well result in the patient travelling longer distances, to a hospital which is under greater pressure and may have longer outpatient waiting times. <\/p>  <p>  The Special Delivery Unit protocol on the management of outpatient services sets out the process for referral and management of outpatient services.  The protocol also helps to maximise efficiency and reduce duplications.  In any instance where a decision has been made to refuse referrals, each hospital Clinical Director has to be apprised of the situation and the decision to issue notice to GPs should be done by the senior management team, within the context of good clinical governance. <\/p>  <p>  Improving waiting lists for in patient and day case treatment is a key priority for me and for the Government.  My Department is working with the HSE to put in place a plan to eliminate very long waiters by the end of the year.  This will involve both productivity improvement and rigorous waiting list management.  Further increasing day case surgery rates for specific procedures will be important in improving elective access within available capacity.  Priority will be given to adherence to the guidelines in relation to the scheduling of patients for surgery, including chronological scheduling, and this will be monitored by the HSE throughout the year.  <\/p>  <p>  The management of competing demands for emergency and scheduled care requires changes in how and where patients are treated.  The movement of care and treatment from in-patient to day case and from day case to Outpatient Departments is most important, as is ensuring the appropriate ratio of new to return appointments, reducing unnecessary return appointments.  Limiting elective surgery in preparation for, or as a response to, increased Emergency Department attendances is intended to help manage the need for immediate emergency or trauma care.  Where it is necessary to prioritise cancer and other complex cases, the HSE assures me that this is being done.  Inevitably this will affect waiting lists.  The challenge is to minimise the need for cancellation at short notice and to manage the impact of such cancellations effectively, within the hospital and in collaboration with other hospitals.

The Government has provided additional funding of  &euro;3 million in 2014 and &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges and actions being taken include the provision of additional home care packages, additional transition beds in nursing homes, 300 additional Fair Deal places and an extension in Community Intervention Teams.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100070#WRH00500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":195,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100070#WRH00550"},{"type":"question","counter":196,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[2348\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100070#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding a medical card application in respect of a person (details supplied); and the reason there has been an unacceptable delay in the processing of this application.

I would like to clarify that response time performance is improving in the face of increasing demands on the service.

A significant programme of reform and modernisation is ongoing, and, this year we will see a number of further developments.  A key component of the reform programme is the single national control system.  This will be completed later this year and will, along with the single Computer Aided Dispatch system, further improve call taking and dispatching.  The Intermediate Care Service, which received additional vehicles and staff in 2014, will continue to free up emergency vehicles for emergency calls and we are focussed on improving hospital turnaround times.  <\/p>  <p>  A &euro;5.4m  budget increase in 2015 will help address service gaps, particularly in the west, by reforming rostering and staffing additional stations.  We will also expand the number of community first response teams, particularly in more rural and sparsely populated areas.

I also understand that the draft executive summary of the National Capacity Review, recently circulated to the Joint Committee on Health and Children, suggests that the response time targets recommended by HIQA cannot be met, even with substantially increased resources.  However, as that report is not yet finalised, I believe it is premature to make any concrete decisions in relation to response time targets.  <\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that response time targets only measure one aspect of ambulance performance and they should be part of a suite of assessments.  Internationally, many services are moving to patient outcomes as a better indicator of performance.  The NAS introduced a patient outcome target for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in 2014, and more are being developed.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to rural response time targets, I think it is accepted that these are difficult to achieve for any ambulance service.  However, I can assure the Deputy that we are already adapting our ambulance services for the needs of rural populations through, for example, the use of rapid response vehicles.  In addition, the Emergency Aeromedical Support Service which has proven to be very successful, will continue to provide rapid access to appropriate treatment for very high acuity patients where this might be difficult to achieve by road.  A &euro;5.4m budget increase in 2015 will help address service gaps, particularly in the west, by reforming rostering and staffing additional stations.  We will also expand the number of community first response teams, particularly in more rural and sparsely populated areas. The Intermediate Care Service, for non-emergency clinical transport, will continue to free up frontline ambulances, and their highly skilled paramedics and advanced paramedics, for emergency calls. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the recent HIQA review, the national capacity review and the review of Dublin ambulance services are awaited.

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria. The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating. The commonest noticeable evidence of infection is a rash called erythema migrans that is seen in about 80-90% of patients.<\/p>  <p>  Lyme borelliosis is diagnosed by a medical history and physical examination and can be difficult if there has been no erythema migrans rash. The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies to B. burgdorferi produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection. These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease. The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step. Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other spirochaete infections including syphilis, and certain viral infections including glandular fever. In addition, sera from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results. Samples giving reactive or equivocal tests in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests. Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity. Using this outlined two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme Disease. Testing for Lyme borelliosis is currently undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  There is an ongoing publicity campaign regarding Lyme Disease. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE is establishing a Lyme Borelliosis Sub-Committee with the primary aim to examine best practice in prevention and surveillance of Lyme Disease and to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise harm caused by Lyme borelliosis in Ireland. This will involve raising awareness among clinicians and the general public. It will explore ways to ensure these messages are brought to the general public with the frequency and in forms in which they can be most effective. <\/p>  <p>  Each year, as part of its ongoing awareness raising regarding prevention and treatment of Lyme Disease, the HPSC holds a Lyme Disease Awareness Week in which media releases are sent out with the intention that media outlets would take up the important Lyme prevention messages. As part of last year's Awareness Week, a supply of information was made available to the public and attention was drawn to a \"Tickborn Disease Toolkit\", developed by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC). This toolkit was modified for use in Ireland and posted on the HPSC website. Indeed, the ECDC informed the HPSC that Ireland was the first European Member State to make such extensive use of this material. Following the Awareness Week, a 100% increase of web traffic to the various Lyme Disease sections of the HPSC website was noted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100071#WRJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Funding","counter":235,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100071#WRJ02300"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[2365\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100071#WRJ02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount of the &euro;20 million allocated for community mental health services in budget 2014 spent in 2014; if he will provide a breakdown on the way the money was spent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":237,"content":"<p>In relation to the &euro;20 million provided in Budget 2014, the HSE National Service Plan provided for the phasing-in of the expenditure, in order for the HSE to live within its overall available resource across its service areas.

The purpose of awarding the contract is to engage a firm with the appropriate\u00a0experience\u00a0to provide advice to assist the Department in making the bank's balance sheet fit for purpose and in designing a roadmap that will see the bank start to return cash to the State.  As I have indicated previously, no decision has been taken in relation to the State exiting any of its investments in the bank.<\/p>  <p>  The award follows the establishment by the Department last year of\u00a0three separate panels of financial advisers after an extensive process that followed EU procurement rules.  These panels were put in place to principally facilitate the provision of timely advice in relation to our banking investments though the panels are available for the wider Department to use in other areas if deemed necessary.<\/p>  <p>  The award of the current contract followed a competitive tendering process with each of the eleven firms on Panel 1 (which covers capital markets, strategic, M&amp;A and restructuring advice) being invited to submit a tender.  Prior to the year end, each of the firms accepted the invitation and the tendering process included face-to-face presentations by each of the firms to a panel of Department of Finance officials.  Arising from these presentations, each of the firms was scored across a number of standard criteria with Goldman Sachs International being adjudged to have achieved the highest aggregated score. Accordingly,\u00a0they were awarded the contract.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the\u00a0process for assessing the award of a contract by the Department,\u00a0all firms who are invited to submit a tender are required to provide a declaration\u00a0that no conflicts of interest exist. Should a\u00a0firm be in a position to be unable to\u00a0provide\u00a0such a declaration, any tender submitted by the firm would\u00a0be disqualified from further consideration.  I can confirm that\u00a0Goldman Sachs International provided the Department with the appropriate declaration.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the terms of the contract, Goldman Sachs International has been engaged on a pro bono basis.  This is a good outcome for the State and we understand is not unusual internationally given firms\u00a0desire to be associated with such high visibility government work.  In fact a number of the tenderers offered their services on a pro bono basis.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that Goldman Sachs\u00a0is one of the leading investment banks worldwide with vast experience in a number\u00a0of areas, including corporate finance.\u00a0 The firm has ongoing engagements\u00a0with a wide variety of clients including large corporates and\u00a0sovereign states.  The\u00a0Federal Reserve Board is the primary regulator of the Goldman Sachs group.  In addition to this, Goldman\u00a0Sachs International is regulated by the PRA and FCA in the U.K.  With its vast experience and high degree of regulation,\u00a0I am not aware of any reason not to\u00a0proceed\u00a0with their engagement,\u00a0be it\u00a0probity or otherwise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100074#WRM01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100074#WRM01150"},{"type":"question","counter":306,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[2997\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100074#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether DIRT paid on children's savings is unfair and a disincentive to save; his further views on an exemption for children under 18 years of age; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Either the taxpayer authorises the agent to act on their behalf or the agent advises Revenue that they are now the taxpayer s representative.  Where the taxpayer authorises the agent, they submit a letter to their Revenue office providing details of the agent and the taxes the agent will deal with.  Links are then established on Revenue's systems to grant the agent access and to copy the agent on all relevant correspondence.<\/p>  <p>  Where an agent advises Revenue that they have started acting for a particular taxpayer they must request the link electronically via ROS, Revenue's Online Service, and the eRegistration system, Revenue's online registration facility and attach the authorisation provided by the taxpayer.  Again the necessary links are established but in these instances the taxpayer is advised that the agent has requested access and the taxpayer then has an opportunity to ask that these links are removed, if the client\/agent relationship is not valid.  This additional step acts as a safeguard in instances where a request may have been made in error or without the taxpayer s permission.<\/p>  <p>  The taxpayer can at all times request to have the agent links removed or new agent links created.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that there are very precise operating protocols in respect of access to customer information and they are strictly adhered to by Revenue staff.  I am also advised that Revenue officials will not provide taxpayer details to any person who does not satisfy the relevant security protocols and, in agent\/representative cases, details are only provided where the agent is actually linked to the taxpayer for the specific tax type.  Where an agent is so linked, they have direct access, via Revenue's Online Service, to the records of any taxpayers that they represent.  In those instances, Revenue will not provide copies of taxpayer records to the agent as the information is directly available to the agent to view for themselves in ROS.<\/p>  <p>  The Revenue website is regularly updated with changes in operating procedures and all agent related changes are advised by means of Revenue eBriefs.

Under these regulations each Member State is allocated a volume quota of milk, above which a super levy fine (of 28.6 cents\/litre) has to be paid to the EU Commission by producers who contribute to the over production. It is not possible for me on a unilateral basis to adjust super levy rules.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the foregoing, I have, on numerous occasions, called on the Commission to take action to mitigate the impact of super levy fines, primarily via utilisation of an adjustment to the butterfat coefficient, as this would not have required an amendment to existing regulations. Other options previously discussed included the front-loading of the remaining quota increases, a reduction in the super levy, or a type of EU flexi-milk arrangement which would have operated providing EU production overall was within quota.  However, given the reaction of the Commission, and the opposition of a blocking minority of Member states, some of which have gone so far as to seek to link the issue to possible measures to regulate supply after quotas are gone, there is no realistic prospect of any movement on the super-levy. This is also true of a butterfat adjustment, and coming into the final year of milk quotas, farmers should manage their milk supply with this in mind. <br\/><br\/>At national level I have impressed on the major banks the need to show flexibility in their dealings with farmers experiencing temporary cash flow difficulties in 2015. Co-ops may have a role in mitigating the impact of the global price downturn on their suppliers, and have some flexibility in relation to the phasing of superlevy bills to farmers. Furthermore Teagasc has recently commenced a series of dairy seminars throughout the country to help dairy farmers manage through 2015, while also planning the efficient development of their dairy business in a non-quota environment. <br\/><br\/>There is evidence that milk suppliers are taking steps to manage their milk supply in the final months of the quota regime. The milk quota position for the period up to end-December 2014 leaves Ireland 5.93% over quota when account is taken of the butterfat content of the milk deliveries. This figure continues the downward trend in the over-quota figure, coming from a peak of 7.15% in October 2014.<br\/><br\/>This downward trend is welcome and <i>I would encourage milk producers to continue to manage production, with the help of their advisors, <\/i>into the important production months of February and March.<br\/><br\/>At EU level, the end of the 2013\/14 milk quota year saw total milk deliveries come in at 4.6% below quota. It is difficult to project what the end of quota year position will be in the EU next April. Data taken from the EU Milk Market Observatory show that deliveries for the whole of the EU for the period from January to the end of October 2014 are 5.4% above the same period last year. For the same period it is worth noting that production has increased in 26 of the 27 countries reporting to the EU Milk Market Observatory, with half those countries experiencing increases above 5%. Notwithstanding the possibility of softening of milk prices impacting on the final outcome, these EU production trends would appear to suggest that overall EU deliveries may be nearer to quota than in previous years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100077#WRP01100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":378,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100077#WRP01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Pensions","counter":377,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100077#WRP01150"},{"type":"question","counter":378,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[2891\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100077#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 296 of 2 December 2014, the grounds on which the High Court quashed his Department's original decision of March 1987, and it was concluded that it was not necessary to do other than carry out a review after which the original decision could be reinstated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":379,"content":"<p>The position in this case is that judicial review proceedings were taken against the decision of the then Minister to reduce the applicant&rsquo;s disability pension under Section 13(2) of the Army Pensions Acts.

To that end full vetting checks are conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  The current procedures for Garda vetting ensure the integrity of the system.  This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Garda Vetting Disclosure would not include information regarding any recent criminal convictions, and the second employer could not safely rely on it.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date and employers would be exposed to civil liability if they knowingly recruited staff based on out-of-date criminal records information where the person in fact had a more recent criminal conviction.  Effectively, the non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service and such procedures are in line with best practice internationally.<\/p>  <p>  There are, however, certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  For example, persons involved in voluntary work may be doing work with more than one voluntary organisation at the same time, and may agree with the vetting applicant to share a single vetting disclosure.  Similar arrangements arise in the health sector in regard to persons working as locums, agency nurses or other temporary employees in a number of different organisations, or in the education sector where substitute teachers are on panels for substitute teaching in more than one school.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the current average processing time for vetting applications is four weeks.

The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is the statutory body responsible for planning, designing, building and equipping the new children's hospital.  Since the decision to locate the hospital at the St. James's campus, the Board's initial focus was on decant planning; site surveys and investigations; design team procurement; and review and update of the Project Brief to take account of the new site.  The revised Project Brief also took account of the outcome of a review of the location, model and number of urgent care centres which was undertaken in 2013.  Following that review, which involved significant consultation with the relevant stakeholders, it was decided that satellite centres, which will share governance and staffing with the new children's hospital, will be built on the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  The Project Brief was approved in June 2014 and sets out details of the specialties to be provided and the planned accommodation.  This will include 384 in-patient beds, all in single en-suite rooms with in-room parent accommodation, a further 85 day-care beds and 14 theatres, including three hybrid theatres to facilitate access to imaging during surgery, all in the main hospital.  There will be 111 outpatient consulting examination rooms across both the main hospital and the two satellite centres, as well as Emergency Department and urgent care facilities.<\/p>  <p>  Accommodation will also include family accommodation near the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit\/Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, as well as in-room parent accommodation and separate family accommodation adjacent to the hospital (planned to be provided on a philanthropic basis by a charitable agency); play areas, external gardens and courtyards; specialist therapy area with hydro-pool and gym; and a family resource and information centre.  The Project Brief also sets out the design principles which will be applied in the design. In this context it affirms that it is important that the design created is consistent with the campus-wide site masterplan for the joint campus with St James&rsquo;s Hospital and with the Dublin City Council Local Area plan, and that it can constitute a landmark feature that can be welcomed by the community as a contribution to urban regeneration.<\/p>  <p>  The design team is now working on detailed design development, with the aim of submitting a planning application in June 2015.  Subject to planning, work will commence at the main site at St. James's, and at satellite centre sites at Connolly and Tallaght, in January 2016.  It is intended that a maternity facility will be developed in due course on the St James&rsquo;s campus, achieving tri-location of adult, paediatric and maternity services on one campus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100083#WRV01800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Autism Incidence","counter":534,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100084#WRW00250"},{"type":"question","counter":535,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[3026\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100084#WRW00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"to set out the extent to which the incidence of autism here compares with other countries in the European Union; whether particular research is ongoing to identify contributing factors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":536,"content":"<p>Autism is a developmental disorder that appears in the early years of life and affects the brain's normal development in the areas of social interaction and communication.  While the exact cause of these developmental abnormalities remain unclear, genetic and other non genetic factors such as brain development during pregnancy are thought to play a role.  Autism is described as a spectrum disorder (Autism Spectrum Disorder or ASD) that can have a varied presentation of characteristics ranging from mild to severe.  Many individuals with autism, due to the complexity of their presentation, may have a primary diagnosis of intellectual disability or mental health co-morbidity.<\/p>  <p>  Although there has been an increased demand in recent years for assessment for ASD it is not clear whether this is due to increased prevalence or to a greater awareness and recognition of the need for earlier intervention.  The Health Service Executive does not currently collect information specifically on adults and children identified with Autism on a national basis on the basis of diagnosis. Information pertaining to diagnosis is specifically excluded from the National Intellectual Disability Database as the database is not designed as a medical epidemiological tool.  Accordingly the database does not record the incidence of autism or any other disability.  The 2011 National Council for Special Education (NCSE) study on prevalence of special educational needs in Ireland (A Study on the Prevalence of Special Educational Needs, Joanne Banks and Selina McCoy, Economic and Social Research Institute) includes autism and estimates that prevalence for ASD is 1 in 100.  This is in line with the figure of .9% reported by the Centre for Disease Control in the US.<\/p>  <p>  Research was initiated in 2004 into autism under the auspices of the HRB as part of the Autism Genome Project - a collaboration of autism researchers internationally aimed at understanding susceptibility to ASD.  The research groups for this work were based in Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin.  This research investigated the genetic risk factors in ASD by pooling DNA obtained from a large international sample of individuals and their families, including many Irish families.  Genetic screening was then employed to identify (i) genetic variants that might increase the risk of autism and (ii) structural changes in the DNA of people with autism.  In parallel, complete clinical information was gathered on participants and the clinical and genetic information was combined in the analysis.  The main outcome showed that although ASDs have a substantial genetic basis, most of the known genetic risk has been traced to rare structural gene variants.  These gene variants were both de novo (arising for the first time in individuals) or inherited, implicating many novel ASD genes and genes involved in neurodevelopment.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to ongoing research, I understand that an Autism Research Group in Trinity College Dublin is focusing on understanding the genetic and neurobiological underpinnings of autism using genetic and neuroimaging methodologies.  The Group is funded through a variety of funding agencies and collaborates widely nationally and internationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100084#WRW00400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cancer Incidence","counter":537,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100084#WRW00450"},{"type":"question","counter":538,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[3027\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100084#WRW00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"to set down the countries throughout Europe most affected by fall-out from Chernobyl; the extent of the health issues arising in terms of the number of incidents of cancer; how this country compares with others; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":539,"content":"<p>Definitive data on the consequences from Chernobyl on the incidence of cancer in Ireland is not available.<br\/><br\/>The National Cancer Registry (NCR) publishes data in cancer incidence, treatment and survival in Ireland.

The Scheme was designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial, and aims to minimise the stress for all women concerned.

The closing date for receipt of applications was therefore Friday 5 December 2014.

The Department's capital budget will be focused on providing those place to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place. <br\/><br\/>  My Department uses a Geographical Information System to analyse demographic data to determine the areas where additional school accommodation may be required.  A variety of data sources are used in this analysis, including census data, school enrolment data and child benefit data obtained from the Department of Social Protection.<br\/><br\/>  Where new primary schools are needed, the model of provision is decided by an open patronage determination process, which is overseen by the New Schools Establishment Group.  The criteria for awarding patronage place an emphasis on parental choice and diversity of provision, including language medium of instruction.  <br\/><br\/>  Where new schools are not needed but some level of additional accommodation is required in an area to meet demographic demand, a range of factors are considered as to which school or schools should be provided with this accommodation.  These factors include the level of diversity of provision in the area and the ability or otherwise of existing school sites to facilitate the extra accommodation.  <br\/><br\/>  The Deputy will be aware that a recent nationwide demographic exercise was carried out to determine where additional primary school accommodation will be needed from 2015 onwards at primary level.  This exercise concluded that there is sufficient primary educational infrastructure in the north Kildare area for the foreseeable future.  The schools in the area are, therefore, expected to cater between them for the level of demand presenting for pupil places.  This may result in pupils not obtaining a place of first choice.  <br\/><br\/>  With regard to an update on the reform of patronage models, I assume the Deputy is referring to the patronage divesting process.

Phase 1 targets the delivery of 18,000 additional housing units by the end of 2017 and phase 2, spanning the years 2018 to 2020, targets the delivery of 17,000 units.\u00a0 The actions contained in the Strategy include the agreement by Q1 2015 of targets with local authorities for the delivery of social housing in 2015 and to initiate work on targets for subsequent years. The groups involved in overseeing the work on setting targets, namely the Dublin Social Housing Delivery Taskforce and the Social Housing Strategy Project Board, have met and commenced the process on setting targets with each local authority. The allocation of funding to local authorities, in the context of the increased funding now available, will be based on the targets that are set and the plans of individual authorities to deliver on those targets.  <br\/><br\/>The main areas of social housing capital investment are the local authorities&rsquo; own social housing construction and acquisitions programme and the Capital Assistance Scheme, through which funding is provided to approved housing bodies via the local authorities.

Housing Strategy 2020,<\/i>available at the link below, builds on the provisions contained in Budget 2015 and sets out clear, measureable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list.<br\/><br\/>The total targeted provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme, will address the needs of the 90,000 households on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.<br\/><br\/>Pillar 1 of the Strategy targets the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units over the period to 2020.  The cost to the Exchequer of building, acquiring, or leasing these 35,000 units over the period to 2020 is estimated to be &euro;3.8bn. <br\/><br\/>Budget 2015 marked a significant change in the trajectory of social housing funding with an increase in 2015 of some &euro;210m to &euro;800m and provides a commitment to multi-annual funding envelopes for social housing with clear capital commitment over the period to 2017. Budget 2015 also provided that off-balance sheet and more sustainable forms of funding will come into operation, with the announcement of an extension to the NAMA Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), a large scale Public Private Partnership (PPP) and a commitment to establish a Financial Vehicle. The Strategy provides a coherent policy and institutional framework within which these initiatives can be executed, connected and developed.<br\/><br\/>In 2015, I expect that 3,000 units will be provided through the leasing initiative; 1,000 vacant local authority units will be returned to use through a programme of refurbishment; with a further 1,400 units to be built or acquired by local authorities and approved housing bodies through the Social Housing Investment Programme and the Capital Assistance Scheme.

These 28 areas consist largely of areas defined by the county boundaries including both Cavan and Monaghan.

In the majority of cases, customers are given a slot within the required timescale.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The RSA has also been\u00a0encouraging\u00a0people to book early, as the test may\u00a0be\u00a0undertaken up to 90 days in advance of the due test date without affecting the expiry date of the new certificate. This system is to ensure that owners have ample time to have their vehicle tested before their current NCT certificate expires and I would encourage people to avail of this early facility for booking car test appointments.<\/p>  <p>  Enforcement of the relevant legislation is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.\u00a0If a person&rsquo;s NCT test date is imminent, it will be a matter for the Garda&iacute; to use their discretion. However, responsibility rests with owners to ensure their vehicles are in compliance with the law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100090#WRCC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Safety Strategy","counter":680,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100090#WRCC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":681,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[2896\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012100090#WRCC01000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his Department has studied the Swedish Vision Zero programme for road safety; and his plans to implement any element of this programme here.","asker":"1190","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":682,"content":"<p>I am aware of the Vision Zero Initiative.
