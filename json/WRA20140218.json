I hope the Council will be successful in its work as a vibrant Cork Airport will ultimately benefit both Cork and the wider region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800054#WRB03800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Funding","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800055#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[7616\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800055#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will bring forward any plans from his Department to increase the number of active participants in sporting organisations here; if he will consider increasing the allocation of funding to organisation who promote increasing participation from persons who are currently not active in sport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"976","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>The Irish Sports Council, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the promotion, development and co-ordination of sport, including the development of strategies for increasing participation in sport.

","asker":"1051","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":168,"content":"<p>The centenary of the outbreak of the First World War will be marked by events across Europe in August this year.  At national level, events to mark the outbreak of the First World War will take place over several days.  While detailed arrangements still to be settled, a Cross of Sacrifice monument at Glasnevin cemetery will be dedicated to the memory of the soldiers who died in the War.  Services of prayer and remembrance ceremonies will take place at national and community level.  Special presentations and exhibitions are being organised by the national cultural institutions.  Commemorative initiatives are also being prepared by local authorities, colleges and schools, heritage and community groups and media organisations.  The arrangements in Ireland will complement the commemorations taking place in Europe and the wider international community to mark this important centenary.<\/p><p>  The Government's approach to the Decade of Commemorations is guided by several principles: full acknowledgement of the totality of the island's history; the legitimacy of all traditions; the totality of the diverse history of the period; mutual respect; and historical accuracy.  These principles inform all activities undertaken in the commemoration of the First World War.<\/p><p>  My Department's commemorative policy is delivered by working in partnership across Government, and in conjunction with our partners in Northern Ireland and overseas.  Certain historical events call for joint British-Irish cooperation and attendance, in particular regarding the commemoration of the First World War.  The partnership allows for the further strengthening of the British-Irish relationship, grounded in a respect for the past and reconciliation.  Equally, commemorative events are an opportunity to strengthen and deepen North-South links.<\/p><p>  In November 2012, I attended the Remembrance Day commemorative services in Belfast, at the invitation of Belfast City Council.  At this ceremony, I laid a wreath at Belfast City Hall to remember those who died during the First World War.  On the same date, the Taoiseach attended Remembrance Day events in Enniskillen.  These two events marked the first occasion on which members of the Government participated in Remembrance Day ceremonies in Northern Ireland.  It served as a sign of a deeply embedded reconciliation process that is ongoing.  In 2013, I again attended the commemorative services in Belfast and the Taoiseach attended the remembrance service in Enniskillen.  <\/p><p>  On 10 January 2014, at Google's European Headquarters in Dublin, I launched an online archive of Ireland&rsquo;s First World War records together with Northern Ireland's First Minister, Peter Robinson, MLA, and deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, MLA.  The new archive,<i>'Ireland&rsquo;s Memorial Records<\/i> ', lists soldiers from the island of Ireland who died during the First World War or as a result of wounds sustained during battle.  The archive and launch event reflect the reconciliatory and historical value of an all-island approach to commemorating the First World War.<\/p><p>  My Department's Reconciliation and Anti-Sectarianism Funds are providing support for a number of projects commemorating significant centenaries, including the First World War, as part of its regular funding of community and voluntary groups.  Several community and youth projects supported by the Funds have commemorations-related elements to their projects, exploring issues around identity and understanding of other traditions.  A number of these projects challenge the notion of separate histories and explore the ways in which drawing upon shared experiences can impact on contemporary societal relationships.

I am conscious of the difficulties experienced by Irish citizens who are undocumented in the United States, and I have met and spoken with many of them on my working visits there, and also with the various groups who lobby on their behalf.<\/p><p>  I have maintained contact, both directly and through our Embassy in Washington, with many key players in Congress who are influential in steering the process of US immigration reform.  Over the last five months, both the Embassy and I have had direct contact with some 70 Members of the House of Representatives and their staff.   These have included Republican Congressman Paul Ryan, Chair of the House Budgetary Committee and former Vice-Presidential nominee; Republican Congressman Bob Goodlatte, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee and several other leading Republican members of that Committee, including Immigration Sub-Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy; Minority House Leader Nancy Pelosi; Chair of the Congressional Friends of Ireland, Pete King; with House Speaker John Boehner and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and their staffs.  I have also maintained contact with key figures in the US Administration and with Irish-American community representatives. <\/p><p>  I have reiterated throughout all these contacts the Government's interest in all aspects of immigration reform and in particular our interest in seeing an overall agreement reached which provides relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and a facility for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US.  <\/p><p>  In this context, we very much welcomed the US Senate&rsquo;s approval of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Bill by a 68-32 margin on 27 June last year.    <\/p><p>  Following passage of that Bill, the issue has been under consideration in the Republican controlled House of Representatives.  Public comments and private conversations which I, the Taoiseach and our Embassy in Washington DC had with leaders of the House Republican caucus, had given rise to expectations that the House would take up consideration of a series of immigration reform bills last autumn.  Unfortunately that did not come to pass.  <\/p><p>  Early last month, further public comments from Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Chief Whip Kevin McCarthy again raised hopes that the Republican leadership in the House saw the need to proceed with immigration reform.  To that end, the leadership prepared a set of draft principles that would guide their action on immigration in the House and presented them to the members of their caucus for consideration at a meeting on 30 January 2014.<\/p><p>  Informed by that discussion, Speaker Boehner gave a press conference on 6 February in which he expressed doubts that the House would pass immigration reform legislation this year.  He did reassert that immigration reform is something that needs to get done and that he would continue to consult his members.<\/p><p>  Given that expectations had again been raised, these and other comments are disappointing.  However, it is important that we keep our focus on the endgame.  The Government through our Ambassador in Washington DC and her team are continuing an extensive outreach and engagement with members of Congress and with the Irish groups and organisations who are lobbying for immigration reform.  We are monitoring the ongoing discussions within the Republican Party and continuing to press the case for addressing the concerns of our undocumented and to provide for a future legal flow for Irish immigrants to the United States.  The forthcoming St Patrick's Day visits to the United States will provide a further important opportunity to engage with US leaders in support of our immigration objectives and to assess the prospects for the weeks and months ahead.  We remain fully committed to the effort to achieve an outcome that addresses the needs of our undocumented and creates a legal path for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800056#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Communities Abroad","counter":178,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800056#WRD01950"},{"type":"question","counter":179,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[2219\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800056#WRD02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his Department's actions on the Irish diaspora; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Irish Abroad Unit (IAU) manages a range of engagement between the Irish Government and the Diaspora; including support and recognition for Irish overseas in the form of the Emigrant Support Programme, the Presidential Distinguished Service Awards for the Irish Abroad, and structured engagement with the Diaspora geared towards economic development, through the Global Irish Network and the Global Irish Economic Forum.

The key objectives of the ESP are to support projects and initiatives that address the needs of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable Irish emigrants; enhance access for Irish emigrants and Irish community organisations to local statutory and voluntary services; foster a more vibrant sense of community and Irish identity amongst the Irish abroad; and encourage closer links between Irish communities abroad and Ireland, to the benefit of both.  Since 2009, the Programme also supports projects aimed at creating practical results orientated links between Ireland and the global Irish, and projects that emerged as a consequence of the Global Irish Economic Forum and its follow up.  The Emigrant Support Programme allocation for 2014 stands at &euro;11.595m.<\/p><p>  Organisations in Britain and the United States receive the largest amounts of funding but recent years have seen a new wave of emigration from Ireland.  Many are heading to traditional centres of emigration but others are heading to new locations, building new communities, for example, in Western Australia, Western Canada and the UAE.  The Emigrant Support Programme supports organizations in these new locations to assist these new emigrants with the challenges they face on arrival in these countries<\/p><p><b>Global Irish Network\/Global Irish Economic Forum<\/b><\/p><p>  In early 2010 the Global Irish Network was launched and currently comprises more than 350 senior Irish and Irish connected business people based in some 40 countries.

They have demonstrated a strong connection to Ireland and have a record of high achievement in international business or in assisting in the promotion of Ireland.  They provide Ireland with an invaluable resource of international expertise from which we can draw as we work towards continued economic recovery.<\/p><p>  To date, there have been three meetings of the Global Irish Economic Forum, in 2009, 2011 and, most recently in 2013.  Over these successive meetings, there have been changes in how they are conducted.  For example, in 2013, mentoring sessions were held to bring Enterprise Ireland clients together with Network members.  In addition, meetings were held outside Dublin for the first time, with meetings in Cork, Galway and Belfast. <\/p><p><b>Presidential Distinguished Service Award for the Irish Abroad<\/b><\/p><p>The Presidential Distinguished Service Award for the Irish Abroad was established in 2012<b>.  <\/b>The Award provides recognition by the Irish State for persons living abroad, primarily Irish citizens, those entitled to Irish citizenship and those of Irish descent, who have given sustained and distinguished service to Ireland and\/or Irish communities abroad.  A High Level Panel based in Ireland considers all nominations received from abroad and makes recommendations to the Government and the Irish Abroad Unit administers the awards process.<\/p><p><b>Certificate of Irish Heritage<\/b><\/p><p>  The Certificate of Irish Heritage was introduced in 2011 to recognise descendents of previous generations of Irish citizens in an official way and give greater practical expression to the sense of Irish identity felt by many around the world.

The impact of these decisions on tax revenue and employment is also modelled. <\/p><p>  When assessing the potential impact on the economy of such a measure, my Department must weigh the short-term benefits on economic output against the impact on the public finances. In this regard research produced by the ESRI as part of its Medium-Term Review of July 2013 is informative. Using the HERMES macroeconomic model, the ESRI tested the economic impact of a series of fiscal shocks to the economy. It includes simulations of the impact of a &euro;1 billion adjustment in income tax. \u00a0<\/p><p>  The results of the research suggest an income tax multiplier of -0.6   that is, a &euro;1 billion reduction in income tax results in additional GDP of about &euro;600m million over the forecast horizon. <\/p><p>  The relatively low GDP multiplier likely reflects the open nature of Ireland's economy and the fact that increased demand would 'leak out' through imports. The simulations also include the assumption that some part of a reduced tax burden would be saved rather than spent by households. This positive impact on output must be balanced against the impact on the public finances exerted through lower tax revenues. In addition, the Revenue Commissioners estimated that 856,000 tax units which equates to just over 39% of the tax base will be exempt from income tax in 2014.\u00a0 It is also worth pointing out that it is generally accepted that low income earners spend a greater proportion of their disposable income in the economy. Therefore, any cut in the income tax burden would have no effect on the spending habits of these tax units as they would not benefit from the change.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><p>  When discussing the merits of such a measure it is important not to lose sight of the current fiscal position. Despite the considerable progress made in recent years, Ireland's budget deficit remains one of the highest in Europe. In this context the opportunity cost of any large-scale revenue stimulus would be considerable. Moreover, any revenue shortfalls would have to be made up from alternative measures in order to continue to meet our deficit targets.<\/p><p>  \u00a0In relation to the ESRI example, the simulations suggest that the deficit would increase by 0.5 percentage points of GDP and general government debt by just over 2 per cent of GDP, both by the end of the forecast horizon. Therefore, in relation, to the specific scenario put forward by the Deputy the increase in indirect taxes would be not be sufficient to cover the loss in income tax revenue.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><p>  \u00a0Finally I would say that while there is a clear need to address the fiscal imbalances of the State, this Government is cognisant of the pitfalls of excessively taxing labour. Reflecting this, the Programme for Government contained commitments to not increase the marginal rate of tax.\u00a0 My first three Budgets have achieved these commitments, which further demonstrate our commitment to encouraging labour supply and supporting employment growth into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800057#WRE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Arrears Proposals","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800057#WRE01550"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[7760\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800057#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to prevent the sale of mortgages from foreign owned banks to unregulated operators; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":248,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[8058\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800057#WRE01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the action he will take to amend the law to prevent unregulated vulture funds from acquiring mortgage portfolios from Irish banks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":249,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[8287\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800057#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Central Bank has contacted his Department expressing concern that some mortgage holders may lose the protections of certain statutory codes including the code of conduct on mortgage arrears if their mortgage is sold to an entity not regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland; his views on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

However, this derogation is only permissible where the VAT rate applying is 12% or greater. In this case, it is not legally possible to introduce a 9% rate of VAT on all construction services. <\/p><p>  While it is possible for us to apply the 9% VAT rate to the construction of residential properties, this would involve having two separate VAT rates applying to construction services.

This incentive, which came into operation on 25 October 2013 and will run until 31 December 2015, provides tax relief for homeowners by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence. <\/p><p>  Qualifying expenditure is expenditure subject to the 13.5% VAT rate.

Article 135(1)(i) of the EU VAT Directive (Council Directive 2006\/112\/EC) provides that Member States shall exempt betting, lotteries and other forms of gambling, subject to the conditions and limitations laid down by each Member State.\u00a0 The Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 provides that the acceptance of bets that are subject to betting duty are exempt from VAT. The Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013, currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas, proposes to licence remote bookmakers and betting intermediaries. Once the Bill is enacted, section 49 of the Finance Act 2011, which provides that these operators are chargeable with betting duty and betting intermediary duty under Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the Finance Act 2002, will be commenced.<\/p><p>  The acceptance of bets is the supply of a service for VAT purposes.\u00a0 The place of supply of a service to a non-taxable person for VAT purposes is the place where the supplier s business is established.\u00a0 The extension of the betting duty to remote (online) bookmakers and betting intermediaries will not, of itself, bring such operators within the scope of Irish VAT if they are not established in Ireland.\u00a0 The specific facts of each case would have to be considered in deciding if an operator is established in Ireland.\u00a0 Similarly, the extension of the betting duty will not, of itself, bring operators within the charge to corporation tax.\u00a0 The corporation tax code looks at whether non-resident companies, which carry on a trade here through a branch or agency, are chargeable to tax by reference to whether the branch or agency-related income may be attributable to a permanent establishment here.<\/p><p>  Businesses, such as bookmakers, that are exempt from VAT are not required to register for VAT in relation to their supplies or to make bi-monthly VAT returns.\u00a0 Businesses that are registered for VAT generally make a bi-monthly return that simply provides details of the total VAT on sales and the total VAT on purchases.\u00a0 Businesses that are not established here have no requirement to make Irish VAT returns.\u00a0 For these combined reasons it is not possible to report the total tax revenue raised in 2013 from the industry.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their overall approach to tackling compliance is to make the appropriate intervention following careful appraisal of the risk factors in each case.\u00a0 Not all interventions conducted are in the form of an audit. The focus may vary from a comprehensive examination of all the taxes and duties for which a taxpayer may be liable, to a detailed check of a single tax-head, or a concentration on a single issue of concern.\u00a0 This targeted approach is greatly supported and enhanced with appropriate technology, including the Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling system REAP, integrating information obtained from multiple sources, and categorising taxpayers in accordance with defined risk criteria, including details of the compliance behaviour of the taxpayer in relation to filing and paying their taxes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800058#WRF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Betting Legislation","counter":312,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800058#WRF01100"},{"type":"question","counter":313,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[8101\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800058#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there is a prohibition on the advertising of betting on Gaelic football and any others sport under the Betting Act 1931; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":314,"content":"<p>Section 32 of the Betting Act 1931 deals with the prohibition of advertising relating to betting on football games and\u00a0provides that,\u00a0other than in the case of\u00a0the distribution of advertising by the registered proprietor of a registered premises in such premises,\u00a0\"it shall not be lawful for any person to write, print, publish or knowingly circulate any advertisement, circular or coupon advocating or inviting or otherwise relating to betting on football games or knowingly to cause or procure, or attempt to cause or procure, any such advertisement, circular or coupon to be written, printed, published or circulated\".<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware the Betting (Amendment) Bill, currently before the\u00a0House\u00a0\u00a0provides for the licensing and\u00a0regulation of the remote betting sector.\u00a0 Matters pertaining to public order\u00a0will form part of the forthcoming Gambling Control Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800058#WRF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget Measures","counter":315,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800058#WRF01400"},{"type":"question","counter":316,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[8154\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800058#WRF01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will reverse the budget 2014 measure regarding health insurance due to the fact that as a result health insurance premiums have been increased excessively; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"960","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":317,"content":"<p>In the first instance,\u00a0decisions taken to increase the cost of health insurance premiums are made by health insurance providers and are beyond my control. However, it is the case that in Budget 2014 tax relief for medical insurance premiums was restricted to the first &euro;1,000 per adult and the first &euro;500 per child insured.\u00a0 Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings no longer qualifies for tax relief.<\/p><p>  The cost of Income Tax relief in respect of medical insurance has increased significantly in recent years, estimated at &euro;404 million in 2011, &euro;448 million in 2012 and &euro;500 million in 2013. Despite the increasing cost of the relief, the number of individuals\u00a0insured\u00a0has reduced\u00a0over the same period, while at the same time the level of medical cover has decreased on some policies. Against this background the increase in costs is unsustainable. If the relief were to remain unchanged and the trend was to continue, the cost would increase to approximately &euro;1 billion by 2020.<\/p><p>  Prior to this reform the State was effectively paying 20% of the cost of all private medical insurance premiums via the system of income tax relief. In effect this means that those taxpayers who could never afford private health insurance, or who have had to give up their policies due to personal circumstances, are providing financial support via the tax system to those individuals who can afford such insurance.<\/p><p>  Although it is true that the restriction of the tax relief may have in some cases, led to a\u00a0net increase in medical insurance premiums payable by individuals, it should be noted that many would\u00a0only be affected marginally, depending on the cost of the policies that individuals choose to purchase.<\/p><p>  The measure to restrict tax relief in respect of medical insurance premiums was approved by the D&aacute;il via Financial Resolution on Budget night and confirmed by the Oireachtas via the enactment of Section 8 of Finance (No. 2) Act 2013, which was signed into law by the President on 18 December 2013.

No. 147 of 2013) as having \"significant pyritic damage\". These Regulations describe the methodology that must be used when a property is being assessed for pyrite damage. The assessing and testing procedures that must be carried out are highly technical and specialised and have to be carried out by an appropriately competent person such as an engineer or a geologist.<\/p><p>  The LPT exemption does not apply until such time as the property has been assessed and a certificate confirming &quot;significant pyritic damage&quot; has been issued.

While they are required to pay LPT for those periods, they may reclaim the tax paid if they obtained the certificate by 31 December 2013 and notified the Revenue Commissioners in writing by 31 January 2014. Such retrospective treatment only applies in relation to the years 2013 and 2014. The standard procedure is for homeowners to start the period of exemption from the liability date following the issue of the certificate. For example, a homeowner who has the relevant certificate on 1 November 2014 (liability date for 2015) can claim the exemption for the five year period of 2015 to 2019 but cannot reclaim LPT paid for any year prior to 2015.<\/p><p>  The rules governing when, and for how long, the exemption applies are complicated and are best explained by the use of examples.

Under this provision, rent received by landlords (individuals and companies) from property in the State is chargeable to tax under Case V, while income from trading activity in the State is chargeable under Case I. Therefore, for tax purposes, rental income is viewed as distinct from income arising from trading activity.<\/p><p>  In the case of trading activity, the law provides that taxable income is closely aligned to the accounting profit (subject to certain explicit prohibitions). In the case of rental activity, however, taxable income is the gross rent as reduced by a limited number of specified deductions as set out in section 97 (2) TCA 1997.<\/p><p>  These are:<\/p><p>  - any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;<\/p><p>  - the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;<\/p><p>  - the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property;<\/p><p>  - the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property (which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 75% of the interest and is subject to compliance with PRTB registration requirements for all tenancies that existed in relation to the property in the relevant year); and<\/p><p>  - payment of local authority rates.<\/p><p>  In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation. These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum of the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings over a period of 8 years.I have no plans to change the current taxation distinction between rental income and income arising from trading activity. Neither have I plans to extend the range of allowable deductions from gross rental income in arriving at taxable income for Case V purposes, save for my intention, as stated in earlier Parliamentary Questions to allow for a deduction for Local Property Tax.

An intensification by the Central Bank of its engagement with mortgage lenders to require them, under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) process, to propose and conclude sustainable and durable alternative arrangements to their customers in mortgage arrears; targets have, so far, been set for the period to end of June 2014 and by this date the banks will be required to have proposed sustainable solutions to 75% of mortgages which are more than 90 days in arrears and to have concluded solutions with 35% of such mortgages.<\/p><p>  2. Significant reforms to personal insolvency and the establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland to make it more accessible for people with unsustainable personal and mortgage debt to address their position;<\/p><p>  3.

My Department has provided funding towards the Irish element of this research and I look forward to the final report which is expected later in the year.   In January 2013, my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and I published the Action Plan on Bullying.

These actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying, including cyber bullying, are addressed. <\/p><p>  New National Procedures on Anti Bullying which include a specific reference to cyberbullying were launched last September. These are currently being adopted and implemented by all 4,000 primary and post primary schools in the country.<\/p><p>  My Department has supported awareness raising initiatives in relation to tackling bullying.

The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) does not have a role in setting the contractual hours of work of SNAs.<\/p><p>Secondly, in relation to working hours for SNAs I wish to confirm that no report was prepared for the Department regarding the working hours of Special Needs Assistants prior to the introduction of Circular Sp. Ed. 01\/05.<\/p><p>The contractual position in respect of the working hours of SNAs is as outlined in their contracts of employment which were agreed with the school management authorities and the relevant Trade Unions representing SNAs (IMPACT and SIPTU) prior to their introduction in 2005. Links to the SNA Contracts of Employment are as follows:Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12\/05 (Post-Primary)  Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 15\/05 (Primary)  <\/p><p>This contract of employment is augmented by all of the relevant Departmental Circulars governing Special Needs Assistants which detail the standardised terms and conditions of employment for SNAs. These Circulars are amended and new Circulars are issued by the Minister for Education and Skills from time to time. <\/p><p>The position regarding the working hours of full-time SNAs is as outlined in these standard SNA contracts of employment.  In that context, the standard SNA contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. <\/p><p>In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days. These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and\/or the normal school year. <\/p><p>SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment. Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours. I should point out that this divisor was agreed with both of the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) that represent SNAs.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the issue of appropriate working hours for all public servants was one of the key aspects of the set of proposals for a public service agreement which were put forward by the Labour Relations Commission and which now form the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (the Haddington Road Agreement). The specific text of the Haddington Road Agreement relating to working hours for SNAs is as follows:<\/p><p>&quot;SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTS HOURS.  Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions took place that led to agreement on changed attendance arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) that give schools the option of an additional two hours working time per week from each Special Needs Assistant. Under the terms of this Agreement on increased working hours in the Public Service, the available requirements in schools for additional hours for SNAs is quite limited. Given issues such as the duration of the school day and operation hours, and the specific availability of individual SNAs the details of the utilisation of any additional requirements should be the subject of further discussions.<\/p><p>These new attendance arrangements, allied to the provisions outlined in the above paragraph should be the subject of a review by the LRC in advance of the 2013\/2014 school year, involving the Department of Education and Skills and IMPACT\/SIPTU, in order to assess if the additional hours are being utilised in the most effective and appropriate manner and in order to achieve agreement on any changes deemed necessary in terms of the arrangement agreed for teachers.<\/p><p>This will constitute the liability on Special Needs Assistants in respect of working hours for the purposes of this extension to the Public Service Agreement.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800061#WRJ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Applications","counter":509,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800061#WRJ01450"},{"type":"question","counter":510,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[7976\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800061#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a student grant application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Westmeath will be approved in view of the fact that the applicant has provided proof of independent residence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Insurance companies make commercial decisions on the provision of insurance cover based on their assessment of the risks they would be accepting on a case by case basis but, where flood defence investments have been made and the standard of protection can be verified , I see no reason why the insurance industry cannot provide flood insurance cover in these communities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800063#WRL00300","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":641,"content":"<p>Question No. 323 answered with Question No. 321.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":642,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800063#WRL00450"},{"type":"question","counter":643,"qnumday":324,"qnumall":"[8072\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800063#WRL00500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 284 of 26 November 2013 regarding flooding of the River Deel, Crossmolina, County Mayo, if the consultant's report has been completed and assessed by the Office of Public Works; if he has received same; the stage at which the cost benefit analysis is at; when it is expected to be complete; when he expects further flood mitigation measures to be undertaken; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":644,"content":"<p>As outlined in my reply to your recent written representation on the same subject, adverse weather conditions last year delayed some in-river surveys being carried out, hence the delay in the production of the consultants' Options Report.<\/p><p>  A review of the Hydraulic and Hydrology report is now underway, which will be incorporated into the main report.

Approximately 70% of all FDI investments won by IDA Ireland is from the existing client base.<\/p><p>  When marketing Kerry for new inward investment IDA Ireland particularly focuses on the ICT (incl. software), International Financial Services and Globally Traded Business sector.  On 4 June last, MYMIC Global announced that twenty two jobs would be created in Valentia over the next three years.  In addition there will be a further 15 jobs in the construction phase.  The jobs announcement was made in conjunction with IDA Ireland, Kerry County Enterprise Board and the Valentia Island Development Company.<\/p><p>  There are many complex factors influencing investor location decision-making such as the increasing preference of investors globally for cities of scale with 1 million plus population, significant challenges from lower cost locations in the UK and Eastern Europe and attractive regional aid.<\/p><p>  I am determined to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for foreign direct investment and I am concerned about the lack of investment in certain regional locations.  I have, accordingly, requested IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to work with my Department so that we can explore what further initiatives we can take to ensure we have a better approach to enterprise development in regional locations. This exercise will complement the in-depth analysis of our FDI strategy which is currently being undertaken. This analysis, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, the changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that will be introduced in 2014 and our approach to regional development will inform the formulation of an appropriate FDI strategy from 2015 onwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800063#WRL02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Direct Investment","counter":678,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800063#WRL02850"},{"type":"question","counter":679,"qnumday":336,"qnumall":"[7772\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800063#WRL02900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the position regarding County Kerry's status for grant aid for foreign direct investment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":680,"content":"<p>The State&rsquo;s industrial development agencies can provide support to both Irish and Foreign companies under a range of State Aid measures, including Research, Development and Innovation Aid, Environmental Aid, Risk Finance, and Training Aid etc.<\/p><p>  In addition, of particular importance regarding foreign direct investment strategy are the Guidelines on Regional Aid (also known as Investment Aid), which were adopted by the European Commission on 19 June 2013.<\/p><p>  The Regional Aid Guidelines enable the State&rsquo;s industrial development agencies to pay grants, at enhanced rates, to businesses in order to support new investment and new employment in productive projects in Ireland's most disadvantaged regions.

In line with the public consultation procedures conducted under Section 57 of the Act of 2005, a draft of proposed regulations was published on the Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s website for a period of one month in early 2012, along with a Regulatory Impact Assessment and a copy of the Directive.  Draft regulations providing for transposition of the Directive in line with the principles contained in the Act of 2005 were subsequently transmitted by my Department to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (OPC) at the end of 2012. <\/p><p>  However, legal advice received from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (OPC) in early 2013 required a reversal of this approach, as concerns were raised about the suitability of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, as a vehicle for transposing this Directive.  My Department was subsequently advised that transposition should instead be effected using the Ministerial regulation making powers contained in section 3 of the European Communities Act 1972.  <\/p><p>  Officials from my Department and the Health and Safety Authority have been working together with the OPC on the framing of draft regulations, so as to expedite the transposition arrangements in a manner that is true to the spirit of the Directive, while also ensuring appropriate and proportionate enforcement measures attuned to our existing national regulatory framework.  The European Commission has been informed in the meantime of the legal issues that have given rise to the delayed transposition. <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the delay in the transposition of the Sharps directive, the Health and Safety Authority has produced a very clear guidance document, available on their website since last year, that outlines the procedures that must be followed in order to comply with the provisions of the Directive.  The requirements of the Directive have been brought to the attention of the healthcare sector, throughout the transposition period and since the date on which the Directive came into effect, in communications and presentations made by the HSA presentations at seminars including events held by the Institute of Occupational Health and Safety, Nursing Homes Ireland and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.

The scheme, which is means tested, is available to assist people whose homes are damaged by flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair.  Levels of payment depend on the relative severity of damage experienced and the household&rsquo;s ability to meet these costs ensuring that the funding is appropriately targeted.  Humanitarian assistance does not include risks that are covered by insurance policies or cover business or commercial losses. <\/p><p>  In dealing with events of this nature the Department generally adopts a three stage approach as follows: <\/p><p>-   Stage 1 is to provide emergency income support payments for food, clothing, personal items and temporary accommodation in the immediate aftermath of the event. A relatively small amount of financial assistance is generally provided initially but this will increase as the extent of the problems become clearer. <\/p><p>-   Stage 2 generally involves the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items. It is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes will become known. <\/p><p>-   Stage 3 is to identify what longer term financial support or works are required. It could take several months before this stage of response commences and this involves a cross Departmental\/Agency response. Works carried out can include plastering, dry-lining, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring and painting. <\/p><p>  Following the June 2012 flooding, approximately 120 payments were made to affected householders in the Cork area to the value of some &euro;150,000.

The programme is funded by the Department of Social Protection with day-to-day management of contracts undertaken by Pobal.  Some 425 not-for-profit companies and co-operatives shared annual funding of &euro;46m from the programme in 2013.  Contract holders must deliver tangible services that are capable of generating non-public revenues from their operations by way of charging fees, sales and\/or fundraising and other public funds.  The programme is not intended to represent full-funding for any operation.<\/p><p>  Each contract holder is responsible for their own budgets, income, financial and other liabilities.  Contracts are generally offered on a three-year cycle based on a business plan or similar submitted by the company.  Continued funding is subject to satisfactory compliance with the programme&rsquo;s operational requirements, financial position of the company, continued eligibility of the company and service, progress on delivery of the stated objectives in the business plan, and an assessment of a business plan for the following three year contact cycle.  A regular review process is undertaken to ensure compliance with contract obligations, audit issues, continuing capacity of the organisation to manage public funds, the need for and quality of service delivery, sustainability, and value for money.<\/p><p>  A re-contracting process for the period 2014-16 for organisations operating under the Community Services Strand of the programme was undertaken in 2013.  This involved the submission of business plans by contracted organisations.  These business plans and past performance were reviewed by Pobal and the conclusions submitted to the Department for consideration and decision.  The business plan and operations of the company referred to by the Deputy was reviewed under this process.  The company in question was approved for a funding contribution for one full time manager post and eight full-time equivalent posts (FTE) plus &euro;25,000 operational funding per annum up to end of 2013 with a total value of &euro;209,264 pa.  The business plan submitted by the company as part of the 2014-16 review process was considered to have limitations including the demonstrated level of activity for the level of funds granted.  The level of output delivered by the company was considered low when compared with similar services.  While the continued need for programme support was recognised, both Pobal and the Department are concerned about the value for money being delivered for the high level of public funds provided to the company.  In particular, the level of output delivered by the company was less than that delivered by similar operations.  <\/p><p>  The programme&rsquo;s contribution to the company&rsquo;s turnover has increased in recent years and is significantly above the level generally accepted for companies supported by the programme.  In light of these conclusions, approval for a reduced level of funding was given.  The phased reduction in funding over 2014 to 2016 will ensure value for money is delivered and should stimulate the company into diversifying its income sources and increase productivity to underpin its ongoing sustainability and decrease its dependence on CSP funding to more satisfactory levels.

Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in relation to protecting people from poverty.  To allow us to protect these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments including the household benefits package. <\/p><p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen each year with the number of eligible customers also increasing significantly.  In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013, an increase of 25%.  Each year almost 10,000 extra customers became eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients. <\/p><p>  I am keenly aware of the impact on the Department&rsquo;s customers and particularly those who are living alone. In Budget 2014, I was able to maintain the rate of the living alone allowance at &euro;7.70 per week.  While the decision to the telephone allowance was a difficult one it allowed my Department to maintain at the same rates the other elements of the household benefits package, such as the free electricity\/gas allowance and the free television licence.  These are very valuable supports for customers. We have also maintained the value of the fuel allowance and free travel. <\/p><p>  The monthly allowances under the household benefits package are a contribution towards the cost of services; they are not intended to meet those costs in full.  The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephones were expensive and uncommon and a landline service was the only option available to the customer.  The market has changed enormously since the introduction of the allowance, with several companies providing a range of services and rates with bundled services including television, telephone and broadband and pay-as-you-go mobiles. <\/p><p>  The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government operates the seniors alert scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes.  The budget allocation for 2013 was &euro;2.35 million.

","asker":"1023","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":778,"content":"<p>Food poverty can be defined as 'the inability to have an adequate and nutritious diet due to issues of affordability and accessibility.'  Food poverty is a complex multidimensional issue and impacts on a range of policy areas.  There are many factors which can impact on food poverty: level of income, the cost of food, the availability of healthy food, access to food outlets and education and culture. <\/p><p>  There is no official measure of food poverty in Ireland.  In 2011, the Department published a technical paper on the construction of a food poverty indicator based on the analysis of food-related deprivation items in the Central Statistics Office Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC), developed in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).  Using this methodology, the latest (2011) figure for food poverty is 11 per cent of the population, as calculated by the ESRI. It is not possible to provide local level data on this food poverty indicator because of the sample size in SILC.  <\/p><p>  The Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s primary role is to provide income supports to sustain an adequate standard of living and to prevent poverty. Welfare payments and other social transfers are very effective in reducing the at-risk-of-poverty rate.  Recently published ESRI research shows that welfare payments and other social transfers lifted almost 40 per cent of the population out of at-risk-of-poverty in 2011, which equates to a reduction of 71 per cent in the pre-social transfer poverty rate.  As a result, Ireland is among the best performing countries in the EU in reducing poverty through social transfers. This reflects the continuation of substantial State investment in the social protection system, despite the challenges and constraints of the economic and fiscal crisis. <\/p><p>  In addition, my Department administers the school meals programme as a targeted intervention for children at risk of food poverty and educational disadvantage. In 2013, the Department provided &euro;37 million for food provision to almost 205,000 children, in over 1,600 schools and organisations.  The Department also supports Healthy Food for All, a national charitable organisation, which works to improve access, availability and affordability of healthy food for low-income groups, by developing community and school food initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800064#WRM04900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":781,"qnumday":372,"qnumall":"[7666\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800065#WRN00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide an update on the introduction of a new fund to support the provision of food and consumer products for persons who are the most deprived; if this will have &euro;3.5million in funding from the EU and Exchequer; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1023","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":782,"content":"<p>The European Council has advised that the regulation to create and underpin the operations of this new EU Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived will be adopted by the Council in early March and will come into effect shortly thereafter.

While there is no pre-determined level of replacement rate, which would influence every individual&rsquo;s decision to work, higher replacement rates may indicate lower incentives to take up employment.  In this regard a replacement rate in excess of 70% may be considered to be excessive.  <\/p><p>  Replacement rate analysis, as supported by research by the ESRI, demonstrates that the great majority of people on the Live Register have a strong financial incentive to work and significant numbers leave the Register each year. In this regard it may be noted that almost three-quarters of the people on the Live Register are only claiming a personal rate for themselves. They are either single or may have a spouse or partner who is working. In addition, 53% of the people on the Live Register receive less than the maximum personal weekly rate. <\/p><p>  High replacement rates are generally associated with a relatively high number of dependent children and\/or receipt of rent or mortgage supplement. However, it is important to note that, as the following table demonstrates, only a very small and decreasing proportion of persons on the Live Register are in receipt of these additional supports. <table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Rent Supplement<\/th><th>Mortgage Interest Supplement<\/th><th>Local Authority Mortgage Allowance<\/th><th>% of Live Register availing of  these supports<\/th><th>Total Live Register <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>44,247<\/td><td>10,880<\/td><td>152<\/td><td>12.7%<\/td><td>434,784<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>39,377<\/td><td>8,078<\/td><td>90<\/td><td>11.2%<\/td><td>423,733<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>34,531<\/td><td>4,766<\/td><td>39<\/td><td>9.9%<\/td><td>395,411<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>  Reductions in the numbers of people in receipt of housing support has been the major factor in achieving reductions in instances of high replacement rates.

Arising out of commitments in the Programme for Government to review the operation of the rent supplement scheme, proposals to integrate the systems for providing rent supplement and social housing support have been advanced. It is intended to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from the Department of Social Protection (currently provided through rent supplement) to housing authorities using a new housing assistance payment.<\/p><p>  The effect of this transfer and the introduction of a new form of housing assistance payment will be to address one of the significant disincentives to accessing full-time employment that exists under the rent supplement scheme.

Customers who have switched to other companies receive a direct monthly cash payment.<\/p><p>  A poverty impact assessment was carried out in late 2011 in the context of developing a range of options for the administration of the household benefits package in a de-regulated domestic energy market. The assessment focused on the potential impact of changing the electricity allowance from a unit base to a cash base to avail of cheaper rates available. It also examined the issue of the vulnerability of older people who are the main recipients of the household benefits package. <\/p><p>  Before January 2013, the free electricity allowance was based on Electric Ireland standard units even though it was possible to avail of cheaper rates from other companies.  The poverty impact assessment noted that there was little incentive for customers to switch to other cheaper companies.  Only 16% of social welfare customers had switched companies to avail of cheaper rates, compared to 42% nationally.  With the units based approach it was not possible for customers to carry over any saved units from Electric Ireland to other companies;  this acted as a disincentive for customers wishing to obtain better value.  Under the new cash credit system, it is now possible for a customer with Electric Ireland to transfer to other companies while maintaining their cash credit.<\/p><p>  Current data shows that Ireland&rsquo;s pensioners have the lowest consistent poverty rate and as a group compared to the rest of the population are least likely to be at risk of poverty - pointing to the adequacy and importance of the State pension and other benefits.  Between 2004 and 2011, consistent poverty for older people (those over 65) fell from 3.9% to 1.9%.  The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate for people in that age group also fell, from 27.1% to 16% over the same period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800066#WRO02500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":885,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800066#WRO02550"},{"type":"question","counter":886,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[8209\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800066#WRO02600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will review the situation whereby a person is only permitted on a T&uacute;s scheme for a maximum period of 12 months; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

A report on the hull condition of the vessel, commissioned by INT in April 2013, highlighted serious safety concerns. Based on the report&rsquo;s findings, INT issued a &lsquo;Notice to Vacate&rsquo; to both of the businesses that had been operating from the vessel. <\/p><p>  The Deputies will also be aware that Waterways Ireland, given the health and safety concerns arising from the condition of the vessel, offered, as the property owners of the Grand Canal Dock, to arrange for the removal and disposal of the ship on INT's behalf.  I am advised that INT accepted the offer and confirmed its approval to Waterways Ireland to dispose of the vessel on its behalf on the ground of the health and safety risks arising. <\/p><p>Unfortunately, the position is that the Naomh &Eacute;anna has deteriorated substantially in the past 20 years and presents a real risk in the Grand Canal Basin. I understand that significant investment would be required to bring the vessel to the point where it would be safe and insurable. Accordingly, to mitigate the risks, Waterways Ireland proposes to move the Naomh &Eacute;anna to an adjacent dry dock, under a short-term licence agreement with NAMA, from where it will be dismantled under contract. The vessel&rsquo;s condition will not support its movement out of the Dock and I am advised by Waterways Ireland that this is the only practical way of ensuring the vessel does not sink in the main Dock, thereby giving rise to considerable additional expense. I am also advised that extensive works, entailing considerable additional costs, would be required to preserve the   already unstable hull of the vessel.  <\/p><p>Deputies will recall that a commitment was given in this House last Thursday that a meeting would be convened of the accountable bodies in this area, including my own Department, Waterways Ireland and other relevant bodies, to determine if anything can be done to avert the disposal of the Naomh &Eacute;anna at this time. I wish to inform the House that meeting took place but concluded that the proper course of action to be taken now is to proceed with the disposal of the vessel. This will now be done. Accordingly, I am advised that it is not feasible to   allow an opportunity for 16 weeks or six months as proposed for any interested group to provide a plan that would attract investment in the vessel's restoration.<\/p><p>This decision has not been taken lightly.

My decision on the consent application provided, inter alia, for the full repair and restoration of the monument buildings and the creation of a commemorative centre to honour the leaders of the 1916 Rising.<\/p><p>  My Department has recently received confirmation from the National Asset Management Agency that it has approved funding for works covered by the consent I have given under the National Monuments Acts, subject to compliance with all statutory processes. The arrangements for the disbursement of the NAMA funding are a matter for the Agency itself. <\/p><p>  The national monument is in private ownership and, accordingly, the advancement of proposals that reflect the terms of the consent I have granted is a matter for the owners.  The consent is, however, conditional on a revised project design that takes full account of the terms of my decision being submitted for my approval within 9 months of the decision date.  A further condition requires substantive works to commence on site within 3 months of the approval of the revised proposals.  <\/p><p>  There have been a number of meetings between my Department and the monument owners in the meantime to discuss and clarify various aspects of the 52 detailed conditions set out in the consent order with the intention of ensuring that the designs for the approved works are fully compliant with what I have prescribed.  There have also been discussions in relation to the site investigations needed to determine the works that will be necessary to stabilise and underpin the monument buildings.  As part of these investigations, the cellars under the yards to the rear of monument buildings, which I understand were in use until relatively recently, have been re-opened and are currently being cleared out.  <\/p><p>  My understanding is that the completed designs for the approved works will be submitted to me in the near future to verify that they are in compliance with the consent order.  They will be assessed as quickly as possible on receipt to establish whether they conform to the terms of my decision on the consent application.  The consultation procedures prescribed under the National Monuments Acts have already been completed in this case as part of the processing of the consent application and related Environmental Impact Assessment.  No.18 Moore Street is outside the bounds of the Preservation Order in this case and my role in relation to that building is confined to ensuring that any works to it do not adversely impact on the adjacent national monument.   <\/p><p>  As the national monument is not in the ownership of the State, the practical arrangements for the proposed survey of the national monument buildings by the 1916 relatives&rsquo; representative group, which the monument owners have agreed to in principle, are matters for the group and the owners to agree.  The arrangements for the management of the buildings once work is completed is primarily a matter for the owners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800067#WRP02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Film Industry Development","counter":954,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800067#WRP02450"},{"type":"question","counter":955,"qnumday":430,"qnumall":"[7806\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800067#WRP02500","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"his plans to expand the Irish Film industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Tsunami threats to Ireland include; a repeat of the 1755 magnitude 8.6 Lisbon earthquake, which GSI-commissioned modelling predicts could generate waves up to 4m high on the southern Irish coastline (see    ); the seismic zone responsible for this earthquake, and a similar one in 1761 that also produced a tsunami, is a fault zone called the Azores-Gibralter fracture that continues to be active and has had a few relatively large but non-tsunamigenic earthquakes in recent years; the 1755 and 1761 tsunamis were the last authenticated tsunami impacts on the Irish coast. Other potential tsunami generating events would include earthquakes along the Caribbean plate margin, submarine landslides and volcanic activity in the Canaries.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. The regulation of the industry, including regulatory issues surrounding speeds, is a matter for ComReg, which is independent in the exercise of its functions. Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on a number of websites, including ComReg&rsquo;s website at   , as well as the websites of individual commercial operators.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses including those in Counties Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois and Meath. This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>  -  a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and<\/p><p>  -  a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m addresses with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively. Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings. The ESB Electronic Communications Bill, which I introduced last month, is a further step in promoting investment in competitively priced high speed broadband which is likely to include the prospect of fibre to the home services. The Bill will, when enacted, enable the ESB to utilise its electricity distribution network to provide telecommunications services in the Irish market.<\/p><p>  I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in a number of locations referred to in the Questions, including Kildare town in County Kildare, Borris in Ossory in County Laois and Dunshaughlin in County Meath before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss this further with the Deputies concerned. <\/p><p>  Many of these developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. <\/p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. <\/p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA). Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing. In many cases, this includes follow-up queries and requests for further information. The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines. When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country. When this process is complete, it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government&rsquo;s proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country. <\/p><p>  In designing the procurement process for the intervention, my Department will be required to comply with the EU State aid rules which set out conditionality in relation to, among other things, technology neutrality. As different technological solutions exist to provide broadband services, no particular technology or network platform should be excluded. The EU State aid guidelines do, however, emphasise the role of fibre in assisting the delivery of high speed broadband through various platforms.<\/p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800068#WRQ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"North-South Interconnector Issues","counter":1011,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800068#WRQ01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1012,"qnumday":454,"qnumall":"[7559\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800068#WRQ01500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will clarify if an underground route-specific analysis of the North-South interconnector was ever carried out by EirGrid's consultants (details supplied), and if such a study took place would a map of the specific route analysed be made available to the public; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS) was extended nationally in 2013 and is now operational nationwide. PASS will assist housing authorities to report on the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed and 2014 will be the first year for which PASS will produce composite national data. These reports will be published on my Department's website as soon as they are available.   In advance of the composite national data on homelessness to be available through PASS, the most complete set of data available in relation to homelessness nationally is the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s special Census report, <i>Homeless Persons in Ireland<\/i>, which was published on 6 September 2012. This report indicated that a total of 64 individuals were sleeping rough on Census night, 10 April 2011, while identifying a further 3,744 people as housed in accommodation defined as emergency, transitional or long-term. Of the total of 3,808 individuals included in the report almost 60% were in long-term or transitional housing arrangements. This report is available on CSO's website, . <\/p><p>  In February 2013, I published the Government&rsquo;s <i>Homelessness Policy Statement<\/i> in which the Government's aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined. The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness. The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.   <\/p><p>The Homelessness Oversight Group, which I established in 2013 for the purposes of reviewing the progress of the approach being advocated in the statement, identifying obstacles and proposing solutions has submitted its first report to me.

In addition, under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, the Minister for Finance, from 2014 onwards, is to pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this will contribute to a range of financial supports being provided to local authorities, including General Purpose Grants and funding, on the basis of Service Level Agreements, for water services which local authorities will be providing on behalf of Irish Water. <\/p><p>The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised.

","asker":"1057","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1253,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, in May 2013, the Garda S&iacute;ochana Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) made a Report to me under Section 80(5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 following its investigation into allegations of collusion between an individual and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both the Commissioner and myself have been careful not to refer publically to any individual relating to that report.  It is also important to note that, having received the papers submitted by  GSOC, the Director of Public Prosecutions directed no charges against members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or anyone else.  The Report by GSOC contains a series of recommendations related to informant handling procedures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, oversight of those procedures, as well as intelligence handling and information exchange between GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  At the time I sought the observations of the Garda Commissioner on the Report and its recommendations.  The Garda Commissioner has pointed out the many changes which has been made to its handling of these matters  in recent years including the putting in place of a code of practice for the management of Covert Human Intelligence Sources.  As such, many of the recommendations made by GSOC were already incorporated into Garda procedures, including improved training for Garda&iacute;, the development of an electronic system for maintaining records, placing emphasis on the necessity for Garda&iacute; to comply with professional standards, strict procedures for handling and disseminating intelligence as well as coordination between specialist units and robust internal auditing.  The Commissioner also emphasised that informants are clearly instructed that they may not commit crimes or act as   <i>agents provocateur.<\/i><\/p><p>  Although it is not referred to in the GSOC Report, I should emphasise that there has been, since 2010, an independent, external oversight mechanism in place to ensure compliance with the code of practice of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the management and use of Covert Human Intelligence Sources.  The current holder of this appointment is Mr Justice Thomas Smyth, former judge of the High Court.  In addition to monitoring compliance with the code of practice, Mr. Justice Smyth&rsquo;s remit requires him to communicate any matters which he considers appropriate, including recommendations, to the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to report to the Minister for Justice and Equality annually on the discharge of his functions.<\/p><p>  In the wider context  I have previously advised this House that following receipt of the GSOC Report I convened a meeting  with the Garda Commissioner and the Chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission on 23 July last to discuss the need for enhanced cooperation between the organisations to ensure the effective and efficient investigation of allegations of Garda misconduct.  Both the Commissioner and the Chairperson agreed on the need for the highest possible level of cooperation between the two organisations. In that regard the Garda Commissioner has established a dedicated office within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to process and monitor requests from GSOC and ensure all correspondence with GSOC is attended to in a timely manner.  In addition, revised protocols were agreed and signed by the Chairperson of the Garda Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Commissioner on the 23rd September 2013.  These revised protocols put in place clear procedures for the timely sharing of information, including sensitive information and access to PULSE, and more generally for enhanced cooperation.  These protocols will be subject to further amendments in lights of the recent agreement that the Ombudsman Commission will have direct access to the PULSE system for the penalty points investigation and any other investigation in which they are engaged.  Finally, I should mention that a committee has also been established, chaired by a senior official of my Department, with senior representatives from the Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to act as a forum where any future emerging issues concerning the protocols can be identified and appropriately addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800071#WRT04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insolvency Service of Ireland Remit","counter":1254,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800071#WRT04150"},{"type":"question","counter":1255,"qnumday":543,"qnumall":"[7503\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800071#WRT04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; that have sought advice on insolvency arrangements; the number of garda&iacute; who have availed of the personal insolvency arrangements since 2010; if garda&iacute; are allowed to avail of the personal insolvency regime here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Details in respect of each category are as follows:<\/p><p><b><i>Criminal Legal Aid<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his\/her means are insufficient to enable him\/her to pay for legal representation him\/herself.  The assignment of lawyers or the granting of aid are matters for the Court and, as such, are handled by the judiciary on the applicant's appearance in court.  Unfortunately figures are not kept in such a way as to be able to provide a breakdown by county of the number of certificates granted for criminal legal aid.<\/p><p><b><i>Civil Legal Aid<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  The Legal Aid Board is a statutory, independent body in accordance with the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995. The issue raised by the Deputy is a matter for the Board.  However, in order to be helpful to the Deputy I have had enquiries made with the Board.<\/p><p>  The Legal Aid Board operates 30 general full time law centres in 23 different counties.  The number of applicants in each of the last three years at the law centre(s) in each of the counties in which the Board has a full time presence are detailed below.  The Board has six general law centres in Dublin and two general law centres in both Cork and Galway.  In addition, the Board also operates part time law centres in the counties where it does not have a full time presence. Each of these centres is operated by a full time centre and the numbers getting services at these centres are included in the applications figure for the full time centre. I should point out that the Board operates a part-time centre in Drogheda which is operated by its law centre in Monaghan (rather than its law centre in Dundalk).<\/p><p>  Furthermore, I wish to advise the Deputy that persons seeking legal services can apply at any law centre and are not required to apply within the county in which they reside.  Thus the figures are not reflective of the addresses by county of the applicants. This particular information is not readily available.<\/p><p>  Law centres are almost invariably unable to offer legal services to all on demand and are obliged to operate a waiting list system for non prioritised matters. However every applicant is offered an appointment with a solicitor assuming that they meet the financial eligibility criteria and that their issue is of a nature that comes within the remit of the civil legal aid scheme. At that appointment they will get legal advice. Some applicants require representation in court either to take court proceedings or to defend court proceedings. In those cases the solicitor makes an application to the Board for a legal aid certificate on the person&rsquo;s behalf. The Board does not retain a breakdown by law centre of the number of these applications that are granted\/refused.<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><b>Number of applicants in each of the last three years at the law centre(s) in each of the counties in which the Board has a full time presence<\/b><table><tr><th><div>County<\/div><\/th><th><div>2013<\/div><\/th><th><div>2012<\/div><\/th><th><div>2011<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td><div>193<\/div><\/td><td><div>279<\/div><\/td><td><div>281<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td><div>472<\/div><\/td><td><div>582<\/div><\/td><td><div>739<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td><div>1,809<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,208<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,357<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td><div>643<\/div><\/td><td><div>636<\/div><\/td><td><div>670<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin <\/td><td><div>4,532<\/div><\/td><td><div>5,600<\/div><\/td><td><div>4,821<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td><div>871<\/div><\/td><td><div>939<\/div><\/td><td><div>603<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td><div>610<\/div><\/td><td><div>609<\/div><\/td><td><div>611<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td><div>858<\/div><\/td><td><div>884<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,027<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td><div>784<\/div><\/td><td><div>747<\/div><\/td><td><div>836<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td><div>406<\/div><\/td><td><div>523<\/div><\/td><td><div>622<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td><div>707<\/div><\/td><td><div>853<\/div><\/td><td><div>732<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td><div>444<\/div><\/td><td><div>378<\/div><\/td><td><div>383<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td><div>320<\/div><\/td><td><div>381<\/div><\/td><td><div>379<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td><div>371<\/div><\/td><td><div>393<\/div><\/td><td><div>398<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td><div>785<\/div><\/td><td><div>574<\/div><\/td><td><div>560<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td><div>371<\/div><\/td><td><div>469<\/div><\/td><td><div>389<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td><div>349<\/div><\/td><td><div>423<\/div><\/td><td><div>408<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td><div>319<\/div><\/td><td><div>459<\/div><\/td><td><div>319<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td><div>632<\/div><\/td><td><div>503<\/div><\/td><td><div>636<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td><div>505<\/div><\/td><td><div>562<\/div><\/td><td><div>580<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td><div>511<\/div><\/td><td><div>557<\/div><\/td><td><div>550<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td><div>498<\/div><\/td><td><div>590<\/div><\/td><td><div>589<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td><div>557<\/div><\/td><td><div>696<\/div><\/td><td><div>797<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800072#WRU03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Aid Service Expenditure","counter":1306,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800072#WRU03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1307,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[7810\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800072#WRU03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the annual cost to the Exchequer for free legal aid; if a county breakdown exists for this figure; if the legal professional recipients of free legal aid will be disclosed; his plans to limit the amount of times a person can avail of free legal aid or at least change the free status to affordable, where a portion of income would be deducted in exchange for legal aid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1308,"content":"<p>The reply is as follows:<\/p><p><b><i>Criminal Legal Aid<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  The annual cost of criminal legal aid for the last four years is as follows:<table><tr><th>Year <\/th><th>Total Amount of Expenditure <br \/><br \/>(&euro; million)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>56.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>56.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>50.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013 <\/td><td>50.9<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>  The Deputy will note that the total expenditure for 2012 is &euro;5.6 million less than that for 2011.  This decrease in expenditure is mostly attributed to a reduction of 10% in fees payable which was implemented on 1 October 2011.  Unfortunately figures are not kept in such a way as to be able to provide a breakdown by county. <\/p><p>  The Courts Policy Division of my Department will forward a list outlining payments made under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme to solicitors and barristers in 2013 to the Deputy.<\/p><p>  The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted in certain circumstances for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his\/her means are insufficient to enable him\/her to pay for legal representation him\/herself.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that an accused person who faces serious charges is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence and if they cannot afford to pay for legal representation, there is a right to legal aid.  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend him\/herself in person or through legal assistance of his\/her own choosing or, if he\/she has insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.<\/p><p>  There is no limit to the number of occasions a person can be granted legal aid under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme.<\/p><p>  A new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is planned to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Consideration is being given to including in the Bill provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  Provision to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.  These provisions must have regard to a person's rights to the presumption of innocence, to a fair trial and to be given legal aid, where appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800072#WRU03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":1309,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800072#WRU03250"},{"type":"question","counter":1310,"qnumday":563,"qnumall":"[7835\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800072#WRU03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the procedure to be followed in order to regularise the status in the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 7; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1311,"content":"<p>Given that the person concerned had no valid basis to remain in the State, he was, by letter dated 31st October, 2012, notified that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.

The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of whole-time teacher equivalents to the prisons through the ETBs (220 in the academic year 2012\/13).  The Service seeks to deliver relevant programmes that cater for holistic needs, ensure broad access and high participation, and prioritise those with basic education needs. It promotes the principles of adult and community education and supports a multi-disciplinary approach within the prison system. <\/p><p>  Programmes are adapted to take account of the diversity of the prisoner population and the complex nature of prison life, including segregation requirements and high levels of prisoner turnover. Educational courses and curricula which are based on individuals participating in one or more subject areas for an academic year and then sitting examinations are only appropriate for a small number of prisoners. <\/p><p>  The Junior and Leaving Certificate courses are available but increasing numbers of prisoners require a more flexible curriculum which has multiple entry and exit points that take account of prior educational attainment. FETAC accreditation is therefore widely used with assessment by portfolio compilation. All prison Education Centres meet the quality assurance standards demanded by FETAC. <\/p><p>  Organisations who provide in-reach education roles include Open University, the Samaritans, the Red Cross, Grow, Toe by Toe, Writers and Artists in prison. Other courses run through the education centres include pre-release programmes, parenting, hairdressing, Alternatives to Violence.  The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the new Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning including Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.   <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800073#WRV01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Investigation","counter":1352,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800073#WRV01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1353,"qnumday":577,"qnumall":"[8132\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800073#WRV01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will re-examine the new evidence in relation to the death of a person (details supplied).","asker":"1017","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1354,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has responded on a number of occasions to correspondence concerning the case in question and I myself wrote to the person referred to on 1 October.

In light of the additional funds now available it is my intention to broaden the remit of my Department's 2014 capital programme immediately to encompass to the greatest extent possible repair works on publically-owned, fishery and aquaculture-related piers, slipways and infrastructure in harbours damaged by the storms. With that in mind, I will be inviting local authorities to follow up on their estimates of damage by applying for funding under the programme and to indicate their prioritised list of eligible projects on a county-by-county basis for consideration for funding for repair of the damage caused by the recent storms. The funding will be focussed on infrastructural repairs to fisheries and aquaculture-related harbours, piers and slipways.  <\/p><p>  In addition to the funding to be provided to local authorities, my Department will be moving to repair storm damage to piers, harbours and coastal infrastructure in its direct ownership. This will include moving as quickly as possible to repair the significant storm damage to North Harbour in Cape Clear, west Cork; Dunmore East Fishery Harbour Centre, County Waterford; the Gun Rock beacon, Inisboffin, County Mayo; the West Cove navigational beacon, County Kerry; and Roonagh Pier, County Mayo. <\/p><p>  In relation to inshore fishermen, a temporary one-off scheme of assistance to these pot fishermen will be administered by Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The scheme will be focused on smaller inshore fishermen, with vessels under 15 metres. It will provide a set amount of &euro;24 per lobster pot lost or &euro;12 per shrimp pot lost, equivalent to 40% of the replacement cost, and will be capped at a maximum of 50 pots for under 12 metre vessels and 100 for under 15 metre vessels.  A fisherman who has lost 100 pots at the replacement cost of approximately &euro;6,000 will receive assistance of a little under &euro;2,500. While I am conscious that some pot fishermen have reported losses of several hundred pots, I believe these are exceptional cases.  <\/p><p>  A fisherman availing of these schemes will be required to provide certain evidence to BIM to show that he was actively pot fishing in the months before the storms and evidence of purchase of pots that were lost. In addition, he will be required to make a sworn declaration concerning his losses. The budget for this Scheme will be borne by the existing Vote within my Department and is not additional funding. There is no scope to increase this budget further, so I am emphasising that should applications exceed this budget, the rate of assistance will be reduced, either in terms of the amount of payment per pot or the maximum number of pots, in order to remain within a managed budget.<\/p><p>  The Deputies will agree that these are significant interventions in the current economic circumstances and are a clear indication of this Government's commitment to rural coastal communities and the inshore fishing sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800074#WRW03500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Payments","counter":1443,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800074#WRW03550"},{"type":"question","counter":1444,"qnumday":611,"qnumall":"[7547\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800074#WRW03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the full farm payment for 2013 has been paid in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Carlow; and if all issues are now resolved for 2013 and 2014.","asker":"965","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1445,"content":"<p>The 2013 Single Farm Payment\/Disadvantaged Areas&rsquo; Scheme application of the person named was selected for a ground eligibility\/cross compliance inspection. <\/p><p>  The cross compliance inspection identified breaches in relation to cattle identification and registration requirements resulting in a 1% penalty being applied to the 2013 payments.<\/p><p>  The ground eligibility inspection identified discrepancies between the area declared and the area found, resulting in an over-declaration in area of less than 2 hectares in respect of the Single Payment Scheme.

The EU Commission, being the competent authority for agreeing sanitary and phytosanitary matters on behalf of the EU informed the OIE, the international organisation for animal health. <\/p><p>  The EU Commission proposed, under Chapter 4 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, to provisionally exclude the affected region in Lithuania from exporting pigs and pigmeat to other countries including Russia, thereby &ldquo;regionalising&rdquo; the outbreak and allowing other EU Member States not affected by the disease to trade freely in live pigs, pigmeat and pigmeat products.  <\/p><p>  The value of the Terrestrial Code is twofold; the measures published in it are the result of consensus among the veterinary authorities of OIE members, and it constitutes a reference within the World Trade Organisation Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures as an international standard for animal health and zoonoses.  <\/p><p>  However, the Russian Federation and Customs Union refused to accept regionalisation of the disease and imposed a ban on all exports of pigs, pigmeat and pigmeat products from the EU certified after 26 January 2013.  <\/p><p>  A meeting took place last week in Vilnius between the EU Commission and Russian Federation   and while no progress was registered the Commission continues to pursue the matter with urgency. <\/p><p>  I am in agreement with the EU Commission that the ban is  disproportionate as it does not respect the OIE rules on regionalisation.  The Commission services are currently considering instigating a WTO panel action against the Russian Federation for its non-respect of the regionalisation provision.<\/p><p>  I spoke on the matter at the Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday of this week and I confirmed that Ireland supports the Commission approach to protecting the OIE based regionalisation approach to managing animal disease outbreaks. I urged fellow Member States to continue to act as one on this issue and to show support for the Commission`s approach to dealing with the current difficulty.<\/p><p>  I warned that time is running out for producers and processors in the EU and I encouraged the Commission to step up its efforts to find a solution soon. This solution needs to bring to an end to this unnecessary blanket ban on EU product while assuring the continued protection of the EU against the threat of animal disease.<\/p><p>  My Department officials met with industry representatives last week to update them on developments and will continue this arrangement until the matter is resolved.<\/p><p>  On a positive note the Russian Federation agreed this week to lift the ban on finished product containing pork subject to certain conditions and treatment of the meat before export.  This however accounts for only a small proportion of our exports to Russia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800075#WRX01000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sheepmeat Sector","counter":1477,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800075#WRX01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1478,"qnumday":622,"qnumall":"[7824\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800075#WRX01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding changes to payments in the sheep farming sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1479,"content":"<p>In developing the shape of the new system of Direct Payments in Ireland, I have been very conscious of the needs of sheep farmers, in particular those who farm on hill and commonage land.

This higher throughput has led to factories giving preference to certain types of stock that are better suited to the requirements of their retail customers. Prices for &lsquo;in-spec&rsquo; steers and heifers are relatively stable. While the young bull trade is challenging at present as age and weight issues continue to affect demand, the young bull kill has increased by 60% between week 1 and week 6 of 2014.<\/p><p>  The Irish beef industry is hugely dependent on exports and the need to ensure that it is producing efficiently for overseas markets cannot be ignored. Finished cattle prices continue to be impacted by weak demand, particularly for manufacturing beef, in key export markets. One of the main difficulties in marketing young bulls over 16 months at age is that these animals are outside the specifications preferred by the UK market. This is a major disadvantage at present because the UK market has effectively become the highest-priced beef market in the EU.<\/p><p>  With regard to winter finishers, it must be remembered that most cattle are traded several times during their lifetime based on their perceived value to producers and the price at which they are bought and sold is determined by supply and demand in the marketplace. The particular difficulties experienced by producers who market cattle over the winter period were considered by the Beef 2020 Activation Group, which was established to set out the actions necessary to achieve Food Harvest 2020 targets. The Group&rsquo;s report noted that a more widespread use of contracts would provide price certainty for winter finishers but acknowledged the problems faced by the processing industry in moving to a generalised contract system. <\/p><p>  Bull beef production is a specialised system of production and delays in young bull slaughtering undoubtedly put pressure on producer profit margins. However, neither I nor any Agriculture Minister can interfere in a trade that is cyclical in nature and prone to short-term price fluctuations. I am, of course, entirely sympathetic to those farmers still facing difficulties in getting their cattle slaughtered but I have no function in relation to commercial transactions between the meat factories and their suppliers. <\/p><p>  It is the responsibility of the industry &ndash; in this instance, processors and farmers working together &ndash; to manage the type and volume of cattle being brought to market so that the supply chain operates for the benefit of both parties and does not undermine the viability of beef production systems for either winter finishers or suckler farmers. The current situation strongly underlines the need for the industry to improve communication on market trends and signals along the supply chain. An industry-led solution to clear the backlog of bull beef is essential to restoring confidence in the sector and I would encourage the various stakeholders to engage constructively in discussions on the issue.<\/p><p>  Recognising the importance of maintaining confidence in the beef sector, I recently announced the operational details of an investment package worth up to &euro;40m to beef farmers in 2014. This package will include a &euro;23m for Beef Genomics Scheme, &euro;10m for the Beef Data Programme, &euro;5m for the Beef Technology Adoption Programme and &euro;2m in residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme. <\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s investment is a strong vote of confidence in the suckler beef sector. It exemplifies the smart, green growth initiatives envisioned in the 2020 strategy and, coupled with additional support measures under the new Rural Development Programme, will underpin the development of a sustainable beef sector with long-term growth potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800075#WRX01600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":1483,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800075#WRX01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1484,"qnumday":624,"qnumall":"[7832\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800075#WRX01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the supports available from his Department to encourage and assist young dairy farmers to take over family run farms from their parents; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1485,"content":"<p>I have ensured that key taxation measures that promote earlier lifetime transfer of holdings have been retained and have, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, introduced some amendments to the taxation code to assist young farmers to take over family run farms from their parents, which I will detail briefly.<\/p><p><i><i>Agricultural Relief<\/i><\/i><\/p><p>  Agricultural Relief is a relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax and operates by reducing the market value of 'agricultural property' by 90%, so that gift or inheritance tax is calculated on an amount - known as the 'agricultural value' - which is substantially less than the market value. In general, the relief applies provided the beneficiary qualifies as a 'farmer'. To qualify for agricultural relief, the person receiving the gift or inheritance must be a 'farmer' at the Valuation Date<\/p><p><i><i>Stamp Duty Exemption on Transfers of Land to Young Trained Farmers<\/i><\/i><\/p><p>  This relief provides for a full exemption on stamp duty on transfers of farm land to certain young trained farmers. To qualify the young farmer must be less than 35 years of age and must of have attained a minimum agricultural education standard. This measure was extended in Budget 2012 for a further three year period until 31 December 2015.<\/p><p><i><i>Enhanced Stock Relief from Income Tax<\/i><\/i><\/p><p>  Enhanced rates of stock relief are provided for in certain circumstances &ndash; A 100% stock relief rate is available for up to four years for certain young trained farmers. This measure was extended in Budget 2013 to the end of 2015. If a young dairy farmer has used the four year window of claiming the 100% stock relief, he\/she can avail of a 50% rate of stock relief if they participate in a registered Milk Production Partnerships. This measure was introduced until end of 2015 in Budget 2012.<\/p><p><i><i>Retirement Relief from Capital Gains Tax<\/i><\/i><\/p><p>Retirement relief from Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on land transfers is available where an individual over 55 years<sup><\/sup>  disposes of some or all of his land once certain criteria are met. There are two separate Retirement relief thresholds depending on the relationship of the transferor to the transferee. Budget 2012 introduced the following changes to the &ldquo;transfers of land to a child&rdquo; thresholds with effect from the 1 January 2014, with the 2 year lead in period flagged in advance to allow for an orderly transition;<\/p><p>  -  Irrespective of the amount of consideration for the transfer, full CGT relief may be claimed by a person aged between 55 &ndash; 66 years of age on the transfer to his\/her child.<\/p><p>  -  For land transfers by persons aged over 66 years of age the amount of full CGT relief is only available on considerations up to &euro;3 million, again to encourage earlier lifetime transfer of land holdings.<\/p><p>  -  If the child disposes subsequently of the land within 6 years, clawback of the above reliefs applies.<\/p><p>  These taxation measures reflect the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the agri-food industry and in particular to the expansion planned in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. Recognising the importance of all taxation measures in the farming sector, a review was recently announced in Budget 2014. The &lsquo;AgriTaxation Review&rsquo; will analyse the benefits of the various tax measures to the agriculture sector and the wider economy versus the costs, i.e. value for money to the economy. The overall objective of the review is not to change the level of support to the sector through the tax system but rather to maximise the benefits to the sector and the economy for that existing level of support. Two of the six key policy areas identified for examination are 1) encouraging and attracting young farmers and new entrants to farming and 2) succession &ndash; earlier lifetime transfers within families (and non-family transfers also where no apparent successor available). The public consultation process for the Review was launched on Tuesday 11th February 2014 and will run to Tuesday 25th March 2014, a period of 6 weeks. It is planned that the Review&rsquo;s findings will form part of the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s considerations in the context of Budget 2015.<\/p><p>  In addition to the tax reliefs my Department has also provided a range of on-farm supports, most of which were supported under the old Common Agriculture programme. These on-farm supports included:<\/p><p>  -  the New Entrants to Dairying Scheme (which helped revitalise the sector through the provision of milk quota to dynamic educated farmers);<\/p><p>  -  the Dairy Efficiency Programme (which encouraged the adoption of best practice management and production methods on farm by means of Discussion Groups);<\/p><p>-  the Dairy Equipment Scheme which had a weighting towards young farmers and had as its aim the encouragement of   new entrants\/young farmers in milk production by providing them with a financial support to meet the capital costs associated with either starting up or taking over a dairy enterprise, and ensuring that they have the most up to date technology available to compete in the modern dairy sector.<\/p><p>  -  the provision of financial support for ICBF and Animal Health Ireland to improve breed quality and animal health. <\/p><p>  The new CAP Programme will facilitate the introduction of further supports in the areas of knowledge transfer and capital equipment and I propose to announce such supports over the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800075#WRX01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sheep Census","counter":1486,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800075#WRX02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1487,"qnumday":625,"qnumall":"[7881\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800075#WRX02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when the requirement to submit a sheep census become legally enforceable under Irish law; the specific statutory authority underpinning the sheep census obligation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1488,"content":"<p>The requirement for flock owners to submit the annual census details to my Department came into effect on 29 January 2004 in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No. 21\/2004, which is directly applicable in Member States.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800075#WRX02200","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Security Checks","counter":1489,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800075#WRX02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1490,"qnumday":626,"qnumall":"[7886\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800075#WRX02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if any of his departmental or ministerial offices have been swept for electronic or any other type of surveillance or bugging equipment since coming to office in March 2011; the reasons for this check; the results of this check; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Excellent conditions last Autumn provided an opportunity for farmers to extend the grazing season. In this regard and in conjunction with my colleague Minister Hogan, a number of amendments to the Nitrates regulations were introduced to encourage additional production. The extension of the period for the application of organic fertilisers and the discounting of certain amounts of meal when calculating the amount of phosphorus fertiliser that could be used supported farmers to extend the grazing period last Autumn and in turn keeping animals grazing for longer.<\/p><p>  The situation continues to be monitored.

The Adoption (Information and Tracing ) Bill will address this matter but the legislature will be constrained in the nature of any access which can be granted to adoption records by these legal considerations. My Department is continuing to work on the Heads of Bill for the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval to publish the Heads of Bill as soon as possible.  However, as I have previously advised the House, very complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen in the drafting of the Bill, in particular  in seeking to reconcile an adopted person&rsquo;s request for information about his or her identity with the right to privacy of his or her birth parent.  My Department is continuing to consult with the Office of the Attorney General on this and on a number of related issues and I intend to submit the Heads of Bill for Government approval as soon as these issues have been addressed.  <\/p><p>  Once approved by Government, the Heads of Bill will be sent to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for its detailed consideration. The process of sending the Heads of Bill to that Committee will ensure that the provisions of the proposed legislation will be subject to public scrutiny and it is of course open to that Committee to invite and encourage submissions from all interested  parties.   In the meantime I am open to any proposals or suggestions in relation to policy on this matter that assists in achieving as much access as possible in a manner that is legally and constitutionally sound. <\/p><p>  I have been anxious to see improvements in existing procedures for the tracing of birth parents by people who have been adopted.  The Child and Family Agency, which was established on 1st January last, has advised me that, in the first instance, any person seeking information on adoption should contact the Adoption Authority of Ireland or the Child and Family Agency&rsquo;s Community Services who will assist in directing them to the personnel dealing with their particular records.  The existing arrangements for those seeking access to information reflect a transition from complex and historical situations and I am anxious that the Agency implement much more improved and consistent arrangements. I have been advised by the  Agency that it is reorganising adoption services in 2014 at a national level,  and will consider how best to deploy its staff to deal with this important issue so as to facilitate access to records where they exist. <\/p><p>  The Adoption Act 2010, requirement that agencies providing Information and Tracing services would gain accreditation resulted in a number of religious orders deciding not to apply for accreditation and transferring records from their Mother and Baby Homes and Adoption Societies to the Agency.  In the case of the Sacred Heart Adoption Society, for example, some 25,000 records have been transferred to the Agency&rsquo;s Regional Adoption Service in Cork.  Work by the Agency on the organising and storage of these records has taken place.  The advice of the National Archives has been sought in relation to the proper storage of these records that are of great significance. <\/p><p>  I have raised the importance of arrangements for the management of these records directly with the Child and Family Agency and I have also asked my officials to examine the work that could be undertaken with the Child and Family Agency, the Adoption Authority and other stakeholders to improve arrangements for managing and accessing the records that are available. <\/p><p>  I would urge birth mothers to enrol on the National Adoption Contact Preference Register which was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  Applicants decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland has responsibility for the operation of the Contact Preference Register.  I believe there is an opportunity in the context of the considerable public attention this area is receiving to promote awareness amongst women whose children were adopted of the importance of registering their consent for contact to be re-established.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800076#WRY02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","counter":1567,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800076#WRY02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1568,"qnumday":653,"qnumall":"[7576\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800076#WRY02100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding the heads of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill is; when she expects the Bill to come before the relevant committee for discussion; the way the issue of both the parents and children's right to privacy is being considered in the Bill; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

While mindful that it is, in fact, the courts who appoint guardians ad litem in care proceedings,  the examination is taking account of the potential key elements of a reformed service such as criteria for the engagement of guardians ad litem, their role and responsibilities, their status, necessary qualifications and experience for appointment, and the basis for their remuneration.  <\/p><p>  Other reforms which have already been initiated or completed as part of the wider programme of legal reform relating to children are also very relevant.  These reforms include  the establishment of the Child and Family Agency on 1 January last, the amendment to Section 17 of the Child Care Act enacted in 2013 to reduce the frequency and related cost of renewing interim care orders, the introduction of national procedures relating to Court practice by the Child and Family Agency, the examination being given by the Minister for Justice and Equality to the establishment of dedicated Family Courts and the referral of a draft General Scheme and Heads of Bill in respect of the Children and Family Relationships Bill to the Oireachtas.  This latter proposed legislation, which is being taken forward by the Minister for Justice and Equality, signals the proposed introduction of revised arrangements for guardians ad litem in respect of certain family law proceedings. This is an important context for the collaboration which is underway between both Departments.<\/p><p>  I plan to bring forward legislative proposals to reform this area in the current year in collaboration with the Minister for Justice and Equality.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800076#WRY03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Adoption Services Provision","counter":1582,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800076#WRY03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1583,"qnumday":658,"qnumall":"[7654\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800076#WRY03100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 720 of 15 January 2014, the number of social workers being deployed this year from existing adoption teams to information and tracing work; and the total number of staff dedicated to information and tracing work within the adoption service in the Child and Family Agency.

The size of the market can also be a factor in the prices set by manufacturers.<\/p><p>  My Department and the HSE have implemented a medicines pricing policy which aims to reduce the prices for medicines\/improve value for money whilst also maintaining continuity of supply and availability of essential medicines. These aims are balanced in an attempt to maximise public health gain from available resources. As part of the pricing policies there has been a price freeze (i.e. no price increases allowed except in exceptional circumstances) for a number of years.<\/p><p>  Over the last few years thousands of price reductions on medicines have occurred. For example, the price of over 500 different presentations of various medicines reduced by between 5% and 29% on the 1st November 2013 as a consequence of agreements reached with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland (APMI). In overall terms, price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per item reimbursed is now running at 2001\/2002 levels. <\/p><p>  Occasionally, price increases are required to maintain supplies of specific essential medicines. However, the HSE each year refuses a significant number of requests for price increases. Less than 50 price increases were allowed in the 8 years between 2006 and 2013.<\/p><p>  In October 2012, Aspen Pharma Trading Ltd  informed the HSE that, following an examination of the viability of a number of product lines, it had decided to increase the price of Purinethol in Ireland and a number of other EU countries (including Germany, UK, Denmark and Finland). <\/p><p>  The HSE engaged with the company in an attempt to negotiate a lower price, however, it was unwilling to do so.  The HSE was faced with the choice of allowing increased pricing (in line with other international markets) or running the risk that the product would be withdrawn.  Having regard to the importance of the product and the fact that Aspen Pharma Trading Ltd is the sole supplier to the Irish market, the HSE considered that a price increase was necessary to maintain supply and agreed to grant a price increase from 1 March 2013.  Despite the price increase, no other supplier has chosen to enter the Irish market.  Reversal of the price increase in the absence of an alternative supplier could result in the sole supplier exiting the market and patients being left without access to this medicine. <\/p><p>  In relation to price variations in Irish pharmacies, I would encourage patients to engage with their pharmacists to ensure they are getting best value for money when purchasing medicines. In this context, my Department has asked the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland to consider how to provide for greater price transparency in pharmacies. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800078#WRAA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":1707,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800078#WRAA02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1708,"qnumday":703,"qnumall":"[7699\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800078#WRAA02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will deal with a matter regarding rents in St. Michael's House (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1709,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services, including disability services.

There is a link between consumption and harm and evidence that affordability is one of the drivers of increased consumption.  The Government has approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse, to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  These measures are based on the recommendations contained in the Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy.  <\/p><p>  The Government has decided that minimum unit pricing is the most effective policy measure to deal with the sale of alcohol at cheap prices.  Minimum unit pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels per gram of alcohol that must be legally observed by retailers in both the on and off trade sector.  This is a targeted measure, designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices.  It is mainly aimed at those who are higher risk, such as adolescents and people who have a harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption pattern.  It should therefore only have a marginal effect on moderate drinkers.  It is not expected that minimum unit pricing will affect the price of alcohol in the on-trade sector or the majority of alcohol products sold in the off-trade sector.<\/p><p>  A health impact assessment, in conjunction with Northern Ireland, has been commissioned as part of the process of developing a legislative basis for minimum unit pricing.  The assessment will study the impact of different minimum prices on a range of areas such as health, crime and likely economic impact.

The Government is committed to the provision and development of services for these children, having regard to available resources. <\/p><p>  The HSE National Review of Autism Services: Past, Present and Way Forward Report (2012) and the Progressing Disabilities Services for Children and Young People (0-18s) Programme set out the overall policy context for the provision of autism services to children and young people.  The objective of the Progressing Disabilities Programme for Children and Young People is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services for children with a disability including those with autism so that there is a clear pathway to the services for all children, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability.  This Programme aims to remedy the variations in service provision that currently exist around the country.  In 2014, the HSE are taking a number of key steps in implementing the change programme, including rolling out a new model of assessment and intervention, in line with the Progressing Disabilities Programme for Children and Young People.  An additional &euro;4 million has been allocated, which equates to 80 additional therapy staff, for these purposes.  <\/p><p>  I have been advised by the HSE that it is not in a position to provide details regarding the amount of money that is currently being spent on autism services specifically.  The manner in which funding is allocated by the HSE allows for a distinction between broad categories of funding such as services for older people, primary care and disabilities in general. Disability services are provided based on the needs of an individual rather than by the actual type of disability. Individuals with autism or Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome may attend autism-specific services or may obtain services from a service provider who provides services for a wide range of intellectual disabilities including autism.  <\/p><p>  I also understand that the HSE does not currently collect data on children and adults identified with autism and Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome specifically, either on a national, or on a county basis. At the same time it is important to note that, due to the complexity of their presentation, many individuals with autism may have a primary diagnosis of intellectual disability or a co-morbid mental health component.<\/p><p>  The health sector&rsquo;s National Intellectual Disability Database (NIDD), which was established in 1995, has been designed to provide a comprehensive and accurate information base for decision-making in relation to the planning, funding and management of services for people with an intellectual disability including individuals with autism and Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome.  While the database presents information on the needs of people with intellectual disabilities, information pertaining to diagnosis is specifically excluded, as the database is not designed as a medical epidemiological tool.  There is currently no epidemiological data regarding the prevalence in Ireland of Autistic Spectrum Disorder.<\/p><p>  However, I am advised that some estimates are available through the national census data. For example, the 2006 national census collected data on disability and a follow-up study, the National Disability Survey (NDS), was carried out on 16,000 people.  Approximately 22% of respondents to the NDS reported difficulties with intellect and learning.  Five percent of this group attributed their difficulties to an Autistic Spectrum Disorder.  38% of the total group was aged 0-17 years and a further 25% were 18-35 years old.  Thus the prevalence of ASD within this cohort could be estimated to be in the order of 1.1%.  <\/p><p>  My Department has asked the HSE to provide the Deputy with the detailed operational information requested in relation to assessment for autism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800079#WRBB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service Provision","counter":1750,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800079#WRBB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1751,"qnumday":719,"qnumall":"[7842\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800079#WRBB00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the ambulance cover for Carlow town and county; if this is sufficient service for the population of the county; the way this compares with the service provided to other towns and counties of similar size and population.

The remit spans the whole of Government. It is a pillar of Government policy that people with disabilities should be empowered by policy and programmes to participate meaningfully as citizens in Irish society. The National Disability Strategy is driven by this basic, but fundamentally important, objective. It is Government's goal to develop the most effective combination of legislation, policies, institutional arrangements and services to support and reinforce equal participation for all people with disabilities.<\/p><p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to publish a realistic implementation plan for the National Disability Strategy. That Implementation Plan was published in July 2013 and is the first such implementation plan to be put in place since the National Disability Strategy itself was launched in 2004. The Plan was prepared by the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group, which I established in 2011. I continue to chair the Group to oversee the implementation of the Strategy. The Implementation Group brings together representatives of the relevant Government Departments and representative organisations, including the Disability Federation of Ireland, and also a number of people with disabilities. Significant discussion was undertaken between disability stakeholders and Government Departments to reach agreement on the suite of actions contained in the Plan. The Plan sets out the practical measures across all Government Departments that will be taken to advance the Strategy and ensure that available resources are used to best effect. Progress on the Plan is kept under review by the Implementation Group and thematic meetings, at which all relevant bodies are present to ensure cross-sectoral input and review, are convened. Two such thematic meetings were held in 2013 and focused on the themes of Housing and Irish Sign Language.<\/p><p>  The vision for the Health Service Executive's Disability Services Programme is to contribute to the realisation of a society where people with disabilities are supported, as far as possible, to participate to their full potential in economic and social life, and have access to a range of quality personal social supports and services to enhance their quality of life. The Health Service Executive National Service Plan 2014 and the recently published 2014 Operational Plan for the Social Care Division outline the quantum of specialist disability services, the key reform initiatives and the additional investment in 2014 which it has assured me will give effect to this vision in 2014. The HSE will spend &euro;1.4 billion and employ a staff level of approximately 15,000 whole time equivalents in 2014 to provide specified levels of services. 2014 will also see an additional investment of &euro;14m to address deficits in disability services, a reform programme to transform services to a community based model of person centred supports, a focus on the implementation of the Health Information and Quality Authority standards for residential services for people with a disability. These developments and reform proposals will be carried out in an environment of effective communications and engagement with all those involved in services, including people with a disability and the Disability Federation of Ireland , through the HSE's National Consultative Forum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800081#WRDD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":1885,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800081#WRDD00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1886,"qnumday":766,"qnumall":"[8264\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800081#WRDD00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to tackle the emerging hospital consultant recruitment crisis. ","asker":"1034","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1887,"content":"<p>Notwithstanding the need to reduce the numbers employed across the public service in order to meet fiscal and budgetary targets, the HSE has the capacity to recruit consultants. Arrangements are in place in the HSE to allow the recruitment of front-line staff where there is an established service need. More generally, in order to mitigate the impact on front-line services of the reduction in employment numbers, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.<\/p><p>  It is Government policy to move to a consultant delivered service and there has been a significant increase in the number of consultants (Whole Time Equivalents) over the past 5 years, the number increased from 2,260 in December 2008 to 2,555 in December 2013. However there are some specialties in which there is an international shortage and which have been traditionally difficult to fill, regardless of the salary scale. There are also some hospitals to which it has historically been difficult to attract applicants, in particular smaller hospitals that have onerous rosters due to the limited number of consultants. The establishment of Hospital Groups will help to address this issue, as this will allow doctors to be appointed as group resources - instead of to just one hospital.<\/p><p>  The ability of the public service to attract and retain high quality consultants shapes the extent to which the HSE can maintain and develop the range of health services required. If the health services are to continue to provide consultant-level opportunities for doctors to replace consultants who retire and eventually to expand overall capacity, this can only happen on the basis of a lower-cost model, hence the decision to reduce the pay of new consultants by 30%. This decision is being modified to enable consultants currently working in permanent posts within the public service to move to different posts, while retaining their existing salaries. Application of the revised guidance will support consultant mobility. Allowing serving clinical consultants retain their existing salaries will remove a blockage on movement within the system at present. This mobility will, in due course, also facilitate the roll-out of the Hospital Group model with staff appointed to the Group rather than being confined to specific locations.<\/p><p>  I set up a group under the chairmanship of Professor Brian McCraith last July to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures.

Considerable progress has been made over the last 12 months on progressing compliance with the provisions of the Working Time Directive in respect of NCHDs.  Data from the HSE shows that average working hours for NCHDs in 2009 was 60 hours a week, 54 hours per week in 2012 and 51.4 hours in the third quarter of 2013.<\/p><p>  The HSE is focused on advancing implementation of the Directive. Intensive negotiations conducted at the Labour Relations Commission in September and October resulted in agreement on a joint approach, involving hospital management, the IMO and NCHDs to achieving EWTD compliance. The agreement focused in particular on steps to be taken in the period up to the NCHD rotation on 13th January 2014 to eliminate shifts in excess of 24 hours. At a meeting between the HSE and the IMO on 6th February the progress made by the acute hospitals on achieving compliance with the agreed maximum 24 hour shift target was assessed. While the majority of hospitals have made significant progress, arising from that assessment the Director of Acute Hospitals will be imposing fines on a minority of hospitals where sufficient progress has not been achieved. This is in accordance with the terms of the agreement.<\/p><p>  NCHD recruitment and retention is required in order to facilitate the achievement of EWTD compliance. Achievement of full compliance will also require reorganisation of the delivery of certain services within Hospital Groups. The number of NCHDs in the public health system has increased by over 200 in recent years and now exceeds 4,900. However, there are international shortages of NCHDs in certain categories and specialties. There are also some hospitals to which it has been difficult to attract NCHDS, for a range of reasons including training opportunities and rural location.<\/p><p>  I set up the MacCraith Group to undertake a Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career structure last Summer.

Road charging is an option that is open to any Member State and can contribute to the funding of a country&rsquo;s road infrastructure, particularly in the context of ensuring that out-of-state hauliers who use the infrastructure make a contribution to its funding.<\/p><p>  The new UK road user levy, due to come into effect on 1 April 2014, introduces a charge on all HGVs weighing 12 tonnes or more for use of UK roads including those in Northern Ireland. \u00a0I have previously expressed my concerns regarding the impact this levy will have on Irish hauliers to my UK and Northern Ireland colleagues.  Furthermore, I have sought exemptions for some roads in Northern Ireland to reduce the impact of the levy on Irish hauliers.

Research by the Gathering project team indicates that 250-275,000 of the additional overseas visitors to Ireland travelled because of The Gathering, and these visitors were worth an estimated &euro;170 million in revenue.  My aim is to\u00a0maintain the positive momentum that was created by The Gathering and ensure that we\u00a0grow tourism numbers again this year.  There are a number of positive indications in this regard.  For example, all of the increased air capacity secured for the year of The Gathering has been retained for 2014, with a number of new additional routes also confirmed, and sea capacity has\u00a0also increased this year.  Other\u00a0legacy benefits\u00a0include\u00a0the opportunity to repeat some of the\u00a0events that were initiated in 2013.<\/p><p>  The experience gained by using the community activation process, including town hall meetings and the Volunteer Ambassador programme, has provided many lessons which could be applied in future national or regional projects.  The Gathering was also highly successful in terms of using local authorities to set up a framework for mobilising communities and local organisation of events.  For example, F&aacute;ilte Ireland are using actively engaging communities to maximise the benefits of the Wild Atlantic Way.  Furthermore The Gathering\u00a0increased the number of potential market contacts at both individual and group level and this information will help support future tourism marketing and promotions.  On a broader\u00a0level, I anticipate the experience gained in many of these areas\u00a0will be\u00a0highlighted in the Tourism Policy Review which\u00a0I am currently undertaking.

An integrated and co-ordinated transport system is\u00a0an important consideration when it comes to future decisions on transport investment.\u00a0In making decisions as to future expenditure, my Department has been active to ensure that a co-ordinated approach is taken and that we do not look at land, maritime\u00a0or aviation transport in isolation from each other. In previous times, this was a legitimate criticism of transport investment but I believe that, in recent years, this\u00a0has been addressed. <\/p><p>  At a European level,\u00a0my Department has been engaging and will continue to actively engage with the Trans European Network for Transport (TEN-T) and to ensure it is integrated into Irish transport policy making. The TEN-T regulations\u00a0set out a multi-modal\u00a0transport network across the European Union\u00a0and aim to ensure integration between the various modes. This\u00a0multi-modal\u00a0EU policy is supported by domestic policy such as the new National\u00a0Ports Policy that I launched in March 2013. For example the National Ports Policy's designation of Shannon-Foynes Port, Dublin Port and the Port of Cork as Ports of National Significance (Tier One) and Rosslare\u00a0Europort and the Port of Waterford\u00a0as Ports of National Significance\u00a0(Tier Two) mirror the TEN-T designations\u00a0of these ports\u00a0as Core and Comprehensive ports on the TEN-T network. These designations are then taken into account by the National Transport Authority and the National Roads Authority when decisions are being made in terms of future planning.<\/p><p>  Other policy work is ongoing in my Department and I expect to publish\u00a0two significant new\u00a0transport policy\u00a0papers\u00a0in 2014. An aviation policy is now approaching completion while in\u00a0relation to land transport, work is ongoing on\u00a0a strategic framework for investment in land transport.\u00a0Both the framework for investment and the aviation policy\u00a0will help clarify\u00a0transport priorities\u00a0and\u00a0will help to ensure that there is appropriate co-ordination and integration between the various modes. In a similar vein, the National Transport Authority have a statutory remit to develop an integrated transport plan for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA)\u00a0and they are currently in the process of completing their implementation plan for transport investment\u00a0in the GDA for the period to 2018. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800084#WRGG03500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2120,"content":"<p>Question No. 856 answered with Question No. 801.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pilot Training Colleges","counter":2121,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800084#WRGG03750"},{"type":"question","counter":2122,"qnumday":857,"qnumall":"[8373\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014021800084#WRGG03800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"in the aftermath of the closure of the pilot training college in 2012, the measures have IAA have put in place to ensure that a similar event cannot happen again; if his Department has undertaken an investigation as to the reasons behind the closure; if an investigation took place, if he will provide the findings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":2123,"content":"<p>This question refers to the liquidation of the Pilot Training College (PTC) in 2012.\u00a0 PTC was\u00a0a privately-owned and operated flight training\u00a0organisation \u00a0that\u00a0 reneged on its contractual obligations and failed its students.\u00a0 Its liquidation is proceeding in accordance with company law that requires a report being made to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.\u00a0\u00a0My Department does not have any role in investigating the collapse of any flight training organisation.
