Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.<\/p><p>The social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners who have been less attached to the workforce.  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, may allow up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.<\/p><p>Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.

Under this approach, the rate of pension paid will more closely reflect the number of contributions recorded over a working life.  It is expected that this will replace the current system for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.

JobPath was designed following an open consultation process (a number of open fora were attended by a wide range of participants), with input from labour market experts in Ireland and abroad and taking account of international experience.  The Department was also advised by the Centre for Social and Economic Inclusion in the design of JobPath.<\/p>  <p>  Participants on JobPath will receive intensive individual support to help them address barriers to employment and to assist them in finding jobs.  They are also provided with a range of training and development supports including online modules, career advice, CV preparation and interview skills and where a need is identified, a client may be referred for further education and training opportunities provided by ETBs and others.  These training and development supports may be accredited by FETAC or lead to an industry recognised certification.<\/p>  <p>  JobPath providers are paid based on outcomes &ndash; they receive a fee for each thirteen week period of full time employment (30 hours per week) secured for a client.  The fee is paid in arrears and a maximum of four fees are paid (i.e. 12 months employment).  This fee structure ensures that the providers are incentivised to find sustained employment for JobPath clients and to work with JobPath clients to help them transition into, and remain in, employment.<\/p>  <p>  Participants are selected by the Department &ndash; the companies have no say in the selection process.  Jobseekers will spend a year on JobPath and if they are placed into a job they will continue to receive support from a Personal Advisor for at least three months and up to twelve months while in employment.  Should a client lose a job while on JobPath, their Personal Advisor will continue to work with them to help them obtain further employment and the department&rsquo;s Intreo Centres will expedite payment of their welfare entitlements. <\/p>  <p>  JobPath is one of a range of activation supports, including schemes such as CE and T&Uacute;S, catering for long-term unemployed jobseekers.  In general, and JobPath is not an exception, it is not possible for clients to participate in two separate schemes at the same time.  In addition, given the need to manage the allocation of places effectively, the Department does not facilitate or encourage jobseekers to leave one scheme early in order to take up a place on another scheme.  This approach is particularly relevant in the case of JobPath whereby providers are paid on the basis of outcomes; it is important that the service providers have the opportunity and the time to achieve the outcome &ndash; which is to help the jobseeker secure and sustain full-time employment.  On completion of JobPath, participation in other schemes and programmes remains an option that will be assessed by the Department&rsquo;s case officers.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that all decisions regarding a person&rsquo;s welfare entitlements while on JobPath will be taken only by Department officials and not by the JobPath companies.  In addition the process for sanctioning clients, who do not engage with the JobPath activation process, is exactly the same as the process for clients who fail to engage with any of the Department&rsquo;s other activation programmes.  Again this process is operated by the Department&rsquo;s own staff and not by the JobPath providers.<\/p>  <p>  Significant safeguards have been built into JobPath.  These include a service guarantee to ensure that all participants receive a baseline level of service as well as penalties for the companies if service performance or service quality does not meet set standards.  JobPath is also structured such that the companies cannot recover their costs or make any profit unless and until they get people into sustainable jobs.  The rates paid to contractors are also linked to performance in the wider economy.  Automatic discounts apply if employment growth exceeds our medium term forecasts.  In addition, both companies will be subject to regular on-site inspections and audits to ensure that JobPath is delivered in accordance with contractual obligations.  Payments are also subject to the results of independent customer satisfaction surveys that will be commissioned by the Department.<\/p>  <p>  Seetec was accused of fraudulent activity by former staff members in 2013.  This alleged fraud related to claims that Seetec inflated employment outcomes for people with disabilities under the 'Work Choices' programme in the UK.  The DWP has publicly refuted these claims and advised the UK&rsquo;s Public Accounts Committee that it has investigated the claims and found no wrongdoing.  The potential for inflating figures has been taken into consideration in the design of JobPath.  The Department is satisfied that artificial inflation of employment outcomes will be controlled in Ireland though the use of data matching with Revenue Commencement of Employment records and the Department&rsquo;s own welfare payment systems. <\/p>  <p>  Turas Nua is a new joint venture between FRS recruitment, based in Roscrea, and Working Links, a not for profit UK service provider.  It has been acknowledged by Working Links that some members of its staff incorrectly recorded employment and training placement for jobseekers under the 'New Deal', the precursor programme in the UK to the Work Programme.  However the DWP has publicly stated that the errors occurred in 2008 as a consequence of its heavy reliance on paper-based transactions and that it is satisfied that these cases were investigated thoroughly by Working Links (the amount involved represented less than 0.05% of the payments at the time) and that appropriate actions were taken, with the associated amounts being repaid.  DWP has subsequently awarded additional contracts to Working Links. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note, that neither of the above companies has been sanctioned by the DWP for any fraudulent activity.<\/p>  <p>  JobPath is being rolled out in offices across the country and is expected to be fully implemented in the first quarter of 2016.  The cost of JobPath will be determined by the number of jobseekers who are referred and the number who secure sustainable employment.  Finally, Turas Nua has confirmed that the questions asked of clients regarding criminality are in the process of being removed from their diagnostic assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400061#WRC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400061#WRC03500"},{"type":"question","counter":125,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[41342\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400061#WRC03600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Galway will receive a decision on an application for a disability allowance; the reason for the delay; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":126,"content":"<p>I confirm the department received an application for disability allowance from the person in question on 6 October 2015.

Flexibility is provided under the National Framework for Tenancy Sustainment for both existing customers of the scheme and new applicants.

The Commission presented its Report on 31 March 2012 and over 60 of those recommendations are contained in the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 (the \"2012 Act\"). <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the International Credit Union Regulators' Network (\"ICURN\") review was to assess the performance of the Central Bank's performance of its regulatory functions in relation to credit unions.  The review assessed the legal, regulatory and prudential supervisory framework in place to fulfil the Central Bank's mandate under section 84 of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and accordingly focused on the legal and regulatory framework for the regulation of credit unions in effect at the time of the review.  Overall the review found that the Central Bank effectively performs its functions in the regulation and supervision of the credit union sector.<\/p>  <p>  ICURN made\u00a0a\u00a0number of\u00a0recommendations to the Central Bank\u00a0under various headings\u00a0outlining specific refinements.

Following on from that, an implementation timetable for the 2012\u00a0Act was devised in consultation with stakeholders, including credit union representative bodies. <\/p>  <p>  Commencement of all sections of the 2012 Act has been aligned with the credit union financial year and the introduction of the underpinning Central Bank regulations, with a view to implementation of the 2012 Act in a coherent and cohesive manner.

","asker":"1190","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":335,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s improving competitiveness performance since 2011 has been central to securing the recovery in economic growth and employment. Improved competitiveness has made Irish firms more cost competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in. The recovery in jobs to date, with 135,800 more employed than at the beginning of 2012, unemployment down from over 15% in 2012 to 8.9% in October and the record levels of indigenous exports being achieved, is in large part due to the considerable improvements in the business environment for enterprises. Overall, Ireland has moved from 25th to 16th on the IMD Competitiveness rankings, with progress being made in areas such as the environment for start-ups, regulation, and access to credit.Addressing Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness is a key economic priority for Government. Since 2012, the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs has set out a comprehensive set of measures to improve our competitiveness performance. We continue to monitor Ireland's cost competitiveness and take appropriate action to address fragilities as they emerge. The Action Plan for Jobs 2015 requires the National Competitiveness Council to &ldquo;Benchmark key business costs and publish a report highlighting areas where Irish enterprise costs are out of line with key competitors&rdquo;. The Council's 2015 Costs of Doing Business in Ireland report benchmarks key business costs across over fifty indicators and focuses on areas where Irish enterprise costs are out of line with key competitors, and on costs that are largely domestically determined. <\/p><p>The NCC's 2015 report concentrates on the costs that are largely domestically determined such as labour, property, energy, water, waste, communications and business services. The report finds that while relative cost competitiveness is improving (i.e. although costs are increasing, they are increasing at a slower rate than in many of our competitors), this improvement is largely being driven by external factors beyond the control of domestic policymakers. In particular, a weak euro exchange rate, low ECB interest rates, and low international fuel prices have all combined to improve Irish cost competitiveness. The NCC report concludes that Ireland&rsquo;s industrial cost base has improved but pressure points are emerging in labour, property and business service costs. <\/p><p>We will continue to take corrective action where particular issues emerge. As an island nation for whom competitive transport services are essential to getting our products to market, as part of Budget 2016 the Minister for Finance announced plans to simplify the rates of commercial motor tax by replacing the existing 20 rates with just five rates ranging from &euro;92 to &euro;900, with effect from January 1, 2016. The changes are set to benefit operators of about 28,500 commercial vehicles and address anomalies <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>the regime in the UK and Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>Now is not the time to be complacent about our competitiveness as we have further progress to make if we are to achieve the ambition in the Government's recent enterprise policy statement Enterprise 2025 of achieving sustainable full employment. We must maintain an intense focus on reducing costs that are out of line with those in competitor countries. There is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage their cost base and drive efficiency, thus creating a virtuous circle between the costs of living, wage expectations and cost competitiveness. Measures that ensure open and competitive markets are essential. Improving productivity performance is also key.<\/p><p>The policy implications of the Costs of Doing Business and associated structural reforms required to address Ireland&rsquo;s cost base, will be included in the Council&rsquo;s annual Competitiveness Challenge report which will be published before year-end. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400064#WRF06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Development","counter":337,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400065#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":338,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[41411\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400065#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the steps being taken to promote County Kerry as a location for foreign direct investment, given the enhanced and regional aid status given to County Kerry as a disadvantaged region; the progress in attracting jobs to the county since this initiative was introduced in 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":339,"content":"<p>IDA Ireland markets Kerry as part of its South West region, along with Cork.

This is a marked increase on the period 2008&ndash;2010 when 502 jobs were lost.  70% of all new IDA Ireland jobs come from existing client companies, so it is imperative that we ensure that the local supports are provided to maintain these companies&rsquo; presence in Ireland.  IDA Ireland launched its new five-year strategy entitled <i>Winning &ndash; Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019<\/i>in April 2015.  This strategy has a strong focus on regional development, setting forth aims and strategies to achieve a significant increase in investment going into regional locations.  To support that aim, IDA Ireland is rolling out a &euro;150million capital investment programme to help attract more multinational jobs into each region over a 5-year period.<\/p><p>This programme will also include investments over the coming years in building advanced technology buildings and office facilities in a number of regional locations to provide state-of-the-art property solutions for clients.

In 2008 the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government estimated the value of pollinators (including honey bees) for Irish food crops was worth at least &euro;53m.  This does not include the value of pollinators in terms of non-food crops and maintaining bio-diversity in the wild.  The value of honey produced in Ireland in 2014 was estimated at slightly over &euro;3m.<\/p>  <p>  My Department recognises the importance of maintaining and further developing a healthy honey bee population.  I fully recognise that a disease outbreak and especially an exotic disease outbreak, could have a significant negative impact on the Irish Bee population.  With this in mind, the signing into law of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 repealed the out-dated 1908 Bee Pest Prevention Act. American Foulbrood and the Small Hive Beetle are both notifiable diseases under the Notification and Control of Animal Diseases Regulations 2014 (SI No 110 of 2014).  While American Foulbrood has existed in Ireland for many years the Small Hive Beetle has never been found in Ireland.  In response to the 2014 outbreak of Small Hive Beetle in Italy my Department established a sentinel apiary programme earlier this year.  This programme was established with the support of the Federation of Irish Beekeeping Associations and the Native Irish Honey Bee Society.  Volunteer beekeepers in areas which are considered to represent greatest risk for the introduction of pests such as the Small Hive Beetle, as well as other beekeepers are participating in this programme.  Over 20 beekeepers providing a representative geographical spread across the country are involved.  A similar programme has also been rolled out across Northern Ireland.  The sentinel apiary programme is designed with the objective of providing early notification in the event that any exotic pest or disease affecting honey bees arrives in Ireland.  My Department co-ordinates the programme and has provided the equipment and guidelines to the beekeepers and also provides the diagnostic service to implement the programme.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a bee diagnostic service is operated from the Teagasc laboratories at Teagasc, Oakpark in Carlow.  Analysis of approximately 300 samples submitted by beekeepers each year are carried out and my Department is informed where a case of a notifiable disease is detected.  Officials in my Department follow up where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The option of national action to limit or ban imports of bees must respect the primacy of EU Regulations.  The EU has strict bee health certification requirements which apply to the international trade in bees.  In accordance with Article 3 of Council Directive 92\/65\/EEC European Union Member States must not prohibit or restrict for health reasons the international movement of bees once all requirements set down in EU legislation have been met.  Direct imports of bees into Ireland from outside the EU are not permitted although imports from other EU Member States which fulfil the EU&rsquo;s bee health certification requirements are permitted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400065#WRG04500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Basic Payment Scheme Payments","counter":381,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400065#WRG04600"},{"type":"question","counter":382,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[41229\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400065#WRG04700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payment will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":383,"content":"<p>An application under the 2015 Basic Payment Scheme was received from the person named on 29 April 2015.

This access built on previous arrangements for fisheries products and has more recently been part of wider trade missions to expand the access for Irish food and seafood products in China. In the specific case of live crab, I understand from the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority that there has been a steady increase in exports most recently estimated at &euro;3 million in value with a significant number of Irish sea-fishing boats providing this product to up to 8 seafood export companies.   On 29 October 2015, the Chinese food import authorities wrote to the Irish embassy in Beijing expressing concern about the levels of the heavy metal cadmium in live crabs coming from Ireland which the authorities determined exceeded Chinese limits and requested that Ireland ensure only crabs which meet the Chinese standards for cadmium be permitted for export. I am advised that the UK is currently experiencing similar challenges.<\/p>  <p>  European legislation sets a limit of 0.5 mg\/kg for white muscle meat from the limbs only; however the Chinese authorities are currently applying this limit to all crabmeat. I understand that crabs take in cadmium from the environment and it builds up in the brown meat of the crab to much higher levels than the white meat. In view of the Chinese request to meet this standard for live crabs, the SFPA notified Irish crab exporters of the new monitoring requirements and the difficulties this would pose for providing health certificates for live Irish crabs intended for export to China.<\/p>  <p>  As part of efforts to support the trade of compliant safe seafood, a Memorandum of Understanding is in place with the Chinese import authorities which allows for technical dialogue. With the support of the Marine Institute and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the SFPA has sought to raise this issue with the Chinese authorities in recent weeks. The SFPA is leading on a technical response to the communication from the Chinese authorities before the end of November with a view to meaningful dialogue around reconsideration of the tissues to which this limit applies. To date, there have been two meetings with representatives of the crab industry to facilitate exploration of a range of approaches which may be adopted to address this challenge.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Marine Institute, that Irish waters have very low cadmium levels. It is important to bear in mind that heavy metals occur naturally at low levels in the marine environment and as such do not pose a food safety risk. I am satisfied that the procedures which are in place for monitoring the safety of Irish seafood, including live crab, meet the stringent European standards and consumers can continue to have high confidence in the quality of Irish seafood.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400066#WRH02100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":427,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400066#WRH02150"},{"type":"question","counter":428,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[39537\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400066#WRH02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if hares were sick or dying at Cashel Coursing Club in County Tipperary, resulting in the cancellation of meetings on 10 and 11 October 2015; if post mortems were carried out, and further to the official coursing club website stating unsuitable ground, if he will provide details of the unsuitable ground conditions.","asker":"1005","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":429,"content":"<p>Under the provisions of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, the regulation of coursing is chiefly a matter for the Irish Coursing Club (ICC), subject to the general control and direction of Bord na gCon, which is the statutory body with responsibility for the improvement and development of the greyhound industry, greyhound racing and coursing.

This access built on previous arrangements for fisheries products and has more recently been part of wider trade missions to expand the access for Irish food and seafood products in China. In the specific case of live crab, I understand from the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority that there has been a steady increase in exports most recently estimated at &euro;3 million in value with a significant number of Irish sea-fishing boats providing this product to up to 8 seafood export companies.<\/p>  <p>  On 29 October 2015, the Chinese food import authorities wrote to the Irish embassy in Beijing expressing concern about the levels of the heavy metal cadmium in live crabs coming from Ireland which the authorities determined exceeded Chinese limits and requested that Ireland ensure only crabs which meet the Chinese standards for cadmium be permitted for export. I am advised that the UK is currently experiencing similar challenges. <\/p>  <p>  European legislation sets a limit of 0.5 mg\/kg for white muscle meat from the limbs only; however the Chinese authorities are currently applying this limit to all crabmeat. I understand that crabs take in cadmium from the environment and it builds up in the brown meat of the crab to much higher levels than the white meat. In view of the Chinese request to meet this standard for live crabs, the SFPA notified Irish crab exporters of the new monitoring requirements and the difficulties this would pose for providing health certificates for live Irish crabs intended for export to China.<\/p>  <p>  As part of efforts to support the trade of compliant safe seafood, a Memorandum of Understanding is in place with the Chinese import authorities which allows for technical dialogue. With the support of the Marine Institute and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the SFPA has sought to raise this issue with the Chinese authorities in recent weeks. The SFPA is leading on a technical response to the communication from the Chinese authorities before the end of November with a view to meaningful dialogue around reconsideration of the tissues to which this limit applies. To date, there have been two meetings with representatives of the crab industry to facilitate exploration of a range of approaches which may be adopted to address this challenge.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Marine Institute, that Irish waters have very low cadmium levels. It is important to bear in mind that heavy metals occur naturally at low levels in the marine environment and as such do not pose a food safety risk. I am satisfied that the procedures which are in place for monitoring the safety of Irish seafood, including live crab, meet the stringent European standards and consumers can continue to have high confidence in the quality of Irish seafood.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400068#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Partnerships","counter":526,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400068#WRK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":527,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[41504\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400068#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will follow through on previous commitments to allow young trained farmers who have joint herd numbers with their parents to qualify for the 60% grant rate for erecting agricultural sheds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":528,"content":"<p>To avail of the 60% grant rate applicants are required either to hold a herd number in their own right, be part of a Department registered Farm Partnership or a qualifying director in a company and meet the eligibility conditions of the Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme.

The value fluctuates from year to year depending on the climatic conditions during the summer.  There are almost 2,500 beekeepers in the country. Over 56% of these have 3 colonies or less whilst only 3% or approximately 70 beekeepers have more than 50 colonies. Only 5 beekeepers have over 150 colonies which many would consider to be a commercial apiary.   <\/p>  <p>  One of the major issues facing beekeeping is the issue of bee health and my Department recognises the importance of maintaining and further developing a healthy honey bee population. With this in mind, the signing into law of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 repealed the out-dated 1908 Bee Pest Prevention Act. American Foulbrood and the Small Hive Beetle are both notifiable diseases under the Notification and Control of Animal Diseases Regulations 2014 (SI No. 110 of 2014). While American Foulbrood has existed in Ireland for many years the Small Hive Beetle has never been found in Ireland. In response to the 2014 outbreak of Small Hive Beetle in Italy my Department established a sentinel apiary programme earlier this year. This programme was established with the support of the Federation of Irish Beekeeping Associations and the Native Irish Honey Bee Society. A similar programme has also been rolled out across Northern Ireland.  The sentinel apiary programme is designed with the objective of providing early notification in the event that any exotic pest or disease affecting honey bees arrives in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a bee diagnostic service is operated from the Teagasc laboratories at Teagasc, Oakpark in Carlow. Analysis of approximately 300 samples submitted by beekeepers each year are carried out.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides grant aid to Beekeepers under the national Horticultural Grant Scheme. The current Scheme is advertised on the Department's website with a closing date of 18 December 2015. In recognition of the smaller scale of beekeeping compared with other sectors of horticulture a minimum investment of &euro;2,000 is required compared to &euro;10,000 for other areas of horticulture.   <\/p>  <p>  The Department also provides an annual grant to the Federation of Irish Beekeepers&rsquo; Associations (FIBKA). The objective is to assist FIBKA meet its operating costs and thereby allow the association promote the craft of beekeeping among its members, including the organising of training courses as well as informing the general public of the role of bees in our environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400069#WRL01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Scheme Payments","counter":608,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400069#WRL01550"},{"type":"question","counter":609,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[41783\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400069#WRL01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payments under the basic payments scheme and the areas of natural constraint scheme will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":610,"content":"<p>An application under the 2015 Basic Payment\/Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme was received in my Department from the person named on 8 April 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Payment under Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme has not issued to the person named, at this stage, as the holding concerned has not satisfied the Scheme&rsquo;s minimum stocking density requirements. <\/p>  <p>  Under the 2015 Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme, eligible applicants are required to have met a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units for a retention period of seven consecutive months and to maintain an annual average of 0.15 livestock units calculated over the twelve months of the scheme year.

Historically there were two herring stocks in the north western waters and correspondingly two separate ICES Total Allowable Catch (TAC) areas - Via South\/VIIb,c and VIa North. Ireland has a 92% share of VIa south and a 15% share of VIa north.<\/p>  <p>  The TAC for 2015 for VIa south is zero. A mid year review of this stock was undertaken following new advice and a benchmarking exercise by ICES and the advice for 2015 was not changed.\u00a0\u00a0This ICES advice for 2016 is for a zero TAC for both areas and recommends a re-building plan. There is within the advice the possibility of a reduced TAC that would be applicable to both areas. The added complexity is that while it is scientifically acknowledged that there are two separate herring stocks it has not proven possible to provide separate scientific advice. Work is ongoing on this issue but it may take some time before it is possible to supply such separate advice.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission has yet to make any proposal for North West Herring for 2016. I will be arguing strongly in advance of the December Fisheries Council that a small commercial catch for both areas is justified by the scientific advice and such a quota will facilitate the ongoing work to separate the two stocks. I am also fully supportive of a rebuilding plan as recommended by ICES and supported by the Pelagic Advisory Council.   <\/p>  <p>  Consequently, with regard to this stock, my first priority is to try and convince the EU Commission that a small commercial catch is justified. In that regard, I will be working closely with the UK Minister, in particular, who has a strong interest in the VIa north stock and I will be seeking to reach agreement on the allocations between the areas for any such TAC. If I am successful in that endeavour, and given that the TACs and associated quotas are likely to be modest, I will be considering the allocation of this quota on an exceptional basis in consultation with stakeholders taking account of the interests of small operators who have limited other pelagic opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400069#WRL03300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Scheme Eligibility","counter":635,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400069#WRL03350"},{"type":"question","counter":636,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[41837\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400069#WRL03400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he is aware of the difficulties arising for some young farmers due to the date for enrolment for the green certificate being brought forward from 30 September 2016 to 31 December 2015; of the particular concerns for some young persons who had emigrated and who were planning to return home to take up farming in 2016; if the original date of 30 September 2016 will be restored as the qualifying date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":637,"content":"<p>Applicants to the 2015 National Reserve and Young Farmers Scheme who had not yet commenced their FETAC Level 6 or equivalent agricultural education course were required to register for training with an agricultural education provider prior to submitting their application under the schemes.

In this regard the courts are independent in matters of sentencing and, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  <\/p>  <p>  In respect of sentencing, the position is that the law generally sets out the maximum sentence that can be imposed for an offence and it is then a matter for the court to decide the appropriate sentence in each particular case, taking into account all the circumstances.  However, provision has also been made in legislation requiring the courts to impose custodial sentences consecutively in certain situations, including where offences are committed by persons on bail.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015 which deals with the issue of multiple home burglaries and is currently before this House.  In practice many burglary offences are committed by the same persons and the Bill will amend existing legislation to require a court which decides to impose custodial sentences for multiple domestic burglary offences committed within a 12 month window to impose such sentences consecutively.  This Bill is being progressed very actively by the Government and I expect that it will be enacted during the current parliamentary session.<\/p>  <p>  As regards bail conditions, the position is that in July the Government approved the drafting of a Bail Bill which will strengthen the operation of the bail system and make the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail.  This legislation is currently being drafted on a priority basis and it is my intention that the Bill will be published as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The new Bail Bill will contain a number of provisions to strengthen protection for victims.  For example, in addition to any other bail condition that a court can impose, the Bill will provide that a court may require an accused person not to have contact with the victim of the alleged offence or any member of the victim&rsquo;s family unless the contact is authorised by the court.  I also propose to make specific provision in the Bill for victim evidence to be heard in bail proceedings in cases where there may be a likelihood of harm or intimidation to the victim or a family member of the victim.  <\/p>  <p>  Both I and my Department engage extensively with groups representing victims of crime.

If people are unwilling to do this they have the option to approach the immigration authorities to seek permission to remain in the State.  Such cases would be carefully considered, taking the all relevant circumstances into account, before any final decision was made.  An important factor in any such consideration would be the circumstances in which the person concerned became undocumented.  In some cases that decision would result in their being granted leave to remain.  In other instances they would be required to leave the State and to respect the decision of the Irish authorities. <\/p><p>While I appreciate the Deputy's concerns on this issue, it is the responsibility of all non-EEA nationals who are resident in the State to ensure that they have an appropriate permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality.

While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of persons present in the State without first examining the merits of their individual cases.

This includes the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011 which requires the sentencing judge to consider the imposition of community service where a custodial sentence of 12 months or less is being considered. <\/p><p>In conjunction with the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service has continued the national roll out of the Community Return Programme, an incentivised scheme for earned temporary release under which carefully selected offenders can be granted structured temporary release in return for supervised community service. In addition to this programme, Community Support Schemes have been set up in Cork Prison, Mountjoy Campus, West Dublin Campus and Limerick Prisons, the aim of which is to reduce recidivism rates by arranging for additional support structures and provide for a more structured form of temporary release.<\/p><p>The Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014 provides that the Court imposing a fine shall take into account a person's financial circumstances.

Health related therapy supports and interventions for children, such as speech and language therapy, can be accessed through both the HSE&rsquo;s primary care services and its disability services, depending on the level of need.  Significant additional resources have been invested in recent years in the State&rsquo;s primary care and disability services with a view to enhancing therapy service provision. <\/p><p>Additional funding of &euro;20m was allocated in 2013 to strengthen primary care services and to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line posts, including over 260 additional posts for Primary Care Teams.  In addition, the HSE has introduced a number of initiatives specifically in relation to speech and language therapy services that are aimed at improving access to these services, such as therapists increasing clinic based work and providing family centred interventions in a group, as opposed to a one-to-one setting, whenever possible.  <\/p><p>The HSE is also currently engaged in a major reconfiguration of its existing therapy resources for children with disabilities into multi-disciplinary geographically based teams, as part of its National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years)<i>.<\/i>The key objective of this Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties.  An additional &euro;4m was allocated in 2014 to assist in implementing the Progressing Disability Services Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  Further investment of &euro;4 million (equating to &euro;6 million in a full year) has been provided this year to support its ongoing implementation. <\/p><p>Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Within this context, funding is being provided in 2016 to expand the provision of speech and language therapy through primary care services and to support the reorganisation and expansion of speech and language and other therapies under the Progressing Disability Services Programme.

There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.<\/p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive (HSE), unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400074#WRQ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Procedures","counter":888,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400074#WRQ02350"},{"type":"question","counter":889,"qnumday":374,"qnumall":"[41302\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400074#WRQ02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of colonoscopies that have been carried out in public hospitals over the past 12 months, by hospital and in tabular form; the number of patients on waiting lists for colonoscopies in public hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":890,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.

In accordance with the Act, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants. Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines but where they who face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that there are people with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner. Greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE because the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to nearly 96,000 at the beginning of November this year. This followed the measures announced by Minister Varadkar and I last year, when the \"Keane\" Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility was published. The Deputy may be aware that a key recommendation of that report was that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. It also recommended that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.<\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the Keane Report, the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  The Director General of the HSE accepted an interim recommendation of the Group to award medical card eligibility to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer, effective from 1 July 2015.  Any child not 18 and who has had a diagnosis of cancer within the preceding 5 years ending 30 June 2015 may be awarded a medical card under the terms of this decision for such period, not to exceed five years, as seems appropriate in the individual circumstances. The Group is continuing its work  on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions.<\/p>  <p>  We do not have a universal eligibility system for primary and community health services. Until we have universal health care and everyone is entitled to health care, one will always have anomalies and injustices. There will always be somebody who is just above the means threshold, or who does not have the prescribed disease, or whose condition is not sufficiently severe and, as a result, these individuals will not meet the assessment criteria.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, I have asked the HSE,  which operates the General Medical Services scheme, to respond directly to the Deputy.

Regrettably, it was not possible to find an overall agreement, with a particular difficulty around finding the appropriate balance between the onward disclosure needs of families and arrangements necessary to protect national security.  In the final hours of the talks it became clear that the choice was between removing the legacy elements from the agreement or having no agreement and thus seeing a grave risk to the future of power-sharing institutions.  I argued strongly for at least those elements on which agreement had been reached remaining in the text.  To my disappointment this did not prove possible.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to stress that good progress was made on agreeing many of the details necessary for the establishment of the new institutional framework for dealing with the legacy of the past. Based on the talks we have had over ten weeks, I believe that agreement is very close on many of the details necessary for the establishment of these new institutions, including on; ensuring the operational independence of the Historical Investigations Unit (HIU); guaranteeing the anonymity and inadmissibility of information provided to the Independent Commission for Information Retrieval (ICIR) while making clear that there would be no amnesty for any criminal offences; placing the Implementation and Reconciliation Group (IRG) on a statutory footing and settling on the purpose and functions of the IRG; and on the detail and operation of the Oral History Archive (OHA). <\/p>  <p>  Building on this substantial progress made in the talks, the two Governments will reflect further on the remaining open issues and on how they will be advanced. This will involve engaging with the other parties to find an agreed basis for the establishment of the institutions dealing with the past.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this process I will meet the NI Victims Commissioner this week and my officials are undertaking a round of consultations with victims groups in order to ensure that they are at the heart of how we take this forward. I know that victims and their families feel let down and I am determined that this Government will not be found wanting in playing its part to put things back on track.  <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Government is committed to fulfilling its specific commitments on establishing the institutions  dealing with the past and the necessary enabling legislation will be introduced in the Oireachtas at the appropriate time. The international agreement necessary for the establishment of the ICIR has also been agreed between the British and Irish Governments. <\/p>  <p>  I remain convinced that the new legacy institutions as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement are the best way of providing whatever healing is possible to the victims and survivors of the Troubles and their families, including those affected by collusion.  <\/p>  <p>  The establishment of these institutions in accordance with the Stormont House Agreement remains a priority for the Government. The needs of victims and survivors will remain central to our work. We are determined to achieve the establishment of these institutions so that we can in a fundamental way deal with the past, foster reconciliation and build a society for future generations that is free from hurt and suspicion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400077#WRT05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Application Refusals","counter":1096,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400077#WRT05500"},{"type":"question","counter":1097,"qnumday":445,"qnumall":"[41667\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400077#WRT05600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the reason a passport has been issued to one person but not to another (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":1098,"content":"<p>The Passports Act, 2008 (the Act) provides, among other things, that only Irish citizens are entitled to be issued with Irish passports.

In such cases, the EU national is regarded as having resided in the island of Ireland for the declared periods for the purposes of the 1956 Act, unless the contrary is proven. These declarations must be supported in passport applications for children by original documentary evidence that must verify the actual and continuous residence of the parents in question.<\/p><p>A passport application for the older of the two siblings was received in August 2011.  The applicant&rsquo;s father submitted a fully complete Form A in which he declared that he had been resident in the State since May 2004.  The evidence submitted, comprising tax documents, showed that he had the required residence within the four year period preceding this child&rsquo;s date of birth (i.e. March 2007 to March 2011) to demonstrate his child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship.

The four year period of evidence of residence of a parent extends from April 2009 to April 2013 which is a later timeframe to that of the older child; and<br \/><br \/>-  The submitted Form A was completed by the applicant&rsquo;s mother.  The evidence required of her residence in State is therefore different from that of the father in the case of the older child.<\/blockquote><p>To verify evidence of residence within the review period of April 2009 to April 2013, the applicant&rsquo;s mother has submitted the following documents:<\/p><p>-  Correspondence from Roscommon County Council, dated from 22 February 2010 to 18 May 2012, in regard to the allocation and rental of council property to her; and<\/p><p>-  Correspondence from the Department of Social Protection, dated 4 March 2010 regarding the payment of benefits.<\/p><p>The evidence above is insufficient to demonstrate the youngest child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship.  The Department has been in direct contact with the applicant&rsquo;s mother to inform her of this position and to outline the outstanding requirements to finalise this child&rsquo;s application to passport issue.

A strategy to achieve this will be put in place by the Northern Ireland Executive and an international body will be established to report on progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish and British Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive have also committed to reinforce our efforts to tackle organised crime associated with the legacy of paramilitarism. We have agreed to establish a Joint Agency Task Force to identify strategic priorities for combatting cross-border organised crime and to oversee operational co-ordination. This work will be supported by additional resources. In addition, a tri-lateral cross-border Ministerial meeting will take place next month between Minister Fitzgerald and her counterparts from the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to agree new measures to further enhance law enforcement cooperation.<\/p>  <p>  The Fresh Start Agreement is also about financial stability and reform. Pursuing economic prosperity and job creation is critical to building a peaceful society in Northern Ireland. In recognition of this, the Irish Government has committed to providing support and funding for important infrastructure projects as well as for investment in the North West Region. <\/p>  <p>  In the Agreement, the Irish Government restated its commitment under the St Andrews Agreement to co-fund the construction of the A5 through Northern Ireland to Derry, which will improve access to Derry and North Donegal. Under the Fresh Start Agreement, the Government specifically reaffirms its existing commitment to providing funding of &pound;50 million for this project and commits to providing an additional &pound;25 million to ensure that Phase 1 of the project can commence as soon as the necessary planning issues have been resolved by the Northern Ireland authorities. In accordance with the revised project timeline, this funding will be provided in three tranches of &pound;25 million in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively and therefore it has been agreed that the first section of the A5 will commence in 2017 and this will be the route between Newbuildings (outside Derry) to north of Strabane. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Agreement, the Government is committed to continue exploring the development of cross-border Greenways and Blueway cycling-walking-water leisure routes, including the Ulster Canal. In February 2015, the Government announced &euro;2 million for the restoration of the 2.5 km Upper Lough Erne to Castle Saunderson section. This is due to be completed in 2017. We have also agreed with the Northern Ireland Executive to undertake a review to identify options for jointly developing future phases of the Ulster Canal restoration project, which will be considered by the North South Ministerial Council in June 2016. <\/p>  <p>  In the Agreement, the Government has also reiterated our commitment to the concept of the Narrow Water Bridge. We have agreed with the Northern Ireland Executive to undertake a review of the project to identify options for future development which will also be considered at the North South Ministerial Council in June 2016. <\/p>  <p>  In addition the Government has decided to provide funding of &euro;2.5 million to support the North West Gateway Initiative, which will be complemented by matching funding from the Northern Ireland Executive. This is a demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to support the regional development work of the North West Gateway Initiative which will be of real benefit to Donegal as well as Derry. <\/p>  <p>  In order to drive these projects forward, a group of senior officials from the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government will meet regularly to maintain a strategic overview of economic and infrastructural investment. Regular progress reports will be provided to the North South Ministerial Council. This group will also consider opportunities for sourcing further investment for all-island infrastructure projects for mutual benefit, including through PPPs, EU funding and other non-Exchequer sources. <\/p>  <p>  I believe that the funding committed by the Irish Government under the Fresh Start Agreement, which amounts to &euro;110 million in total, represents a good investment for the people of Ireland.  This investment is aimed at unlocking the full potential of the all island economy. Such targeted investment in cross border economic infrastructure will be key to continued growth of the island&rsquo;s indigenous enterprise base, boosting tourism and to driving and sustaining overseas investment levels. This is crucial for job creation and all-island prosperity and to ensure that the socio-economic dividend made possible by the Good Friday and subsequent Agreements is fully realised. This funding will therefore benefit all citizens on the island of Ireland. I would add that this financial commitment is predicated on a stable political environment in Northern Ireland, with all the institutions and North South bodies operating to full effect. It is therefore important that the Fresh Start Agreement is fully implemented. <\/p>  <p>  In this Agreement, the British Government has also recognised the importance of underpinning the implementation of its provisions by way of financial support so that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s public finances can be placed on a sound footing, which is so important for economic stability and development, and to assist with the transition of Northern Ireland from a society emerging from decades of conflict. The Fresh Start Agreement paves the way for the implementation of the financial package committed to the British Government under the Stormont House Agreement which gives the Northern Ireland Executive &pound;2 billion in additional spending. The British Government has now agreed to provide further financial support of around &pound;500 million which is aimed at assisting the Northern Ireland Executive in tackling issues unique to Northern Ireland such as support for programmes to remove peace walls. <\/p>  <p>  The Fresh Start Agreement also agrees a way forward on Welfare reform. While the necessary legislation will be passed at Westminster, the Welfare Bill was, in accordance with the Agreement, debated and approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly by way of a Legislative Consent Motion on 18 November. This approval also covered the draft Order in Council which gives effect in Northern Ireland to the 2012 welfare changes in Britain, the welfare clauses of the Welfare Reform and Work Bill as initially introduced at Westminster and the Northern Ireland Executive&rsquo;s proposals to enhance payments flowing from the Fresh Start Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  This was agreed by the two main parties in Northern Ireland, working through the power sharing devolved Executive, and endorsed by the Northern Ireland Assembly. The explicit consent given by the Assembly protects the principle of devolved government in Northern Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Fresh Start Agreement, the Northern Ireland Executive has agreed to allocate a total of &pound;585 million from Executive funds over four years to &lsquo;top-up&rsquo; welfare arrangements in Northern Ireland through welfare enhancements and tax credits. The Executive has agreed to establish a small working group under the leadership of Professor Eileen Evason to bring forward proposals within this financial envelope to maximise the use of these additional resources. The Executive has agreed to implement the findings of the working group. <\/p>  <p>  While important progress was made on taking forward aspects of the Stormont House Agreement dealing with the legacy of the past, it did not prove possible to resolve all of the key issues within the timescale of this negotiation. Nevertheless, the two Governments will persist in our efforts to secure an agreed basis for the establishment of the institutions dealing with the past envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  I believe that the Fresh Start Agreement presents a very positive result at the end of 10 weeks of intensive and often challenging negotiations. I regret the fact that some of the parties were not in a position to fully sign up to this Agreement. This was not due to a lack of effort by the Government. I consistently urged all participants to work towards an outcome which would be as comprehensive and inclusive as possible throughout the talks process. It was, however, inevitable that the two largest parties needed to take a leading role as without their shared support there would be no agreement. I believe that this demonstrates a maturity in the politics of Northern Ireland and that power-sharing can in fact work as envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  That said, I believe that the agreement reflects positive contributions made to the talks process by all of the parties involved, especially when it comes to the measures agreed on ending paramilitarism and tackling criminality.  I absolutely accept that each party needs to make their own decision about the content of this agreement and to have the necessary time to do this. Careful consideration will, I hope, enable some of the other parties to get behind elements of the agreement many of which are clearly of great importance to them and to the people they represent. <\/p>  <p>  The Fresh Start Agreement is about protecting the gains delivered by the Good Friday Agreement and placing devolved power-sharing government on a sustainable footing. It is now important that government in Northern Ireland delivers for the people of Northern Ireland. It is for the parties to this agreement, with the support of the two Governments, to ensure that this new opportunity is fully embraced.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400078#WRU01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1115,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 452 and 453 answered with Question No. 444.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1116,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 454 to 458, inclusive, answered with Question No. 448.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1117,"content":"<p>Question No. 459 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":1119,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400078#WRU02100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Momentum Programme","counter":1118,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400078#WRU02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1119,"qnumday":460,"qnumall":"[41564\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400078#WRU02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the future of the momentum programme; what will happen to its unused budget; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1120,"content":"<p>The expectation is that the current round of the Momentum programme will spend the full allocated budget for the programme.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of a further round of Momentum officials in my Department are working with their colleagues in the Department of Social Protection to determine the overall requirement for education and training programmes for 2016.

The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my  Department's Circular 0030\/2014. <\/p><p>  It is important to note that each school's allocation of SNA support can change  from year to year and may be increased or decreased as students who qualify for  SNA support enrol or leave a school.  New students with care needs may, or may  not, enrol to replace students who have left, for example, or SNA allocations  may be decreased where a child's care needs have diminished over time. <\/p><p>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual  Principal\/Board of Management.

This is a great vote of confidence in Ireland and our education and training providers.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there is a worldwide demand for ICT skills and in particular for those with ICT skills and relevant industry experience. <\/p><p>  Given the scale of demand for ICT skills, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation launched a revised Government\/Industry ICT Skills Action Plan in 2014.  The Plan takes a comprehensive approach including increases in high-level graduate output, enhancing awareness of ICT as a career among students, maintaining a strong talent pool and promoting Ireland as a destination for ICT talent. Implementation of the plan is being overseen by a high-level steering group shared by the two departments and including representatives from industry and the education system, and delivery teams have been set up to progress areas of work set out under the plan.<\/p><p>ICT graduate output from the higher education sector has increased significantly since the first ICT plan was published in 2011.<\/p><p>  As well as mainstream provision in the higher education sector, Springboard+ 2015, which incorporates the ICT skills conversion programme, is providing over 9,000 free higher education places for jobseekers who wish to upskill or reskill in areas where there are identified skills needs.  This is the largest Springboard offering to-date.<\/p><p>  ICT conversion courses are also open to a wide cohort of applicants given the priority in this area.<\/p><p>  Employment outcomes for Springboard graduates are very strong and further information on outcomes is available in the trend analysis reports published on my Department's website.<\/p><p>  In addition, under Momentum 6,000 free further education and training places have been made available for long-term jobseekers, on courses where there are identified skills needs.<\/p><p>  Following on from a comprehensive review of the Irish apprenticeship system, a major initiative is also underway to reform and expand apprenticeship.  The content of existing apprenticeships is being modernised, with new curricula being rolled out in five of the most popular trades and a curriculum review underway in the remaining trades.  A new Apprenticeship Council has been established that is prioritising the development of 25 new apprenticeships in areas such as ICT, financial services, transport and tourism and hospitality.  These new apprenticeships are being progressed following the evaluation of responses to a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers.  This expansion of apprenticeship will provide new options for school leavers as well as for those seeking to reskill or upskill in the labour market.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that, as part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2015, my Department is leading on the development of a new National Skills Strategy.  The Strategy will aim to ensure that Ireland's current and future workforce needs are met through increased participation, educational attainment, skills development and skill use to achieve greater productivity and support economic and social prosperity and growth. I have invited all interested parties to contribute to the process by submitting their views, on the development of the Strategy, before Tuesday 1st December 2015.  Full details on the consultation process are available on the Department's website at www.education.ie As part of this work, my Department is also leading a project to create a network of regional skills fora to foster greater engagement between the education and training system, employers and other local stakeholders in building the skills needs of their regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400080#WRW02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Eligibility","counter":1242,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400080#WRW02950"},{"type":"question","counter":1243,"qnumday":504,"qnumall":"[41595\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400080#WRW03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will grant free school transport for a person (details supplied) in County Longford.","asker":"1065","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1244,"content":"<p>Under the terms of my Department's Primary School Transport Scheme children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest national school as determined by my Department\/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.<\/p><p>  The child in question is not eligible for school transport as she is not attending her nearest school. <\/p><p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may avail of transport on a concessionary basis subject to a number of conditions including the availability of spare seats and the payment of the annual charge; a medical card waiver does not apply to concessionary transport.<\/p><p>  I understand that the School Transport Appeals Board considered this case at their most recent meeting and that the Board has informed the family directly of their determination on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400080#WRW03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1078"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Patronage","counter":1245,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400080#WRW03150"},{"type":"question","counter":1246,"qnumday":505,"qnumall":"[41598\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400080#WRW03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of schools who are under the patronage of the Catholic Church, including schools under the patronage of dioceses, religious orders or other bodies within the Church that have been vacated and offered for divestment to her Department, but have yet to be handed over to other patron bodies; the location of each of these schools and the date from which her Department was made aware that these schools would be available for divestment; the reason for any delay by her Department in completing the divestment process in relation to these schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1188","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1247,"content":"<p>My Department is considering the offer of a number of school buildings by the Catholic church under the patronage divesting process.

The school principal manages the school on a day-to-day basis.<\/p>  <p>  As my Department has no role in the employment of staff in schools or schools' day-to-day management, a complaint about the child's school and its staff is proper to the school itself.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, whereas my Department provides funding and policy direction for schools, my Department does not have the power to instruct schools to follow a particular course of action in regard to individual complaint cases.

A core objective of the Charter will be to shift away from reacting to problems only after they give rise to grievances.

It is also permissible for a school to seek payments in respect of extra-curricular activities provided such activities are not obligatory and individual pupils can choose whether or not to participate.  No charge may be made, however, in respect of instruction in any subject of the school curriculum or for recreation or other activities where all pupils are expected to take part.<\/p>  <p>  The manner in which such voluntary contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school management.

Landlords affected by these changes should have engaged with their tenants during this time to discuss the implications of any works that needed to be carried out on their properties.  The revised standards in the 2008 Regulations do not specifically target bedsits but were based on a review of minimum standards dating back to 1993 which tolerated very basic facilities such as external toilets, cold water only and having an open fireplace as the only heating source.  In consultation with key stakeholders including organisations representing landlords and tenant rights, such as Threshold and the IPOA, the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008 were drafted.  Minimum standards are necessary as a protection to all consumers and especially to the most vulnerable who may not be in a position to protect themselves adequately.   <\/p>  <p>  Census 2011 indicated that there were approximately 4,500 bed-sits across the country &ndash; the majority of which were in Dublin &ndash; accounting for 1% of households in the private rented sector.  In 2012, Dublin City Council commenced an intensified inspection programme, funded by my Department, specifically targeting properties likely to be at risk of non-compliance.  It found that 90 % of dwellings selected for inspection were non-compliant with the regulations on initial inspection.  It is worth emphasising that 72% of the dwellings inspected were failing on fire safety grounds.  By the end of March 2015, 73 % of the non-compliant properties had been brought into compliance resulting in improved standards for tenants in over 4,000 properties.

The Residential Tenancies Act will give most AHB tenants greater rights than they currently have by giving them the right to a four year tenancy under Part 4 of the Act. The entitlement to a four year tenancy is a minimum entitlement for tenants after 6 months. This does not prevent landlords providing for longer fixed-term tenancies should they wish to do so and there is nothing in the Act to prevent a landlord providing a tenant with more beneficial rights generally than those that are provided for in the Act. <\/p><p>The Residential Tenancies Act provides a base level of protection for tenants. When AHB tenancies come within the remit of the Act, AHB tenants will not lose any advantages they might have over private rented tenants; rather, they will benefit from the additional legal protection provided by the Residential Tenancies Act. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400082#WRY03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electoral Commission Establishment","counter":1368,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400082#WRY03650"},{"type":"question","counter":1369,"qnumday":548,"qnumall":"[41611\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400082#WRY03700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the status of the establishment of an independent electoral commission; when it will be established and functioning; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1053","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1370,"content":"<p>In January 2015, I published a consultation paper on the establishment of an Electoral Commission and invited the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht to undertake a public consultation process on that paper and report back to me.\u00a0  The Committee completed its consultations at the end of July 2015 and, I understand, is currently considering its report and recommendations.

In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport power from renewable sources.

However, the extent to which electric vehicles are adopted in the short-to-medium term will depend on a range of factors including, inter alia, the strength of the economy, the overall numbers of new cars being purchased, the cost of purchasing and running electric vehicles compared to fossil fuel comparators, and the number of different electric vehicle models available to purchase.

Natural heritage areas are designated under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 and are legally protected from negative impacts from the date they are formally proposed for designation through a requirement to obtain Ministerial consent before certain potentially damaging activities are undertaken on these sites. <\/p><p>The criteria to which the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht shall have regard to, when publishing a notice of an intention to designate a natural heritage area, are set out in section 16(6) of the Act of 2000.<\/p><p>When a landowner has been refused Ministerial consent to carry out certain proposed works in a natural heritage area, a claim for compensation may be made to my Department not later than 6 months from the date of issue of the decision refusing consent. The provisions relating to compensation are set out in section 22 of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000. In this regard, as there are legal proceedings ongoing, taken by the landowner referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question, it would not be appropriate for me to refer further to matters which are the subject of these proceedings.<\/p><p>The Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network, published in January 2014<i>, <\/i>which is available to download from my Department&rsquo;s website, provides detail on future arrangements regarding turf cutting on each of the 75 current raised bog natural heritage areas. The Review<i><\/i>has concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network. This will entail the phasing out of turf cutting on certain natural heritage areas by 1 January 2017 and the partial or complete de-designation of certain natural heritage areas.<\/p><p>46 raised bog natural heritage areas (including parts of 7 natural heritage areas) are scheduled for de-designation. As set out in correspondence to affected persons in February 2014, restrictions on turf cutting for domestic purposes will not come into effect on these sites. However, the consent of other authorities may be required in order to undertake turf extraction on these sites in certain circumstances, for example, commercial peat extraction.<\/p><p>Regulatory change will be required to give full effect to the de-designation of the sites. The appropriate form of this change is being considered within my Department and I expect that the process will be completed by early 2016. <\/p><p>To compensate for the loss of habitat within sites where it is proposed that turf cutting can continue, 25 undesignated raised bogs, which are in public ownership or where there is reduced turf cutting pressure, will be designated as natural heritage areas. The current compensation arrangements for domestic turf cutters in raised bog special areas of conservation will be made available to affected turf cutters in the relevant natural heritage areas.<\/p><p>The necessary preparatory work in order for these sites to be proposed for designation is ongoing. This work includes the delineation of proposed boundaries, the preparation of site maps and the compilation of the details of landowners and others who may be affected by the proposed designations.<\/p><p>As with all designations, my Department will, in due course, directly contact individual landowners and users in the relevant areas and advertisements will be placed in local newspapers. An explanation will be given as to why a site is being proposed for designation and of the process through which individuals can appeal against the designation of their lands. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400085#WRBB05000","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commemorative Events","counter":1547,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400085#WRBB05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1548,"qnumday":613,"qnumall":"[41736\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112400085#WRBB05200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if the relatives of those who fought in the 1916 Rising will be invited to official ceremonies to mark the commemoration of the Rising; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":1549,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that, together with my own officials and officials across other relevant Government Departments, I am working closely with the relatives of those who took part in the events of 1916, including in particular the 1916 Relatives Association, to ensure, inter alia, fair and balanced representation of relatives at official commemoration ceremonies during 2016.
