I very much look forward to working with the new Senator, along with my colleagues, and I speak on behalf of the Labour Party group in the Seanad.  <br\/>Like others, we look forward to the budget today.

I also hope we will have time later today, when discussing the Budget Statement, to reflect on what is actually in the budget and how it will pan out.  I will look particularly at the impact on children and how their lives will be improved and not just simply having cash transfers and going back to the old way of doing things.  We debated in this House, after the last three budgets, the need to invest in services at local level and I hope we see those investments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400004#C00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1413289200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I join in the words of congratulations and welcome extended to Senator Craughwell, our new Senator.

It was a remarkable victory.  Mr. Craughwell, as he was then, contacted me in advance of the election and we had a very good discussion.  I indicated that Independents do not normally support candidates, but that since he was an Independent, if he needed a name I would supply it.  In fact, he got two nominations, so he did not need me to add my support.  I am extremely glad.  He is precisely the kind of person that we need in Seanad &Eacute;ireann - a person of independent mind, with clear views.<\/p><p>I was extremely impressed by what he said.  I was sitting with my ear cocked, listening to what he said to the media, and when he was asked about voting the Government out or voting it down in the Seanad, he said &quot;vote on the issues&quot;.  That is the policy of the Independent group.  We are all independent of each other, we discuss policy but we do not always come to the same conclusion, and we vote as a matter of conscience.  I must say I am struck by Deputy Peter Mathews's introduction in the D&aacute;il of a formula from the Bundestag, where every single Member is allowed, and indeed required by the constitution, to vote according to their conscience.  Germany has not collapsed.  This shows that democracies can allow for conscience, so why not do it here?  I welcome the fact that Senator Craughwell is also a teacher, like myself and Senator Barrett, who is a professor, and I think the Seanad will be strengthened.<\/p><p>The fact that the Government is technically in a minority is good for democracy as it means we can hold it to the principles enunciated at the time of election and we can influence it.  However, we do not block, we are not destructive, we are not negative, and we wish to co-operate.  I am glad to say that Senator Craughwell has so far indicated that he will be joining the Independent group, and that is another great addition.  It is notable that in the three by-elections, one for Seanad &Eacute;ireann and two for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, neither the Government nor the Opposition managed to get a seat.  That says something about the mood of the electorate, as did the march of 100,000 people through central Dublin a few days ago.  We will get into that later on.<\/p><p>With regard to direct provision, we may be able to be of some help.  I have been in consultation with some people and a Bill has been prepared.  I hope to introduce it, seconded by Senator van Turnhout, in the fairly near future.  That will be a test, and we will be able to see then what we can do by the passage of such progressive legislation.<\/p><p>This is a good day for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

Whatever one's background in society - whether one has a disability, or comes from a poor background - if one gets a quality education, the goalposts may be moved into an equal position.  One will then get the same opportunities as everybody else.  I am, therefore, like others, looking forward to Senator Craughwell's contributions in the area of education.  I would also like to acknowledge his family in the Visitors Gallery.  It is a very proud day for them.  I remember the first day I came into Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

In the last days I have expressed concern that RTE is going to get rid of the long wave service, which is the last remaining broadcast radio service with Irish programmes available in the UK.  While this move will not affect a huge number of people, it will certainly affect people in rural areas and the Irish diaspora in the UK, particularly the elderly and vulnerable.  Listeners can tune in to radio stations online and via satellite, but the DAB service that RTE offers is not available in Britain or the North.  RTE has broadcast Radio 1 to Britain on that wavelength since 1932, and many of the Irish immigrants use it to listen to GAA matches from home.  For some, it is their last connection to Ireland, and the shutdown, first of medium wave, and now of long wave is severing a vital connection to home for certain vulnerable people.  Estimates suggest that it would cost RTE approximately &euro;150,000.  There will be a lot of talk of budgets today but in the context of RTE's overall budget this does not seem like such a huge amount of money.  As such, I am urging RTE to postpone this move until there are better options that will make RTE radio accessible to all the Irish in Britain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400006#E00800","speaker":"1153"},{"type":"speech","time":1413290400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400006#E00900","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1413290400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I join with others in welcoming our new colleague and wish him every success in his endeavours here in the coming months and years.

They have been in a position so far today to give us details of the impact of the budget on every household.  This is a recent practice of recent years begun by the previous Government.  It is highly disrespectful and shows contempt for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is consistent for the Taoiseach given that he wanted to abolish this House, and we know about the affairs of recent weeks in terms of the manipulation of the membership of various bodies.  It does not augur well when we see this level of disdain for the institutions of the State and ultimately the people whereby, to curry favour with the media, the budget has been systematically leaked by members of Cabinet or perhaps the Taoiseach, so that it is available to all except the people, instead of going through the correct procedure.  I thought that such matters were governed by Cabinet confidentiality which in fact is not the prerogative of the Taoiseach or individual Ministers, but the prerogative of the State and its people.  The basic approach that should be taken by any Government is to respect that and keep things confidential until such time as they are brought into the public domain through the Houses of the Oireachtas.

It is important to give people information on how money is being used.  We must make sure we get value for money.  I suggest we are still not getting value for money in some areas.  We need to work towards getting value for money.  I have serious questions about the use by local authorities of the moneys they collect through commercial rates and housing rents.  In the near future, we should debate whether the delivery of services by many State systems could be more efficient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400007#F00900","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413291300,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I would like to welcome Senator Craughwell to the House and extend many congratulations to him.

We were told by the then Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, that when the water services plan, which was farmed out to the Commission for Energy Regulation, was ready, it would be brought back to the Oireachtas so that we could have our say.

Should they allow their mortgages to slip a bit further so they can pay the Government's water charges?  Should families that cannot put enough food on the table put even less food on the table to pay these charges?  Should people who cannot afford to pay existing bills let those bills go into further arrears to pay water charges?  This was not properly explained by the Government.

As the Leader of the House will know, I have held a number of public meetings on the issue of water charges in Waterford city and county.  The anger out there is real.  People on the other side of the House can smile, but they do not get the reality of what it is like for many families that cannot afford to pay another austerity tax.  They do not have the money to give.  Perhaps the Leader will give some advice to families that cannot afford to pay existing bills.  Which bills should they not pay so they can pay water charges?  I reiterate my call for a debate.  I am seeking to amend the Order of Business to call on the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come to the House today.

I am a great believer in it but I keep my eyes open.  There has been far less competition in the petrol and oil business than used to be the case.  A number of petrol stations have closed down.  I read recently there has been a reduction of 16% in the Brent oil price, yet there does not appear to be any reduction in the price of fuel in petrol stations around the country, certainly not in Dublin as far as I am aware.  That is something that would be worthy of debate in the House to see whether we are managing to establish competition in the fuel business to ensure citizens are getting the best value.<\/p><p>A biography was recently published on T.K.

He will be 98 years of age in early December but he is full of energy and vigour and he is still thinking as actively as he ever thought.

Those of us in this House who care and are serious about political reform should recognise the opportunity that Senator Craughwell&rsquo;s election presents.

I fully subscribe to it but it behoves those of us who care about political reform to sit down and talk to each other and present to the Government our expectations of what should happen now.  Without in any way making presumptions about Senator Craughwell&rsquo;s voting intentions, it is time for us to talk if we are to deliver to the public the important programme of political reform that Senator Quinn and others have done so much to champion in recent years.<\/p><p>I also welcome the re-announcement of the working group to examine the plight of long-term asylum seekers in this country.

Earlier today, the Ministers, Deputies Michael Noonan and Brendan Howlin, presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann the Government's fourth budget and the first since Ireland regained its economic sovereignty following the successful exit from the EU-IMF programme at the end of last year.<\/p><p>This budget is not just another big step towards stabilising the public finances; it also places the economy firmly on the road to sustainable, job-rich growth, which will support business and provide for investing in our future while, at the same time, helping to build a fairer Ireland by supporting our citizens of all ages.  Taking account of all the measures announced today, budget 2015 is expected to add 0.3 percentage points to GDP growth next year, as rising household income feeds through to higher employment and consumption.<\/p> <p>This is something I know Senators will all welcome.<\/p><p>We are seeing the successful result of the great effort made in the past three years to repair the public finances and put them on the path to recovery.  This success is clearly illustrated by the over-achievement of the general Government deficit target for this year and by the achievement for the first time since 2007 of a primary budget surplus for 2014.  The size of this surplus is projected to increase in 2015 and to keep on increasing over the following three years.  Achieving a primary surplus is an important milestone along the road to recovery, because it means that once debt servicing costs are excluded, we are now taking in more tax than we are spending and we can start to reduce the volume of our national debt.<\/p><p>While meeting our commitments to stabilise the public finances is the Government's central priority, budget 2015 is not just about that and will do a lot more than that.  Accordingly, it contains measures to add impetus to the economic recovery that is clearly under way as well as measures to ensure this impetus will spread as widely as possible throughout the economy.  It will also provide practical support for large numbers of those worst affected by the downturn - the unemployed and especially the long-term unemployed - and will help set about enabling them to get jobs, despite the serious constraints imposed on the public finances by our commitments.  This is an ambitious budget, but it is an ambition that is based on favourable current developments and realistic expectations for the year ahead.  I wish, therefore, to outline to the House the economic developments and fiscal arithmetic that underpin the budget, before dealing with the specific provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400014#JJ00300","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413294300,"counter":87,"content":"<p>If I might be allowed to rudely interrupt the Minister of State, could I ask if we will be getting copies of the speech?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400015#KK00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1413294300,"counter":88,"content":"<p>We will arrange for that to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400015#KK00300","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1413294300,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I would be very grateful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400015#KK00400","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1413294300,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Last year saw a welcome return to economic growth.  There were clear indications that this would accelerate in 2014 and that domestic demand was stabilising and about to return to modest growth.  Nevertheless, in the first half of this year the pace of real economic activity surprised on the upside.  Exports performed strongly, even when account is taken of the impact of so-called contract production, partly due to a rebound after the pharma-led weakness of the past two years.  There was also a better than expected recovery in domestic demand, and this concerns people throughout the country.  This trend is projected to continue for the remainder of the year and into 2015.  As a result, real GDP growth of 4.7% is projected by the Department for 2014.<\/p><p>The budget arithmetic is based on a further strong increase in GDP of 3.9% in 2015.  This is based on an expected continuing strong export performance and on strong domestic demand in both investment and personal consumption.  The particularly strong export growth in the first half of 2014 took place against a background of mixed economic developments in Ireland's main trading partners.  Growth in the UK and the US was relatively robust, while the euro area continues to underperform.  The latest indicators point to a momentum of US and UK economies remaining strong in 2015.  As a result of the weakness in its three largest economies, Germany, France and Italy, growth in the euro area looks set to remain subdued, although somewhat better than this year.<\/p><p>For most, proof of economic growth is best seen in proof of employment growth.  Proof of this has been evident for well over a year.  The total number at work has risen for seven consecutive quarters and the latest available quarterly national household survey data indicate a year-on-year increase in employment of 37,000 for the first half of 2014 - real people in real jobs.  Even better, the bulk of jobs growth has been in full-time employment rather than the gains in part-time employment which had characterised earlier recovery trends.  Employment growth has also been broadly based and has taken place in ten of the 14 economic sectors.  The recovery in the labour market reflects the shift in the composition of economic activity to more domestic sources which, by their nature, are typically more labour intensive.  The rate of employment growth for 2014 as a whole is expected to be 1.8% and is to accelerate to 2.4% in 2015.  This represents a net increase during the period of 46,000 jobs. Average unemployment for 2014 is expected to be 11.4% and is expected to fall to 10.2% in 2015.  While still unacceptably high, the latest figures show that unemployment is now below the euro area average, and in the absence of an adverse shock to the economy, unemployment should continue falling over the forecast horizon.<\/p><p>Inflationary pressures remain subdued, both domestically and in the wider euro area.  As measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices, inflation averaged 0.4% in the first nine months of this year and is expected to be 0.5% for 2014 as a whole.<\/p> <p>This moderate rate of growth is mainly due to the fall in the price of goods, in particular non-energy industrial goods and to a lesser extent unprocessed food but price inflation in services continue to rise.  As a result inflationary pressures are expected to pick up slightly next year to an average of 1.1%.  The inflationary impact of the budget is small and is estimated to add only 0.1% to inflation next year.<\/p><p>Over the medium-term, that is out to 2018, GDP is forecast to grow broadly in line with the economy's potential at around 3.5% per cent per annum, characterised by more balanced contributions from net exports and domestic demand.  Employment growth is set to continue with unemployment falling to just over 8% by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>At this point, I should remind the House that the forecasts by the Department of Finance underpinning budget 2015 were endorsed, as is required, by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  The endorsed forecasts were based on the technical assumption of a neutral budget and therefore a detailed reconciliation table and qualitative explanation of how any modifications impact the post-endorsement forecasts are set out in the budget documents, which Members should have.<\/p><p>Let us turn to the budgetary position.  Today's statement confirms that after successfully exiting the EU-IMF programme at the end of last year, Ireland remains on track to meet its obligations under the excessive deficit procedure with the underlying general Government deficit for 2014 forecast to be 3.7% of GDP.  It is worth repeating that this is a considerable over-performance against the target of 5.1% under the excessive deficit procedure and the forecast of 4.8% in April's stability programme update.  For 2015 the forecast is for an underlying deficit of 2.7% of GDP, which as Members will be aware, is lower than the required target.<\/p><p>This target is based on a total package of &euro;1.05 billion of fiscal leeway in 2015, consisting of new measures to reduce tax revenue in net terms by &euro;420 million in 2015 and new measures to increase expenditure in a targeted and necessary way in net terms by &euro;630 million.    In summary for the first time since the crisis began this budget does not require further consolidation through either overall tax increases or expenditure reductions.  This is an important milestone on the road back to full recovery.<\/p><p>Ireland's gross debt-to-GDP ratio peaked last year at just over 123% of GDP.  This ratio is now on a downward path and is expected to fall to under 111% of GDP by the end of this year and to under 100% of GDP by the end of 2018.  It is also important to bear in mind that when account is taken of cash balances and other financial assets, the net debt position is expected to be just below 91% of GDP at the end of 2014.  These ratios are approaching the euro area average.  The markets have played close attention to our progress in dealing with our public finances and economy with the result that Ireland's debt is now regarded as investment grade by all the main credit rating agencies and two of them have now moved Ireland into the A grades.  This time last year the yield on Irish ten year bond rates was just over 3.5%, which was considerably lower than its peak value.  Now it is less than half of what it was a year ago and is lower than the rates for Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal and even lower than the rates for the UK and the USA.  This favourable position was hard earned by all of us, by every Irish citizen and cannot be taken for granted, which means that we must stick to our ongoing commitment to repair the public finances.<\/p><p>Let me outline the specific tax and spending measures contained in budget 2015.  As I indicated, this budget is not just about continuing to stabilise the public finances but also about the goals of achieving sustainable growth, supporting all families and citizens, business and jobs and investing in our future.  These goals are not altogether new because since taking office this Government has done whatever it could do in difficult circumstances to enhance growth where it was taking place and to enable recovery to take place where it stalled while all the time seeking to protect the vulnerable and ensure fairness.<\/p><p>Ireland's competitive corporate tax system plays a central role in our economic development.  The international environment for corporation tax is changing.  Every Member of this House is aware of that and Ireland must, to secure sustainable economic development for the decades ahead, respond to this change.  Accordingly, today's announcement by the Minister for Finance of a roadmap to secure Ireland's place as the destination for the best and most successful companies in the world is timely and strategically important.  The main elements of the roadmap are based on the Minister's three principles when it comes to corporation tax - rate, reputation and regime.  These will improve Ireland's research and development support by fully phasing out the research and development base year from 1 January 2015.  It will make Ireland an even more attractive location for companies to develop intellectual property by enhancing Ireland's existing intangible asset tax provisions and will improve the special assignee relief programme, commonly known as SARP.<\/p> <p>In addition, the three-year corporation tax relief for start-up companies and the accelerated capital allowances scheme for energy-efficient equipment are also being extended for a further three years.<\/p><p>In recognition of the need for Ireland&rsquo;s economy to be innovative if it is to prosper, the Minister for Finance has announced that he intends to put in place a &quot;knowledge development box&quot;, along the lines of the patent and innovation boxes which have existed for many years in countries that compete directly with us for foreign direct investment.  To address criticisms relating to multinational companies being facilitated in aggressive tax planning, legislation will be enacted to ensure that from January of next year, new companies will no longer to avail of the &quot;double Irish&quot; mechanism.  Specifically, our residency rules will be changed to require all companies registered in Ireland to be tax-resident in Ireland as well.  For existing companies, provision will be made for a transition period until the end of 2020.<\/p><p>The increase in the higher tax income threshold and the reduction in the higher tax rates from 41% to 40%, combined with the overall reductions in the universal social charge, give a clear message that the Government supports job creation and work and wants to ease the burden on workers and others in receipt of an income.  The commitment to allow for tax relief of up to &euro;500 per annum on water charges represents an important support to many hard-pressed working families and a recognition of the need to invest in our water infrastructure.  The agri-taxation review measures represent the outcome of a serious and thorough examination of the appropriateness of the tax framework of our largest indigenous sector and a determination to ensure agricultural land will be used as productively as possible for the foreseeable future.  I am sure many Senators will welcome the decision to end the 0.6% pension levy by the end of this year and to end the additional 0.15% levy at the end of 2015.<\/p><p>It is evident that action must be taken now to ensure the private and social housing market meets the needs of our citizens.  No Member of either House is unaware of the huge demand for private and social housing in this country.  Action is being taken under the Construction 2020 strategy to get things moving, and this process will be accelerated by the tax measures in the budget.  The extension of the home renovation incentive to rental properties, the owners of which are liable to income tax, is one such measure.  This will ensure rental properties are kept at a decent standard and will enable landlords to have such work carried out in an efficient manner.<\/p><p>With effect from 1 January next, the 80% windfall tax applying to chargeable gains on the disposal or development of land which are attributable to planning decisions made since October 2009 will be removed and the normal 33% rate of capital gains tax will then apply.  A refund for deposit interest retention tax on savings used to purchase first homes will apply from tonight and will run until the end of 2017 in respect of savings up to a maximum of 20% of the purchase price.  I am sure Senators on all sides of the House will agree that this provides welcome support to many young people who are saving to buy their first home.  In addition, the Ireland strategic investment fund, under the auspices of the National Treasury Management Agency, will explore new ways to support financing projects that will enhance the supply of housing.<\/p><p>The corporation tax reforms outlined in this budget will also support our international financial services sector.  In my role as Minister for State with specific responsibility for this sector, last month the Government assigned me the task of preparing a new national strategy for international financial services.  The international financial services sector makes an important contribution to the economy.  It employs over 33,000 people in Dublin and in towns throughout the country.  My appointment to this task is timely.  The current strategy for this sector was prepared in very difficult times in early 2011.  The IFSC has slipped considerably in the global ratings, from tenth place in 2009 to 70th out of 83 centres in the most recent rankings issued last month.  There is no shortage of ideas to develop this sector, in which many stakeholders are involved.  One of my key tasks is to ensure a co-ordinated approach is agreed to drawing up a strategy that can be presented to the Government for approval and publication in the first quarter of next year.  I am determined that this will be a public sector strategy and will be action-based.  It will have clear deliverables, timelines and responsibilities as part of an effort to ensure our financial services sector is competitive, is fit for purpose, grows and creates more jobs in communities throughout the country.<\/p><p>A total gross increase in expenditure of &euro;639 million, by comparison with the 2014 Estimates, is being provided for in budget 2015.  The increase of &euro;429 million for current expenditure will bring the total to just over &euro;50 billion.  The comparable increase for capital expenditure is &euro;210 million, bringing the total allocation for investment in 2015 to &euro;3.5 billion.<\/p> <p>These increases were made possible because of the improving economic position as well as the fall in the numbers of the unemployed and the efficiencies achieved in the public service.  This money will be used in a targeted way to help support our citizens and families, in particular, in the areas of social housing, social protection, education, health, justice and transport, and to support business and jobs.<\/p><p>As part of the Government's commitment to supporting our citizens and their families, an overall capital investment of more than &euro;2.2 billion is being provided for social housing for the next three years.  This will involve an innovative three-strand approach consisting of more than &euro;1.5 billion to be directly invested from the Exchequer by 2017, using public private partnerships to invest a further &euro;300 million in social housing units by 2017 and an off-balance sheet financial vehicle to provide at least &euro;400 million from 2015 on to the approved housing bodies.  <\/p><p>More than 7,500 new homes will be provided under a range of social housing initiatives in 2015 - these are 7,500 badly needed new homes in communities throughout the country.  Up to 8,000 low-income families will be assisted to secure suitable accommodation under the housing assistance payment.  The housing needs of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in society will be prioritised in several ways, including the provision of some 7,600 housing adaptation grants to assist older people and people with disabilities remain at home and in the community for longer.  In addition, the number of leased housing units will be increased by 8,700.  A new social housing strategy will be published by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, that will outline a range of actions to increase housing supply, including through the maximisation of existing social housing stock and harnessing new funding streams to underpin additional investment in social housing.<\/p><p>The reduction in the number of people out of work has allowed the Government to reprioritise social welfare spending and to introduce several important measures to improve the welfare of families and the less well-off.  The first of these, as announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, is an increase in child benefit of &euro;5 per child per month.  A water subsidy payment of &euro;100 per annum will be given to recipients of the household benefits package and this will be extended to all those in receipt of the fuel allowance who do not already qualify for household benefits payments.  The living alone allowance will be increased to &euro;9 per week which will help nearly 180,000 elderly and vulnerable people.  A back to work family dividend will be introduced to incentivise the move from welfare to work.  This will allow families to retain the full qualified child increase of &euro;29.80 per week for 12 months after returning to work and half of that amount for a further 12 months.<\/p><p>The allocation of &euro;13.1 billion to health will allow the health services to begin to address the long-standing deficits and continue to provide its core services, including the roll-out of universal GP services in respect of children under six years and persons over 70 and, above all, to enable delivery of the Government commitments to improve the health of all of our citizens.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, will announce further details on this later today.<\/p><p>The allocation of &euro;8.3 billion in current expenditure to education will, among other things, enable some 1,700 new full-time posts to be provided within the education sector and class sizes to be maintained.  That means more special needs assistants in our classrooms and more mainstream teachers and more resource teachers.  I welcome Senator Gerard P. Craughwell, who has an interest in education, to the House.  He has come on a very good day.  <\/p><p>The budget includes measures to help the long-term unemployed get back to work.  The number of positions in JobsPlus is to be doubled to 6,000. The JobPath service will provide case management services to all long-term unemployed during the next four years.  Also, &euro;1.6 billion has been allocated to the Pathways to Work strategy which will provide almost 300,000 work and training places.  It will provide help for those who are long-term unemployed in getting access to work, getting access to training and being work ready.<\/p><p>Through its capital allocation of &euro;50 million, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will be able to continue to provide strong support for job creation and enterprise.  The allocation to Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland of more than &euro;260 million will provide a strong impetus to the development of Ireland as an innovative economy.<\/p><p>Although the recovery is most evident in Dublin and in some other large urban centres, many rural areas are still struggling with the aftermath of a deep and difficult recession.  For this reason, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will use more than &euro;1 billion to support initiatives such as the rural development programme and the Food Harvest 2020 plan.  In addition, the increase in the Structural Funds available to Ireland for the period 2014 to 2020 will help to share the benefits of our recovery right across the country and not just in its urban centres.<\/p><p>The Minister for Justice and Equality will outline her plans to increase the number of garda&iacute; and the number of Garda vehicles, an issue of importance in every town and village in Ireland.<\/p><p>The cost savings delivered through the Government's reform programme are being used to fund priority front-line services.<\/p> <p>There will be no further reductions in public service numbers and additional education workers and garda&iacute; will be recruited.  From 2015 onwards numbers will be allowed to increase provided this is done within set payroll limits.  This will increase flexibility and allow public service managers, who are best placed to manage their work force and to target recruitment and employment in the areas it is most needed, take charge.  We have come a long way and suffered a lot to bring us to where we are today, where recovery is well-established, employment is growing and the public finances are improving at a rapid pace.<\/p><p>Budget 2015 does not just involve fixing the public finances but also putting the economy firmly on the road to sustainable employment growth while supporting business, providing for the future through investment and using the leeway that we have in public expenditure to make targeted investment that will help our young people, our businesses and the vulnerable in society.  If we continue with the discipline and commitment that has been demonstrated since this Government came into office, we can all look forward to a bright future of high employment, low unemployment and increasing prosperity.  I look forward to this debate and I commend the budget. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400015#KK00500","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413296700,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

Another 40 cent on a packet of 20 bringing it up to &euro;10 is heavy duty in real terms.  If I was one of those who pay for most things, the \"squeezed middle\" Ireland, I would be very disappointed with this budget.  I could be proved wrong.  Those who are just above the social welfare threshold, who are in the &euro;35,000 to &euro;50,000 income bracket, will not benefit at all when the additional charges are taken into account.  Many of them are families with two people at work.  I am very surprised that there is no child care tax credit.  I welcome the &euro;5 increase in child benefit but this Government reduced it by &euro;10 two years ago and by more from the third and subsequent children.<\/p><p>It is true that the number of teachers and special needs assistants will be increased but there is no reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio.  The increase may only just keep up with the demand created by an increased population.  I recently met with the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, and other teachers&rsquo; organisations and know they will be disappointed that there has been no move to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.<\/p><p>The budget shows our priorities.  The &euro;9 increase in the living alone allowance is welcome but has to be seen in the context of the savage, disproportionate cuts this Government imposed on the elderly, senior citizens and those dependent on State pensions and household benefits.  The household benefits package has been filleted over the past two years.  Anything that goes back into it is welcome. <\/p> <p>Those people should not have been targeted in the first place.  I hope that when the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protect brings in the social welfare and pensions Bill, she will look at reversing probably the worst cut the Government made which was the 30% decrease to the respite care grant.  That just about got through this House two years ago.  They are the types of items for which we should be looking.  There are good things in this budget but I raise the areas about which I have concerns.  I am not in any way saying the whole package should be discarded.  <\/p><p>The people carrying the heaviest debt burden are generally younger families who bought their houses prior to 2009.  If the Government wants to target its approach at them, it should do what we proposed and increase mortgage interest relief.  We proposed increasing it to 40% this year and then increasing it further.  Many of those people are on high variable rate mortgages and high levels of debt and many also have children.  There is no tax credit for anyone whose children are in child care, where both partners work, have large mortgages and face the high cost of child care.  The increase in child benefit of &euro;5 per month will not do much.  It is approximately &euro;25 to &euro;30 per hour to have one's child looked after in a reputable Montessori school or cr&egrave;che.  <\/p><p>I am also surprised - perhaps this will come out in the health budget - that the Government has not seen fit to reduce the prescription charge, which it increased five times and which the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly, promised to abolish.  It has increased from 50 cent to &euro;2.50 per item, which is a substantial cost.  I would have thought that if the Government was targeting people who are sick, elderly and those in need, that is something that could have been done as well as reducing the threshold for the drugs payment scheme from &euro;144 per month, to which this Government increased it, to maybe &euro;120 per month.  <\/p><p>The Government could have targeted the people who have suffered instead of just reducing the top rate of tax.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, said he would offset that by increasing the USC for those earning above &euro;70,000.  That is fine but would it not have been fairer to reinstate the PRSI exemption of &euro;264 per year?  If one looks at the examples given in the budget document the Minister, Deputy Noonan, presented, one will see the reduction in the USC liability for people, which is welcome because it is a reduction.  However, for a couple earning &euro;59,300 per annum, it falls far short of the &euro;264 the Government took from them last year.  If the Minister reinstated the PRSI exemption of &euro;264, people on &euro;20,000 would benefit from that a lot more than people on &euro;200,000.  I suppose it is about choices and fairness.<\/p><p>I was particularly interested in the paltry reference to mental health services in the document presented by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is one paragraph between both documents of approximately 400 pages and it does not give any breakdown.  I have major concerns about this area, although there may be more detail, which I would welcome.  If one looks at the mental health services and at early intervention, which at least is mentioned, there are no early intervention teams in Dublin for children.  I hope there is some recognition that we need an extra &euro;20 million to clear these waiting lists.  I have not seen it yet, although it is early in the day.<\/p><p>On the education side, there is no provision for guidance counselling, which was removed by this Government.  Again, that falls into the whole mental heath area and entails tackling, in particular, the scourge of suicide.  <\/p><p>All Governments have to make a decision on whether a budget is about numbers and the economy or about society.  It should be about the economy but it should also be about the type of society we want to build.<\/p> <p>We have missed an opportunity to alleviate the pressure on those who have borne it most.  I ask the Minister of State to take on board the few points I have made, which will be debated in more detail in the run-up to the finance and social welfare Bills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400019#OO00400","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413297300,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I offer hearty congratulations to Senator Craughwell.  I wish him well in his period in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>Every budget is about choices, and sometimes the choices are difficult.  We were hopeful that the most difficult choices would have been made and that we will never have to revert to those choices and the boom and bust politics of the past because that is the reason so many people throughout the length and breadth of this country experienced personal catastrophes.<\/p><p>The big ticket item in this budget will be whether the 80% of households that will now have to pay for water, excluding the 20% who pay for their own water or pay via a group scheme, will be net beneficiaries of it.  Will they gain or lose money?  I have looked at as many examples as I could and it appears to be the case that the 80% who will have to pay for water in the future will benefit from this budget.  It must be remembered that this is the first budget in the past eight in which this will be the case.  The average household charge for water will be in the region of &euro;250.  Some people say it will be &euro;278, others say it will be &euro;238.  However, it will be in that region which amounts to &euro;5 a week.<\/p><p>I welcome the extension of the household benefits package and also the increase in the free fuel allowance.  Those changes will benefit many additional households.<\/p><p>In conjunction with that, we now have a tax credit for people who are working.  It is not just people in receipt of social welfare payments who will benefit; it is now available to people at work.  In past debates on the budget people will have heard me speak about those in receipt of net payments, those in low-paid jobs who are in receipt of gross payments.  That conversation is not being held in an open and fair way.  Anybody who receives a payment via social welfare is in receipt of a net payment but there are people in low-paid jobs who are in receipt of gross payments and they are less well off than people in receipt of net payments via social protection.  The report by the economist Professor Richard Tol was withdrawn by the ESRI and hidden because that conversation was in the public arena but that conversation was apt, and I welcome what I hope will turn out to be a &euro;100 tax credit.<\/p><p>The GDP figure of 3.9% for 2015 can only be welcomed.  It is higher for this year.  I note that this time last year we were saying that our debt to GDP ratio would peak in 2014 at 121%.  That rate had Ireland up there with the largest nations in the world.  The figures for this year show a reduction of 10% because our GDP has increased.  We have a legal obligation to get that down to 60% within a period of time.  A reduction of 10% in one calendar year is as a result of growth.  Everything revolves around our economy growing in a sustainable and efficient manner.<\/p><p>We will spend &euro;53.6 billion.  We will have a deficit, including our interest payments, of about &euro;5 billion.  Those are the figures being projected.  However, it is essential that we also impact upon the areas in which there have been deficits.  We can see from what happened in that 12-month period that while we live in an economy, we cannot ignore people.<\/p><p>Our health sector has been stretched beyond belief, and I was complicit in the silence about that last year.  I do not believe anybody believed we could do what was required in the health structure based on the figures that were given.<\/p> <p>I am glad to see an increase in the provision for health.<\/p><p>I also am glad to see the numbers regarding what will be spent on education and the area about which I am most aggrieved in education is the primary sector.  It is too late by the time children get into secondary education as they are gone.  Many education professionals are aware that children will not have the benefit of the impact that is needed to try to make a difference.  Many education professionals are able to see that before the children go to primary school, let alone secondary school and as for third level, for too many children that is not a realistic prospect.  The issue I wish to raise is the DEIS status for schools.  While I do not wish to get into the political carnage of removing schools from DEIS, there are schools that absolutely require DEIS status far more than do schools that were allocated such status a decade ago.  This issue should and must be examined as we are abandoning too many children.  In each budget speech I have made here, I have raised the issue of a school in my own locality at Riverchapel.  It has experienced massive growth from eight teachers to 24 teachers and operates with serious disadvantage.  It is very wrong that the school in question does not get DEIS status.  How much time remains to me?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400021#QQ00200","speaker":"1160","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413297600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>One and a half minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400022#RR00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1413297600,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I will be obliged to motor through some of my points.

As for the people who will be removed from the universal social charge net, by my calculations this will affect more than 330,000 people on the very first budget and a further 80,000 people thereafter, which means 410,000 people will be out of the universal social charge net.  When one combines that figure with the 742,000 people who will benefit from the reduction of the 41% tax rate to 40%, plus the increase of &euro;1,000 in the tax band, to put this into context it means that 60% of all taxpayers will have the benefit, which I welcome.

They are angry and are protesting in their thousands and I do not believe this is merely about water charges.  Ireland pursued a policy of massive social disinvestment during the austere period.  During this time, Ireland knocked back the possibility of a good life for everyone, especially those hardest hit from increased taxation and decreased public service provision.  Moreover, it is women across all classes and backgrounds who have been hardest hit to varying degrees and, consequently, people are angry.  Am I alone in feeling a profound disconnect between the self-congratulatory discourse in these Chambers and the anger and disillusionment resounding in the streets?  I will outline my questions.  Has the shape of this budget been rooted in deliberative problem-solving conversations within communities, the results of which were placed in dialogue with Oireachtas Members and Government?  There is no evidence of this.<\/p> <p> Should the budget be about recovery?  Recovery means returning to a normal state.  Where is the creativity and imagination?  Should the people not expect more than normality, especially if that simply means returning to the way things were?<\/p><p>Do the measures announced today by Government equally benefit all in Ireland?  Does investment target society as a whole - social investment versus economic investment?  Is the budget creating better living conditions for everyone in an equivalent fashion?  Are resources being used in an efficient manner that invest in public services, both in the short term and in the long term?<\/p><p>Let us begin by looking at taxation.  The 41% top rate of income tax is being reduced to 40% in the budget, but only one in six adults or one in three workers will benefit from this cut.  Many will only receive a marginal benefit and only the top earners - those who need it least - will receive the largest tax relief from this reduction.  Half of Irish women who earn less than &euro;20,000 a year are not eligible for that cut.<\/p><p>Additionally, the Government is proposing to raise the threshold for the high tax rate.  This change only impacts 607,000 tax cases whose incomes above &euro;33,800 qualify for the full tax relief.  Those with incomes between &euro;32,800 and &euro;33,800 will only gain a fraction of the benefit.  Those beneath the threshold - much of the population - receive no benefit from the change.<\/p><p>With regard to taxation, only the universal social charge gives something back for the low income earners and takes something away from those earning more than &euro;70,000.  I commend the Government on including this in the budget.  However, I ask the Government why has it failed to implement more progressive reforms in this budget.  Progressivity of direct taxation is counterbalanced with the regressivity of indirect taxes such as VAT.  Everyone will benefit from the tax changes, as the Minister, Deputy Noonan, stated, but will they benefit in an equivalent manner?<\/p><p>Income tax is not the only source of Government revenue.  Costly loopholes ought to be closed and gaps filled in the existing tax system.  Social Justice Ireland estimates that the removal of the taxed refund element for unused research and development credits would generate &euro;112 million annually.  Enforcement of the minimum effective corporate tax rate of 6% would bring in an estimated &euro;500 million yearly.  Increasing gambling taxes would provide &euro;100 million annually in revenue.  A financial transaction tax implementation would raise &euro;150 million each year.  These four measures alone would generate an estimated &euro;862 million in revenue.  Why has the Government failed to raise revenue through these reasonable measures?  A lack of robust rationale to taxation persists as a result of the undue power of the business lobbying on Government.<\/p><p>Beyond taxation, what should have been done in this budget to reinvest in society?  How could we as a society spend the estimated &euro;862 million in additional revenue, which I outlined earlier and which I picked out as a couple of additional measures that the Government has not proposed?  The first group hit hard by public disinvestment consists of women and their children.  Women are more vulnerable than men to these public cuts.  Women are employed in public sector jobs more than men.  Women also avail of public services more often than men.  Women are also much more likely to be lone parents than men.  Government cutbacks on social spending affected women much more than men.<\/p><p>There is a massive deficit in social housing, especially for women.  I am happy to see the Government addressing some of the nation's social housing needs in the budget.  The Government does not go far enough, however, to implement policies that benefit women in light of employment opportunities.  While measures to increase available housing provide jobs, less than 6% of women hold construction jobs in Ireland and we need equivalent forms of investment in employment sectors where women will benefit.  What are these sectors?  Women are the primary providers of care in Ireland.  Much of this caring role is unpaid or low-paid work.  I hear families describe their struggle with their costs of child care every day, as I am sure do most Senators.  Government policy must support women in the workforce.  Child care costs approximately &euro;10,000 per year per child.  The cost is debilitating, especially for low and middle income women, and we need to structure support to make child care more affordable for working families.  I have worked closely with education throughout my career, and in Tallaght and neighbouring communities, 55% of women leave education by secondary school.  Child care would not only help with returning to work but also with returning to education.  Moreover, to assist working mothers while improving education, the Government should provide an additional year of early childhood education, costing an estimated &euro;175 million annually.  Of equal importance, increasing education funding would provide women, who comprise 75% of education staff, with increased employment opportunities.<\/p> <p>The money spent to raise child benefit, which benefits those with high and low incomes, should have been used instead to invest in early years and publicly subsidised child care places.<\/p><p>Not only must social spending guarantee a living wage, social welfare should be restructured to support people moving from welfare to employment.  Increasing social payment rates by &euro;5 per week to adjust for rising living costs would cost an estimated &euro;231 million per year.  Many people unemployed due to illness and disabilities struggle to earn a living wage.  They have five times the risk of poverty and have low disposable incomes.  Since 2008, HSE funding has dropped by &euro;159 million, despite rising service demand and &euro;100 million is needed in the budget to address service gaps for people with disabilities.  Continuing education can also provide people with skills for work.  Again, in Tallaght and neighbouring communities over 11% of people are identified as being unskilled or semi-skilled.  Efforts such as increasing funding to adult literacy programmes at a cost of &euro;50 million per year would benefit not only individuals but also society.<\/p><p>The final group I would like to highlight that has significantly suffered under public spending cuts is lone parents.  Lone parents experienced eight cumulative cuts since 2009.  In Tallaght and surrounding areas, 89% of the lone parents are women.  Given that 41% of one-parent families receive the one-parent family benefit, more support is needed.  Reversing changes to the one-parent family payment would annually cost &euro;89 million.  We could invest &euro;50 million annually in preventive health measures in local communities such as increasing primary care teams, or &euro;35 million in mental health service support.  If we add up the few extra changes I have identified, which focus on social investment, it would cost &euro;722 million per year, drastically improving the lives of many.  The cost would be more than offset by the four revenue measures I suggested, which total &euro;862 million annually.  We should use this opportunity to invest in public services, especially in a community context.  Above all, social investment should drive economic investment, not the other way around.  Now, more than ever, women should insist that the gender impact of policies be evaluated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400022#RR02200","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413298800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Could the Acting Chairman tell me when I have two minutes to go so I can ensure I make some of the points I absolutely want to make?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400024#TT00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1413298800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>This is going to be good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400024#TT00300","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1413298800,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Senator O'Brien was talking about the measures that needed to be put in place to protect society.

We were right.  We have proven that it was right not to take more out of the economy than we absolutely had to.  We stand now at a point where the Department of Finance has estimated that the economy will grow by 4.7% this year, 3.6% next year and 3.9% in 2016, while the ESRI has estimated that the economy will grow by 5% this year and 5% next year.  This is a superb performance that is a credit to the Irish people by comparison with what is happening in our European neighbours.  Unemployment has fallen substantially, as the Minister of State said, and it is estimated that we will reach an unemployment level of 10% next year.<\/p> <p>That is not something of which we should be proud but by comparison with the unemployment rate of in excess of 15% we had in recent years, we can say we are on the right road.<\/p><p>Last year, the Government had to introduce &euro;2.5 billion in cutbacks in the budget whereas this year, it will invest &euro;429 million in the economy, which equates to a turnaround of &euro;3.1 billion.

I commend the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Howlin on their speeches earlier in the other House.  Towards the end of his speech, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, said, \"This Government is not going to allocate resources to services that are unreformed\".  We still have much reform to do and perhaps we lost sight of some of it in trying to complete the troika programme.  Child benefit, which goes to everybody with children, including millionaires, was increased.  Medical cards were extended to everybody aged under six and over 70.  I have said in this House that redistribution should take place from the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; to the &ldquo;have nots&rdquo; and that universalism costs the Government very large amounts of money.<\/p><p>The increases in education seem to be divided approximately half and half between teachers directly in schools and support services.  This trend has been worrying for some time.  Let us get resources in the classroom; the support services are fine but we want to reduce class sizes by increasing the number of people who give the classes and lectures.  More resources should be diverted into the classroom rather than support services.  I welcome the ending of the pension levy.  As Senator O&rsquo;Brien said, it was amazing that those of us who have unfunded pensions in the public sector raided the pensions of those who are paying for them to the tune of &euro;2 billion.  I am delighted it has stopped, or is scheduled to stop.  It was an amazing operation and I was surprised there were no challenges to it on the grounds of equality.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Noonan&rsquo;s recognition that it would be pointless for us to try to defend the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, system.  He wants to increase the resources of the Revenue Commissioners in its role as the competent authority.  Although the Revenue Commissioners were part of this, they were in denial until the OECD, the US and other EU countries said these deals were made by the Revenue Commissioners with, for example, Apple in Cork.  I am nervous that the tax advisors and lawyers who drew up these schemes are coming into the offices of the Minister of State and the Minister offering to design the next scheme.  They are like the bankers who did damage in the past.  I would like to see a good distance being kept between the Department of Finance and the tax lawyers and accountants who designed massive tax avoidance schemes.  I would prefer a simple tax system - the 12.5% the Minister espoused in the other House - with no deductions or allowances, and have the tax lawyers and accountants do some more useful work than reducing the amount of revenue available to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>I wish the knowledge development box the Minister is trying to develop every success.  I would have phased out the double Irish sooner than 2020.  Let us move to a new industrial policy that is not based on tax avoidance.  We are to give an additional &euro;6 million per year for three years to the horse and greyhound racing fund.  It has always amazed me that we put such a priority on this industry.  Most of the extra betting will be online.  People bet on the Rose of Tralee and by-elections &ndash; about which the bookies are usually inaccurate &ndash; and people bet on the abolition of this House.  It is nothing to do with subsidising horses and dogs, as we seem to assume.  We have far more important priorities, as nearly every Senator agrees, than that the country should be going to the dogs.  I wonder about continuing the home renovation scheme with &euro;190 million worth of improvements to existing houses when the priority should be new houses.  While it is very nice for a person who has a house to get such a grant, why not give priority to those who are on housing waiting lists?  Irish Water must be a test case in how not to establish a new quango.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400026#VV00500","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1413300000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400026#VV00600","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1413300000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>It has caused political and morale damage.

The economy is growing again, and it means we have righted the sinking economic ship left to us three years ago.  The Government took some very difficult and unpopular decisions in order to do so.  We have had three years of deflationary budgets.  Every year for the past three years, the Government took money out of the economy either by tax increases or cutting services.  That is over.  The budget has two distinct elements, namely, a reduction in the tax people are expected to pay, and greater funding for our public services.  The Government has reduced the marginal tax rate to 40%, increased the entry point, at which people start paying the marginal rate, to &euro;33,800 and, most important, increased the entry level at which USC is paid to &euro;12,000.<\/p> <p>In addition, the first and second rates of USC have been reduced by 0.5% each.  The additional fourth level of USC just introduced by the Minister for Finance will ensure low and middle income earners will be the main beneficiaries of this change.  This is not a once-off measure.  The Government is committed to reducing and spreading the taxation burden over the coming years, but it can only do that by continued prudent management of the economy.<\/p><p>On the public services side of the equation, I am very pleased to see that the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, has received major additional funding this year amounting to &euro;305 million.  The health service is demand led and we have an ageing population.  The health budget has overrun every year for more than ten years.  It is impossible to predict the demands on the health service annually.  The Minister has taken a very pragmatic view of his Department's requirements and has secured this money to ensure continuity of service next year and to commence the rolling out of new services to meet the needs of people.<\/p><p>The Government recognises the value of education and the budget funding for 1,700 teachers, resource teachers and special needs assistants, mostly at primary level, will ensure demand for places is met and the pupil-teacher ratio does not increase.  The plan is to reduce the ratio in future.<\/p><p>Whether young or old, urban or rural, we all like to feel safe in our beds, and in that regard, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, has secured funding of &euro;10 million for the purchase of 400 new Garda vehicles.  She has also secured funding to replace retiring officers and to continue the Garda recruitment drive which recommenced this year.  There will be another 200 Garda recruits by 2015 which means we are increasing Garda numbers for the first time since the downturn.<\/p><p>Those retired or about to retire will be glad to hear that the 0.6% pension levy will cease at the end of this year and the 0.15% levy will cease at the end of next year.  Government policy should be to encourage people to invest in their pensions.  Now that the urgency to collect additional taxation is abating, the Government will move to abolish the levy all together.<\/p><p>I have said before that no Government should be bribing people with their own taxes and we have not done so.  We have made prudent decisions to reduce the burden of taxation while maintaining public services.

I am disappointed, overall, that there has not been a greater targeting of those who are less well off, particularly those who are in receipt of social welfare benefits whose payments have been cut repeatedly in recent years.

There is no doubt this budget is very disappointing from an education perspective.  The much-heralded extra teachers and SNAs are simply going to keep the services at exactly the same level at which they are now, having taken cut after cut in recent years.  They will do nothing to reduce the increasing number of children who are in classes of 35 or more.  There is no measure to improve the pupil-teacher ratio.  The Government is still cutting day-to-day funding for schools next year.  The capitation payment will be reduced by another 1% next year.  We already have a situation where many schools struggle to pay basic utility bills like light and heat and parents are being asked to dip into their pockets to pay for minor repairs.<\/p><p>There will be an increase in the third level student service charge of &euro;250, which will push third level beyond the means of many middle income families.  Those on the very lowest incomes get grants and those on high incomes can afford third level education but the people who have been squeezed out of third level education, both by the service charge increases and by the complete removal of the maintenance grant for postgraduate students, are those on middle incomes.  That is very unfair.<\/p><p>While the Government will do its best to sell the positive elements of this budget, it should be noted that additional cuts will be implemented next year, especially in the education sector.  There has been no effort to reverse cuts such as the removal of guidance counsellor provision for schools, which has left some of our most vulnerable students without counselling services at a time when many young people struggle with serious mental health problems.  We have a very serious problem in this country with suicide, particularly among young males, and nothing is being done in that regard.  Similarly, the cuts to special needs services remain.<\/p><p>There were other alternatives and Fianna F&aacute;il in its pre-budget submission opted to do nothing on income tax.  We know that is not the most populist position in the world but we decided, on a point of principle, that income tax should not be cut, particularly not in the way the Government has cut it for high earners, because there is still so much that needs to be done in terms of restoring our public services, especially health and education.  That is our position and we believe that approach would have been fairer and would have allowed the Government to do a lot more for our education system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400027#WW02000","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1413300600,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing me-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400027#WW02100","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1413300600,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the House that the time allowed for this debate will be extended.

I want to refer to the social protection part of the budget, although it is difficult to speak about in depth when we do not have all the details, as the T&aacute;naiste will announce them later.  I will refer to some of the details I picked up from the budget speeches of the two Ministers.  This is the first budget since 2009 that has been introduced without a cut.  The Senators opposite may say we are self-congratulating in that respect.  We are not, but it is an achievement bearing in mind that this time last year we were facing a &euro;2 billion cut in this budget.  Thankfully, we have turned that around and rather than cutting, we have invested.  I noted from a contribution in the other House that &euro;19.4 billion will be allocated to social welfare in 2015.  That figure rang a bell because when we came into government, the deficit was &euro;19 billion and we now investing that much money in social welfare.<\/p><p>Getting people back to work has been and will continue to be the Government's main priority.  If we get people back to work, fewer social welfare benefits will have to be paid and more revenue will be accrued from income tax.  We will be able to target more money towards services that desperately need it and provide support for those in dire need of them.<\/p><p>The back to work family dividend is a new measure and one of the incentives introduced in this budget.  It will provide &euro;29.80 per child in the first year and 50% of that will be retained in the second year.  It is great to see the introduction of initiatives to encourage people to take up work.  We constantly hear from people and from the Opposition that people are better off unemployed.  We need to address that and put in place initiatives and incentives, such as the new family dividend, for people to return to work.<\/p><p>There will be a doubling of the number of positions on the JobsPlus scheme, which encourages employers to employ those who are long-term employed, with the payment of &euro;10,000 in respect of a person unemployed for over two years and the payment of &euro;7,000 in respect of a person unemployed for over a year.  It is great that employers will be in a position to take on more people.  The sum of &euro;1.6 million will be made available to provide 300,000 work and training places in support of Pathways to Work and &euro;12 million will be provided for the JobPath initiative in 2015.  We cannot create jobs but we can put initiatives in place to help create jobs.  I note from Twitter that the INOU welcomes the jobs activation measures.  It is good that it acknowledges we are working in the right direction.  Even though we managed to maintain the basic rate of social welfare payment, there is no doubt people on social welfare took hits over recent years from this and the previous Government.  There is no point in saying they did not.  We are turning it around and moving in the right direction.  The economy is coming around.  We are beginning to unwind some of the tightening up we had to do and some of the cuts.<\/p><p>There is a small increase in the living alone allowance for the elderly.  I would have preferred if that small increase had been put on the basic rate.  Increasing the living alone allowance will only benefit a person living on their own while a couple will not benefit from it.  There are measures I would have loved to have seen done better.  There is no doubt about that.  This measure will help people in receipt of an invalidity pension who get the living alone allowance.  The reintroduction of 25% of the Christmas bonus is a start and it is to be hoped it will be increased in the years ahead.  The T&aacute;naiste was adamant that this came out of the 2014 Vote.  That money was available as a result of people returning to work.  If we get more people back to work in 2015, one hopes we will again be able to increase the Christmas bonus.  That provision which gives people that little bit of extra money at Christmas is very important, especially for the elderly and recipients of social welfare.<\/p><p>The increase in child benefit, albeit a small one, is a step in the right direction.  I am disappointed there was no mention of child care provision in this budget.  It is a major issue for young couples trying to maintain two jobs, pay a mortgage and having to pay for child care.  I had hoped there would be some reference to it.  I will speak in more detail on it when the social welfare Bill comes through and I apologise for taking all that time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400028#XX00600","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1413301200,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Well spoken already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400028#XX00700","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1413301200,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I wish to share my time with Senator Mac Conghail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400028#XX00900","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1413301200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Ar aghaidh leat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400028#XX01200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1413301200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I would like to raise many points and welcome many measures but time does not permit me to do that.  I note the increase of &euro;26 million in the funding for the Child and Family Agency, which is very welcome, and also the additional funding of &euro;19 million for the Oberstown child detention centre.  The main issue I wish to raise is that when cuts were made to lone parent and child benefit we were lectured in this House that cash transfers were not the answer and that we needed to invest in these services.  We were guaranteed \"a system of safe, affordable and accessible child care in place, similar to that found in Scandinavian countries\".  We have not seen a single cent in this budget allocated to investment in that system.  No additional money is going into it.  We talk about jobs but many providers are now on the brink of collapse.  They cannot provide the service the Government requires at a quality level at the rates they are getting.  There has been much talk about the provision of a second preschool year.  Children with special needs need that second year of early years education.<\/p><p>Other issues I remain concerned about include food poverty, the delivery of mental health services - we continually see a budget for it but the delivery of the services is a concern for me - and investment in community health services.

Artists of significance are waiting for crumbs from this Government to support them, this Government which is eviscerating and demolishing the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 through so-called mergers, yet not a single increase has been set aside for any of the institutions I mentioned.  When the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht speaks about protecting funding, the assumption is that the cuts that have occurred in previous years have been proportionate to other areas in our economy, but they have not been.  Many artists living below the poverty line are experiencing devastation and the Government has not backed up its commitment to support the arts.<\/p> <p>The increase of &euro;4 million is not protecting the arts but is putting a slush fund into a vacuous and woolly idea regarding commemoration about which we know nothing.

As the Minister, Deputy Noonan, stated in his Budget Statement, the economy is recovering and the country is moving in the right direction.  On budget day, it is appropriate to acknowledge the contribution and pivotal role played by the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, in rescuing the country from economic ruin within three and a half years and in getting the country to the position today whereby one can discern an end to the austerity measures with which one has become familiar over the past six budgets.<\/p><p>The budget has been strongly designed to create jobs and to sustain economic recovery.  A ten-point package, including an enhanced research and development credit and a knowledge development box for intellectual development was outlined by the Minister today.  These measures update Ireland's tax offerings to keep us ahead of the curve internationally and will attract foreign investment and jobs.  The package provides certainty for international investors for the next decade and will facilitate long-term investment in Ireland that provides high-quality jobs.  Significantly, the Government has protected the 12.5% corporate tax rate, about which there has been much discussion recently.  In his speech today, the Minister confirmed firmly that the 12.5% corporate tax rate is here to stay.  I greatly welcome the doubling of the number of JobsPlus places from 3,000 to 6,000, as well as the provision of the working family bonus to assist low-income families to move into work by retaining child income supports in the workplace.  Moreover, the increase of &euro;5 in child benefit will help in a small way with child care costs and hopefully will enable many low-income people to return to the workforce in the near future.<\/p><p>In his Budge Statement, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, recognised the largest indigenous industry, namely, the agriculture industry, which employs 170,000 people and has an annual turnover of &euro;26 billion.  A decision to introduce measures that will make additional land available to young and active farmers will reap a rich dividend for the economy in the future and the end to milk quotas in 2015 hopefully will see much more investment in the agriculture sector.  I acknowledge Senator Barrett is not that happy with the further investment in the bloodstock industry but it is a highly significant part of the agricultural sector and this modest investment is welcome.  I welcome in particular the retention of the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector, for which I campaigned strongly, which created more than 24,000 jobs since its introduction in 2011.  I am particularly pleased by the highly positive reaction from that sector this evening to the decision to retain the rate.<\/p><p>While I would have desired more investment in education, the net increase of &euro;60 million is to be welcomed and I also welcome the 1,700 new jobs in the form of teachers, resource teachers and special needs assistants who will be recruited in the near future at a cost of &euro;88 million.  However, I am disappointed that no decision was taken to review class sizes, particularly as they pertain to one, two and three-teacher schools and to rural schools in particular.  This is a subject on which Members will have further discussions with the Minister for Education and Skills.  I welcome the investment of &euro;7 million for the human biology building in NUI Galway, as well as the &euro;10 million for the University of Limerick and &euro;3 million for UCD.<\/p><p>On the taxation side, the tax changes made today are modest but constitute a start in reducing the additional measures imposed on people as a result of the economic downturn.  I welcome in particular the reductions in the universal social charge, USC.  It is a tax that was introduced because of the austerity and I seek a further dismantling of this charge over forthcoming budgets.  The USC will forever be associated with austerity and the economic crisis in which we found ourselves and it is to be hoped that in future, there will be further dismantling of that charge.  Finally, I welcome the &euro;2.2 billion that will be invested in social housing over the next three years.  It will address the major housing crisis we face and will put a lot of people in the construction sector back to work, which is badly needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400029#YY00300","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1413301800,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

I do not accept them but that is another day's argument.  I believe the entire financial system should be pulled to pieces and rebuilt from top to bottom.  There is nothing much about university funding although there has been a steady and consistent drop in the universities' positions in the international rankings and something should be done in this regard.  As the 0.7% overseas development aid target falls into line with the economy, if we can afford 0.7% at any time, we can afford it.  However, provision in this regard has dropped consistently in recent years and should be retained.  What about the Aer Lingus pensioners and the cut of 60%, which is unimaginable?

I have been contacted by a constituent who, after getting a degree from Trinity College subsequently went to Cork and gained a medical degree.  He now is a junior doctor who is crippled by trying to repay loans of &euro;150,000 he took out to cover his seven-year medical course and is contemplating leaving this country.  Something should be done about this.  I wrote to the Ministers and received the usual holding reply but nothing has happened, although this is an area in which something could be done.<\/p><p>I urge the Minister of State to read the excellent budgetary submission made by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The society has prepared a detailed submission some of which is budget-neutral and does not cost anything.  A proposal was made a couple of years ago about front-loading the fuel allowance that was never implemented but which should be considered.  Calls for help to its regional offices have risen by 100% since 2009 and, to put a human face on matters, one woman described the impact of cuts to child benefit by noting that when she had her daughter last year, she was getting &euro;140 per month but now was receiving &euro;130.  She acknowledged that while it did not sound like a lot, that &euro;10 would have bought two packs of nappies, would have fed the family for the day or would have gone a long way towards their milk bill.  Moreover, with &euro;10 she could go to Dunnes Stores and fill up her freezer with frozen vegetables and chicken fillets, not with junk food.  This is also something that must be examined.<\/p><p>In addition, the Government should remove the prescription charge of &euro;2.50.  I listened to a woman of 90 on the wireless this morning who had nine prescriptions per month.  That is a lot of money and is very worrying for a person who is 90 year old.  Moreover, were the Government to ensure that all landlords in receipt of rent supplement provided permission for the installation of electricity and natural gas pay-as-you-go prepayment meters, that would be budget-neutral.<\/p> <p>If we could introduce it and ensure that landlords allow the installation of these pay-as-you-go meters, it would make it easier for people to heat their houses.  On heating, average domestic electricity prices in Ireland are the fourth highest in the EU.  That means Ireland is right up at the top of the league in an area in which people are extremely vulnerable.  Meanwhile, simultaneously, the purchasing power of the fuel allowance has dropped between 20% to 55% depending on the source of the energy.  <\/p><p>Was that a ding?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400029#YY00600","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413302400,"counter":217,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400030#ZZ00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1413302400,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Thank you.

We will have plenty of opportunity in the next couple of days and weeks to flesh out the meaning of this budget.  With that in mind, I want to speak in general terms about what we are trying to achieve here.<br\/>We have had seven budgets in six years which could be described as austerity budgets.  This is the first one that falls outside that description.  It attempts to do four things, namely, create jobs, help hard-pressed families, invest in public services and pay down some of Ireland's debt.  These four items will be generally achieved with this budget.  It is a decent budget in that it is a modest budget.  Even if we call it modest, it still is significant.  A year or so ago, we were talking about making a correction to take another &euro;1.4 billion out of the economy in order to reach the agreed targets of 3% by 2015.  However, due to the resilience, hard work and fortitude of the Irish people, we find ourselves in a position where we do not require to do that.  The remarkable economic growth last year and, particularly, this year has allowed us to put an additional &euro;1.6 billion or thereabouts into the economy.  That is a significant turnaround in our fortunes.  It is a turnaround of &euro;3 billion which this time last year would have been considered inconceivable.  <br\/>I remember having a series of meetings over the last three years, since 2011, with various Ministers about budgets and about the state of the economy in general.  At that time, even the gloomiest of gloomy predictions were not sufficiently gloomy.  In 2011 when we came into government, the country's future was on a knife edge and could have gone<b><\/b>either way.  There was even talk in 2011 that the schools might not be in a position to open in September.  That is not hyperbole or exaggeration or retrospective thinking.  These are the sorts of things that were current in conversational topics in political circles at that time.  <br\/>This budget is a small step.  We still have a very long way to go.  However, the change in circumstances now allows the Government to be in a place it thought a couple of years ago it could never be.  In the three years it has been in this Government, the Labour Party has supported reductions and cuts in services that any Government, in particular a Labour Party Government, would think inconceivable in normal circumstances.  We could not even countenance these things.  It is not that we are taking credit for these things.  These things affected the Irish people and it is due - I have to say it again - to the hard work and resilience of the Irish people that we now find ourselves in this position.  <br\/>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated in a speech about two years ago that if we got our policies right, the Irish economy could become a little bit like a loaded spring ready to take off.  I think that is the analogy he used.  At the time, people looked at him and wondered what he was talking about.  However, we have seen growth in the region of 4.3% this year.  We will see growth of 3.9%, 3.4% and 3.9% in the following years.  These are our projections.  This is a cumulative value of 16% or 17% growth in our economy.  These figures are tremendous if they materialise.  On the back of those figures, the Government - and even more so the next Government - will be able to take advantage of the difficult decisions it has made and the hard work of the Irish people over the last number of years.  These things need to be remembered.  We see that the levels of dangerous debt and our debt to GDP ratio have fallen.  That will allow investment in public services, jobs and in our people.  It is just a start.  It is a very small step.  It is a good step forward and we hope we can see the progress next year and in future years.  <br\/>Senators O'Brien and van Turnhout made reference to mental health services.  It is my No. 1 priority area in politics and I note a &euro;35 million investment in this area has been announced.  I have previously said that I do not believe the problems in mental health services are solely related to the availability of resources.  Senator van Turnhout referred to service delivery.  Service delivery is key.  Senators O'Brien and Power mentioned guidance counsellors in schools.  I would have been very happy if I could have seen some reversal on the measures previously taken in that area.  Perhaps in the coming days, we might see some reversal when the details of the budget are fleshed out.  <br\/>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and giving his typically insightful contribution.  He is one of the better performing Ministers when he comes here.  We appreciate that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400030#ZZ00400","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1413302400,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  On the budget and budgetary considerations, the main question is whether there is a coherent strategy to address the growth of inequality that we witnessed over the last number of decades. It is not just over the last number of austerity budgets that we have witnessed this.  Earlier this afternoon, the Minister of State said the rate of job creation is one of the fastest in Europe.  We heard a lot about the wave of new jobs that are being created and an increase in the number of those in employment since the employment crisis hit originally.  Despite a minor increase in the numbers employed in some counties, we do know from the quarterly national household survey that the labour force has declined in some of those counties.  Limited jobs growth, by and large, has been restricted to Dublin and other urban centres.  This is deepening a well-entrenched two-tier economy.<\/p><p>There is a growth in high-skill, high-paid jobs but loss of mid-pay jobs in manufacturing.  Service sector jobs are growing but new sectors of employment are characterised by low pay and low job security.  Young people are in low-paid and precarious employment.  According to a number of surveys, they are leaving Ireland because they cannot get their footing in a career.  I want to stress the word &quot;career&quot;.  They do not see prospects for themselves here and that is why they are flocking to other countries.<\/p><p>It is important to note, in the context of the increase in the employment figures, that low pay is becoming a serious problem.  One in five workers earns below the living age of &euro;11.45 per hour.  To contextualise the living wage, it is 14% of a current Minister's salary.  According to recent Social Justice Ireland data, 16% of adults who have an income below the poverty line are actually employed.  We know from the recent OECD employment outlook 2014, that Ireland has the second highest percentage of low paying jobs among OECD countries.  The prevalence of low pay will undermine future recovery.  It will lead to unstable growth and increase costs for the State in transfer payments.  Given this inequality, I ask the Minister of State to outline what the Government is doing to counteract this.<\/p><p>The Minister of State also said recovery would not be felt until everyone had a job or more money in their pockets.  Those were some of the measures he mentioned.  There are also 28,000 fewer young people in employment since this Government took office.  A Red C poll commissioned by the National Youth Council of Ireland released recently found that four in ten young people are struggling to make ends meet as a result of welfare cuts.  The justification put forward for those cuts originally was that they would incentivise young people to take up education, training or work opportunities.  That argument is undermined by the fact that various social welfare payments and training allowances to young people under 25 years of age have been cut in recent budgets.  As someone from the generation which has since adulthood known nothing but austerity, I am extremely disappointed that the weekly rate of &euro;188 for all young people on education, training and work experience programmes is not being restored. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400030#ZZ00500","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1413302400,"counter":221,"content":"<p>What is it in Northern Ireland?

I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Harris and welcome him to the House.  I have listened carefully to the speeches here and in the other House.  Any fair-minded observer - there are many fair-minded observers on the Opposition benches - would acknowledge that there are very positive aspects to this budget and that overall, it is a positive development.  It is modest in scope and I do not think anyone is being triumphalist or is crowing in any way, as that would not be appropriate.<\/p><p>We are looking at a budget that has been brought to us in the context of positive figures on economic growth and unemployment, which has been falling for 27 months in a row now.  These are objective measures of positive developments in our economy.  Also objectively, as others have acknowledged, the changes to the tax system announced today are progressive.  They are aimed squarely at improving the economic position of low- to middle-income earners.  The reduction in the top rate of tax is more than offset by the increase in the USC rate for higher earners.  We are seeing an additional 80,000 low-paid workers come out of the USC on top of the 330,000 brought out of it in the first budget of this Government.  We need to be fair when assessing the tax changes here.  Their impact will undoubtedly benefit those who are in low- to middle-income brackets, and not the higher income earners.  That is a very important point.<\/p><p>In the speech by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, he very importantly noted that increases in spending would also be targeted on jobs, health, education, social protection, justice and housing.  Like many others, I would have liked to see a further increase in the arts budget - although again it must be acknowledged that there is a &euro;4 million increase in the current expenditure for the arts Vote.  I would have liked to see the ECCE scheme for early childhood education extended by another year . However, I accept that the changes that have been made are positive, although there are more positive changes that could have been made.  Let us not forget the words of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, that he is doing this in the context of trying to build a solid and steady economic recovery.  He does not want to return to boom and bust policies of the past.  I believe that is the appropriate balance to strike.  <\/p><p>It is very welcome to see increases in child benefit payments.  That will benefit people; I am one of those paying high child care costs and I know how high they are, specifically in Dublin.  Child benefit increases are a drop in the ocean but they are welcome nonetheless.  The return of the Christmas bonus is also hugely welcome for the very many people who will benefit from it, and indeed the small businesses that will benefit from the spend.  This is very much supporting expenditure in the community as well.  I also welcome the increased expenditure in justice, the investment in Garda vehicles and in Garda recruitment; the expenditure in education, with 1,700 new full-time posts which has already been referred to by many others; and the end to the public sector recruitment moratorium.  This is very positive news as we will see recruitment in these areas for the first time in many years. <\/p><p>I have listened to many speeches by Opposition Members that made reference to auction politics and others that made reference to continued austerity.  This budget cannot be both.  The more accurate depiction of the budget from an objective perspective is that  it strikes a balance in that it is neither an engagement in auction politics nor a continued austerity budget.  It is not an austerity budget, as the Minister, Deputy Howlin, made clear.  It marks the end of an era of austerity.  Nor is it a return to the auction politics that characterised Fianna F&aacute;il budgets in the past, the budgets of the McCreevy years which led us into the economic ruin which this Government faced when taking over in 2011.<\/p><p>I believe this is a modest budget, but one built on the idea of solid and steady economic growth and of moving us back to a sustainable prosperity of the sort which we all deserve after so many years of austerity.  I commend the budget to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400031#AAA01300","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1413303000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I thank the Leader for extending the time as it is appropriate that we should have the opportunity to talk about the budget.<\/p><p>I will start on a positive note.  Even though it is belated and should have happened last year, I welcome the reversal of what was a terrible decision to raid people's pension pots.  Pensions are a huge issue, given our demographics, and it was totally the wrong thing to do.  Private people have lost &euro;2.2 billion from their funds and many of them are workers who are depending on their pensions when they retire.  I understand the 0.15% rate is being continued, although there has been a commitment to remove it.  That should have been done this year.  I hope the commitment will be honoured.<\/p><p>There was one aspect of pensions that was not dealt with but could have been and probably would not have cost a whole lot.  There is an imputed 5% distribution from pensions.  I accept that, during the economic growth of the 1990s and first decade of this century, very considerable amounts of money were put into pension funds.  We heard of pensions pots of &euro;40 million or &euro;50 million.  I have no difficulty with those.  However, many people have small pension pots, maybe &euro;500,000 or &euro;1 million or &euro;1.5 million.  I do not think that they should be forced to pay tax on 5% of that.  With healthcare and people living longer that should be discontinued up to the threshold, which is &euro;2 million at the moment.<\/p><p>I am disappointed to see the trend that the Government has taken on the USC.  There is a disconnect between the public and the established political system and it is there for a very good reason.  It is because people make promises and do not honour them.  In this instance, there was a clear signal given when the USC was being introduced,  albeit a by different Minister and a different Government, that it was  in fact a temporary measure to meet the fiscal crisis that would be reduced as soon as public finances improved.  Instead of that, the Government has increased it.  That is totally the wrong direction to take.  The threshold in terms of the imposition of the 8% rate has been reduced to &euro;70,000.  That is wrong.<\/p><p>Another matter which I suggest could make an impact would be capital gains tax.  It has increased from 20% to 33%.  The former Deputy, Mr. Charlie McCreevy has been mentioned and criticised but he did a lot of very good things, and one of them was reducing capital gains tax from 40% to 20%.  This doubled the revenue that came from it.  We need investment and we need to release assets for that investment. <\/p><p>There is more than &euro;300 million unaccounted for in the health service budget.  People are wondering where that is going to come from.  There is a perception that charges are going to be heaped on the private health insurance sector again.  It is a disgrace that people who have paid their health insurance all their lives, as I have along with many others, and who have also paid their social insurance now find that they are being deprived the benefit of the social insurance, which was entitlement to the use of a public bed.  It is being charged back to the health insurers who in turn charge it to the people taking out private health insurance.  As a consequence, there is a haemorrhaging of people from private health insurance.<\/p><p>There is no cohesive policy on housing.  Although I acknowledge the small step the Government has taken on this it is inadequate.  It is not going to solve the extent of the homelessness problem and it will not do anything to encourage people into home ownership.  We have a proud record in this country which removed the cost of people purchasing their own houses from the State.<\/p> <p>There is a range of issues, including the Central Bank matter recently.  I would like a full discussion on housing, including both of those issues.<\/p><p>I am a little perplexed.  There is a pension provision of &euro;1,037 million in the Department of Education and Skills, whereas it is &euro;638 million for the Department of Health.  It seems an anomaly that the Department of Health, which has a lower budget and a somewhat lower pay budget, would have such a significant pension provision.<\/p><p>It is the first year in six that there has been some relief in the fiscal position and there has been some flexibility for the Government, but while some are clapping themselves on the back-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400031#AAA01400","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413303600,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Nobody is clapping themselves on the back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400032#BBB00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1413303600,"counter":237,"content":"<p>-----the borrowings will increase from &euro;203 billion this year to &euro;210 billion at the end of next year.

Principals and deputy principals are at breaking point without middle managers to support them and that is of concern.<\/p><p>I am delighted to see training places, but I wonder if people are aware that those returning to second-chance education in further education are paying a &euro;200 charge to enter the system.  They also are paying voluntary contributions.  For example, it costs &euro;1,000 to take the course I taught.  Where does one get that sort of money?  There are also the costs of course materials, travel, subsistence, etc.  In case someone is not aware of it, a cup of coffee costs &euro;1.50.<\/p><p>I do not thank any Minister for where we are today.  I thank the people of Ireland who have sat quietly and taken all that has been thrown at them.  If the Government is succeeding in building this economy, it is on the backs of hungry children going to school every day.<\/p><p>It would be wrong of me not to mention the Defence Forces.  As a former member of the Defence Forces, I was extremely proud to see the turnout at the funeral of the late former Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds.  They looked so well, but only two days later we discovered that uniforms were borrowed in order that soldiers could look right on parade that day.  I checked this out.  I visited a barracks not so long ago and I met soldiers who have to borrow parts of uniforms.  In this day and age, it is outrageous that soldiers would have to borrow uniforms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400032#BBB00900","speaker":"1196"},{"type":"speech","time":1413303600,"counter":244,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400032#BBB01000","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1413303600,"counter":245,"content":"<p>It is outrageous that there are young soldiers sleeping in their cars.

We are still borrowing &euro;5 billion to run the country.  While we are on an upward trajectory, we have a long way to go yet.<\/p><p>The Minister for Finance spent &euro;585 million in measures today.  Were those measures the best ways to spend that money?  That is ultimately the question we must ask.  There are lots of small sweeteners being dished out but, when one thinks of the child care problem and the cost of child care, what will an extra &euro;5 benefit do in a month other than buy a few extra ice-creams?  It is not addressing the fundamental child care issue that Senator Zappone did a good job explaining.<\/p><p>I take this opportunity to share with the Minister of State a disappointment I have had.  I published a budget reform Bill this year, the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2014.  I was not allowed to debate that here and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, would not give the time.  I see it as a lack of confidence on behalf of the Government not to listen to those ideas.  They were simply this.  First, every year, on a statutory basis, a balance sheet on where the country stands would be published mid-year.  It would outline the country's assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.  It would take account of what is owed in pensions and in toll roads that are not making enough income, and where money is being set aside for the ageing population.  When we had those facts mid-year, we could have a real debate.  This mystery up until the last minute is a joke.<\/p><p>The second measure my Bill provided for was that we would know the ceilings that each Minister was allowed.  For example, the Department of Education and Skills has &euro;8 billion, but when one takes out pensions and salaries, we cannot see what is being achieved with the &euro;2 billion that is left over.  There are no targets or performance outcomes.  How do we change society?  This morning, on the Order of Business I spoke about the lack of career guidance counsellors and I hoped there would be a provision for that area, but there was not.  We are losing &euro;15 million in State fees in first year alone due to dropout at third level and one of the contributory factors is poor course choice - a poor matching of the student with what he or she wants.  Career guidance counselling also contributes significantly to addressing the mental health fallout among these young people.<\/p><p>I will leave it at that.  I am grateful to Senator Craughwell for sharing his time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400032#BBB01200","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1413303600,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I wish to share time equally with Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.

The reality is that one can never look at a budget without looking at the bigger economic context and also all the budgets that have gone before.  As the Minister will accept, after seven years of austerity many working families are in an unsustainable position where they simply cannot afford to pay any more and they are looking for a break.  These are the families who were caught with the universal social charge, increases in PRSI, the household tax which became the property tax, cuts to child benefit, increases in college fees and cuts to supports for students going to college, cuts to medical cards and, of course, cuts in health, etc.<\/p><p>Whatever small adjustments were made in this budget for those families will be wiped out by water charges.  The Minister of State will have seen 100,000 people on the streets of Dublin.  That was an outpouring from those who simply have had enough.  I have challenged the Leader of the House to answer a simple question on a number of occasions but, to date, he has not been able to answer it.  Some 180,000 families are in mortgage distress.  They cannot afford to pay their mortgages.  There are many more families who cannot afford to pay basic utility bills.  There are many families who have no disposable income and there are more who cannot put food on the table.  There are many homes across the State where the heating tanks are empty with no oil.  The Government will place water charges on their lap.  What bills should they not pay?  Should they allow their mortgage to go into deeper debt to pay the water charge or should they not provide food for their children to pay the water tax?  The reality is that the Minister has political choices and what he could have done in this budget was abolish the property tax, abolish water charges and put in place higher taxes on higher earners.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State sniggers because he simply does not accept-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400032#BBB01500","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413304200,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I do not snigger.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400033#CCC00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1413304200,"counter":252,"content":"<p>-----or understand the reality of what it is like for many families.

Nothing has been done to sort out the difficulties many farmers face because of farm assist.  There is nothing to replace REPS, which has gone by the wayside.  There is also an anomaly in the water charges whereby somebody on a group scheme will not be able to obtain the tax breaks.  There is no reverse to the pupil teacher ratio changes in rural schools, and we do not see anything in the budget which will reverse emigration from rural areas.  Many statistics show that people in the west and north west are on lower incomes.<\/p><p>The big anomaly in the budget is that it has put an awful lot more money back into the pockets of people with incomes of more than &euro;75,000.  The figures at the back of the budget book show anybody earning up to &euro;25,000 a year will receive between &euro;170 and &euro;250 whereas somebody earning more than &euro;75,000 will receive &euro;777.  This is not balanced, as has been put forward by some Senators.  The money should have been balanced in the other direction and should have been put back into the pockets of people who need it most.<\/p><p>We have not seen any move towards a Scandinavian model of child care, which we were promised.  We have not seen any move on rent supplement, which needed to be done.  Although the housing initiatives are welcome, they will only reach the tip of the iceberg and would only just about solve the issue of the 4,000 people on the housing list in Galway city this coming year.  To say it will make any huge difference in the national picture is incorrect.  We are disappointed.<\/p><p>I am also disappointed with the cut of 30% in the equality and integration budget.  Will the Minister of State explain this?  Why will the equality and integration budget be cut?  It has been slashed year on year by the Government but it is an area in which we need to put more funding for projects such as those with regard to women and race.

There is one element of the budget, which I pointed out to Senator Barrett earlier, which I find deeply disturbing.  I am referring to the universal social charge, which we all have on all of our earnings.  If one earns between &euro;12,000 and &euro;17,500 one pays 3.5% in universal social charge.  If one earns between &euro;17,500 and &euro;70,000 one pays 7%.  I find it deeply disturbing that anybody earning &euro;20,000, &euro;21,000, &euro;25,000, &euro;30,000, &euro;31,000, &euro;40,000 or &euro;41,000 pays 7% and if one earns &euro;70,000 one also pays 7%.

I am sure we will be back again, and the discussions on the social welfare Bill and the finance Bill will give us plenty of opportunities to tease out some of the issues raised by Senator O'Donnell and many others.  I will endeavour to get through as many as I can.<\/p><p>I thank Senators for their contributions which I have found useful and positive.  I also found the constructive criticism to be useful.  Senator Bacik and others made the point the budget is modest.  It must be modest in its ability to spend additionally and we had to try to target this.  There will always be political debate on all sides of the House on whether the Government got it right or wrong, but it is important to note that no Member of this or the other House or the public expected the Government to be in any position this year to increase in spending or alleviate the tax burden.<\/p><p>We find ourselves in a political and budgetary environment in which, if we were all being honest, nobody in the House expected us to find ourselves.  In this sense the Government has made an honest effort to begin the process of investing in a targeted manner in the public services we require, which all Senators know are important enough to call for increased investment in them.  We must also look at how to begin to reduce the tax burden in a manner which incentivises and rewards work and increases the differential between working and not working, while providing support to those not in a position to work to enable them access work or, should they not be able to, to provide them the standard of living they should be able to expect.<\/p><p>It is now very clear to everybody the economy is in recovery.  The budget targets the limited resources available to the best effect to accelerate this recovery, spread throughout the economy and country and provide support to those individuals and families who need it.  I am the first to acknowledge we still have a good way to go, but from now on the journey will not be marked by austerity but rather by a debate on how we increase living standards and get more people back to work.  This is a debate of which we all want to be part.  We all got involved in politics to be involved in this debate.  We are now at the point that we can look to have this debate again and ask where do we want the economy to go and how we want to use economic growth to create the society in which we wish to live.<\/p><p>We are very conscious not to return to the errors of the past which wrecked the economy, destroyed jobs and mired the lives of millions of people.  We have heard from Senators on all sides about some of the impact of this destruction on the lives of people today.  We now know how to restore the public finances and bring the economy back to full health.  The Government will not deviate from the path and we will continue to realise these goals.<\/p><p>I want to get through many points but I may not be able to do so.  I will start with Senator O'Brien, who made a very constructive and generous contribution, perhaps more constructive and generous than the contribution made by his party's spokesperson in the other House.  Senator O'Brien began by acknowledging the positives in the budget.  He welcomed the DIRT exemption for first-time buyers and will think about giving up cigarettes.  He also raised important policy issues which we can tease out, such as child care.  He welcomed the living alone allowance, which is a modest but important payment and an important signal of the intent of the Government.  He spoke about a number of health issues.  These will be fleshed out by my colleague, the Minister for Health, in the coming weeks and during debates in the House.<\/p><p>Senator Michael D'Arcy spoke about the need for a more realistic health budget.  It is important that we have a budget which can realistically be expected to deliver on the desires of the Irish people and on the commitments in the programme for Government, such as free GP care and extending BreastCheck to women up to the age of 69.  Senator D'Arcy made a point on the status of DEIS schools and he should take this up with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills.<\/p><p>The 80,000 people taken out of the universal social charge today and the in excess of 300,000 people who were already outside it, means that in the lifetime of the Government 410,000 people who were paying universal social charge when we came to office no longer pay it.  A further 700,000 people will directly benefit from a rate reduction from 41% to 40%.  The changes we made to the universal social charge at the higher rate with regard to 8% for those earning more than &euro;70,000 is a signal the Government wants to target the relief at the squeezed middle, which is the colloquial term we now use, by ensuring people earning more than &euro;70,000 do not benefit disproportionately.  This is quite important.<\/p> <p>People will benefit.  There are many people earning &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 who are paying the higher rate of tax from &euro;32,800.  After today they will not pay it until &euro;33,800 and they will also experience a rate reduction from 41% to 40%.  That is not all we want to do.  The statement of Government priorities from the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste during the summer is very clear on this and this is just a first step.  I take Senator O'Donnell's point about the bands.  We will have the Finance Bill and I will raise her concerns with the Minister for Finance and suggest that we can have that discussion on the Finance Bill.<\/p><p>I want to be very clear to Senator Zappone that I am not engaging in self-congratulation.  That would be entirely inappropriate - far too many people are unemployed and far too many are in mortgage arrears.  It is important to note, however, and I do genuinely feel this point, that when something goes wrong in the country, no matter who is in government, Government gets the blame, and when something goes right in the country, there is a tendency to say &quot;Ah, sure, it would have happened anyway&quot;.  I do not believe that.<\/p><p>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, has made the point that the economy did not recover by an act of God.  I think it recovered for three reasons, so far.  As Senator Craughwell has quite eloquently acknowledged, massive credit must go to the Irish people, if one looks at the industrial unrest in other countries, compared with how the Irish people engaged with the Haddington Road or Croke Park agreements and got on with the job, delivering vital public services in tough times.  Second, the work that we have done internationally on restructuring our debt is not finished yet, but we have improved the cashflow of the country over the next decade by &euro;40 billion.  Whatever one thinks of the promissory note deal, before it was in place the Minister for Finance would have had to sit down and find in excess of &euro;3 billion to give to Anglo Irish Bank.<\/p><p>The third reason is policy.  Policies like the 9% VAT rate have been welcomed today.  There are also policies like the home renovation incentive scheme and the abolition of the air travel tax.  All of this together has got us to this point.  I would argue that the tax changes are progressive, for the reasons that I have outlined.  When one talks about actual numbers - amounts in people's pockets as opposed to percentages - that is a debate we can continue to have, but we did target these changes at removing as many people as we could from the USC.  The process will continue, reducing the higher rate of tax, but targeting it at people on middle incomes.  That is quite important.<\/p><p>The issue of mental health was raised by many Senators.  My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has secured &euro;35 million for this area.  However, I take the point made by Senators van Turnhout and Gilroy, among others, that it is about the delivery of that service.  Deputy Lynch feels passionate about this issue and I am sure it will be debated in this House.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform's speech did refer today to the issue of more front-line staff, more psychologists, access to counsellors, and that is something we must flesh out.<\/p><p>Senator Hayden set the budget in context, where we have come from and the point we have reached.  She talked about how we have invested &euro;3.1 billion more in the economy through this budget than we thought we ever had.  She commented on the &quot;double Irish&quot; issue.  It is important to me in my role in relation to the financial services sector that we continue to ensure our economy is competitive to attract more investment.  The important factors are rates, regime and reputation.  By getting first move, or advantage, on the &quot;double Irish&quot;, rather than having the OECD base erosion and profit sharing, BEPS, process drag countries there, Ireland is showing its intent to work with that process and to take a leadership role.  I expect other countries with similar practices, be it the &quot;Dutch sandwich&quot; or whatever else, will follow.  <\/p><p>The issue of homelessness and social housing, on which Senator Hayden is far more an expert than I am, came up on all sides of the House.  We have today seen a major investment.  Some Senators wanted to know why we were not doing more or why we were looking at various vehicles.  There is a limit to the amount one can do on the Government balance sheet, but the innovative solutions proposed today looking at public private partnerships and a financial vehicle to deliver through affordable housing bodies, constitute a step in the right direction.  It is not fair to categorise it as a small step.  Some &euro;2.2 billion of an investment is a pretty major step.<\/p><p>The pension levy-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400033#CCC00900","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413304800,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Over three years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400034#DDD00200","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1413304800,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Absolutely over three years.

Senator Barrett referenced the need to reform and to continue to reform.  He is right that reform is not, and cannot be, something that is only done in years of crisis.  This Government, and the Oireachtas as a whole, must be evaluated on how it continues to reform in years of calm.  That is why I think, to the credit of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the publication of a new comprehensive spending review is important.  Spending must be reviewed in times of crisis.  When one is fighting an economic fire one must review it, but reviewing it in years when it might be easier not to do so is important.  Documentation from all Departments will be published on the website at the end of the week.  The point that Senator Healy Eames made regarding greater scrutiny of performance outputs is valid.  I hope that documentation will enable Oireachtas committees to continue to play a greater role, and I will discuss it with my colleagues at Cabinet level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400034#DDD00300","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1413304800,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400034#DDD00400","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1413304800,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Reference was made to issue of excise.  I welcome the fact that there has not been an increase in excise duties.  Many Senators and many Members of the other House raised the need to support one's local.  We have talked about economic development outside of Dublin, the role of the pub, particularly the rural pub.  In many communities it is more than just a pub, it is a tourism facility or a source of employment.  Such pubs have obviously seen significant excise rises over the years of difficulty, so it is important that there is not one today.<\/p><p>There is a reference to the additional 400 Garda cars and ongoing Garda recruitment announced today.  We are not just announcing that we are hiring an additional number of garda&iacute;, we are announcing that it is a process we believe we can continue and never return to a situation where there would be no more recruitment or a freeze on recruitment of garda&iacute;.<\/p><p>Many people raised issues about disability and the delivery of health services.  The ending of the blanket moratorium is an important moment for this country.  Senator Craughwell referenced management in schools.  We must put the power back in the hands of people at the front line at a management level.  They are paid to manage and are well able to manage.  We must  present them with an employment budget and tell them to manage it as they see fit.  In my own county, services like speech and language therapy and occupational therapy are at crisis point.  We must see investment in them, and that involves resources on the ground.  The ending of the blanket moratorium will give people that ability.<\/p><p>I found some of the criticism of the budget fair, while some was quite political, and I have tried to avoid this tendency.  However, most of the criticism I heard was &quot;You didn't do this&quot; or &quot;You didn't do that&quot; or &quot;You didn't go as far as we would have liked&quot;.  Much of that is fair.  There is probably not a Member on the Government side of this House who would not have liked to see more investment in education, or more investment in health, or further tax reductions on hard-pressed families.  Today's budget sends out a message to Irish people that the economic crisis is over.  We are not getting complacent - there is much more to do - but we are finished firefighting and we can now talk about how we can work together to grow the economy by 3% into the future and deliver the services we all want.  I commend the budget and I look forward to continued debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400034#DDD00500","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1413304800,"counter":264,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400034#DDD00600","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1413304800,"counter":265,"content":"<p>Tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400034#DDD00700","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Adjournment Matters","time":1413304800,"counter":266,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400034#DDD00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Charges Exemptions","time":1413304800,"counter":267,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400034#DDD00825"},{"type":"speech","time":1413304800,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I welcome Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, Deputy Tom Hayes, to the House.

I have been contacted by her son, who reports that his mother has been billed for &euro;125 for water and wastewater services for the year in her family home.  She does not live there and nor does anybody else, so the house is vacant.<\/p><p>After speaking with this lady's family member, I immediately contacted Irish Water for the details of the rules and regulations for a vacant house.  Irish Water informed me that the owner of a vacant domestic property is liable for a minimum annual charge, irrespective of consumption or occupancy circumstances.  This minimum charge amounts to &euro;62.50 per annum per service provided, so that is where it came up with the figure of &euro;125.  My point is that if the lady were living at home, she had the household package, which she lost when she went into the nursing home.  She would then, in effect, probably be liable for about &euro;75 when all the allowances are taken into consideration.  By living out of the house and not using any water, she is being charged &euro;50 more.  Before entering the nursing home to live full time due to her illness, she would have received the household package, which would have entitled her to pay less.<\/p><p>I find the whole issue very strange.<\/p> <p>Nobody is living in the house and, therefore, a minimal volume of water is used.  However, she is being charged for more than that.  I am sure many others are in a similar position to this lady or they have family members who are in this position.  In total, 80% of her pension is going to the nursing home while 22.5% of the value of her house is going to the State.  Therefore, she is left with 20% of her pension.  Those who reside in nursing homes are being seriously penalised.  I have raised this in order that something can be done and specific cases examined.  It is one thing if somebody has a second home and uses it some of the time as a holiday home but this house is vacant and the only time water is used, as reported by the lady's son to me, is when the heat comes for an hour a day to keep the house damp free.<\/p><p>Another query I received relates to the use of PPS numbers and how long they will be kept on file by Irish Water.  Could the Minister of State give a response to that?  Irish Water is a semi-State body.  Is there is a data protection issue if PPS numbers are retained indefinitely?  I would be grateful if the Minister of State and Irish Water outlined the IT precautions being taken to ensure data protection is not breached.  It is highly unusual for semi-State utility companies to retain PPS numbers indefinitely.  We need clear assurances from Irish Water that people's personal details are safe and protected as well as an explanation for the need to retain these details indefinitely.<\/p><p>I welcome the water services support payment of &euro;100 annually, which will be paid quarterly to individuals in receipt of the household benefits package, but a person who no longer resides in the family home for health reasons and, therefore, does not use water or wastewater services and who must pay 80% of her pension to the nursing home for her care and 22.5% of the value of her house to the State under the fair deal scheme, should only be liable for a minimal charge, which could be attributed to leakages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400034#DDD01100","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413305400,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  I apologise on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, who is unavailable to respond to this issue, which will lead to further discussions.<br\/>The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water is responsible for public water services and can collect charges from customers in receipt of water services provided by it.  The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, which has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers of Irish Water.<br\/>The proposed approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan, which was submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act.  The commission recently held a public consultation on this plan which covered a range of issues relating to water charges and allowances.  On 30 September 2014, the commission issued a determination on the water charges plan.<br\/>In making its determination on the water charges plan, the commission had to take account of the decisions made by the Government on the funding model for Irish Water and a ministerial direction made under section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 in July 2014.  This policy direction addressed a number of matters relating to domestic water charges, including the provision of a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water supplied and wastewater treated per annum for a primary residence on a public supply and a free allowance to cover the normal usage of water services by every child in their primary residence, while customers with specific medical conditions that require increased water consumption will have their charges capped.<br\/>In its determination on the water charges plan, the CER has approved charges to be levied by Irish Water.  These charges outline how much a customer will pay for the water service his or her household receives, how unmetered customers will be billed by way of an assessed charge, the rates to be charged for households with a meter installed, and a minimum water charge which will apply to non-primary residences.  The owner of the premises will be required to pay a minimum charge for water supply and for wastewater per service for a domestic property that is not permanently occupied.<br\/>The commission also decided, in its determination, to make a number of changes to the water charges plan submitted by Irish Water.  These included the capping of the total water charges for all customers at the unmetered &quot;assessed charge&quot; for nine months.  The cap will apply from the start date of the next billing period after installation of the meter or 1 October 2014, whichever is the later.  With regard to the annual minimum charge for a combined water supply and wastewater service at a non-primary residence, the CER have reduced these charges from &euro;160 to &euro;125 per annum or &euro;62.50 per service per annum.  In addition, the Government has agreed to put in place further affordability measures to assist pensioners, persons with disabilities, and carers who receive the household benefits package.  The conditions and administrative approach to this additional measure are being developed by the Department of Social Protection.  Further measures were also announced earlier as part of budget 2015.<br\/>The establishment of the CER as the independent economic regulator for Irish Water is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to ensure the interests of customers are well represented.  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water is required to prepare codes of practice on a range of matters related to the protection of the customer, including standards relating to the performance by Irish Water of its functions; the provision of information to customers of Irish Water for the purposes of enabling customers to communicate with Irish Water; and billing by Irish Water of persons in respect of water services provided.  These codes of practice are now published and available on Irish Water's website <i>www.water.ie<\/i>.<br\/>The Senator raised the case of a person who does not use water at her residence because she resides in a nursing home.  I will convey this to the Minister and I will ask him to communicate with Irish Water because the Senator has made a strong case.  However, as somebody who has had a meter on his home for the past 20 years, there are few instances of houses in which water is not used.  Somebody will have access to the house.  If no drop of water is used from one end of the year to the other, Irish Water should examine such cases but they are few and far between.  I was a member of a local authority in County Tipperary.  Water charges were in place for many years and people paid them.  I rarely came across a case where no water passed through the meter.  However, I will bring the Senator's contribution to the attention of the Minister.<br\/>With regard to the PPS numbers, my understanding is Irish Water needs them to apply the allowances.  If it does not have the numbers, it cannot process the allowances.  There is a great deal of fear and the communications relating to Irish Water raises many questions.  However, as somebody who uses a meter, we have to conserve water.  The greatest fear people have relates to the volume of water they use.  If one conserves water and the pipes that serve one's home are not leaking, the water bill will be low.  Much of the fear relates to leaks and using large volumes of water.  There are few leaks in urban Ireland, in particular.  One will recognise a leak quickly where water is gathering on the lawn or is coming through the floors in the house.  In rural Ireland, leaks could happen under a ditch on a farm or under a road and it is often difficult to detect them.<br\/>The Senator referred to a particular individual and there is a good case to be made.  I will convey that to the Minister and ask him to address it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101400035#EEE00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1413306000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

If this woman was at home with her allowances she would be charged less than she is being charged now, which is ridiculous.
