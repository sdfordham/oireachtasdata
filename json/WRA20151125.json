The basis for these inspections is governed by EU legislation and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must be conducted each year.

These inspections are a necessary requirement in order to draw down approximately &euro;1.7 billion of EU funds annually and to avoid EU disallowances.

In abiding with the findings of these audits my Department ensures that these inspections are conducted in a fair and equitable manner and in full accordance with the legislative provisions.

The US is one of our leading trading partners, and we have a large and growing agri-food trade surplus with them (exports of &euro;570m last year, compared to imports of &euro;268m).  <\/p>  <p>  We have significant offensive interests in these negotiations.  We see worthwhile opportunities in the US for cheese, powdered milks and sports products, and further opportunities for branded packaged butter, if we can reduce tariffs and remove some regulatory barriers.  Prepared consumer foods and fish could also benefit from trade liberalisation.<\/p>  <p>  Beef is a unique sector in that we have both offensive and defensive interests.  In the long term, any significant increase in beef imports to the EU could have adverse effects on the Irish industry.  That was confirmed by a number of recent studies, and is an issue we have raised strongly with the European Commission.  Therefore we have legitimate concerns about the size, composition and administration of any quota offered to the US. <\/p>  <p>  Of course, we should also seek a significant EU quota for beef to the US as part of any TTIP agreement.  Following the re-opening of the market, Irish beef exports now fall under a 65,000 tonne quota for &lsquo;other countries&rsquo; on a first come, first served basis.  This is mainly filled by Latin American countries.  When we get access for manufacturing beef we would stand to benefit greatly from a specific EU import quota in the US, and this can only be achieved through TTIP. <\/p>  <p>  A number of key issues in these negotiations arise in relation to hormone treated beef, food standards, GMOs and Geographical indicators.  In this regard, it will be important to ensure that the principle of equivalence continues to apply so that even where food production processes in the EU and US are not identical they will provide equivalent guarantees regarding the standards of production.  This principle is recognised by both sides in the negotiations as the basis for an agreement.  Equally it is important that both the EU and United States retain the policy space to restrict certain practices and processes on social and ethical grounds and this is also recognised, in principle, by both sides.<\/p>  <p>  This is particularly relevant in relation to the use of hormones in meat production.  The EU Commission has made it clear that it will not allow the importation of hormone treated meat into the EU and this is well understood by the US side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500075#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agricultural Waste","counter":43,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500075#WRC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":44,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[41243\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500075#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the communications his Department had with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources regarding bio-digesters; if the need to increase the tariffs on electricity generated by bio-digesters was considered; if this would have advantages for the agricultural sector, as a result of the increase in the dairy herd; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1053","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":45,"content":"<p>My Department recognises the need to encourage the utilisation of agricultural waste as an alternative source of energy.

Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, all operational issues of this nature concerning sea fisheries control are, as a matter of law, exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service.  As Minister, I am precluded from getting involved in operational matters including in relation to law enforcement.  In relation to the overall framework for fisheries control in the EU, in October 2009 a new regulation dealing with fisheries controls was adopted.  Council Regulation 1224\/2009 establishes a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy.  Control and inspection is now focused where it is most effective through an approach based on systematic risk analysis.  Inspection procedures are standardised and harmonised for all stages in the market chain, including transport and marketing.  The Control Regulations were introduced so that there is a common EU level playing field and to provide for an effective range of controls across EU waters.<\/p><p>One of the key elements of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy is the introduction of a phased ban on the discarding of unwanted fish catches.  The first part of the landing obligation, the ban on discarding pelagic stocks such as herring and mackerel, came into effect on the 1<sup>st<\/sup>of January 2015.  The EU Commission adopted a Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1393\/2014 on 20 October 2014 which implements a discard plan for certain pelagic fisheries in north-western waters in line with the recommendation of the North West Waters Member States Group. <b><\/b>A Control Experts Group from the North West Waters Regional Group of Member States has been set up and has produced a draft set of recommendations on additional control measures for the pelagic sector in respect of the landing obligation in pelagic fisheries.

A meeting of this Group is planned for the 25<sup>th<\/sup>November and the control report will be considered.  The measures recommended by the Control experts cover a range of actions including the use of cameras or other remote sensing equipment on all large pelagic vessels, both freezer vessels and our own RSW (Refrigerated Seawater Tank vessels) to support the landing obligation.  It also recommends control observers &ldquo;for individual trips to address dynamically &ndash; assessed risks of a more transient nature.&rdquo;  It is important to note that the flag Member State would be responsible for placing control observers on its vessels.  I consider that any strengthened control measures must provide tools to both the flag Member State and the coastal Member State to better monitor and control fishing activities.  We will continue to work closely with the North Western Waters Member States to identify the control actions that are most useful so that the landing obligation is fully respected. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500076#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Harbours and Piers Development","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500076#WRD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[41315\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500076#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will commit to establishing a dredging programme for Howth fishery harbour in County Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1206","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":79,"content":"<p>Howth Fishery Harbour Centre is one of the six designated Fishery Harbour Centres which are owned, managed and maintained by my Department under Statute.

Under this programme for forestry, significant measures were included aimed specifically at encouraging farmers to plant native trees.

The first of these schemes provides financial assistance which covers 100% of the costs of establishing new native forests. An annual premium payment of &euro;635 per hectare is also available each year for 15 years; this rate is the highest rate available of all afforestation planting categories. In order to ensure a higher level of planting of native trees on farms all afforestation must include native woodlands alongside aquatic buffer zones in water sensitive sites such as aquatic Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and sensitive fisheries areas when establishing new forests. This will provide a filtration buffer zone slowing down runoff from upland areas and helping to prevent sediment reaching rivers and streams.    <\/p>  <p>  Promotion of native woodlands on farms is also included in the Native Woodland Conservation Scheme which aims to support the appropriate restoration of existing native woodlands and (where appropriate) the conversion of existing non-native forest to native woodland. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to these two native woodland schemes the Department also supports the improvement and management of native woodland seed stands including sessile oak and pedunculate oak seed stands within ancient woodlands.

Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators.

Live exports serve a dual purpose as a means of satisfying market demand for live animals and providing alternative market outlets for cattle farmers in Ireland.  Total live exports for 2014 were 237,000 head, of which over 72,000 went to the UK - a 10% increase over 2013. Specifically, over 54,000 head were exported to Northern Ireland, which is comparable with the 2013 figure. So far in 2015, approximately 8,500 head of cattle have been exported to Britain, 50% down on 2014. This is a function of better prices being received domestically for beef producers and an almost 10% increase in the live trade to Northern Ireland, up by over 4,000 head in the year to date. This trade has been assisted by the relative strength of sterling in recent times.   <\/p>  <p>  Dairy farmers expanding their production may have also played a part in decreased live cattle exports to Britain. With the abolition of milk quota it can be assumed that some farmers have elected to hold on to calves and weanlings which would be normally destined for foreign markets.<\/p>  <p>  A strong system of transport links is in place to facilitate these exports and extra roll-on roll-off ferry capacity for livestock exports has been added since the beginning of this year. Three dedicated vessels and three roll-on roll-off ships are currently approved for export of live animals. The process to approve two more dedicated vessels is also well underway.<\/p>  <p>  Bord Bia, in its ongoing interactions with British customers, will continue to pursue all possible opportunities to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner in addition to actively supporting the development of the live export trade through the provision of market information, developing market access and promotional activity.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500077#WRE00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500077#WRE01000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":102,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500077#WRE00950"},{"type":"question","counter":103,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[41867\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500077#WRE01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a decision has been made on an application for a carer's allowance by a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":104,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA) from the person concerned on 19 August 2015 in respect of two care recipients. <\/p>  <p>  The application was referred to a local social welfare inspector (SWI) to assess the level of care being provided, assess means and confirm that all the conditions for receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance are satisfied.

The Department of Social Protection, through Intreo, identifies and refers eligible and suitable clients to the Momentum programme. The current phase of Momentum is coming to a conclusion and a decision has yet to be taken on whether or not it will operate again next year. Should it be decided to repeat the programme, the Department will together with the Department of Education and Skills and SOLAS consider if, and if so how, eligibility might be extended to people with disabilities who may be receiving payments other than jobseekers&rsquo; payments.    The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed. The main plank of the guarantee is through early engagement with young recipients of jobseekers payments to provide them with assistance in finding and securing sustainable jobs. Engagement with this process is mandatory for young jobseekers&rsquo; recipients. For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training. Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. <\/p>  <p>  As those young people with disabilities who approach Intreo offices for employment-related support receive immediate engagement, the main innovation provided by the Youth Guarantee is already in place for this group, as is access to the full range of supports and programmes available for young people more generally. The difference in the treatment of young persons in receipt of disability\/illness support payments is that engagement with the Intreo service is on a voluntary basis, unlike job-seekers where participation in activation measures through the Intreo service is mandatory.  <\/p>  <p>  There is also a range of additional supports that are specific to people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  These supports include the wage subsidy scheme (WSS), the EmployAbility (supported employment) service, the reasonable accommodation fund for the employment of people with disabilities and the disability awareness training scheme. For those who are in receipt of invalidity pension or illness benefit (for at least six months) and who feel they now have some capacity for work, the partial capacity benefit (PCB) scheme allows them to work and retain a portion of their social welfare payment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500077#WRE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Data","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500077#WRE01550"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[41889\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500077#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons of working age in receipt of disability allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1188","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":113,"content":"<p>Disability allowance (DA) is payable to eligible people between the ages of 16 and under 66.

Credits protect an employee&rsquo;s social insurance entitlements by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI, such as during periods of unemployment, illness etc.   <\/p>  <p>  To qualify for credits a worker must have paid at least one PRSI contribution while working and have had an attachment to the workforce in the last 2 tax years, as evidenced by having paid or credited PRSI contributions in that period.  If these conditions are met, credits are awarded in specific circumstances.  These circumstances include proven unemployment or certified illnesses, receipt of specific social welfare payments, participation on certain training or employment schemes and entitlement to certain statutory leave, such as Parental Leave.  Credits on their own, do not give an employee entitlement to social insurance benefits.

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and maintain revenue to reduce the budget deficit. It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced, and is applied at a low rate on a wide base.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The USC, like the Income Levy before it, does not apply to social welfare payments, such as the contributory and non-contributory State pensions,\u00a0or payments of a similar nature.\u00a0 However occupational pensions, including occupational pensions of retired civil servants,\u00a0are liable to the USC if the payment is greater than the exemption threshold, which for 2015 is &euro;12,012.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As you are aware, delivering on a commitment in the Programme for Government, the USC was reviewed by my Department in the lead up to Budget 2012. The report is available at www.finance.gov.ie. The issue of  USC applying to occupational pensions of retired public servants who entered the public service before April 1995 was examined as part of that review.\u00a0 Such individuals are (or were) liable to modified rate PRSI, which does not generate an entitlement to the State Pension.<\/p>  <p>  The Government decided not to exempt the occupational pensions of these individuals from the USC charge as it would be very costly and difficult to achieve, and it would involve all income earners with the equivalent income benefiting from the exemption.\u00a0 In addition, it would also undermine the principle of the USC being applied to income with few exceptions. <\/p>  <p>  However, as a result of the review of the USC, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum. Budget 2015 provided for an increase in the\u00a0exemption threshold\u00a0to\u00a0&euro;12,012 and I announced in my recent Budget speech that this threshold will increase to &euro;13,000 per annum from 1 January 2016. It is estimated that over 700,000 income earners will not be liable to USC at all from next year.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This exemption threshold equalises the position for single individuals whose sole source of income is the State Contributory Pension with Public Service pensioners whose pension is at an equivalent level. Furthermore, I intend to continue to reform the tax system in future budgets, subject to having the required fiscal space. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  For the reasons outlined, I do not consider the application of the USC on Public Service pensions to be discriminatory. I would point out\u00a0that the changes to the income tax system included in Budget 2015 mean that individuals who paid Income Tax and\/or USC in 2014, including pensioners, are seeing a reduction in their tax bill this year where incomes are equal. Budget 2016 is now continuing this process of reducing the tax burden on low and middle income earners including, among other changes, a decrease in the three lowest rates of USC announced to take effect from January 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500081#WRJ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions Services","counter":194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500081#WRJ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":195,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[41957\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500081#WRJ01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to enable credit unions to offer point-of-sale cards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":196,"content":"<p>My role as Minister for Finance is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.    <\/p>  <p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank\u00a0is the independent regulator for credit unions.\u00a0 Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members. <\/p>  <p>  The Credit Union Act \u00a01997 (\"1997 Act\") and related statutory instruments (provide for services exempt from additional services regulations) set out the services that a credit union may provide to its members.

In general, this covers income taxable under Schedule E from non-pensionable employment and trading and professional income (Schedule D, Cases 1 and 2). Income from investments such as rental income from property, cannot be used to effect such a plan as it is not a source of \"relevant earnings\". This reflects the fact that pension income replaces an individual's earned income once they retire. In contrast, individuals with investment income do not lose that income source at the point at which they reach what could be considered \"normal retirement age\". The income will continue as before and they have the investment asset, for example, a property or properties, which may be converted to a capital sum with which they can purchase an annuity if they so wish. <\/p>  <p>  Having excluded investment income from \"relevant earnings\" for the purposes of private or supplementary pension provision and the tax reliefs on contributions that go with it, it would appear contradictory, to say the least, from a policy perspective to then allow tax relief at a later date on rental income from a property designated a \"pension property\" by the property owner which appears to be what is envisaged in the details supplied with the question.<\/p>  <p>  Where an individual owns a property and rents it out, the rental income is receivable directly by the landlord and accordingly is taxable in the year that it is receivable. There are a number of allowances and deductions available to reduce the tax on rental income paid. These include, for example: a deduction of 75% of the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair rented premises; the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant; and the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property.<\/p>  <p>  However, for the reasons outlined, I have no plans to introduce further changes or additional tax incentives as requested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500081#WRJ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Compliance","counter":203,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500081#WRJ01550"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[42015\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500081#WRJ01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps the Revenue Commissioners are taking to monitor car park washing companies to ensure full compliance with taxation legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":205,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that a key feature of our tax system is self-assessment.

There is extensive detail on this initiative on NAMA's website,\u00a0.\u00a0 Under this initiative, NAMA identified the properties to the Housing Agency under a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) which in turn has engaged with local authorities to ascertain demand and with local authorities and approved bodies to determine the allocation of properties for which demand was confirmed.\u00a0 NAMA has no role in determining which properties or the number of properties that are required for social housing or in decisions relating to the location or allocation of properties by the Housing Agency.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Of the 6,500 properties made available by NAMA, demand has been confirmed by local authorities for just over 2,500 and more than 1,600 of these have already been delivered.\u00a0 The 4,000 residential properties not taken up for social housing have been either sold or rented in the private housing market by NAMA debtors and receivers and in that way have contributed to increased market supply. \u00a0In determining demand, local authorities based their decisions on criteria such as location and wider planning and housing policy considerations.\u00a0 There were also cases where the related properties were sold or rented by their owners or appointed receivers in the time taken by local authorities to assess and confirm demand.<\/p><p>Where demand is confirmed for a property, NAMA makes whatever funding is needed, more than &euro;50m to date, to ensure that \u00a0previously unfinished properties are completed and comply fully with all building standards.\u00a0 In addition to facilitating the sale or lease of properties through its debtors and receivers, NAMA has established a social housing SPV, NARPS, which directly leases properties to approved housing bodies.\u00a0 NAMA has developed standardised long-term leasing arrangements and attractive lease terms to facilitate this process. <\/p><p>I am advised that there has been extensive engagement between NAMA and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and all the other stakeholders, including the Housing Agency, local authorities and approved housing bodies, on this initiative and all of the parties have worked extremely hard to ensure that properties for which demand has been confirmed are delivered as quickly as possible, notwithstanding the substantial construction and wider compliance work that is required in many cases.\u00a0 <\/p><p>As the NAMA Chair\u00a0recently pointed out to the Public Accounts Committee, following this initiative,\u00a0there are now\u00a0very few unoccupied houses across NAMA's entire portfolio.<\/p><p>The issue of social housing is, as the Deputy is aware, directly impacted by the level of housing output generally in the economy.\u00a0 NAMA is, in this respect, making a very substantial contribution to increased housing supply.\u00a0 It funded close to 50% of new housing output in Dublin last year despite having an exposure to less than one-third of all Dublin residential development land.\u00a0 The NAMA Board has also indicated that it could fund up to 20,000 additional new homes on a commercial basis in the five years to end-2020, approximately 90% of which could be in Dublin and the greater Dublin area where demand is greatest.\u00a0 NAMA-funded residential developments are subject to the same planning and social housing provisions, including Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), as all other residential development projects in the State.  Therefore,\u00a0NAMA's major contribution over the coming years will be in funding vitally needed new residential supply and will contribute to future delivery\u00a0of social housing through Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) as part of this funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500082#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500082#WRK00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions Levy","counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500082#WRK00750"},{"type":"question","counter":217,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[41919\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500082#WRK00800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"to consider measures to ensure parity in the pension restorations of public servants who retired on reduced pensions, as per those who retired on full pensions.","asker":"1065","askee":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":218,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[41920\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500082#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will engage with the Alliance of Retired Public Servants regarding the potential discontinuation of parity.","asker":"1065","askee":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":219,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[41921\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500082#WRK01000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he has considered reducing the timeframe for the restoration of public service pensions, considering the projected growth in the economy.","asker":"1065","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":220,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 to 83, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>I and my officials have\u00a0met with representatives of the Alliance of Retired Public Servants (ARPS)\u00a0on\u00a0a regular basis. \u00a0My proposals to Government\u00a0earlier this year in respect of the amelioration of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR)\u00a0burden on pensioners, and which now form part of the Financial\u00a0Emergency Measures in the Public Interest\u00a0(FEMPI) Bill 2015,\u00a0were welcomed at that time by\u00a0representatives of the Alliance.\u00a0 These proposals deliver on my commitment to\u00a0<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">ease the burden of the PSPR as early as economic and fiscal circumstances allowed me to do so, with a focus on\u00a0 benefitting\u00a0impacted lower-income pensions\u00a0proportionately more. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  The proposed ameliorative measures for public service pensions in\u00a0the 2015 Bill will<\/font>deliver\u00a0the part-restoration of the PSPR cuts in three stages effective from 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.

Longford employing c560 people. In Co. Westmeath, FDI has performed well and there 16 companies employing c2,300 people. 3 of those companies are based in Mullingar, employing c150 people. <\/p>  <p>   IDA Ireland&rsquo;s plans for the Midlands Region, which includes the towns listed about,  are incorporated into the Action Plan for Jobs: Midland Region which I launched on the 29th June. This plan sets out over 120 actions aimed to deliver enhanced employment growth in the region over the coming years with a target of increasing employment in the region by approximately 14,000 by 2020. <\/p>  <p>  In June 2015, IDA Ireland appointed a dedicated Regional Manager to the Midlands Region and IDA Ireland will be targeting at least 25 additional FDI projects in the Midlands Region over the next 5 years.  Supporting the increase in investment in this and all regions across the country will be a &euro;150m property investment plan spread out over five years.  The funding will be used to upgrade Ireland's business and technology parks, make investments in a number of strategic utility-intensive sites and build new advanced technology buildings in a number of regional locations. An advanced office building is planned for 2017 for Co. Westmeath as part of the programme. This is in addition to an advanced technology building, which was completed in 2014 in Athlone and is available for FDI investment.<\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland has put a digital marketing campaign in place to market the Midlands Region for potential investors and this is used overseas by IDA executives, to showcase potential locations within the Midlands Region including Mullingar and Longford.  Currently, IDA Ireland positions the Midlands Region as having a strong cluster in medical technology and life sciences. The Midlands is home to key clients such as Abbott, Covidien, Integra, GeneMedix, Freund, Utah, KCI, and AMS. Examples of where the cluster effect benefits investment decisions include the announcement in 2014 by Jazz Pharmaceuticals and American Medical Systems, both located in Athlone, who are already seeking planning permission to expand after only two years.  As well as the FDI sector, this cluster is supported by over 600 people employed in medical technology related industries from the indigenous sector, in areas such as manufacturing to delivery of elements of the supply chain.<\/p>  <p>  Given the global economic operating environment in recent years, the existing client base has performed consistently and retained its presence.  IDA Ireland actively engages with its existing client base to support them in growing their business to retain jobs and expand their existing footprint in the region.  In this respect, Patterson Pumps, located in Mullingar, announced a 30-person expansion at the opening of its new manufacturing facility in September 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The Succeed in Ireland initiative is supported by IDA Ireland, which partners with ConnectIreland to support any potential investors identified to locate in Ireland and Arc Consulting in Longford is an example of this in practice.  IDA Ireland also has regular engagement with the Chief Executives of the local authorities of Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly to ensure that there is a continuous line of communication open and a mutually supportive approach taken, considering the role that Local Authorities now have for economic development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500083#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Low Pay Commission Remit","counter":243,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500083#WRL01700"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[41948\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500083#WRL01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the status of his recent decision to ask the Low Pay Commission to review the impact of the minimum wage on young persons and women; the terms of reference for this review; when he expects to receive its findings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1190","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":245,"content":"<p>The principal function of the Low Pay Commission is, once each year, to examine the national minimum hourly rate of pay and to make a recommendation to the Minister respecting the rate.

I would expect that the second tranche of GLAS, which closes on 7 December, will contain a further significant number of commonage applications. <\/p>  <p>  Turning to the question of Commonage Management Plans, there is no requirement for any such plans to be submitted until next year. My Department has already laid out the detail of what is to be included in these plans and is currently finalising the provision of functionality on the online GLAS system which will allow Commonage Management Plans to be submitted in electronic format. I would not expect to see the first plans submitted until early 2016, with most coming in later that year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500084#WRM01700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Scheme Data","counter":276,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500085#WRN00100"},{"type":"question","counter":277,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[41912\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500085#WRN00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of farmers who applied for the basic payment scheme and for the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, by county and in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":278,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the tables below.<\/p><p><b>GLAS Applications<\/b><table><tr><th>County <\/th><th>Submitted <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>CARLOW <\/td><td>299 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CAVAN <\/td><td>961 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CLARE <\/td><td>1684 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CORK <\/td><td>2347 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DONEGAL <\/td><td>2043 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DUBLIN <\/td><td>66 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GALWAY <\/td><td>3250 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KERRY <\/td><td>1853 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILDARE <\/td><td>305 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILKENNY <\/td><td>473 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LAOIS <\/td><td>393 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LEITRIM <\/td><td>1067 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LIMERICK <\/td><td>1130 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LONGFORD <\/td><td>536 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LOUTH <\/td><td>160 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MAYO <\/td><td>2681 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MEATH <\/td><td>481 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN <\/td><td>611 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>OFFALY <\/td><td>505 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON <\/td><td>1585 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SLIGO <\/td><td>978 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY <\/td><td>1233 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WATERFORD <\/td><td>393 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH <\/td><td>680 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WEXFORD <\/td><td>859 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WICKLOW <\/td><td>362 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>26935 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b>Basic Payment Scheme Applications<\/b><table><tr><th>County <\/th><th>Eligible BPS applications <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>CARLOW <\/td><td>1567 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CAVAN <\/td><td>4590 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CLARE <\/td><td>5876 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CORK <\/td><td>12457 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DONEGAL <\/td><td>8165 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DUBLIN <\/td><td>603 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GALWAY <\/td><td>11611 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KERRY <\/td><td>7488 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILDARE <\/td><td>2008 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILKENNY <\/td><td>3240 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LAOIS <\/td><td>2781 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LEITRIM <\/td><td>3311 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LIMERICK <\/td><td>4826 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LONGFORD <\/td><td>2292 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LOUTH <\/td><td>1467 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MAYO <\/td><td>11177 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MEATH <\/td><td>3621 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN <\/td><td>3900 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>OFFALY <\/td><td>2951 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON <\/td><td>5501 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SLIGO <\/td><td>3873 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY <\/td><td>6614 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WATERFORD <\/td><td>2304 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH <\/td><td>2873 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WEXFORD <\/td><td>3836 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WICKLOW <\/td><td>2031 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total <\/td><td>120963 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500085#WRN00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme","counter":279,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500085#WRN00400"},{"type":"question","counter":280,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[41913\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500085#WRN00500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when outstanding payments will be made under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme 1; the number of farmers who have submitted documentation for payment and the number who have not yet received payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":281,"content":"<p>Applications for payment under the TAMS 1 schemes are being processed on an ongoing basis and my Department currently has some 2,500 claims on hand.

The fourth annual report <i>&ldquo;Milestones for Success 2014&rdquo;<\/i>, published September 2014, showed that the sector had achieved very significant progress on these targets and illustrated the manner in which the Food Harvest 2020 vision of &lsquo;smart, green, growth&rsquo; is being attained. The Milestones report showed that, compared to the Food Harvest baseline: primary output had increased by 32% in 2014; agri-food exports had increased by 27% in 2014; and value added had increased by 29% in 2012 (latest data available). <\/p><p>Food Wise 2025, the new ten year strategy for the agri-food sector published in July this year, builds on the successful vision of Food Harvest 2020.

This imperative informed my approach to the negotiations in 2012 and 2013, and it continues to inform the process by which the various elements of CAP reform are now being delivered.<\/p>  <p>  Taking the direct payments system as an example, the Deputy may recall that I proposed an alternative approach to the redistribution of direct payments than that originally advocated by the European Commission, precisely because I wanted to ensure that the direct payments system could be made fairer and more equitable while at the same time ensuring that the level of transfer of payments between farmers was not of a scale that might jeopardise our objectives for the development of the sector. We now have a system which satisfies these two requirements. The advance payments that commenced last month - which will be followed by balancing payments from next week - represented the start of a process that, by 2019, will see a considerable shift in the balance of payments from those previously receiving very high rates per hectare to those previously receiving much lower rates of payment. I believe that this not only makes the direct payments system fairer, but also ensures that it continues to provide support and income stability that will allow farmers to respond to the demands of the market. As such, it also provides a vital tool to help us achieve the objectives outlined in the Food Wise 2025 strategy.<\/p>  <p>  I have also taken significant steps to encourage the participation of young farmers in agriculture, which is vital in terms of securing the critical role that farm families play in the development of the sector. In addition to providing for a top-up of direct payments, I have ensured that young farmers are prioritised in the allocation of payment entitlements from the national reserve. These direct payments measures are further complemented by supports under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme where, for example, enhanced support for capital investment by young farmers has been made available under the TAMS schemes. <\/p>  <p>  More generally under Pillar 2 of the CAP, I am focussed on the socio-economic development of our farms and of our rural areas so that all farm families have an opportunity to realise their potential. Schemes for improving sustainability (such as GLAS and the Beef Data and Genomics Programme) and competitiveness (such as TAMS) are complemented by continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now known as Areas of Natural Constraint).

My Department engages on an ongoing basis with many third countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Irish embassy staff, the meat industry and the European Commission on various market access issues.<\/p>  <p>  Since taking office I have led trade missions to a wide variety of destinations, including China, the United States, Algeria, Japan and the Gulf States, in order to promote Irish food and beverages, including meat exports, and to open up new markets abroad. These initiatives have led to several notable successes in securing agreement to export Irish beef to Japan, Singapore, Egypt, Iran, the US, Canada and Oman; to export sheepmeat to Singapore, South Africa, the Philippines, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, Canada and Oman; and to export pigmeat to Australia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Serbia. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to China, the ban on boneless beef from Ireland has been lifted for animals under 30 months. Further work is required before trade will commence, and my Department is at present engaging with the Chinese authorities on these technical details. The beef market in the US was opened in January 2015 and as of the start of November 2015, an estimated 1,300 tonnes valued at &euro;8.5 million has already been exported. This is a strong start to this trade considering that the first exports only went in March 2015 and some of the plants were only approved for export as recently as September. In relation to the Philippines, Ireland has now become their second-largest supplier of beef, and Ireland supplied around 20% of their beef imports during the first quarter of 2015. <\/p>  <p>  Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across the EU. This wide portfolio of customers has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years and reflects the success of Bord Bia&rsquo;s differentiation and premiumisation strategy, which focuses on the main attributes of Irish beef: environmental sustainability, grass-based production systems, full traceability, quality assurance at all stages and superior eating quality. Among Bord Bia&rsquo;s key initiatives in 2015 is the continued development, global promotion and marketing of the Origin Green initiative, which establishes Ireland as a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink. Over 200 companies are currently working with Bord Bia to develop and commit to sustainability plans setting out clear targets in emissions, energy, waste, water, biodiversity and corporate social responsibility activities.   <\/p>  <p>  The sheep sector is an important component of our agriculture sector and the third largest farming sector in Ireland with over 34,000 producers and an output value of over &euro;230 million in 2014. Sheepmeat exports in 2014 totalled some &euro;210 million. The market in Hong Kong opened for exports of sheepmeat in 2014 and exports of sheepmeat were valued at almost &euro;9 million in 2014.   <\/p>  <p>  The poultry sector plays an important role within the Irish agricultural economy, accounting for approximately 2% of gross agricultural output and supporting around 5,000 jobs, mostly in rural areas. Export values for poultry meat have increased steadily in recent years to c. &euro;310 million in 2014, growing by 20% in the last year alone, as the value of trade was driven by larger shipments of processed products. A high proportion of these exports are destined for the UK and redirected to international markets through agents for &lsquo;fifth quarter&rsquo; product like chicken feet. Strong fundamentals increased demand in almost all regions of the world in 2014. This is expected to continue in 2015, although some easing in global poultry prices is expected.   <\/p>  <p>  The development of a viable pigmeat sector is a priority for me, given the crucial role which the industry plays in supporting approximately 7,000 jobs including production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services. In 2014 export volumes jumped by approximately 7%, with growth to the UK, Continental Europe and International markets. Export values were up by 3% and are in the range of &euro;570 million, continuing the steady growth seen in recent years. Although the increase in Irish pigmeat exports to international markets in recent years has been negatively impacted by the restrictions of the Russian trade ban, this has been offset by the opening of alternative markets such as Vietnam and the Philippines. These Asian markets will continue to provide valuable opportunities for Irish pork producers into the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500088#WRQ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":358,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[41999\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500088#WRQ00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he is satisfied regarding the adequacy and frequency of checks and inspections in respect of food and food-product labelling in this country and throughout the European Union, with particular reference to the need to preserve the integrity of the food industry, and to recognise its importance to this economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":359,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, I attach huge importance to the food and drink industries exports and their contribution to our economic recovery.

The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement. This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b><\/b>Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have systems to identify any person who supplies the business with a food, and a system to identify other businesses to which their product has been supplied. This is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system. There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224\/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404\/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail. <\/p><p>My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants. Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment.

The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department. Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the FVO to ensure compliance.

The average price received by producers for an R 3 steer in 2015 to date is &euro;4.01, over 10 % higher than the 2014 average.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, I have rolled out a number of supports for Beef farmers . The BDGP involves an investment of over &euro;300 million in suckler farming over the next 6 years under Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan (RDP). The scheme aims to improve the genetic merit of Irish beef cattle, which will in turn lead to increased returns for beef producers and improve the environmental sustainability of the beef herd. The scheme also aims to reverse the decline in the maternal index seen in recent years in the Irish beef herd. This investment is a huge vote of confidence from the government in the Irish Beef herd&rsquo;s potential into the future.   <\/p>  <p>  Beef farmers can also avail of my Department&rsquo;s Knowledge Transfer Programme and my Department provides significant funding for bodies such as Teagasc, Bord Bia, ICBF and AHI, which are a vital part of the support infrastructure for beef.   <\/p>  <p>  Participants in the programme will receive a payment of &euro;142.50 for each of the first eligible 6.66 hectares and &euro;120 for each of the remaining hectares up to the maximum payable area. The maximum payable area is based on the number of calved suckler cows in each herd in 2014. The payment rates provide for a higher payment linked to the first 10 animals on each herd as I felt it was important to favour smaller herds through this programme. The payment rate of &euro;142.50 is the maximum amount which could be provided based on the cost incurred and income foregone associated with the actions under the BDGP, as negotiated with the European Commission. The BDGP is the only animal based scheme in the Rural Development plan   <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is a major exporter of beef, supplying more than half a million tonnes annually to a wide array of European and International markets. Irish beef is now purchased by more than 85 EU supermarket chains, along with numerous high-value food service and manufacturing customers. The Origin Green sustainability programme is central to Bord Bia's promotional strategy for Irish beef, alongside the Beef and Lamb Quality Assurance scheme (BLQAS). One of the fundamental elements of Origin Green relates to the sustainability survey carried out at the time of the farm audit. With over 47,000 certified farms in BLQAS, Ireland is the first country in the world to measure on-farm sustainability on such an extensive basis. The programme has already proven to be a unique advantage in communicating with key customers, and is the envy of other major beef producing countries. Earlier this year, Ireland became the first European country authorised to resume exporting beef to the US market and this market is already worth almost &euro;9m. Similarly, China offers future huge potential for Irish beef exports and my Department is working with the Chinese authorities to have the final technical issues resolved before trade can commence.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500088#WRQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":363,"content":"<p>Question No. 130 answered with Question No. 119.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Correspondence","counter":364,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500088#WRQ01500"},{"type":"question","counter":365,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[42013\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500088#WRQ01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will release his response to letter UA(2015)1842458 from the Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development on the implementation of the Leader programme.","asker":"1017","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":366,"content":"<p>I have forwarded a copy of the response to this letter directly to the Deputy .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500088#WRQ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Scheme Payments","counter":367,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500088#WRQ01800"},{"type":"question","counter":368,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[42024\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500088#WRQ01900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payments under the areas of natural constraint scheme and the basic payments scheme will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":369,"content":"<p>An application under the 2015 Basic Payments \/ Areas of Natural Constraints Schemes was received from the person named on 29 May, 2015.

Surveys led to further findings of the disease. The first step was the introduction of national legislative measures in November 2012 under the Destructive Insects and Pest Acts 1958 and 1991 which listed the disease as a pest and which also regulated the import of ash seed, plants and wood. In December 2012 ash was delisted from the list of tree species approved under the afforestation grant schemes and thereafter the Department also delisted ash for the trees species approved under the agri-environment options scheme (AEOS and now GLAS). The National Roads Authority agreed in 2013 to suspend the use of Ash in any roadside plantings and since then it uses alternative species.<\/p>  <p>  Also in December 2012 the Department introduced a new scheme to restore forests affected by ash dieback, by supporting the removal and destruction of trees and leaf litter affected by the disease and the replanting of the forest with an alternative species. The number of individual ash trees destroyed as part of this exercise is not recorded, however to date 713 hectares of ash has been removed under the scheme. In addition, over the same period, the Department has overseen the removal of several thousand ash plants and trees in nurseries and from along roadways. <\/p>  <p>  An &ldquo;All Ireland Chalara Control Strategy&rdquo; was launched by Minister of State Tom Hayes and Minister Michelle O&rsquo;Neill on 9th July 2013. This strategy, developed jointly between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Northern Ireland (DARD) establishes an all island framework for the policy of identification, control and eradication of the causal agents of ash dieback.   <\/p>  <p>  Surveys have been conducted by the Department year on year since the first occurrence of the disease in Ireland was confirmed. Similar surveys are undertaken by authorities in Northern Ireland. The systematic and targeted plant health surveys in relation to the disease undertaken by the Department over this summer (2015) and the associated laboratory tests were completed in October.

Member States offered strong messages of solidarity and support.  I extended my condolences to the French Minister and the French people and pledged Ireland's support for France at this difficult time. <\/p>  <p>  The High Representative, Fredericka Mogherini, clearly outlined that Article 42.7 of the treaty does not give rise to any coordinated EU action or CSDP operation and that EU institutions have no function in the matter. The HRVP noted that it is an issue for France and the Member States acting on a bilateral basis.  The meeting was advised that France will engage in bilateral discussions with other member States with a view to seeking support for all aspects of its response to the threat from the &ldquo;Daesh&rdquo; and in response to the atrocity committed in Paris. <\/p>  <p>  The meeting of Defence Ministers then continued with an introduction by Commissioner Bie\u0144kowska of the Commission&rsquo;s European Defence Action Plan, the main objective of which is to bring together the core elements of the Commission&rsquo;s policy on the internal market, industrial policy and research. Member States were supportive of this work in conjunction with the European Defence Agency (EDA) in the area of defence.   <\/p>  <p>  Discussion then moved to Capacity Building in Support of Security and Development (CBSD) and the challenges inherent in same. The discussion took place on the basis of a draft implementation plan prepared by the European External Action Service (EEAS) and Commission services.  HRVP Mogherini noted that funding remains a particular concern, calling on Defence Ministers to push for national coherence with their respective Development Ministers on the funding issue and having regard to the clear link between security and development.  In addressing the meeting, I welcomed the initiative. I suggested that pilot projects in this area could provide a useful tool to prove the underlying theory behind CBSD to the Development Community.  Recognition of the link between peace-keeping, development aid and NGO activities was also needed in terms of feeding into Development Aid Policy.  Agreeing with the notion that &lsquo;Prevention is better than Intervention&rsquo;, I also suggested that member States should identify short to medium term solutions while the various funding options were being considered and that the establishment of Trust Funds into which MS could contribute might be a worthy interim solution in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  The NATO Secretary General, Jens Stolenberg, who was invited to attend the item on Capacity Building in Support of Security and Development gave a brief overview of NATO&rsquo;s current activities in the field of &lsquo;Defence Capability Building&rsquo; &ndash; NATO&rsquo;s version of CBSD - citing the initiative as another opportunity to further develop EU\/NATO cooperation. <\/p>  <p>  The last section of this session saw Ministers briefed on the ongoing CSDP military operations which focused on the future development of   Operation Sophia (EUNAVFOR MED) the CSDP Naval operation in the Mediterranean, and the EU Military Assistance Mission in the Central African Republic (EUMAM CAR). It is proposed that the mission in the Central African Republic will transition to a training mission and initial planning will commence. A renewal of UN Security Council Resolutions for Operations Althea and Atalanta was confirmed. <\/p>  <p>  The final working session of the meeting was in EDA Steering Board format, where Member States agreed   the key taskings and the way ahead. A 2016 budget of &euro;30.5m was approved and a further meeting will be held in December to revise the 3 Year Planning Framework, which had been devised based on an expected increased budget of &euro;33m. <\/p>  <p>  In the margins of the meeting I met with a number of colleagues to discuss issues of mutual interest. I also had a discussion with the Italian Minister for Defence in relation to our ongoing Naval Service humanitarian search and rescue operation. The Italian minister commented very positively on the work being done by the Naval Service and welcomed Ireland&rsquo;s support for what is a difficult mission and at a difficult time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500089#WRR01100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Deployment","counter":389,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500089#WRR01150"},{"type":"question","counter":390,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[42033\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015112500089#WRR01200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"in view of the French Minister for Defence having invoked article 42.7 of the Lisbon Treaty, if Ireland will be deploying troops to assist France without a vote in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Work on the Affordable Childcare Programme will begin immediately, so that it can be in place in 2017. This single programme will replace the existing CCS, along with the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes, comprising the After-School Childcare (ASCC), Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS), and Community Employment Childcare (CEC).
