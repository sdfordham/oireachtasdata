Recognising its importance to the economy, the Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of specific measures aimed at supporting employment in the retail sector in 2012.  These actions are for delivery across a number of Departments and agencies and include a renewed focus on prompt payments, an assessment of the potential for future development of the retail sector, the introduction of a statutory code of practice for grocery goods undertakings and the provision of support to retail firms seeking to internationalise.  Other more general measures in the Action Plan which will also help to support employment in the retail sector include improved access to finance for businesses, the enactment of legislation to reform the statutory wage setting mechanisms and the acceleration of the programme of revaluation of commercial premises, which will provide a basis for the adjustment in commercial rates.

In its most recent National Skills Bulletin, which was published on 25 July last, the Expert Group stated that it considers \"skills shortages\" to refer to a situation where there are an insufficient number of individuals who have the required qualifications, skills set, and\/or experience to fill a particular post.  The Expert Group considers that current skills shortages almost entirely have third level qualification requirements, coupled with experience and a specific skills mix.  The National Skills Bulletin found that the magnitude of shortages is unlikely to be greater than several hundreds in terms of headcount for the overall economy, with the exception of IT skills where the demand is greater especially for experienced personnel who are in demand and short supply globally.   Job vacancies were most frequent for sales and related occupations, including marketing (especially digital marketing) and customer services roles.  Vacancies also arose for IT professionals, science and engineering professionals, business professionals, administrative occupations, IT associate professionals, and personal care occupations.  Language skills continue to be important, particularly for sales and customer service roles but also at a professional level (e.g. ICT, engineering and finance).<\/p><p>  The conclusions of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs with regard to the incidence of shortages in specialist skills categories that require a specific skill mix, and also in relation to the persistence of some difficult to fill vacancies, concur with my own experience based on continuing discussions with employers and their industry level representatives.  The Government has brought education and training to the heart of its Action Plan for Jobs.  Initiatives such as Springboard, the ICT Conversion Programme and the target to double the annual number of honours degree ICT graduates to 2,000 by 2018 are aimed at delivering the skills needed by enterprise. n Graduates from these programmes are available to industry and increasing numbers will qualify over the next 18 months.  We will continue to depend on inward migration for highly experienced specialists in ICT who are in short supply globally.  While these are small in number; their recruitment is linked to the additional hiring of a team of graduates and professional staff.

The obligation to provide a Sunday Premium is derived from Section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 (OWT).  In summary, while the OWT Act specifies the means by which an employer should provide a premium for Sunday working, the nature and value of the premium rate is a matter for negotiation and agreement between the employer and trade union(s) representing employees or between the employer and employees who are affected by Sunday trading, in circumstances where employees are not unionised.  Thus, under section 14 any employee who is required to work on a Sunday, and his or her having to work on that day has not been taken account of in the determination of pay, shall be compensated by the payment to the employee of a reasonable allowance having regard to all the circumstances; or by increasing the employee&rsquo;s rate of pay by a reasonable amount having regard to all the circumstances; or by granting the employee reasonable paid time off from work having regard to all the circumstances; or by a combination of two or more of the above.<\/p><p>  Prior to the High Court ruling in the Grace Fried Chicken case that resulted in the striking down of all Employment Regulation Orders, many EROs had provided premium payments to those required to work on Sundays.  Where EROs had made provision for a Sunday premium, they had only prescribed the level of monetary compensation (e.g. double time; time plus one-third) and had excluded the possibility of the use of the other options under section 14 of the OWT Act.  These provisions were a source of significant concern to employers in sectors in which Sunday is a normal working day.  In some cases, such as the hospitality sector, it is the day of greatest demand for the services provided.  The Duffy-Walsh report accepted that there was validity in the argument that the arrangements in place in JLC sectors with regard to Sunday working were unduly burdensome, particularly in sectors in which Sunday is a normal working day.  In its decision, the High Court had particular regard to the absence of consistency across sectors in relation to such matters as to the requirement to pay a Sunday Premium and a confusion between what had been established in statute for universal application and what was being imposed through EROs.<\/p><p>  In this context, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 provides for a new definition of &quot;remuneration&quot; for the purposes of formulating proposals for EROs.  The proposed new statutory definition will ensure that JLCs will no longer set Sunday premium rates or any other conditions of employment already covered by universal standards provided for in existing legislation.  Workers' entitlements to a Sunday Premium will, of course, continue to be reserved under Section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  To complement the removal of the Sunday Premium from the purview of JLCs, I have requested the Labour Relations Commission to develop a Code of Practice on Sunday Working in those sectors covered by JLCs.  The development of this Code will complement the provisions at Section 14 of the OWT Act and ensure that best practices are operated by all employers for those employees who are currently covered by JLCs and who work in sectors where Sunday working is widely practised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200052#WRC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Export Statistics","counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200052#WRC01850"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[41620\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200052#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide the increase in the number of people employed in exporting companies; and his plans to increase the number of existing business that have an export potential.","asker":"984","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":61,"content":"<p>Driving export growth is central to our economic recovery and is a key focus of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs.

In addition, the Credit Guarantee Scheme will also facilitate &euro;150 million per annum in additional lending for SMEs who, because of a lack of collateral or because of the sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing traditional bank credit.

This report benchmarks business costs against a range of Ireland&rsquo;s key competitor countries in a number of key areas, such as labour costs, property costs, utility costs and business and professional services.  The report also provides an analysis of cost profiles of the manufacturing and services sectors.  <\/p><p>  In its most recent Cost of Doing Business report, published in 2011, the NCC identified improvements in Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, particularly in relation to labour costs and property costs.  However, the NCC also advised that further progress is required to ensure that Irish enterprises can compete internationally. <\/p><p>  Some operating costs for business are largely outside the control of Government.  For example, fuel and energy prices are primarily driven by external factors such as global fossil fuel prices.  However, the Government&rsquo;s approach has been to identify those areas of policy it can influence to bring about cost reductions or provide supports to business.<\/p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 includes an extensive range of measures across Government which will help to reduce costs and support job creation.  These include:<\/p><p>- Reforming the statutory wage setting mechanisms;<\/p><p>- Reducing the administrative burden on business;<\/p><p>- Placing downward pressure on insurance costs through the enactment of the Legal Services Bill;<\/p><p>- Encouraging all professionals to supply quotes in advance to business customers; and<\/p><p>- Encouraging local authorities to exercise restraint in the setting of commercial rates.<\/p><p>  The Government is making good progress on implementing the Action Plan for Jobs.  All of the 160 measures for delivery in the first half of the year have been implemented.  <\/p><p>  The Government will continue to deliver on its commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs, to work towards the objective of supporting an extra 100,000 jobs in the economy by 2016 and making Ireland the best small country in which to do business. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200053#WRD00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Initiatives","counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200053#WRD00650"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[41609\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200053#WRD00700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will outline the way in which the proposed industry-led clustering proposals will address or exasperate existing regional employment disparities.","asker":"1083","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":78,"content":"<p>Collaboration and clustering is a proven strategy that provides potential for economies of scale and access to opportunities that would be outside the capability or scope of a business working on its own.

Clustering can be geographically focused, but with advanced technologies and communications, it can be sectorally focussed and operate across regions.

Benefits of collaboration include: enhanced productivity and income; increased market share; increased innovation and knowledge transfer; and enhanced capability.<\/p><p>  One of the Action Points (2.4) in the Plan is to support industry-led clustering in key areas of opportunity, based on new models, industry proposals, and newly developed niche market strategies and in July last, I announced a new &euro;2m pilot Clustering Programme designed to promote cooperation between businesses and create more jobs.  The Programme is a joint agency initiative, involving Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Forf&aacute;s.

This is a very significant achievement and other recent initiatives by Enterprise Ireland in the region included the approval of 14 high quality projects under their competitive feasibility fund, 12 companies being been approved for Graduate Placement. 5 Community Enterprise Centres having been approved for funding for full-time business development managers and a high take-up of the Enterprise Ireland Innovation Voucher scheme in Waterford.<\/p><p><br \/>  The two local County Enterprise boards, in the city and county, have created 59 new jobs and the South East Regional Authority has secured EU funding for a number of enterprise and innovation-focussed projects.<\/p><p><br \/>  F&Aacute;S training services having provided training for about 5,000 people and that Agency is also undertaking a wide range of other training initiatives.

The deal has led Dawn Meats to invest &#8364;14.5 million in a new purpose built, state of the art, beef processing facility in Carroll&#8217;s Cross, Co Waterford, creating 65 new jobs.

This legislation provides for certain statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions. <\/p><p>  The State provides a number of mechanisms through which these statutory employment rights can be vindicated and enforced. These are provided through the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), The Rights Commissioner Service, The Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT), The Equality Tribunal and the Labour Court.<\/p><p>  NERA seeks to secure compliance with employment rights legislation through the provision of education and awareness as well as through routine and complaint driven inspection of employers&rsquo; employment records.  NERA also undertakes enforcement activity.  Where an employer has been identified as being in breach of the legislation NERA will request that the employer rectify the breach.  Where such a breach involves underpayment of wages due to an employee NERA will seek rectification for the employee by seeking payment of the monies due. Where an employer fails or refuses to rectify the breach or repay monies due NERA may initiate a prosecution. <\/p><p>  Where people have concerns that workers may be exploited or are receiving less than their statutory entitlements the matter should be reported to NERA for investigation.<\/p><p>  In other cases complaints may be made to Rights Commissioner Service, the EAT, the Equality Tribunal or the Labour Court depending on the nature of the complaint and the relevant legislation. The relevant body will convene a hearing where both parties will be afforded the opportunity to present their case and the relevant body will issue a determination or recommendation.<\/p><p>  It has to be acknowledged that the system that has developed over the years has become complex and in some cases involves long delays. However, I have commenced a root-and-branch reform with the objective of establishing a world-class Workplace Relations Service.  I am happy to report that significant progress has been made to date in that regard.  <\/p><p>  In addition to reforming the structures and processes, I also intend to provide for enhanced compliance measures and a new mechanism for enforcing awards of the Adjudicators and of Labour Court Determinations. <\/p><p>  The mechanisms I have outlined above relate to people who are legally entitled to work in the state. A situation where an individual, whose immigration status prohibits him or her from working legally in the State, takes up employment and is thus working illegally is different. In such cases both the employer and the employee may be committing an offence.  As the Deputy will be aware, from a recent High Court case, this may prevent a worker in such circumstances from seeking to benefit from the rights laid down in statute. <\/p><p>  While NERA, and other authorities, could pursue convictions regarding an employer in breach of certain employment legislation and employment permits legislation, in cases where the employment is illegal, and may succeed in securing penalties on the employer, they are not in a position to seek redress for the employee in such circumstances.  This is because a contract may be unenforceable if it is drawn up for an illegal purpose or in an illegal manner, or if the contract is prohibited by statute whether expressly or implicitly. <\/p><p>  On Friday 31st August 2012, Mr Justice Gerard Hogan of the High Court reversed a Labour Court award on the basis that person concerned had no standing to invoke the protection afforded by employment legislation since any contract of employment was an illegal one in the absence of an employment permit which he did not have. Justice Hogan therefore held that the Labour Court could not lawfully have made the awards as the employment contract was substantively illegal.<\/p><p>  The issue raised by the High Court judgment is one which has important policy and legal implications in the area of Employment Permits and also in terms of Employment Rights.<\/p><p>  As Justice Hogan noted in his judgement, &ldquo;the Oireachtas must, of course, regulate the labour market by specifically deterring illegal immigrants from taking up employment, as failure to do so could have serious medium term implications for both employment and immigration policy&rdquo;. The relevant provisions of the Employment Permits Acts of 2003 and 2006 hold that where an employee, who was required to hold an Employment Permit, has failed to do so then he or she is guilty of an offence. Furthermore, while an employer may also be guilty of an offence in this matter, Justice Hogan points out that the legislation provides for a defence with regard to an employer but fails to do so with regard to an employee.<\/p><p>  As I understand it, this lack of defence affects the Courts&rsquo; scope to interpret the statutory provisions and compels the Court to hold that the legislation has created an absolute offence so far as an employee is concerned. Importantly, Justice Hogan found that it must therefore be taken that the Oireachtas intended that a such a non-national employee automatically commits an offence if he or she does not have a work permit irrespective of the reasons for that failure and that this has implications so far as the civil law is concerned, in that such a contract of employment must also be taken to be void.<\/p><p>  The question which now arises is to what extent illegal immigrants should be dissuaded from working illegally in Ireland by virtue of there being a statutory offence to do so, versus, to what extent certain employment rights shall protect vulnerable migrants who find themselves unwittingly in such employment positions. <\/p><p>  The Deputy will recognise that this question requires careful consideration as the applicability of rights in one context can have far reaching consequences beyond that originally intended.<\/p><p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that I am very concerned by the facts of this case and I will be meeting the individual concerned this week. My Department is treating the matter with the utmost importance and various policy options are currently being considered with a view to an early response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200053#WRD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200053#WRD02900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Minimum Wage","counter":110,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200053#WRD02850"},{"type":"question","counter":111,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[41250\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200053#WRD02900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of workers currently employed, by sector, with a remuneration level equal to the national minimum wage.","asker":"1080","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":112,"content":"<p>The Earnings, Hours and Employment Costs Survey (EHECS) collects information from enterprises on the number of employees paid at or below the national minimum wage.<\/p><p>The table shows the results from this survey by economic sector for Quarter 1 2012, the latest period for which data is available.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>-<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>Q1 2012<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div><b>-<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><b>-<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>Economic Sector<\/div><\/td><td><div>Number of Employees on National Minimum Wage(NMW)*<\/div><\/td><td><div>Total Number of Employees<\/div><\/td><td><div><i>National Minimum Wage (NMW)\u00a0\u00a0 %<\/i><\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Industry<\/td><td><div>3,400<\/div><\/td><td><div>192,700<\/div><\/td><td><div>1.8<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Construction<\/td><td><div>1,800<\/div><\/td><td><div>63,500<\/div><\/td><td><div>2.8<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wholesale and retail trade;

At the subsequent June 2012 NSMC Plenary meeting, it was noted that the N.I. Executive had announced an investment package of major roads including two sections of the A5 project.

This allowance, which varies according to marital status and grade, is payable at all locations abroad.  Officers serving in designated &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; posts may also be entitled to a hardship allowance as part of their LPA.  Where payable, this hardship element takes account of factors such as personal security and political tension, health, environmental factors, climate and isolation.

Under this concept, each individual State has the primary responsibility for the protection of its citizens.  It must ensure their safety and security and work to prevent atrocities such as genocide, ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity and war crimes &ndash; atrocities which have caused the concept of &ldquo;responsibility to protect&rdquo; to be developed in the first instance.  Any objective appraisal of what has occurred in Syria over the past eighteen months will conclude that the Syrian Government has failed utterly in this basic responsibility.  I pointed out in my address to the UN General Assembly on 28 September that the Assad Government is guilty of wholesale slaughter of its own people.  I also made clear that, while the violence is indiscriminate and on an appalling scale, it is not confined to one side.<\/p><p>  If the concept of &ldquo;responsibility to protect&rdquo; is to have any meaning or relevance for the Syrian people, it is incumbent on the UN Security Council, as the body charged with the maintenance of international peace and security under the UN Charter, to act with one voice in seeking to promote the earliest possible ceasefire and initiation of a political process leading to transition.  That is why I also made clear in my address to the General Assembly that what is now needed, above all else, is a strong Security Council resolution which will authorise targeted sanctions.  This must include a comprehensive arms embargo, against all those who are responsible for violating the human rights of the Syrian people.  That is what the Syrian people want from us, and what they have a right to expect.<\/p><p>  There must also be full accountability for human rights abuses.

A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level.  An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans &#8212; retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts &#8212; by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers.<\/p><p><br \/>  There is, therefore, no statistical basis for providing definitive figures.  However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, it is estimated that the full-year yield to the Exchequer from confining tax relief to the standard rate of 20% in respect of pension contributions to occupational pension schemes, retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts and confining tax relief for the Public Service pension related deduction to the standard rate of 20% would be approximately &#8364;560 million.<\/p><p><i>Reducing the Standard Fund Threshold from &#8364;2.3m to &#8364;622,500<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  The Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) is the maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes which was introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2006 to prevent over-funding of pensions through tax-relieved arrangements.  The SFT was reduced in Budget and Finance Act 2011 by over 50% to a level of &#8364;2.3 million with effect from 7 December 2010 with transitional arrangements to protect the capital values of the pension rights of individuals where these exceeded the reduced SFT on that date.<\/p><p><br \/>  There is currently no underlying data available to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners on which to base reliable estimates of the savings from a further reduction in the SFT to the level indicated in the question.  Information on the numbers and values of individual pension funds or on individual accrued benefits are not generally required to be supplied to the Revenue Commissioners by the administrators of pension schemes and personal pension arrangements.  For these reasons, the estimated savings included in respect the Budget and Finance Act 2011 change in the SFT were quite conservative, based as they were, on incomplete data and using very broad assumptions.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has been engaging with representatives of the pensions industry with a view, among other things, to gathering private pensions-related data which may be of value into the future in estimating the costs of potential changes in the pensions&#8217; tax area.  These engagements are ongoing.<\/p><p><i>Reducing the annual earnings limit from &#8364;115,000 to &#8364;75,000<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  I assume that the Deputy is referring to the current annual earnings cap of &#8364;115,000 which operates to limit the level of tax-relieved personal pension contributions in any one year.  The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, to put a ceiling on the annual amount of tax relief an individual taxpayer can obtain on pension contributions.  A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level.  An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans &#8212; Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) &#8212; by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers.  There is, therefore, only a limited statistical basis for providing definitive figures.<\/p><p><br \/>  However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, the Revenue Commissioners inform me that the combined estimated full year yield to the Exchequer from reducing the current annual earnings cap of &#8364;115,000 to &#8364;75,000 in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs would be about &#8364;113 million.<\/p><p><i>Reducing the maximum tax-free lump sum payment allowable at retirement to &#8364;122,500<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  The following arrangements currently apply to retirement lump sums paid under pension arrangements approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  Lump sum amounts up to &#8364;200,000 are paid free of tax.  They are also paid free of USC. The portion of a lump sum between &#8364;200,001 and &#8364;575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%.  This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum.  No USC is chargeable.  Any amount of a lump sum in excess of &#8364;575,000 is taxed at the individual&#8217;s marginal rate of tax (credits and other tax reliefs are available).  In this instance, USC is chargeable on the excess.  These amounts are lifetime amounts with prior lump sums aggregating with later lump sums.<\/p><p><br \/>  I assume from the Deputy&#8217;s question that he is proposing that retirement lump sums in excess of &#8364;122,500 be taxed as outlined above.  As there is no general requirement for data on the number of persons who are receiving payments of retirement lump sums of less than &#8364;200,000 to be returned to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners, I am not in a position to provide definitive figures on the Exchequer impact of reducing the tax-free retirement lump sum amount from &#8364;200,000 to &#8364;122,500.<\/p><p><br \/>  As an exercise that might provide some indication of the scale of the savings involved, it is estimated that just under 10,500 individuals in the public service would be on salaries of over &#8364;82,000 and less than &#8364;133,500 which, under existing pension scheme arrangements generally applying across the public service, would deliver retirement lump sums of between &#8364;122,500 and &#8364;200,000.  If it is assumed that these individuals would retire in line with retirement trends from the public service in a normal year (about 2.5%), then the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums in excess of &#8364;122,500 at 20% could be approximately &#8364;2m in a full year.  I have no data on which to provide a similar estimate in relation to the private sector.  I should point out, however, that one significant difference between public sector and private sector pension schemes is that private sector schemes invariably allow scheme members the option of commuting part of their pension fund for a tax-free lump sum. This option is not available to members of public sector schemes.

Therefore it is not possible to introduce measures which will direct insurance companies to price in a particular way in response to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) Test-Achats ruling prohibiting gender-differentiation in insurance.   The background to this matter as you are aware is that in its decision of 1st March 2011 the ECJ declared invalid, with effect from 21 December 2012, Article 5(2) of the council directive 2004\/113\/EC of 13 December 2004.  The effect of this ruling is that all private insurance contracts concluded for the first time from 21 December 2012 as well as any  agreements between parties to extend contracts from that date are prohibited by law from differentiating by gender on price or benefits. <\/p><p>  The Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for making the necessary legislative amendments to the Equal Status Act to ensure that they reflect the judgement of the European Court of Justice. The Minister for Justice and Equality expects to announce shortly the details of legislation to amend the Equal Status Acts to reflect this ruling.<\/p><p>  In practice, the impact of unisex insurance premium rates may vary depending on the product, reflecting the take-up by each gender and the corresponding risk profile.  However, the exact movement in premiums after 21 December 2012 is difficult to predict.<\/p><p>  The Government is aware of the concern of many people that insurance premium costs may increase and as a result the Government agreed on 5 June 2012 that the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation would consider what actions their respective Department might take to address the potential adverse consequences of this ruling. This matter is still being examined as always.

Neither the Central Bank nor the Department of Finance has a statutory function in relation to interest rate decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time. <\/p><p><br \/>  However, notwithstanding that, I have received the following input from the covered banks in response to your question:<\/p><p><b>PTSB:<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  I am informed by PTSB that it does not have a significant amount of business loans and therefore this question has little relevance to that institution. <\/p><p><b>AIB:<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  AIB doesn&#8217;t wholly fund itself via the ECB and so reductions in ECB rates don't necessarily lead to a reduction in funding costs for the bank. As part of the restructuring of the bank AIB is required to reduce its levels of ECB funding in exchange for retail \/ business deposits and historical wholesale market funding. In the case of business loans, most business loans in AIB reference EURIBOR or a form of EURIBOR (e.g. AIB's Business Loan Rate (BLR) is an average of 3 month's historic 3 month EURIBOR fixings). A liquidity premium and margin to cover cost of risk, operational costs and funding costs, is then added to this reference rate to arrive at a total interest rate for the customer. AIB keeps these rates under constant review.<\/p><p><b>IBRC:<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The majority of IBRC&#8217;s commercial loan book references money market interbank offer rates &#8211; for Euro based loans, rates are set at a margin above EURIBOR and for sterling based loans interest rates are set as a margin above LIBOR.  Changes in money market Interbank offer rates (i.e. LIBOR or EURIBOR) are applied to individual loan accounts in accordance with the contractual interest reset dates agreed with the borrower. Typically interest rates on IBRC commercial loans are scheduled to reset every month or every three months.<\/p><p><b>BOI:<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  Business lending by Bank of Ireland (BoI) is not linked to ECB rates and therefore BoI has not passed on recent ECB rate reductions on its standard variable rate small business loans. BoI sets interest rates on standard variable rate business loans with reference to BoI&#8217;s cost of funding.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Prior to 2008, the Bank&#8217;s cost of funding was directly linked to official interest rates (e.g. Euribor). When official interest rates moved, it was appropriate to pass on the benefit or cost of that movement to borrowers through the banks standard variable rate. Since 2008, BoI&#8217;s cost of funding has become disconnected from official market interest rates due to:<\/p><p><br \/>  &#8211; the intense competition for customer deposits: as a result deposit rates have not reduced in line with reductions in official interest rates, and;<\/p><p><br \/>  &#8211; the increased cost of issuing stable term wholesale funding, reflecting distressed market conditions, the reduced credit rating of BoI and the Sovereign and heightened concerns regarding the overall euro area.<\/p><p><br \/>  The result of this disconnection is that the Bank&#8217;s cost of funding is no longer directly linked to official interest rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200055#WRF02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Review Office Appeal Numbers","counter":220,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200055#WRF02550"},{"type":"question","counter":221,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[41563\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200055#WRF02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total number of referrals to the Credit Review Office; the number of appeals that have overturned the original decision; the breakdown of this number by county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":222,"content":"<p>I have been informed by the Credit Review Office that it has received 202 formal applications since the establishment of the Office.

Revenue's systems were upgraded to implement the 30% rate last December and Revenue has since been communicating with the various lenders in regard to their IT enhancements, but the speed of upgrading has not been uniform across all lenders.

This exemption does not extend to admissions to visitor farms for educational school tours.<\/p><p>  While admissions to visitor farms became liable to VAT from 1 January, provision was made in the Finance Act 2012 to ensure that such admissions apply at the 9% reduced rate of VAT and not the standard 23% VAT rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200056#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GDP-GNP Levels","counter":250,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200056#WRG00750"},{"type":"question","counter":251,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[42003\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200056#WRG00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide in tabular form GDP and GNP by year from 1992 to 2011.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":252,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is provided as follows.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>NIE<\/div><\/th><th><div>GDP<br \/>Current<br \/>Prices<\/div><\/th><th><div>GNP<br \/>Current<br \/>prices<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>1992*<\/div><\/td><td><div>40,489<\/div><\/td><td><div>35,998<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>1993*<\/div><\/td><td><div>43,605<\/div><\/td><td><div>38,943<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>1994*<\/div><\/td><td><div>46,864<\/div><\/td><td><div>42,146<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>1995<\/div><\/td><td><div>53,787<\/div><\/td><td><div>47,634<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>1996<\/div><\/td><td><div>58,894<\/div><\/td><td><div>52,027<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>1997<\/div><\/td><td><div>68,154<\/div><\/td><td><div>59,660<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>1998<\/div><\/td><td><div>78,685<\/div><\/td><td><div>68,739<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>1999<\/div><\/td><td><div>90,683<\/div><\/td><td><div>77,133<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2000<\/div><\/td><td><div>105,775<\/div><\/td><td><div>90,287<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2001<\/div><\/td><td><div>117,643<\/div><\/td><td><div>98,668<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2002<\/div><\/td><td><div>130,877<\/div><\/td><td><div>107,182<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2003<\/div><\/td><td><div>140,827<\/div><\/td><td><div>119,103<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2004<\/div><\/td><td><div>150,194<\/div><\/td><td><div>127,316<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2005<\/div><\/td><td><div>163,037<\/div><\/td><td><div>138,776<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2006<\/div><\/td><td><div>177,729<\/div><\/td><td><div>154,465<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2007<\/div><\/td><td><div>188,729<\/div><\/td><td><div>162,209<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2008<\/div><\/td><td><div>178,882<\/div><\/td><td><div>153,565<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2009<\/div><\/td><td><div>161,275<\/div><\/td><td><div>132,911<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2012<\/div><\/td><td><div>156,487<\/div><\/td><td><div>130,202<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2011<\/div><\/td><td><div>158,993<\/div><\/td><td><div>127,016<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><i>Source:  CSO<\/i><\/p><p>GDP and GNP in current market prices for 1995 to 2011 are sourced from the CSO's National Income and Expenditure (NIE) tables.<\/p><p>* For 1992 to 1994 the historical NIE tables are used.

However, the budget measure that requires schools to manage the provision of guidance from within their standard staffing allocation must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times. The net impact on overall teacher numbers in our schools has been minimised to the greatest extent possible. Teacher allocations to post primary schools for the 2012\/13 school year have effectively been settled at this stage and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. Decisions on how this is done are taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.<\/p><p>  A key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage. All 195 second-level school in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools. My Department also provided some limited short-term support to schools through curricular concessions in order to help them manage within their approved teaching allocation. <\/p><p>  It is established policy that guidance is a whole school activity and under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students. While the school's guidance planning should involve the guidance counsellor(s) in the first instance, other members of school staff and management also have key roles to play. Parents and students must be seen as an essential part of the process. Through this process schools can, for example, consider the following options for maximising the use of their available resources for the provision of guidance: Optimise the delivery of personal educational, career and vocational guidance in class group settings; Enable students to use directly the extensive range of guidance tools available through the internet from relevant websites (e.g. Qualifax, Careers Portal); Enable some of the curriculum elements of the planned guidance programme to be delivered through other teachers such as SPHE staff; Maximise the role of the pastoral care team in schools; and, Ensure that the guidance counsellor has 1:1 time towards meeting the counselling needs of students experiencing difficulties or crisis.<\/p><p>  The support of the whole school community, parents and the relevant external agencies such as NEWB and NEPS are key to the provision of guidance and support to schools.<\/p><p>  Psychologists from my Department's National Educational Psychological Service ( NEPS ) also provide a range of supports to schools. These include the promotion of positive mental health among the general student body and assistance in supporting pupils with particular social, emotional or behavioural difficulties.<\/p><p>  My Department is also aiming to launch the Guidelines on Mental Health for Post-Primary Schools later this year. These guidelines aim to support schools in developing a whole-school approach to mental health promotion and suicide prevention and are of relevance to all members of the school community. In particular, they have been developed to support principals, guidance counsellors, student support teams, and teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200058#WRJ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teaching Qualifications","counter":399,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200058#WRJ03050"},{"type":"question","counter":400,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[41925\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200058#WRJ03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on whether it is fair that teachers are to be disproportionately impacted by the cut to allowances for new entrants to the public service; if he accepts that qualification allowances for teachers are important in terms of ensuring we have a highly educated teaching force; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":401,"content":"<p>The Government recently approved a number of measures relating to public service allowances for new beneficiaries.  This follows a public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments conducted by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The main measure affecting teachers is the withdrawal of qualification allowances for new entrant teachers.  The Government has decided that the payment of allowances for the basic qualifications required for entry to the teaching profession is no longer appropriate or necessary.  This allowance goes back many years to the time when a distinction was made between teaching colleges and university qualifications.  It is not considered justifiable to incur a permanent cost to the public service pay and pensions bill where a public servant acquires an additional qualification.  The payment of allowances, such as the Gaeltacht and island allowances, are being withdrawn or altered for all new beneficiaries in the public service, including new teachers. These allowances are no longer considered the most appropriate way to meet the business needs of public service employers or the service delivery needs of Irish language speakers.  The Government was mindful of the impact of the abolition of the qualifications allowance on new teachers given that the allowances have come to be viewed as an element of basic pay.

The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) and the Department of Finance are leading on sourcing this funding and are liaising with my Department in this regard; 850 million euro coming from the proceeds of the sale of State assets and from the new licensing arrangements for the National Lottery, to be used as a project preparation facility for the new PPP programme and to fund additional Exchequer capital projects and other commercial and publicly needed projects.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The 1.4 billion euro investment will be directed towards projects that meet key infrastructural needs and are in line with the priorities in the Government's Investment Framework.

As the Phase 1 projects are progressed and as funding permits, projects that could be delivered as part of further phases will be considered.<\/p><p><br \/>  Job creation is a critical priority for Government.  This stimulus will help sustain jobs in the construction sector which has been very badly hit during the recession.  The investment in this Phase 1 package is expected to generate significant numbers of jobs: previous analysis of each sector indicates that the investment will generate around 13,000 jobs.  It will also create much needed social and economic infrastructure and aid economic recovery.  The projects selected are from the education, health, transport and justice sectors.

Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year.  Obviously, this affects the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure.  In addition, public financial rules require that payments are only made on foot of matured liabilities, so payments made in the later parts of the year are made on foot of work that has already been satisfactorily completed.

This plan identified procurement reform as a key instrument that can assist the public service to deliver services in an efficient manner. <\/p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS) has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service&rsquo;s buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. These national arrangements have benefits that include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency; and enhanced service levels. In some instances the take up of the NPS arrangements has been low. In order to increase the usage of the NPS arrangements and thereby secure best value for money, the Government decided that it should be mandatory for public service bodies to use specified national procurement arrangements.  <\/p><p>  Circular 06\/12 implements the Government decision by making it a mandatory requirement that public service bodies avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS. The list of categories subject to national procurement arrangements includes: electricity; natural gas; stationery and office supplies; paper; ICT consumables; managed print services; print media advertising;  and, motor vehicles. These national arrangements will secure best value for money and facilitate contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints. <\/p><p>  In relation to the issue of whether public service bodies have scope to purchase goods and services locally at prices lower than those under national arrangements - the position is that a public service body making such a purchase will need to explain the rationale for not using the NPS arrangement and provide a value for money justification that takes account of the full costs incurred in managing its own procurement process. <\/p><p>  While the key purpose of Circular 6\/12 is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money, it is worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, it should not be taken that single supplier frameworks are to be accepted as the norm. The greater use where appropriate of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring ongoing cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions. <\/p><p>  In relation to managed print services (MPS), the value of this national arrangement is estimated to be &euro;100 million over two years. Given the potential value of contracts under the national arrangement and the fact that suppliers are required to provide all of the print and imaging devices upfront, from their own resources, the view was taken by the NPS that the &euro;10 million minimum turnover requirement was proportionate.  Furthermore, in order to facilitate SMEs, tenderers who did not have the required turnover in their own right were invited to partner with other entities to satisfy this requirement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRL01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Croke Park Agreement Savings","counter":486,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRL01800"},{"type":"question","counter":487,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[41766\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRL01900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the savings to be pursued by him under the Croke Park Agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":488,"content":"<p>Significant savings have accrued as a result of initiatives already carried through using the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014.

The aim of Pathways to Work is to ensure that, as the economy recovers, as many of those new jobs as possible are filled by people who are on the Live Register.<\/p><p>  Pathways to Work places a particular emphasis on supporting those who are long term unemployed.  It has an objective of ensuring that at least 75,000 of those who are currently long-term unemployed will move into employment by 2015.  It also aims to reduce the average time spent on the Live Register from 21 months, to less than 12 months by the end of 2015.<\/p><p>  The establishment of the new integrated National Employment and Entitlement Service under Pathways to Work will transform the nature and level of engagement between our employment services and those who are unemployed.   It will also provide better targeted services to both job seekers and employers.  <\/p><p>  The labour market activation measures outlined in Pathways include over 85,000 job placement and work experience places to be delivered this year by the Department of Social Protection, and over 450,000 training and education places to be delivered by the Department of Education and Skills.  <\/p><p>  There are also financial supports available to employers who recruit a person who is long term unemployed.  These include Revenue&rsquo;s &ldquo;Job Assist&rdquo; scheme and the Employer&rsquo;s PRSI Exemption scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection.  As part of the Action Plan process, I have been actively promoting these schemes to employers in recent months, with the support of business representative bodies.  <\/p><p>  We must continue to do all we can to facilitate the return to work of those who have lost their jobs.  I am currently preparing the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government and will be exploring further measures which can be taken to transform our economy and support job creation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRL03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":502,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[42022\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRL03400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the steps he has taken to reduce bureaucracy and red tape in an effort to protect and encourage employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":503,"content":"<p>The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 sets out a range of measures designed to stimulate the economy and encourage employment growth.  Reducing administrative burdens   has the potential to deliver cost savings and efficiencies for businesses which will assist them in growing employment. This is a key focus for my Department and its Offices and Agencies.<\/p><p>  Significant progress has been made by my Department, with a reduction in administrative burdens of 24.8% already achieved in the areas of Employment Law, Company Law and Health &amp; Safety Law; this amounts to annual savings for business of almost &euro;207 million.  Details of all the initiatives making up this total are available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.djei.ie.<\/p><p>  Successful initiatives resulting in significant savings include: In Company Law, savings of &euro;82 million per annum have already been realised, more than &euro;33 million of which are due to the work of the Companies Registration Office (CRO), as companies can submit their annual returns online via the CRO website and can now use digital signatures for the B1 Form and Accounts; The audit exemption threshold has been increased to the maximum level permitted under EU law.  This will achieve potential additional savings for Irish SMEs of approximately &euro;2.8 million annually; In Health &amp; Safety Law, a total of &euro;123 million in annual administrative savings for business has been delivered by the HSA via two key projects: the BeSMART online tool for preparing the Risk Assessment and Safety Statement (&euro;59m), and the SMP20 Guidelines (&euro;64m), which assist construction firms with fewer than 20 employees in establishing and maintaining an effective safety management system.<\/p><p>  The reform of the State's Workplace Relations Services, that I set in train last year, will, among other matters, deliver a simplified two-tiered structure comprising a single body of first instance, the Workplace Relations Commission, and a single body of appeal, in effect an enhanced Labour Court. This new structure will provide a better service for both employees and employers, with fewer delays and reduced administrative burdens. Already there has been some significant early progress, including the development of a single complaint form for all workplace relations complaints, the establishment of a single contact portal, Workplace Relations Customer Services, to handle all complaints and enquiries, the launch of a single website, www.workplacerelations.ie, containing all relevant information on employment rights and industrial relations and the commencement of a Pilot Early Resolution Service which will seek to resolve disputes without recourse to adjudication or inspection. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to this new structure.<\/p><p>  My Department also coordinates the cross-Government measurement and reduction of administrative burdens towards the 25% target by the end of 2012.  A project to measure the burden imposed by regulation under the responsibility of seven Departments and Revenue was initiated in September 2011.  Following completion of its measurement exercise, each participating Department must then set out how it will achieve the remaining reductions necessary to reach the target and report to Government with its Simplification Plan. Revenue&rsquo;s report on its administrative burden reductions, which has reached the 25% target, has been published on its website.<\/p><p>  The current overall reduction is just over 15% which includes the 24.8 % achieved by my Department, the 25% achieved by Revenue and a 30% reduction achieved by the CSO.<\/p><p>  A further initiative, which will be of benefit to small businesses, in particular, has been the launch of businessregulation.ie.  This new website provides a single online source of information on regulations and how to comply with them. Business will no longer have to search multiple Government websites to find out their obligations.  <\/p><p>  Work is continuing to identify new areas where administrative burdens on business can be reduced and in this regard the High Level Group on Business Regulation has prioritised a number of areas for attention in its 2012 Work Programme. These areas are currently being considered and will be published in the Group&rsquo;s annual report later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRL03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Joint Labour Committees Agreements","counter":504,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRL03600"},{"type":"question","counter":505,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[41251\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRL03700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of workers employed, by sector, in contracts governed by Joint Labour Committee agreements.","asker":"1080","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":506,"content":"<p>The most recent estimates of the number of workers covered by the JLC and REA systems were published in the 2011 Report of the Independent Review of Employment Regulations Orders and Registered Employment Agreement Wage Setting Mechanisms (the Duffy Walsh Report).<\/p><p>Duffy Walsh estimated that there were between 151,539 and 204,724 workers in the sectors covered by JLCs in 2009.

The role involves extensive out of hours working and a high degree of individual responsibility for decision making in an often unsupported environment. The nature of industrial dispute intervention by an IRO is a dynamic and unpredictable activity, not amenable to structure in the normal sense of working time organization. The employer receives a commitment on the part of the officer to prioritise his \/ her work demands, often at short notice, over any other aspect of their time. The employer receives delivery of extensive additional hours working without additional remuneration. It is considered that the degree of individual responsibility undertaken by HEO&rsquo;s in the role exceeds that normally undertaken by officers of the grade.<\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px\">(2)  <b>Is the allowance cost effective\/represent value for money?<\/b><\/div><\/p><p>It is not practicable to envisage the delivery of a conciliation system based on overtime working or on the basis of a &lsquo;time in lieu&rsquo; arrangement. The operation of an allowance based system ensures maximum productivity from available resources and removes issues around availability of officers from the challenge of providing a responsive service to parties in dispute. In the view of the Commission, the allowance at current rates represents good value for money.<\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px\">(3)  <b>Other Pertinent Issues (e.g. why duties cannot form part of grade\/post; impacts\/risks if duties\/responsibilities not undertaken) <\/b><\/div><\/p><p>The Industrial Relations Act, 1990 commits the State to the provision of a Conciliation Service. That service consistently resolves 80% of all disputes referred to it. Access to the service is on a voluntary basis and the parties demand and expect that service delivery will be structured in a manner that responds to the pressures under which the parties operate. Conciliation Service delivery is consistently acknowledged by the Minister and the parties as fundamental to the effective working of our industrial relations system and any diminution or restriction of the service would have significant impacts in terms of dispute activity leading to days lost due to industrial action in the economy. The nature of service delivery requires that the HEO officers are willing and mandated to make decisions and take responsibility for the trajectory of dispute negotiations in an often unsupported environment. It is considered that the degree of such responsibility demanded of HEO IROs is beyond what would normally be demanded of officers in the HEO grade.<\/p><p><b>Labour Inspector Allowance<\/b><\/p><p><div style=\"padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px\">(1)  <b> What does the employer receive in return for the allowance?<\/b><\/div><\/p><p>The Labour Inspectorate of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers.<\/p><p>Labour Inspectors deliver an enforcement and information service in relation to employer obligations and employee rights\/entitlements\/protections falling due under a wide-ranging body of employment legislation and under Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreements.

The main features of the new measures included:<\/p><p>-  expanding the ineligible list of occupations for which permits can be issued;<\/p><p>- increasing by 50% the fees charged at renewal stage for new permits issued after 1 June 2009, and<\/p><p>- reduction in the number of occupations for which Green Cards are issued.  <\/p><p>  The Employment Permits Act 2006 allows for regular review of Ireland&rsquo;s economic migration policies and my Department keeps these policies under review, in line with the emerging needs of the labour market, on an on-going basis.<\/p><p>  Other EU countries may also review their policies in this regard depending on the factors pertaining to their respective economies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRM03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":571,"content":"<p>Question No. 249 answered with Question No. 246.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Numbers","counter":572,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRM03150"},{"type":"question","counter":573,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[42059\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRM03200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the total number of service jobs created indigenously in each of the past three years to date; the specific area or areas in respect of which growth is most obvious; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":574,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[42060\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRM03300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the total number of manufacturing jobs created indigenously in each of the past three years to date; the specific area or areas in respect of which growth is most obvious; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":575,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 250 and 251 together.<\/p><p>The figures in respect of jobs in Enterprise Development agency-supported companies and those supported by the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) are compiled in the Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey and the CEB Annual Employment Survey respectively on an annualised basis.

However, while upward only rent reviews are one of a number of factors which are causing pressure on the commercial and retail sectors at the present time, there are other factors influencing decisions of individual retailers to cut jobs.

As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I have set-out an approach which is focused on economic recovery, by delivering improvements in competitiveness, ensuring companies have access to the finance they need to grow and by prioritising innovation as a key driver of success which will lead to jobs and export growth.<\/p><p>  My Department and the relevant State Agencies under its remit, have a clear focus on the potential and opportunities that exist and can be created. Enterprise development Agencies, Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Science Foundation Ireland,  provide a spectrum of innovation and technology development programmes that deliver  financial, technical and experiential support to help companies become more innovative, encourage and support competitiveness, and help them grow their sales and exports in order to create a climate in which  sustainable employment will grow and expand. It is my view that Innovation and the use of technology will be among the core drivers of job creation in Ireland&rsquo;s key sectors during 2012 and into the coming years.<\/p><p>  A wide range of programmes are being delivered by the Enterprise Agencies - Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland  and Science Foundation Ireland, to promote research &amp; development and innovation and give Irish enterprise a competitive edge in the global market place.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland, the agency responsible for the development and promotion of the indigenous business sector, is focused on the growth of world-class Irish companies to achieve strong positions in global markets. Enterprise Ireland provides research, development and technological innovation support relevant at all stages of company development, enabling companies to progress from undertaking an initial research project to higher level innovation and R&amp;D activities. Enterprise Ireland funds the undertaking of R&amp;D to support significant in-company projects which have the potential to develop new processes, products and services.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland has a range of programmes and soft supports focusing on research, development and innovation to facilitate and support businesses to compete sustainably in international markets. Information on all supports for research and development is available on the websites of Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards.<\/p><p>  In addition, Enterprise Ireland is engaged in efforts to extract maximum value from Ireland&rsquo;s research system &ndash; the objective is to work with companies to secure commercial purpose, leading to jobs and sales, for technologies and ideas developed in Irish research institutions. Enterprise Ireland also operates a range of supports to help companies engage with third level researchers to undertake collaborative research for the benefit of the company. Larger collaborative research projects involving groups of companies are also supported.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland are engaged in a number of specific opportunities to assist the SME sector to avail of its support programmes.<\/p><p>  For example, through the Enterprise Europe Network which includes Enterprise Ireland and the Chambers of Commerce of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Sligo and Waterford, Enterprise Ireland produced a new on-line directory of innovation supports to assist companies and their advisers in sourcing the various forms of support required to promote innovation and R&amp;D.  This new directory was promoted through a series of workshops and seminars held in the various regions.  The new directory is now available through the internationally co-ordinated Enterprise Europe Network website.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland has appointed a panel of 38 Advocates whose role is to assist companies in formulating projects to develop their business through innovation and R&amp;D.  This follows on from previous successful Advocate programmes which have assisted companies to identify their best options for development of new products, processes and services in order to grow sales into new international markets.<\/p><p>  The Industry Research &amp; Development Group (IRDG) Innovation Network, supported by Enterprise Ireland, has been undertaking a range of successful seminars around the country including seminars on R&amp;D Tax Credits (including a workshop on Audits), an event devoted to Services Innovation in Waterford and promotion of collaboration through the &ldquo;Supporting Business In The Mid-West&rdquo; seminar held at the University of Limerick.  This seminar was designed to highlight the benefits of collaboration with Higher Education Institutes for businesses in the Mid-West.<\/p><p>  The Irish Software Innovation Network (ISIN), funded by Enterprise Ireland and managed by the Irish Software Association (ISA), offers a free matchmaking and knowledge-brokering service to help software companies to identify and engage with relevant third-level research institutes.<\/p><p>  The Construction Information Technology Alliance (CITA), funded by Enterprise Ireland, aims to leverage Building\/Business Information Modelling (BIM) to facilitate integrated project delivery and reduced costs in construction industry.<\/p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs Enterprise Ireland is actively working with IDA Ireland to attract companies to avail of R&amp;D tax credits for the first time.  The preliminary work involves the development of an updated R&amp;D tax credit brochure, which will be jointly issued by the two agencies later this year. The next stage will involve a series of agency workshops which will promote an understanding and use of &ldquo;R&amp;D tax credits&rdquo;.<\/p><p>  Research and development support programmes and initiatives will continue to be delivered by the enterprise agencies in support of Irish businesses in order to drive growth, sustainability, exports and job creation.  My department and its enterprise agencies will continue to promote the application of research &amp; development and innovation to gain competitive advantage and to build on the strengths that have emerged from the investment to date in Science Technology and Innovation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRM03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":582,"content":"<p>Question No. 254 answered with Question No. 243.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":584,"content":"<p>Question No. 255 answered with Question No. 76.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Rehiring","counter":585,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRN00250"},{"type":"question","counter":586,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[42669\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRN00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will list all the current positions, where the appointment was made by his Department held by retired senior civil servants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":587,"content":"<p>Since my appointment as Minister, I have not appointed any senior retired civil servants to any position within my Department or to any position within any of the State Agencies under the aegis of my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":589,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRN00500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Supplementary Welfare Allowance Appeals","counter":588,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRN00450"},{"type":"question","counter":589,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[41229\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRN00500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason an oral hearing was not granted in respect of an application for supplementary welfare allowance in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":590,"content":"<p>The legislation provides that an Appeals Officer may decide a case before him\/her on the basis of the documentary evidence.

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice. The first two involve the enhancement of the website    and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears. <\/p><p><br \/>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders. This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main recognised accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.<\/p><p><br \/>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice.<\/p><p><br \/>  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main recognised accountancy bodies and the lenders. The general scope of the advice will be limited to the borrower&#8217;s principal private residence. <\/p><p><br \/>  The advisory framework has commenced with practising accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.  <\/p><p><br \/>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as requested by borrowers. While the advisory framework will be monitored on an on-going basis, it is not intended to conduct a formal review of the scheme before the due date of  2013. At this time, other interested parties who meet the criteria in terms of qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc., may be considered for inclusion.   <\/p><p>The accountancy bodies have notified their members about the new service and a panel is available on a county by county basis on the website <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">.<\/font><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRN01600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Eligibility","counter":604,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRN01650"},{"type":"question","counter":605,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[41295\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRN01700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if there has been a change in policy in 2012 in respect of housing applicants who have been approved for rent assistance and where the social housing needs assessment has post dated the commencement of the tenancy, sometimes by months; if a change has been made to refuse to pay arrears; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":606,"content":"<p>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.

The current full rate of payment is &#8364;29.80 per week per dependent child having increased in recent years after a considerable period of being frozen in value. The estimated expenditure on qualified child increase in 2012 is around &#8364;675 million. <\/p><p><br \/>  QCI payments do not of themselves constitute a specific social welfare scheme and entitlement to the appropriate primary adult payment must be established in the first instance.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Social welfare payments consist of a personal rate with increases for qualified adults and children depending on the household composition. In order to be regarded as a qualified child the child must be ordinarily resident in the State (except where EU rules provide otherwise), not be in legal custody, satisfy the age condition attaching to the particular payment and normally reside with the claimant. Where children continue in full-time education, payment of the QCI can continue up to 22 years of age or up to the end of the academic year in which the child reaches 22 in the case of long-term payments as well as short-term payments that have been in payment for at least 156 days.  A full rate QCI is payable where a qualified adult increase is also awarded or for those claimants who are parenting alone.  A reduced rate QCI is payable for children in cases where the claimant&#8217;s spouse\/partner&#8217;s income exceeds a certain limit. The upper income limit is currently set at &#8364;400 a week.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Child benefit is a universal payment that assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).  <\/p><p>  Any changes to the PRSI system to extend the full range of social insurance benefits to self-employed persons would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.   <\/p><p>  The recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund as at 31 December 2010 looked at the break-even contribution rates required to provide invalidity pensions and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for self-employed workers.   The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 3.7% effective rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus the invalidity pension and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.<\/p><p>  I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year and one of the issues that the Group is currently considering is the issue of providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  The Advisory Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed. <\/p><p>  Any proposals to extend additional cover to the self-employed will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  <\/p><p>  Self-employed individuals may, however, establish entitlement to assistance-based payments such as the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for assistance-based payments, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRO03600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Status","counter":697,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRO03650"},{"type":"question","counter":698,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[41728\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRO03700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a social protection appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":699,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 23 August 2012 and will be referred to an Appeals Officer who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRO03800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Appeals","counter":701,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRP00125"},{"type":"question","counter":702,"qnumday":295,"qnumall":"[41730\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRP00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a disability allowance appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":703,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 15 March 2012.

Approximately 37,300 rent supplement claims have been awarded in 2012, representing over 41% of total claims in payment, indicating that accommodation can be secured within the existing rent limits. Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met; there will no incidence of homelessness due to these changes.<\/p><p>  It is essential that rents are allowed to stabilise from a natural balance of supply and demand, rather than as a result of a rent control funded by the taxpayer. The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country but at this stage I have no plans to alter the current approach, in terms of introducing legislation to impose rent controls on residential properties.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRP03400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Schemes","counter":748,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRP03425"},{"type":"question","counter":749,"qnumday":314,"qnumall":"[41946\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRP03500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason a weekly payment from a payment protection insurance policy to a person out of work due to ill health does not qualify for income disregard noting if the person was well enough to work and earned the exact same amount from employment it would qualify for income disregard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":750,"content":"<p>There are a number of means tested, social assistance scheme operated by my Department.

Each week, over 1.4 million people receive a social welfare payment and, when qualified adults and children are included, over 2.2 million people benefit from weekly payments.  Some 600,000 families receive child benefit payments in respect of over 1.1 million children each month.  The day to day activities of the Department included (full year 2011): <\/p><p>- 2.2 million applications processed; <\/p><p>- 87.6 million scheme payments made; <\/p><p>- 982,000 control reviews;<\/p><p>- 6.8 million telephone calls answered; <\/p><p>- 34,000 social welfare appeals finalised;<\/p><p>- 153,000 PPS numbers allocated. <\/p><p>  Most of the related schemes and services have been, or will be, addressed under the programme for Service Delivery Modernisation.<\/p><p>  Each project under the modernisation programme is focused on business process improvements in the relevant business area with major changes to how staff work and interact with customers, and supported through new technology solutions on the department&rsquo;s modern integrated technology platform.  Each of these projects is rigorously assessed, governed and implemented based on specific business requirements and its contribution to the overall strategic objectives of the department.<\/p><p>  Benefits have been achieved over time, not only in improved customer service but in administration of schemes through integrated systems; reduced system &lsquo;downtime&rsquo; (1.21% in 2011 compared to 2.13% in 2009); agile response to required change including budget changes under the Social Welfare Act; enhanced work flow to maximise resources; integration with payment and reconciliation systems; ability to take on increased workload without commensurate increase in staff resources; more efficient and flexible communication products such as automated customer communications and use of text messaging; use of integrated scanning technologies to support end-to-end processing of claims; authenticated online services; support for major service initiatives such as moving customers from payable orders to electronic payment mechanisms; agile development environment to support introduction of new schemes such as the early child care supplement; robust infrastructure that supports on-going system improvements through a monthly release cycle; parallel project development; enhanced certification processing to support customer communications and control functions such as child benefit Irish residency certificates, and changes to continuing eligibility, residency and employment; improved overpayment and debt management; and ability to deliver new functionality such as statements of customer contributions and a new PRSI refunds application.<\/p><p>  Examples of benefits achieved include:<\/p><p>- There has been a significant increase in claims activity in local offices since mid-2008.  The number of claims processed in 2008 increased by 88% (216,000 additional claims) and a further 43% in 2009 (198,000 additional claims), with activity falling slightly through 2010 and 2011\/12.  <\/p><p>-  In 2011 there was in excess of 500,000 claims processed in local offices nationally &ndash; this was double the level of activity in 2007.  <\/p><p>-  It should be noted that a similar number of claims (500,000) were also closed in local offices in 2011, giving a total &lsquo;claim churn&rsquo; of over 1 million customers in 2011.<\/p><p>-  Average processing times for jobseeker allowance and jobseeker benefit claims have stabilised at 5 weeks and 2 weeks respectively, lower than peak processing times in 2009. <\/p><p>-  Some 95% of state pension contributory claims are paid by due date.<\/p><p>-  Average processing times for family income supplement has remained at 17 weeks over the last two years.<\/p><p>-  The department received 1.4 million claims for various non-weekly schemes such as child benefit (144,386 claims received, roughly half in respect of new births), household benefits, treatment benefits and supplementary welfare allowance.  The average processing time for circa 80% of these claims is now 1 week and almost all of the remainder are processed within a month.<\/p><p>  There are some schemes which are receiving particular attention. For example, processing times for carers allowance and invalidity pension which amounted to 3% of received claims in 2011 are not acceptable.  Increased demand by individuals for these schemes has put pressure on the administration of the department to service this demand, resulting in a requirement to increase productivity.  To this end major service delivery modernisation projects have taken place in these business areas over the last 2 years to improve the efficiency of their administration.  These projects involve the deployment of information technology solutions and associated business processes.  The new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customers by optimising performance and providing improved customer service.  However, change of this magnitude needs time to build and bed in and it is expected to be a number of months before the backlogs are reduced to an acceptable level.<\/p><p>  The department&rsquo;s modernisation programme is a fundamental part of government&rsquo;s public service reform agenda and in this regard the department is currently undergoing another period of major transformation moving from a passive transaction focused model of income support to a proactive model which is customer centric and progressive.  The integration of the community welfare service, and employment and community services of F&aacute;s was made possible through the investments in modern technology over the preceding years.  Change on this scale also requires substantive changes for staff and these initiatives are being delivered under the auspices of the Public Service Agreement (PSA) and with significant input from staff who are required to make major changes to how they work.<\/p><p>  Expenditure on all the Department&rsquo;s SDM related projects in the period since commencement, some eleven years ago, amounts to just over &euro;82m at the end of 2011.  It is expected that expenditure on the service delivery modernisation programme in 2012 will amount to some &euro;4.8m. Further information in relation to the Department&rsquo;s modernisation programme, including costs, are provided in the department&rsquo;s annual report which can be found on the website www.welfare.ie.  <\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the investments made in the modernisation of systems and processes represent good value for money and have positioned the department to best meet the needs of customers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRQ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":762,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRQ00850"},{"type":"question","counter":763,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[42009\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRQ00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"of the 1628 appeals on medical grounds submitted for carer's allowance in 2011, the number awaiting a decision on 1 January 2012; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":764,"content":"<p>A total of 2,359 appeals in relation to carers allowance\/benefit were received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2011, which were added to the 2,218 on hands on the 1st January of that year.

The areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.<\/p><p><br \/>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30Mbps and 40Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers&#8217; existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Broadband Plan contains a commitment that my Department will undertake a full mapping exercise in respect of high speed broadband deployment.  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country where there is market failure in the provision of high speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed and fail in the delivery of high speed broadband over the coming years.  Until that process is complete, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.  I would reiterate however, that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds referred to above, to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including areas such as Fossa and Ballydesmond, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has already begun some of the necessary preparatory work, and the full mapping will commence as soon as the current spectrum auction being managed by ComReg is completed and final decisions are taken by the ComReg in respect of Next Generation Access regulation.  It is necessary that both these processes are finalised before the mapping exercise begins, as they will critically inform the investment plans for telecommunications service providers over the coming years.<\/p><p><br \/>  I have already emphasised to industry the importance of my Department securing full cooperation from all the commercial operators in completing this aspect of the Plan&#8217;s implementation.<\/p><p><br \/>  As regards current broadband speeds, the Communications Regulator, ComReg, publishes on its website, , details of broadband packages available in all counties, including County Kerry.

The EirGrid project is of strategic national importance in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s economic infrastructure.<\/p><p>  Electricity interconnection improves security of supply, promotes further competition in the electricity market which in turn exerts downward pressure on electricity prices.  Interconnection also facilitates the penetration of wind generation and the East West Interconnector will facilitate export of surplus electricity generation output.<\/p><p>  I do not have a statutory function in the setting of energy prices, whether in the regulated or unregulated market.  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  <\/p><p>  Prices in the retail business and residential electricity markets are now fully deregulated.  Since 1 October, 2011 residential gas customers supplied by Bord G&aacute;is Energy are the only segment of the electricity and gas markets where prices are still regulated by the CER.  Prices in the electricity and gas markets, with the exception of residential gas customers supplied by Bord G&aacute;is Energy, are wholly commercial and operational matters for the suppliers concerned. Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and gas markets, both wholesale and retail, are characterised by vigorous competition regulated by the CER.<\/p><p>  The domestic retail electricity market is a competitive market and consumers are able to switch their business between suppliers, who in turn purchase their power on the all island wholesale market, the Single Electricity Market (SEM).  Overall electricity prices in Great Britain are lower than those in Ireland and, as might be expected in this situation, there has been strong interest from traders on the interconnector in importing power into Ireland from Britain.  The interconnector in these circumstances is capable of carrying additional power into Ireland from a lower cost market, to the extent of 500MW, with that capacity representing more than that of an average modern power station.  The interconnector therefore means that there can be even greater competition for existing generators operating in the SEM leading to additional downward pressure on the wholesale prices otherwise charged by generators.<\/p><p>  It is difficult in the deregulated electricity market to identify the precise impact of the downward pressure on prices brought about specifically by the interconnector, as against the impact of any other factors at play in the wholesale and\/or retail market.

My Department's role is to ensure that there is an adequate legislative and financial system in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation. <\/p><p>  Accommodation for Travellers is provided across a range of options including standard local authority housing, which is financed from my Department's capital allocation for social housing, private housing assisted by the housing authority or voluntary organisations, private rented accommodation and through their own resources.  My Department also provides funding for Traveller-specific accommodation such as group housing schemes and halting sites.<\/p><p>  The Government remains committed to meeting the accommodation needs of Travellers.  Since 2005, over &euro;187m has been expended for the provision of new, and refurbishment of existing, Traveller-specific accommodation.  This is in addition to expenditure on standard local authority housing and other housing supports.  The results of this substantial financial commitment are reflected in the significant reduction in the numbers of Traveller families on unauthorised sites, despite continuous increases in the numbers of Traveller families nationally.<\/p><p>  The National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee (NTACC) is a statutory body established for the purposes of providing advice on all matters relating to housing for Travellers.  While the matter of a Traveller-led accommodation agency has been examined, no firm proposals have been put forward for consideration by the NTACC.  A proposal for a statutory Traveller accommodation agency, as set out in the 1995 Report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community, was considered by my Department.  However, it was subsequently decided not to establish such an Agency and I have no plans to review the matter at this time.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRU00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":979,"content":"<p>Question No. 397 answered with Question No. 382.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Light Pollution","counter":980,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRU00550"},{"type":"question","counter":981,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[42047\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRU00600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on the fact that with regard to astronomy, the majority of street lighting diffuses the light not only downward to the pavement but also upwards, in other countries this practice has ceased to ensure that the orange sky glow over towns will be done away with; misdirected light not only destroys the view for astronomers but also leads to a huge wastage of energy and is unnecessary in view of modern options; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":982,"content":"<p>There is no environmental legislation pending or in force, at either EU or national level, on light pollution.

It is their duty to ensure as far as is possible, and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register.   <\/p><p>  In the normal course, voter registration is an ongoing process in which those entitled to be registered apply to their registration authority for inclusion in the Register of Electors.  The new register comes into effect each year on 15 February.  The draft register is published in November each year in preparation for the coming into effect of the register on the 15 of February following.  The public is invited to check the draft during this period so that people can make sure that they are correctly registered.  Any errors or omissions in the draft should be brought immediately to the attention of the registration authority.  Claims for the addition or deletion of names are ruled on by the county registrar who is a legally qualified court officer.  The ruling is made in public and any person may attend and give evidence. <\/p><p>  Provision is also made in electoral law for inclusion in the supplement to the register.  If a person is not included in the register of electors currently in force but considers that he or she qualifies for registration - for example if they have come of age to register or if they have changed address - the person may apply for entry in the supplement to the register which is open year round subject to certain practical limits in the weeks before a polling day.  The closing date for the supplement to the register for the forthcoming referendum is Tuesday, 23 October 2012. <\/p><p>  The detailed requirements regarding the inclusion of persons in the supplement are set out in section 15, and Part 2, of the Second Schedule to the Electoral Act 1992.  An applicant for inclusion in the supplement to the register must apply directly to his or her registration authority.  The application must be signed by the applicant in the presence of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from the applicant&rsquo;s local Garda station who must first be satisfied as to the person's identity before signing, dating and stamping the form.  The Garda may request photographic or other identification.  Where the applicant establishes in writing that he is unable to progress the application in this way, the form can be signed by the applicant in the presence of an official of the registration authority who is satisfied as to his or her identity.  Again, photographic or other identification may be required.  If neither option is viable due to physical illness or physical disability, the application form must be accompanied by a medical certificate. <\/p><p>  Student campaigns which encourage people to register to vote are to be welcomed.

On the basis of a value for money review, it was clearly established that the vast majority of the money allocated to PwDI was being spent disproportionately.  The largest proportion of PwDI&rsquo;s annual budget was spent on the operation of its office headquarters and on administration rather than on the creation of projects which would directly benefit people with disabilities.  This was an untenable situation that could not be allowed to continue as the conclusions of the VFM report show that people with disabilities were benefiting very little from the allocation in real terms. <\/p><p>  It is my wish to ensure that people with disabilities directly benefit from any money allocated to this sector.  With this in mind, I just recently oversaw the finalisation of a major Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in the Department of Health to ensure that existing funding allocated for people with disabilities is spent to best effect.  I am also interested in hearing what people with disabilities have to say on issues affecting them.  I have established and am personally chairing a new National Disability Strategy Implementation Group to develop and progress disability strategy.  The new group includes representation from a number of disability stakeholder organisations, also three former members of PwDI and a number of people with disabilities who are able to bring their lived experience directly to bear on the very important work of this high level group.  This ensures the voice and perspective of people with disabilities will continue to be heard in a more focused and cost effective way.<\/p><p>  At my request the National Disability Authority held the first National Disability Forum event in June 2012.  This event, which is hoped will be held on an annual basis, was primarily about listening to the views of individual people with disabilities, their families and carers in relation to the key policy areas and service developments that impact on their lives.<\/p><p>  The Government must ensure that funding is allocated for maximum provision of services for people with disabilities, having regard to overall resource constraints which affect all sectors at this time.  Specialist disability services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings.  The integral role of the non-statutory, voluntary and community groups is of particular relevance to the provision of health and personal social services to people with a disability.  These agencies provide a very significant and broad range of services in partnership with and on behalf of the Health Service Executive (HSE).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRU02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Charities Regulation","counter":1004,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRU02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1005,"qnumday":406,"qnumall":"[41740\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRU02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to regulate the charity sector to ensure accountability and transparency in its operation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1006,"content":"<p>The Charities Act 2009 provides for an integrated system of mandatory registration and proportionate regulation and supervision of the charities sector in Ireland.

The Revenue Commissioners have granted charitable tax exemptions to almost 8,000 charities and have significant powers to ensure that such charities comply with tax law.  A full list of these charities is available to the public at www.revenue.ie.

While I expect that the policing plan for 2013 will contain proposals for the further rationalisation of Garda stations and Districts, it would be premature, in advance of its submission, to speculate on specific measures which it might contain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRW00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service Issues","counter":1088,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRW00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1089,"qnumday":436,"qnumall":"[41984\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRW00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on the fact that irrespective of the reconfiguration or rearrangement of Court Service facilities that court proceedings through the medium of Irish must continue to be available to residents of Gaeltacht areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1090,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions.

The Report, which is publicly available on the Law Society's website (www.lawsociety.ie), details the arguments that were put forward both in favour of and against the introduction of this regulation and explains the reasons behind the decision to propose its adoption.

In order to make the necessary savings it was proposed to make technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers whose farming enterprises are situated primarily in DAS areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme, which are defined in the governing EU legislation as follows: To ensure continued agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable rural community; To maintain the countryside; To maintain and promote sustainable farming systems which, in particular, take account of environmental protection measures.<\/p><p>  Processing of high volume application schemes, such as the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and the Single Payment Scheme, require significant hands-on from the management teams and a willingness and ability to focus resources on the varying priorities that arise throughout the process.  One very important element of the process is dealing with the many and varied enquiries from applicants, by telephone, letter, email or on-line.  The 2012 processing campaign is currently well advanced, with the necessary arrangements in place to deal with farmers&rsquo; queries.  The record number of applications submitted on-line in 2012 has further contributed to the smoother processing of applications.<\/p><p>  While changes were introduced in respect of the minimum stocking density requirements, specific provision was made for those farmers who had a stocking density less than 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to a recognised agri-environmental measure.  The principles of force majeure\/exceptional circumstances were also provided for in the process. Provision was also be made for new entrants to farming.<\/p><p>  All 10,046 applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, were written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in such an agri-environmental measure resulted in the lower stocking density.  The Department is currently working on those applicants who applied for derogation, good progress has been made to date with many already paid.  All applicants are being advised, in writing, of the success or otherwise of their application.  Those unsuccessful applicants are being afforded the opportunity of appeal to the DAS Derogation Appeals Committee.  This Committee, to be chaired by Padraig Gibbons, is to be constituted shortly, to adjudicate on those further appeals from farmers dissatisfied with Department decisions on their derogation applications.<\/p><p>  Payments under the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme started issuing, on schedule, on 26 September 2012 and, to date, payments worth in the region of &euro;159 million have issued; these payment levels are very much in line with previous years.  Included in this figure are payments to a sizeable number of farmers who successfully applied for derogation from the revised stocking density requirement, included as part of the range of technical adjustments necessitated by budgetary requirements.  Payments will continue to issue as individual cases are confirmed eligible for payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRW03300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Licences","counter":1131,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRW03350"},{"type":"question","counter":1132,"qnumday":450,"qnumall":"[41243\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRW03400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when the assignment of an aquacultural licence will be completed in respect of a company (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1133,"content":"<p>The application for licence assignment referred to by the Deputy is currently being assessed by my Department in accordance with the provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997.

The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery. I received over 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management. It was very clear from these documents that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed. I asked my Department to examine the proposals received and to prepare for me a number of options, which as far as practically possible, took the views of stakeholders into account while delivering proper and effective management.  <\/p><p>  On 22 December 2011, I published a draft policy document on the matter which I believed meets the objectives to the greatest extent possible. I consulted and met industry regarding the draft policy and again there was no consensus.  Having considered all views and having regard to the sustainability of the fisheries, I came to a decision which I believe provides for the proper and effective management and conservation and rational exploitation of the herring stocks. On 8 June 2012 I published a policy, based on giving access to each of the fisheries to those with recent track record in that particular fishery.  The track record involves vessels having landed a minimum of 5 tonnes of herring in 2009 or 2010 or in 3 of the 5 years during the period 2006 to 2010.  In addition, there are some very limited specified  circumstances where an earlier track record may be taken into account.<\/p><p>  These are the criteria under which future herring authorisations will be granted and I believe that these track record criteria are objective, transparent and non-discriminatory.  The only exception to track record relates to small vessels in the Dunmore area for the Celtic Sea fishery where a small scale local fishery is permitted in line with the Rebuilding\/Management Plan for the fishery. The policy also provides for a modest restricted quota for smaller vessels without a track record in both the Celtic Sea and Area VIa.<\/p><p>  The decision made was based on a clear, detailed and objective assessment of the fisheries in recent years.  This policy is intended to ensure the long term sustainability of the herring fisheries by limiting participation in the main fisheries to those vessels which have participated in the fishery, in the 5 years prior to the commencement of the review, even at a low level.  I set down this fishing boat licensing aspects of this policy in Policy Directive 1 of 2012 which I issued to the Registrar of Sea Fishing Boats on 19 September 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRY00400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":1181,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRY00450"},{"type":"question","counter":1182,"qnumday":468,"qnumall":"[41585\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRY00500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding an application under the dairy equipment grant scheme in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1183,"content":"<p>The person concerned is an applicant under the Dairy Equipment Scheme and submitted an application under the tranche which closed at end-July 2012.

Approximately 95% of children in the year before school are availing of the free pre-school provision at this time.  The ECCE programme is being maintained on a universal and free basis but a reduction of &#8364;2 per week was made to the capitation rates paid to providers from September 2012.

From September 2012, the higher subvention rate payable for full day care, under this programme, of &#8364;100 per week has been reduced by &#8364;5 to &#8364;95.

It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the care of the organisation. The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I published the Heads of the Children First Bill   in April 2012. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that organisations and professionals who work with children have a statutory responsibility to report reasonable concerns about the abuse or neglect of children in their care to the HSE Child and Family Services.<\/p><p>  I asked the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to consider the Heads of the Children First Bill and make recommendations.  I received their comprehensive Report in July and  I thank the Committee for its work on this matter. My Department is currently considering the broad range of submissions to, and recommendations of the Joint Committee, including those submissions pertaining to the issue of childminders.<\/p><p>  Preschool services are regulated under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.   &quot;Childminder&quot; is defined in the  Regulations as &quot;a person who provides a childminding service as defined in the Regulations&quot;.  A &quot;childminding service&quot; is defined in the Regulations as &quot;a preschool service which may include an overnight service offered by a person who single-handedly takes care of preschool children, including the childminder's own children, in the childminder's home for a total of more than 2 hours per day, except where the exemptions provided in Section 58 of the Child Care Act 1991 apply.&quot;<\/p><p>  Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three preschool children from different families in the childminder&rsquo;s home.  Childminders taking care of not more than three preschool children from different families are not covered by the Regulations, recognising parental choice to place children with friends and neighbours, and the challenges of the over-regulation of the more informal arrangements chosen by parents.  As a result of this exemption it is not possible to provide a figure for the number of childminders currently providing childminding services.<\/p><p>  The National Guidelines for Childminders, compiled by the National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee which oversees the development of an integrated child care infrastructure throughout the country, provide guidance to childminders on good practice, and assist them to decide whether they are subject to the Regulations, as well as providing other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of child care services.<\/p><p>  The 2006 Regulations replaced the earlier Regulations, introduced in 1996, and made a number of improvements to the regulatory environment, including the introduction of a requirement for all staff and students working in a preschool service to have been Garda vetted.<\/p><p>  As is the case with all regulatory requirements, the Child Care Regulations set the minimum standards which services are legally required to comply with.  However, my Department is proactive in monitoring, promoting and developing the highest standards of care and education throughout the sector, including the regulatory environment, given the important role which these services play in this crucial phase of children&rsquo;s lives.<\/p><p>  My Department also has begun work on Ireland&rsquo;s first Early Years Strategy which I envisage will be a creative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s Early Years sector aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to age six.   One of the issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the development of the childminding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for the under-one age group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRAA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Preschool Services","counter":1272,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRAA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1273,"qnumday":500,"qnumall":"[41844\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200060#WRAA00800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide an update on the expansion of the free pre-school year in early childhood care and education programme; if such an extension will begin for children at the age of two years, thus allowing them two years of pre-school learning; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1018","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1274,"content":"<p>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free preschool year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.

However, glucosamine products are available over the counter without prescriptions.<\/p><p><br \/>  Omega-3 triglyceride products (e.g. Omacor) have been identified both nationally and internationally as not being cost effective or being of lesser benefit to patients. However, these products are also available over the counter without prescriptions, as is Orlistat.<\/p><p>Gluten-free products have become more widely available in supermarkets in recent years and tend to be significantly cheaper than products sold through community pharmacies.

Approximately 1,000 of these women were infected with Hepatitis C and were therefore eligible to apply to the Tribunal for compensation.

In 2010, almost 600,000 appointments were missed by patients on hospital waiting lists.  Current outpatient waiting lists do not exceed 400,000 patients.  It is clear, therefore, that the already limited capacity for the system to attend to all patients on the waiting list in a timely manner is being impacted further by these missed (and therefore wasted) appointment slots which prevents this slot being utilised by another patient still waiting for his\/her appointment.<\/p><p>I am determined to do all that is possible to minimise this waste and reduce waiting lists.

However, the NCC also advised that further progress is required to ensure that Irish enterprises can compete internationally. <\/p><p>  Some operating costs for business are largely outside the control of Government.  For example, fuel and energy prices are heavily influenced by external factors such as global fossil fuel prices.  However, the Government&rsquo;s approach has been to identify those areas of policy it can influence to bring about cost reductions or provide supports to business.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 includes an extensive range of measures across Government which will help to reduce costs and support job creation.  <\/p><p>  A range financial and non-financial supports and incentives are also available from Government Departments, Offices and Agencies to support employment creation in all sectors.

Also, recent jobs losses which have occurred in the FDI sector in Ireland are largely the result of the continuing restructuring process that is on-going in Ireland and other developed economies, driven by competitive pressures and technological change.  This can result in jobs at the lower end of the value added scale being either phased out completely or relocated to lower cost locations.<\/p><p>However, the most recent report from the National Competitiveness Council, <i>&#8220;Ireland&#8217;s Competitiveness Scorecard 2012&#8221;<\/i>  , has pointed out that Ireland has become significantly more cost competitive. In terms of international measures, the World Economic Forum (WEF) rankings showed Ireland&#8217;s position improving two places to 27th last September, while the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook released in May showing Ireland&#8217;s headline position recovering back into the top 20 (up from 24th) and 8th out of the 24 EU countries featured.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Our current policies are geared to bring about a transformation of the Irish enterprise sector to ensure that we are in a position to avail of the opportunities that will arise as the global economy returns to growth.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The Action Plan for Jobs aims to transform the operating environment for business in order to support enterprise growth and job creation.  The Government will achieve this objective by systematically removing obstacles to competitiveness, putting downward pressure on business costs, promoting innovation and trade, supporting new and existing businesses to develop and expand, and by deepening the impact of foreign direct investment in Ireland.  The Government has identified, in the Action Plan, a number of key sectors where Ireland can gain competitive advantage in global markets.  The Plan has also set a target of supporting the creation of 100,000 net new jobs over the period 2012 to 2016, with the longer term objective of having two million people at work by 2020 as part of our goal of making Ireland the best small country in which to do business.  <\/p><p><br \/>  We are reforming supports to small businesses, we have published the National Research Prioritisation Exercise, and we have launched the Succeed in Ireland scheme to help identify and encourage companies that might set up in Ireland.   <\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to the wide-range of programmes being delivered by the Enterprise Agencies, I am also focusing on other measures to address the challenge of access to finance being faced by SMEs.

It is my view that Innovation and the use of technology will be among the core drivers of job creation in Ireland&rsquo;s key sectors during 2012 and into the coming years.<\/p><p>  A wide range of programmes are being delivered by the Enterprise Agencies - Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland  and Science Foundation Ireland, to promote research &amp; development and innovation and give Irish enterprise a competitive edge in the global market place.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland, the agency responsible for the development and promotion of the indigenous business sector, is focused on the growth of world-class Irish companies to achieve strong positions in global markets. Enterprise Ireland provides research, development and technological innovation support relevant at all stages of company development, enabling companies to progress from undertaking an initial research project to higher level innovation and R&amp;D activities. Enterprise Ireland funds the undertaking of R&amp;D to support significant in-company projects which have the potential to develop new processes, products and services.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland has a range of programmes and soft supports focusing on research, development and innovation to facilitate and support businesses to compete sustainably in international markets. Information on all supports for research and development is available on the websites of Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards.<\/p><p>  In addition, Enterprise Ireland is engaged in efforts to extract maximum value from Ireland&rsquo;s research system &ndash; the objective is to work with companies to secure commercial purpose, leading to jobs and sales, for technologies and ideas developed in Irish research institutions. Enterprise Ireland also operates a range of supports to help companies engage with third level researchers to undertake collaborative research for the benefit of the company. Larger collaborative research projects involving groups of companies are also supported.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland are engaged in a number of specific opportunities to assist the SME sector to avail of its support programmes.<\/p><p>  For example, through the Enterprise Europe Network which includes Enterprise Ireland and the Chambers of Commerce of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Sligo and Waterford, Enterprise Ireland produced a new on-line directory of innovation supports to assist companies and their advisers in sourcing the various forms of support required to promote innovation and R&amp;D.  This new directory was promoted through a series of workshops and seminars held in the various regions.  The new directory is now available through the internationally co-ordinated Enterprise Europe Network website.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland has appointed a panel of 38 Advocates whose role is to assist companies in formulating projects to develop their business through innovation and R&amp;D.  This follows on from previous successful Advocate programmes which have assisted companies to identify their best options for development of new products, processes and services in order to grow sales into new international markets.<\/p><p>  The Industry Research &amp; Development Group (IRDG) Innovation Network, supported by Enterprise Ireland, has been undertaking a range of successful seminars around the country including seminars on R&amp;D Tax Credits (including a workshop on Audits), an event devoted to Services Innovation in Waterford and promotion of collaboration through the &ldquo;Supporting Business In The Mid-West&rdquo; seminar held at the University of Limerick.  This seminar was designed to highlight the benefits of collaboration with Higher Education Institutes for businesses in the Mid-West.<\/p><p>  The Irish Software Innovation Network (ISIN), funded by Enterprise Ireland and managed by the Irish Software Association (ISA), offers a free matchmaking and knowledge-brokering service to help software companies to identify and engage with relevant third-level research institutes.<\/p><p>  The Construction Information Technology Alliance (CITA), funded by Enterprise Ireland, aims to leverage Building\/Business Information Modelling (BIM) to facilitate integrated project delivery and reduced costs in construction industry.<\/p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs Enterprise Ireland is actively working with IDA Ireland to attract companies to avail of R&amp;D tax credits for the first time.

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice. The first two involve the enhancement of the website    and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears. <\/p><p><br \/>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders. This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main recognised accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.<\/p><p><br \/>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice.<\/p><p><br \/>  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main recognised accountancy bodies and the lenders. The general scope of the advice will be limited to the borrower&#8217;s principal private residence. <\/p><p><br \/>  The advisory framework has commenced with practising accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.  <\/p><p><br \/>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as requested by borrowers. While the advisory framework will be monitored on an on-going basis, it is not intended to conduct a formal review of the scheme before the due date of  2013. At this time, other interested parties who meet the criteria in terms of qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc., may be considered for inclusion.   <\/p><p>The accountancy bodies have notified their members about the new service and a panel is available on a county by county basis on the website <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">.<\/font><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200062#WRN01600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Eligibility","counter":1691,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200062#WRN01650"},{"type":"question","counter":1692,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[41295\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200062#WRN01700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if there has been a change in policy in 2012 in respect of housing applicants who have been approved for rent assistance and where the social housing needs assessment has post dated the commencement of the tenancy, sometimes by months; if a change has been made to refuse to pay arrears; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1693,"content":"<p>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.

In order to be regarded as a qualified child the child must be ordinarily resident in the State (except where EU rules provide otherwise), not be in legal custody, satisfy the age condition attaching to the particular payment and normally reside with the claimant. Where children continue in full-time education, payment of the QCI can continue up to 22 years of age or up to the end of the academic year in which the child reaches 22 in the case of long-term payments as well as short-term payments that have been in payment for at least 156 days.  A full rate QCI is payable where a qualified adult increase is also awarded or for those claimants who are parenting alone.  A reduced rate QCI is payable for children in cases where the claimant&#8217;s spouse\/partner&#8217;s income exceeds a certain limit.

Details of these submissions, redacted in respect of confidential operational information, are available on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform website at <i>www.per.gov.ie<\/i> and go into Press Releases, Review of Public Service Allowances and Premium Payments, business cases and then into Social Protection.<\/p><p><i>http:\/\/per.gov.ie\/review-of-public-sector-allowances-and-premium-payments-business-cases-submitted-for-review\/<\/i><\/p><p><table><tr><th><b>Allowance<\/b><\/th><th><b>Payment Rates &#8364; per week<\/b><\/th><th><b>Total in 2011 &#8364;<\/b><\/th><th><b>Comments<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Child Allowance<\/td><td>&#8364;2.17 <\/td><td>43,233<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Call out Availability<\/td><td>&#8364;33.90 (class B); &#8364;35.67 (class A) (this amount can be shared between a number of people.)<\/td><td><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>18,845<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Private Secretary <\/td><td>&#8364;376 for HEO grade; &#8364;199.41 for EO grade (retained on a sliding scale)<\/td><td><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>125,549<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Telephone Rental<\/td><td>Varies (currently ranges from &#8364;2.54 &#8211; &#8364;4.46)<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>3,085<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Franking Machine<\/td><td>&#8364;32.60 (class B); &#8364;34.30 (class A)<\/td><td>85,763<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Keyholder<\/td><td>&#8364;33.90 (class B); &#8364;35.67 (class A) (this amount can be shared between a number of people.)<\/td><td><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>117,091<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Driving<\/td><td>&#8364;43.05<\/td><td>2,486<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Machine Duties<\/td><td>&#8364;32.60<\/td><td>3,390<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Service Officer Supervisory<\/td><td>&#8364;54.08 &#8211; &#8364;61.06 <\/td><td>20,055<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Forklift<\/td><td>&#8364;34.49 <\/td><td>1,793<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>On Call<\/td><td>Varies according to hours worked.<\/td><td>200,191<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Special Duty Allowance<br \/><br \/><\/td><td>&#8364;148.55 to &#8364;358.71 (Depending on posting, retained on sliding scale after special duties cease)<\/td><td>144,926<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Shift <\/th><th>Varies according to duties and basic pay (currently ranges from &#8364;92.69 to &#8364;265.50)<\/th><th><br \/><br \/>360,874<\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Paperkeeper<\/td><td>&#8364;61.06<\/td><td>6,350<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Benefit in Kind Mileage<\/td><td>Varies (based on mileage accrued)<\/td><td>7,479<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Higher Duty<\/td><td>Varies &#8211; (difference between current salary and what would be the salary payable on promotion)<\/td><td>331,289<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gaeltacht<\/td><td>Varies but equates to 7.5% of Salary: this applies only to former HSE staff<\/td><td>12,462<\/td><td>Oct-Dec 11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dual Responsibility<\/td><td>&#8364;71.50 (former HSE staff only)<\/td><td>2,498<\/td><td>Oct-Dec 11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cleaning\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/td><td>&#8364;65.95 (former HSE staff only)<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>Not set up until 2012<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Training <\/td><td>Varies (currently ranges from &#8364;15.23 to &#8364;58.02: (former HSE staff only)<\/td><td>4,523<\/td><td>Oct-Dec 11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Travel<\/td><td>&#8364;29.32 (former HSE staff)<\/td><td>13,421<\/td><td>Oct-Dec 11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Personal To Holder Allowance<\/td><td>Varies (carried over to DSP by former Revenue staff)<\/td><td>39,424<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Special Investigation Unit <\/td><td>&#8364;42.40 at Assistant Principal level and &#8364;114.31 at Higher Executive Officer \/ Executive Officer levels<\/td><td>512,614<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200063#WRO00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Assist Scheme Appeals","counter":1742,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200063#WRO00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1743,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[41423\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200063#WRO00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding an appeal for farm assist in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cavan; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1744,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an oral hearing of the appeal of the person concerned took place on 10 September 2012 and the Appeals Officer is now considering the appeal in the light of all the evidence submitted, including that adduced at the hearing.

Customers in this category include asylum seekers who do not have access to primary social welfare payments or those who are ill but do not qualify for a payment under the Department&#8217;s primary illness related schemes.

The project involved the development of IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.  Full deployment of the new system for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance was completed in June 2012.<\/p><p>Following the completion of the modernisation project, an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project commenced for the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs. The outcome of the review is the division of work into two streams. One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processes these without delay and the other on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%).  <\/p><p>  Any changes to the PRSI system to extend the full range of social insurance benefits to self-employed persons would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.   <\/p><p>  The recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund as at 31 December 2010 looked at the break-even contribution rates required to provide invalidity pensions and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for self-employed workers.   The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 3.7% effective rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus the invalidity pension and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.<\/p><p>  I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year and one of the issues that the Group is currently considering is the issue of providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.  The Advisory Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed. <\/p><p>  Any proposals to extend additional cover to the self-employed will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  <\/p><p>  Self-employed individuals may, however, establish entitlement to assistance-based payments such as the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for assistance-based payments, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200063#WRO03600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Status","counter":1784,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200063#WRO03650"},{"type":"question","counter":1785,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[41728\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200063#WRO03700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a social protection appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1786,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 23 August 2012 and will be referred to an Appeals Officer who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.<\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200063#WRO03800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Appeals","counter":1788,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200064#WRP00125"},{"type":"question","counter":1789,"qnumday":295,"qnumall":"[41730\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200064#WRP00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a disability allowance appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1790,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 15 March 2012.

Each week, over 1.4 million people receive a social welfare payment and, when qualified adults and children are included, over 2.2 million people benefit from weekly payments.  Some 600,000 families receive child benefit payments in respect of over 1.1 million children each month.  The day to day activities of the Department included (full year 2011): <\/p><p>- 2.2 million applications processed; <\/p><p>- 87.6 million scheme payments made; <\/p><p>- 982,000 control reviews;<\/p><p>- 6.8 million telephone calls answered; <\/p><p>- 34,000 social welfare appeals finalised;<\/p><p>- 153,000 PPS numbers allocated. <\/p><p>  Most of the related schemes and services have been, or will be, addressed under the programme for Service Delivery Modernisation.<\/p><p>  Each project under the modernisation programme is focused on business process improvements in the relevant business area with major changes to how staff work and interact with customers, and supported through new technology solutions on the department&rsquo;s modern integrated technology platform.  Each of these projects is rigorously assessed, governed and implemented based on specific business requirements and its contribution to the overall strategic objectives of the department.<\/p><p>  Benefits have been achieved over time, not only in improved customer service but in administration of schemes through integrated systems; reduced system &lsquo;downtime&rsquo; (1.21% in 2011 compared to 2.13% in 2009); agile response to required change including budget changes under the Social Welfare Act; enhanced work flow to maximise resources; integration with payment and reconciliation systems; ability to take on increased workload without commensurate increase in staff resources; more efficient and flexible communication products such as automated customer communications and use of text messaging; use of integrated scanning technologies to support end-to-end processing of claims; authenticated online services; support for major service initiatives such as moving customers from payable orders to electronic payment mechanisms; agile development environment to support introduction of new schemes such as the early child care supplement; robust infrastructure that supports on-going system improvements through a monthly release cycle; parallel project development; enhanced certification processing to support customer communications and control functions such as child benefit Irish residency certificates, and changes to continuing eligibility, residency and employment; improved overpayment and debt management; and ability to deliver new functionality such as statements of customer contributions and a new PRSI refunds application.<\/p><p>  Examples of benefits achieved include:<\/p><p>- There has been a significant increase in claims activity in local offices since mid-2008.  The number of claims processed in 2008 increased by 88% (216,000 additional claims) and a further 43% in 2009 (198,000 additional claims), with activity falling slightly through 2010 and 2011\/12.  <\/p><p>-  In 2011 there was in excess of 500,000 claims processed in local offices nationally &ndash; this was double the level of activity in 2007.  <\/p><p>-  It should be noted that a similar number of claims (500,000) were also closed in local offices in 2011, giving a total &lsquo;claim churn&rsquo; of over 1 million customers in 2011.<\/p><p>-  Average processing times for jobseeker allowance and jobseeker benefit claims have stabilised at 5 weeks and 2 weeks respectively, lower than peak processing times in 2009. <\/p><p>-  Some 95% of state pension contributory claims are paid by due date.<\/p><p>-  Average processing times for family income supplement has remained at 17 weeks over the last two years.<\/p><p>-  The department received 1.4 million claims for various non-weekly schemes such as child benefit (144,386 claims received, roughly half in respect of new births), household benefits, treatment benefits and supplementary welfare allowance.  The average processing time for circa 80% of these claims is now 1 week and almost all of the remainder are processed within a month.<\/p><p>  There are some schemes which are receiving particular attention. For example, processing times for carers allowance and invalidity pension which amounted to 3% of received claims in 2011 are not acceptable.  Increased demand by individuals for these schemes has put pressure on the administration of the department to service this demand, resulting in a requirement to increase productivity.  To this end major service delivery modernisation projects have taken place in these business areas over the last 2 years to improve the efficiency of their administration.  These projects involve the deployment of information technology solutions and associated business processes.  The new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customers by optimising performance and providing improved customer service.  However, change of this magnitude needs time to build and bed in and it is expected to be a number of months before the backlogs are reduced to an acceptable level.<\/p><p>  The department&rsquo;s modernisation programme is a fundamental part of government&rsquo;s public service reform agenda and in this regard the department is currently undergoing another period of major transformation moving from a passive transaction focused model of income support to a proactive model which is customer centric and progressive.  The integration of the community welfare service, and employment and community services of F&aacute;s was made possible through the investments in modern technology over the preceding years.  Change on this scale also requires substantive changes for staff and these initiatives are being delivered under the auspices of the Public Service Agreement (PSA) and with significant input from staff who are required to make major changes to how they work.<\/p><p>  Expenditure on all the Department&rsquo;s SDM related projects in the period since commencement, some eleven years ago, amounts to just over &euro;82m at the end of 2011.  It is expected that expenditure on the service delivery modernisation programme in 2012 will amount to some &euro;4.8m. Further information in relation to the Department&rsquo;s modernisation programme, including costs, are provided in the department&rsquo;s annual report which can be found on the website www.welfare.ie.  <\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the investments made in the modernisation of systems and processes represent good value for money and have positioned the department to best meet the needs of customers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200065#WRQ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":1849,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200065#WRQ00850"},{"type":"question","counter":1850,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[42009\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200065#WRQ00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"of the 1628 appeals on medical grounds submitted for carer's allowance in 2011, the number awaiting a decision on 1 January 2012; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1851,"content":"<p>A total of 2,359 appeals in relation to carers allowance\/benefit were received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2011, which were added to the 2,218 on hands on the 1st January of that year.

Prices in the electricity and gas markets, with the exception of residential gas customers supplied by Bord G&aacute;is Energy, are wholly commercial and operational matters for the suppliers concerned.

The interconnector in these circumstances is capable of carrying additional power into Ireland from a lower cost market, to the extent of 500MW, with that capacity representing more than that of an average modern power station.  The interconnector therefore means that there can be even greater competition for existing generators operating in the SEM leading to additional downward pressure on the wholesale prices otherwise charged by generators.<\/p><p>  It is difficult in the deregulated electricity market to identify the precise impact of the downward pressure on prices brought about specifically by the interconnector, as against the impact of any other factors at play in the wholesale and\/or retail market.

This holistic, multi-agency approach ensures that regeneration is sustainable, beyond just the initial construction phases, and generates long-term advantages. The Regeneration Process in Limerick seeks to reinvigorate and revitalise communities that have witnessed considerable neglect and breakdown over decades by acting as a catalyst for more integrated, responsive and effective public service provision and enhanced resident participation in matters that affect them.

It is co-funded by Government Departments\/State Agencies, Atlantic Philanthropies and the University of Limerick.

It is their duty to ensure as far as is possible, and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register.   <\/p><p>  In the normal course, voter registration is an ongoing process in which those entitled to be registered apply to their registration authority for inclusion in the Register of Electors.  The new register comes into effect each year on 15 February.  The draft register is published in November each year in preparation for the coming into effect of the register on the 15 of February following.  The public is invited to check the draft during this period so that people can make sure that they are correctly registered.  Any errors or omissions in the draft should be brought immediately to the attention of the registration authority.  Claims for the addition or deletion of names are ruled on by the county registrar who is a legally qualified court officer.  The ruling is made in public and any person may attend and give evidence. <\/p><p>  Provision is also made in electoral law for inclusion in the supplement to the register.  If a person is not included in the register of electors currently in force but considers that he or she qualifies for registration - for example if they have come of age to register or if they have changed address - the person may apply for entry in the supplement to the register which is open year round subject to certain practical limits in the weeks before a polling day.  The closing date for the supplement to the register for the forthcoming referendum is Tuesday, 23 October 2012. <\/p><p>  The detailed requirements regarding the inclusion of persons in the supplement are set out in section 15, and Part 2, of the Second Schedule to the Electoral Act 1992.  An applicant for inclusion in the supplement to the register must apply directly to his or her registration authority.  The application must be signed by the applicant in the presence of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from the applicant&rsquo;s local Garda station who must first be satisfied as to the person's identity before signing, dating and stamping the form.  The Garda may request photographic or other identification.  Where the applicant establishes in writing that he is unable to progress the application in this way, the form can be signed by the applicant in the presence of an official of the registration authority who is satisfied as to his or her identity.  Again, photographic or other identification may be required.  If neither option is viable due to physical illness or physical disability, the application form must be accompanied by a medical certificate. <\/p><p>  Student campaigns which encourage people to register to vote are to be welcomed.  However, it is important that the requirements of electoral law are met.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200069#WRU01700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Rehiring","counter":2085,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200069#WRU01750"},{"type":"question","counter":2086,"qnumday":404,"qnumall":"[42665\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200069#WRU01800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will list all the current positions, where the appointment was made by his Department held by retired senior civil servants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2087,"content":"<p>Mr. David O'Callaghan is current Chair of the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management.

On the basis of a value for money review, it was clearly established that the vast majority of the money allocated to PwDI was being spent disproportionately.  The largest proportion of PwDI&rsquo;s annual budget was spent on the operation of its office headquarters and on administration rather than on the creation of projects which would directly benefit people with disabilities.  This was an untenable situation that could not be allowed to continue as the conclusions of the VFM report show that people with disabilities were benefiting very little from the allocation in real terms. <\/p><p>  It is my wish to ensure that people with disabilities directly benefit from any money allocated to this sector.  With this in mind, I just recently oversaw the finalisation of a major Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in the Department of Health to ensure that existing funding allocated for people with disabilities is spent to best effect.  I am also interested in hearing what people with disabilities have to say on issues affecting them.  I have established and am personally chairing a new National Disability Strategy Implementation Group to develop and progress disability strategy.  The new group includes representation from a number of disability stakeholder organisations, also three former members of PwDI and a number of people with disabilities who are able to bring their lived experience directly to bear on the very important work of this high level group.  This ensures the voice and perspective of people with disabilities will continue to be heard in a more focused and cost effective way.<\/p><p>  At my request the National Disability Authority held the first National Disability Forum event in June 2012.  This event, which is hoped will be held on an annual basis, was primarily about listening to the views of individual people with disabilities, their families and carers in relation to the key policy areas and service developments that impact on their lives.<\/p><p>  The Government must ensure that funding is allocated for maximum provision of services for people with disabilities, having regard to overall resource constraints which affect all sectors at this time.  Specialist disability services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings.  The integral role of the non-statutory, voluntary and community groups is of particular relevance to the provision of health and personal social services to people with a disability.  These agencies provide a very significant and broad range of services in partnership with and on behalf of the Health Service Executive (HSE).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200069#WRU02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Charities Regulation","counter":2091,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200069#WRU02150"},{"type":"question","counter":2092,"qnumday":406,"qnumall":"[41740\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200069#WRU02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to regulate the charity sector to ensure accountability and transparency in its operation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1106","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2093,"content":"<p>The Charities Act 2009 provides for an integrated system of mandatory registration and proportionate regulation and supervision of the charities sector in Ireland.  The various sections of the Charities Act are subject to implementation through commencement orders.  Sections that it was possible to commence in advance of the establishment of the Charities Regulatory Authority, as provided for under the Act, have been commenced. The remainder will be commenced following the establishment of the Authority. <\/p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the full implementation of the Charities Act, including the establishment of the Authority, had to be examined in the context of the comprehensive review of expenditure, which took place last year.  Arising from this review, and in the context of the need to reduce Government spending, I took the view that it was not possible to proceed with the full implementation of the Act at this time given the likely scale of the financial and staffing resources then envisaged, and that this should be deferred.  In light of this decision my Department is currently examining options for resource efficient ways of making progress towards the objectives of the Charities Act.<\/p><p>  It should be recalled that there is, at present, a range of regulatory oversight measures that can apply to charities.  Many charities are already subject to scrutiny by various State Bodies.  The Revenue Commissioners have granted charitable tax exemptions to almost 8,000 charities and have significant powers to ensure that such charities comply with tax law.  A full list of these charities is available to the public at www.revenue.ie.  Many charities are companies limited by guarantee and, as such, are also subject to the provisions of company law and are generally required to provide certain information to the Companies Registration Office under the Companies Acts.

Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda Region to target suspect offenders.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to invest time and energy in these partnerships and relationships to the benefit of all. In this regard, last week the Garda Commissioner launched the second national public awareness week this year under the 'Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign&rsquo;. This important campaign highlights a range of key issues, in particular burglary prevention. The primary objective of this Garda Community Safety Campaign is to engage with, and raise awareness within communities of initiatives aimed at preventing crime, reducing the fear of crime and promoting community safety.<\/p><p>  Insofar as the number of arrests made in the specific areas referred to are concerned, I am informed that this would require a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources to compile due to the fact that persons arrested in these areas will, in general, be brought to either Navan or Ashbourne Garda Stations, which are both District Headquarters and have full custody facilities.

Revenue has adopted a comprehensive tobacco strategy which is published on Revenue&#8217;s website <i>www.revenue.ie.<\/i>    The strategy includes a number of programmes, which are designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for contraband tobacco in Ireland. Key elements include developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, development of analytics and detection technologies, and ensuring optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and within the country, in order to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.<\/p><p><br \/>  With regard to the level of penalties for illicit importation and sale of tobacco products, the threat to tax revenues from criminal activity in the cigarette market is viewed very seriously, and substantially increased penalties were introduced in the Finance Act 2010 as a deterrent.  The penalties for the smuggling of tobacco products are contained in Section 119 of the Finance Act 2001 as amended and the penalties for the illegal sale of unstamped tobacco products are contained in section 78 of the Finance Act 2005, as amended. In 2012 to date a total of 81.1m cigarettes with a retail value of &#8364;36.6m and 3,338kgs of tobacco with a retail value of &#8364;1.2m have been seized by Revenue.

This year Cosc has provided grants totalling &euro;241,820 to 59 successful applicants throughout the country. In 2011 &euro;298,153 was granted to 58 different groups from the scheme. Guidelines devised by Cosc in 2011 in relation to the grant scheme aim to encourage a shift from a focus on activities only relating to the victim to an inclusion of a focus on the perpetrator and bystander whilst also ensuring that information on support services continues to be made available to victims\/survivors.<\/p><p>  The bystander approach aims to both engage individual members of society in challenging the social norms that allow sexual and domestic violence to occur and to encourage individuals to assist victims of such violence rather than isolating them. One example of this approach has been a partnership between the Union of Students of Ireland and Cosc over the last two years to increase awareness of domestic and sexual violence among students attending third level institutions. The purpose of this campaign was to make students as bystanders more aware of intimate partner violence in the college setting and to intervene where relevant. There have been three stages to date in this work: an awareness raising art work competition, distribution of colourful wristbands with a slogan and website details for more information, and the circulation of a free postcard, visually based on the winning piece from the art competition, containing information about abusive relationships and the helplines to contact.

In order to make the necessary savings it was proposed to make technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers whose farming enterprises are situated primarily in DAS areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme, which are defined in the governing EU legislation as follows: To ensure continued agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable rural community; To maintain the countryside; To maintain and promote sustainable farming systems which, in particular, take account of environmental protection measures.<\/p><p>  Processing of high volume application schemes, such as the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and the Single Payment Scheme, require significant hands-on from the management teams and a willingness and ability to focus resources on the varying priorities that arise throughout the process.  One very important element of the process is dealing with the many and varied enquiries from applicants, by telephone, letter, email or on-line.  The 2012 processing campaign is currently well advanced, with the necessary arrangements in place to deal with farmers&rsquo; queries.  The record number of applications submitted on-line in 2012 has further contributed to the smoother processing of applications.<\/p><p>  While changes were introduced in respect of the minimum stocking density requirements, specific provision was made for those farmers who had a stocking density less than 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to a recognised agri-environmental measure.  The principles of force majeure\/exceptional circumstances were also provided for in the process. Provision was also be made for new entrants to farming.<\/p><p>  All 10,046 applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, were written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in such an agri-environmental measure resulted in the lower stocking density.  The Department is currently working on those applicants who applied for derogation, good progress has been made to date with many already paid.  All applicants are being advised, in writing, of the success or otherwise of their application.  Those unsuccessful applicants are being afforded the opportunity of appeal to the DAS Derogation Appeals Committee.

The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery. I received over 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management. It was very clear from these documents that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed. I asked my Department to examine the proposals received and to prepare for me a number of options, which as far as practically possible, took the views of stakeholders into account while delivering proper and effective management.  <\/p><p>  On 22 December 2011, I published a draft policy document on the matter which I believed meets the objectives to the greatest extent possible. I consulted and met industry regarding the draft policy and again there was no consensus.  Having considered all views and having regard to the sustainability of the fisheries, I came to a decision which I believe provides for the proper and effective management and conservation and rational exploitation of the herring stocks. On 8 June 2012 I published a policy, based on giving access to each of the fisheries to those with recent track record in that particular fishery.  The track record involves vessels having landed a minimum of 5 tonnes of herring in 2009 or 2010 or in 3 of the 5 years during the period 2006 to 2010.  In addition, there are some very limited specified  circumstances where an earlier track record may be taken into account.<\/p><p>  These are the criteria under which future herring authorisations will be granted and I believe that these track record criteria are objective, transparent and non-discriminatory.  The only exception to track record relates to small vessels in the Dunmore area for the Celtic Sea fishery where a small scale local fishery is permitted in line with the Rebuilding\/Management Plan for the fishery. The policy also provides for a modest restricted quota for smaller vessels without a track record in both the Celtic Sea and Area VIa.<\/p><p>  The decision made was based on a clear, detailed and objective assessment of the fisheries in recent years.  This policy is intended to ensure the long term sustainability of the herring fisheries by limiting participation in the main fisheries to those vessels which have participated in the fishery, in the 5 years prior to the commencement of the review, even at a low level.  I set down this fishing boat licensing aspects of this policy in Policy Directive 1 of 2012 which I issued to the Registrar of Sea Fishing Boats on 19 September 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200069#WRY00400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":2268,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200069#WRY00450"},{"type":"question","counter":2269,"qnumday":468,"qnumall":"[41585\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200069#WRY00500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding an application under the dairy equipment grant scheme in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2270,"content":"<p>The person concerned is an applicant under the Dairy Equipment Scheme and submitted an application under the tranche which closed at end-July 2012.

Approximately 95% of children in the year before school are availing of the free pre-school provision at this time.  The ECCE programme is being maintained on a universal and free basis but a reduction of &#8364;2 per week was made to the capitation rates paid to providers from September 2012.

From September 2012, the higher subvention rate payable for full day care, under this programme, of &#8364;100 per week has been reduced by &#8364;5 to &#8364;95.

It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the care of the organisation. The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I published the Heads of the Children First Bill   in April 2012. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that organisations and professionals who work with children have a statutory responsibility to report reasonable concerns about the abuse or neglect of children in their care to the HSE Child and Family Services.<\/p><p>  I asked the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to consider the Heads of the Children First Bill and make recommendations.  I received their comprehensive Report in July and  I thank the Committee for its work on this matter. My Department is currently considering the broad range of submissions to, and recommendations of the Joint Committee, including those submissions pertaining to the issue of childminders.<\/p><p>  Preschool services are regulated under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.   &quot;Childminder&quot; is defined in the  Regulations as &quot;a person who provides a childminding service as defined in the Regulations&quot;.  A &quot;childminding service&quot; is defined in the Regulations as &quot;a preschool service which may include an overnight service offered by a person who single-handedly takes care of preschool children, including the childminder's own children, in the childminder's home for a total of more than 2 hours per day, except where the exemptions provided in Section 58 of the Child Care Act 1991 apply.&quot;<\/p><p>  Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three preschool children from different families in the childminder&rsquo;s home.  Childminders taking care of not more than three preschool children from different families are not covered by the Regulations, recognising parental choice to place children with friends and neighbours, and the challenges of the over-regulation of the more informal arrangements chosen by parents.  As a result of this exemption it is not possible to provide a figure for the number of childminders currently providing childminding services.<\/p><p>  The National Guidelines for Childminders, compiled by the National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee which oversees the development of an integrated child care infrastructure throughout the country, provide guidance to childminders on good practice, and assist them to decide whether they are subject to the Regulations, as well as providing other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of child care services.<\/p><p>  The 2006 Regulations replaced the earlier Regulations, introduced in 1996, and made a number of improvements to the regulatory environment, including the introduction of a requirement for all staff and students working in a preschool service to have been Garda vetted.<\/p><p>  As is the case with all regulatory requirements, the Child Care Regulations set the minimum standards which services are legally required to comply with.  However, my Department is proactive in monitoring, promoting and developing the highest standards of care and education throughout the sector, including the regulatory environment, given the important role which these services play in this crucial phase of children&rsquo;s lives.<\/p><p>  My Department also has begun work on Ireland&rsquo;s first Early Years Strategy which I envisage will be a creative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s Early Years sector aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to age six.   One of the issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the development of the childminding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for the under-one age group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200069#WRAA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Preschool Services","counter":2359,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200069#WRAA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":2360,"qnumday":500,"qnumall":"[41844\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200069#WRAA00800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide an update on the expansion of the free pre-school year in early childhood care and education programme; if such an extension will begin for children at the age of two years, thus allowing them two years of pre-school learning; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1018","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2361,"content":"<p>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free preschool year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.

However, glucosamine products are available over the counter without prescriptions.<\/p><p><br \/>  Omega-3 triglyceride products (e.g. Omacor) have been identified both nationally and internationally as not being cost effective or being of lesser benefit to patients. However, these products are also available over the counter without prescriptions, as is Orlistat.<\/p><p>Gluten-free products have become more widely available in supermarkets in recent years and tend to be significantly cheaper than products sold through community pharmacies.

Approximately 1,000 of these women were infected with Hepatitis C and were therefore eligible to apply to the Tribunal for compensation.

In 2010, almost 600,000 appointments were missed by patients on hospital waiting lists.  Current outpatient waiting lists do not exceed 400,000 patients.  It is clear, therefore, that the already limited capacity for the system to attend to all patients on the waiting list in a timely manner is being impacted further by these missed (and therefore wasted) appointment slots which prevents this slot being utilised by another patient still waiting for his\/her appointment.<\/p><p>I am determined to do all that is possible to minimise this waste and reduce waiting lists.

Guidelines devised by Cosc in 2011 in relation to the grant scheme aim to encourage a shift from a focus on activities only relating to the victim to an inclusion of a focus on the perpetrator and bystander whilst also ensuring that information on support services continues to be made available to victims\/survivors.<\/p><p>  The bystander approach aims to both engage individual members of society in challenging the social norms that allow sexual and domestic violence to occur and to encourage individuals to assist victims of such violence rather than isolating them. One example of this approach has been a partnership between the Union of Students of Ireland and Cosc over the last two years to increase awareness of domestic and sexual violence among students attending third level institutions. The purpose of this campaign was to make students as bystanders more aware of intimate partner violence in the college setting and to intervene where relevant. There have been three stages to date in this work: an awareness raising art work competition, distribution of colourful wristbands with a slogan and website details for more information, and the circulation of a free postcard, visually based on the winning piece from the art competition, containing information about abusive relationships and the helplines to contact.

In order to make the necessary savings it was proposed to make technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers whose farming enterprises are situated primarily in DAS areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme, which are defined in the governing EU legislation as follows: To ensure continued agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable rural community; To maintain the countryside; To maintain and promote sustainable farming systems which, in particular, take account of environmental protection measures.<\/p><p>  Processing of high volume application schemes, such as the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and the Single Payment Scheme, require significant hands-on from the management teams and a willingness and ability to focus resources on the varying priorities that arise throughout the process.  One very important element of the process is dealing with the many and varied enquiries from applicants, by telephone, letter, email or on-line.  The 2012 processing campaign is currently well advanced, with the necessary arrangements in place to deal with farmers&rsquo; queries.  The record number of applications submitted on-line in 2012 has further contributed to the smoother processing of applications.<\/p><p>  While changes were introduced in respect of the minimum stocking density requirements, specific provision was made for those farmers who had a stocking density less than 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, where that lower stocking density was as a result of adherence to a recognised agri-environmental measure.  The principles of force majeure\/exceptional circumstances were also provided for in the process. Provision was also be made for new entrants to farming.<\/p><p>  All 10,046 applicants, whose stocking density was below 0.3 livestock units per forage hectare in 2011, were written to formally and given the opportunity to apply for a derogation on the grounds that his or her participation in such an agri-environmental measure resulted in the lower stocking density.  The Department is currently working on those applicants who applied for derogation, good progress has been made to date with many already paid.  All applicants are being advised, in writing, of the success or otherwise of their application.  Those unsuccessful applicants are being afforded the opportunity of appeal to the DAS Derogation Appeals Committee.

The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery. I received over 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management. It was very clear from these documents that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed. I asked my Department to examine the proposals received and to prepare for me a number of options, which as far as practically possible, took the views of stakeholders into account while delivering proper and effective management.  <\/p><p>  On 22 December 2011, I published a draft policy document on the matter which I believed meets the objectives to the greatest extent possible. I consulted and met industry regarding the draft policy and again there was no consensus.  Having considered all views and having regard to the sustainability of the fisheries, I came to a decision which I believe provides for the proper and effective management and conservation and rational exploitation of the herring stocks. On 8 June 2012 I published a policy, based on giving access to each of the fisheries to those with recent track record in that particular fishery.  The track record involves vessels having landed a minimum of 5 tonnes of herring in 2009 or 2010 or in 3 of the 5 years during the period 2006 to 2010.  In addition, there are some very limited specified  circumstances where an earlier track record may be taken into account.<\/p><p>  These are the criteria under which future herring authorisations will be granted and I believe that these track record criteria are objective, transparent and non-discriminatory.  The only exception to track record relates to small vessels in the Dunmore area for the Celtic Sea fishery where a small scale local fishery is permitted in line with the Rebuilding\/Management Plan for the fishery. The policy also provides for a modest restricted quota for smaller vessels without a track record in both the Celtic Sea and Area VIa.<\/p><p>  The decision made was based on a clear, detailed and objective assessment of the fisheries in recent years.  This policy is intended to ensure the long term sustainability of the herring fisheries by limiting participation in the main fisheries to those vessels which have participated in the fishery, in the 5 years prior to the commencement of the review, even at a low level.  I set down this fishing boat licensing aspects of this policy in Policy Directive 1 of 2012 which I issued to the Registrar of Sea Fishing Boats on 19 September 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200073#WRY00400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":2852,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200073#WRY00450"},{"type":"question","counter":2853,"qnumday":468,"qnumall":"[41585\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200073#WRY00500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding an application under the dairy equipment grant scheme in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2854,"content":"<p>The person concerned is an applicant under the Dairy Equipment Scheme and submitted an application under the tranche which closed at end-July 2012.

Approximately 95% of children in the year before school are availing of the free pre-school provision at this time.  The ECCE programme is being maintained on a universal and free basis but a reduction of &#8364;2 per week was made to the capitation rates paid to providers from September 2012.

From September 2012, the higher subvention rate payable for full day care, under this programme, of &#8364;100 per week has been reduced by &#8364;5 to &#8364;95.

It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the care of the organisation. The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I published the Heads of the Children First Bill   in April 2012. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that organisations and professionals who work with children have a statutory responsibility to report reasonable concerns about the abuse or neglect of children in their care to the HSE Child and Family Services.<\/p><p>  I asked the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children to consider the Heads of the Children First Bill and make recommendations.  I received their comprehensive Report in July and  I thank the Committee for its work on this matter. My Department is currently considering the broad range of submissions to, and recommendations of the Joint Committee, including those submissions pertaining to the issue of childminders.<\/p><p>  Preschool services are regulated under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.   &quot;Childminder&quot; is defined in the  Regulations as &quot;a person who provides a childminding service as defined in the Regulations&quot;.  A &quot;childminding service&quot; is defined in the Regulations as &quot;a preschool service which may include an overnight service offered by a person who single-handedly takes care of preschool children, including the childminder's own children, in the childminder's home for a total of more than 2 hours per day, except where the exemptions provided in Section 58 of the Child Care Act 1991 apply.&quot;<\/p><p>  Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three preschool children from different families in the childminder&rsquo;s home.  Childminders taking care of not more than three preschool children from different families are not covered by the Regulations, recognising parental choice to place children with friends and neighbours, and the challenges of the over-regulation of the more informal arrangements chosen by parents.  As a result of this exemption it is not possible to provide a figure for the number of childminders currently providing childminding services.<\/p><p>  The National Guidelines for Childminders, compiled by the National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee which oversees the development of an integrated child care infrastructure throughout the country, provide guidance to childminders on good practice, and assist them to decide whether they are subject to the Regulations, as well as providing other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of child care services.<\/p><p>  The 2006 Regulations replaced the earlier Regulations, introduced in 1996, and made a number of improvements to the regulatory environment, including the introduction of a requirement for all staff and students working in a preschool service to have been Garda vetted.<\/p><p>  As is the case with all regulatory requirements, the Child Care Regulations set the minimum standards which services are legally required to comply with.  However, my Department is proactive in monitoring, promoting and developing the highest standards of care and education throughout the sector, including the regulatory environment, given the important role which these services play in this crucial phase of children&rsquo;s lives.<\/p><p>  My Department also has begun work on Ireland&rsquo;s first Early Years Strategy which I envisage will be a creative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland&rsquo;s Early Years sector aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to age six.   One of the issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the development of the childminding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for the under-one age group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200075#WRAA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Preschool Services","counter":2943,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200075#WRAA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":2944,"qnumday":500,"qnumall":"[41844\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100200075#WRAA00800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide an update on the expansion of the free pre-school year in early childhood care and education programme; if such an extension will begin for children at the age of two years, thus allowing them two years of pre-school learning; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1018","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2945,"content":"<p>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free preschool year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.

However, glucosamine products are available over the counter without prescriptions.<\/p><p><br \/>  Omega-3 triglyceride products (e.g. Omacor) have been identified both nationally and internationally as not being cost effective or being of lesser benefit to patients. However, these products are also available over the counter without prescriptions, as is Orlistat.<\/p><p>Gluten-free products have become more widely available in supermarkets in recent years and tend to be significantly cheaper than products sold through community pharmacies.

Persons wishing to apply for this allowance can do so by completing an application form which can be downloaded at the following link:   .  Separate application forms are available for children.

Approximately 1,000 of these women were infected with Hepatitis C and were therefore eligible to apply to the Tribunal for compensation.

In 2010, almost 600,000 appointments were missed by patients on hospital waiting lists.  Current outpatient waiting lists do not exceed 400,000 patients.  It is clear, therefore, that the already limited capacity for the system to attend to all patients on the waiting list in a timely manner is being impacted further by these missed (and therefore wasted) appointment slots which prevents this slot being utilised by another patient still waiting for his\/her appointment.<\/p><p>I am determined to do all that is possible to minimise this waste and reduce waiting lists.
