I welcome that the debate on the Social Welfare Bill 2012 is scheduled over three days.  It is important that the legislation is debated properly in this House.  The Seanad will have more time to debate the Bill than was the case in the D\u00e1il.  I hope we will have a reasoned debate and that people will listen to the arguments put forward on both sides of the House.  I look forward to putting forward our views and discussing our amendments tomorrow.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to raise an issue arising with the proposed property tax with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p> <p>Colleagues on Dublin City Council now face a bill of \u20ac3.4 million - just two weeks after passing their budget - on the basis of the property tax for which the Minister says local authorities are now liable.  Two weeks ago, Fianna F\u00e1il colleagues on Dublin City Council sought a postponement of the council budget in order to get clarification from the Minister as to who would be liable for the property tax and how it would be paid.  Dublin City Council owns 21,771 social housing units, all of which will now be liable for the tax, which will bring a bill of approximately \u20ac3.4 million.  Fingal County Council, my local authority, has 5,077 social housing units, but it is only having its budget today.  The bill for Fingal County Council will amount to approximately \u20ac1.6 million over a full year.  D\u00fan Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has approximately 4,000 social housing units and it is expected to pass its budget tomorrow.<\/p><p>Did the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, make any effort to consult the local authorities about this?  Was there any communication at all with local authority members and county and city managers?  Has his Department carried out an assessment of the number of local authority houses in each area and of the cost of the overall bill for each council?  Was there any proper examination of this or did the Minister hope people would not notice these changes?  As colleagues are aware, most local authorities will pass their budgets over the next few weeks.  It is important and the least that can be expected that locally elected members are given some idea, before they pass their budgets, for what additional bills they will be liable.<\/p><p>How can local authorities pay this tax.  They must either raise the rents of those living in local authority houses to pay these bills or they must cut services.  Last year, when the household charge was introduced - which we supported - it was supposed to fund local government, but all local authorities were hit with a cut of \u20ac1 million in September because they did not reach their targets on the collection of the household charge.  Now we have a property tax that is particularly anti-urban and anti-Dublin.  Local authorities will now be asked to pass a budget to fund local government, which it will not do, and will be hit with an additional bill.  Did the Department and the Minister consult the county and city managers on this?  Has the Department a list of the number of social housing units in each local authority and has it calculated the approximate cost of the tax for each local authority?  <\/p><p>Why did the Minister ignore the recommendation in the Thornhill report, which was not published for eight months, that social housing and the housing stock of local authorities would be exempt from the property tax.  This recommendation has been set aside.  This is not fair on people working in local authorities, particularly locally elected councillors who are expected to pass budgets without knowing the full story.  I would be grateful if the Leader could clarify this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800003#B00300","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355834100,"counter":11,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Labour Party group, I would like to express our condolences on the enormous tragedy in the United States last week, on the deaths of 20 small children and of the teachers who tried to protect them.

I am glad the Minister is able to ringfence that time for the social welfare debate.  The Bill is important and has been a cause of concern for many on all sides of the House and in the wider community.  I look forward to a robust and fair debate and hope we can reflect not just on the difficulties that have arisen with the Bill, but also look at some of its positive aspects and acknowledge the work that has been done by the Minister, Deputy Burton, and the Cabinet in order to contain and retain enormous levels of payment for the many people who require them.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the comments of the IMF overnight with regard to Ireland and what may happen next year. <\/p> <p>I acknowledge its commitment to encouraging our European partners to implement the pledges made in regard to breaking the relationship between sovereign debt and bank debt.

I ask the Leader to call the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the House for a debate.  As the months and years go by in these times of austerity, the latest issue concerns chemotherapy.  The Members present may know someone with cancer.  Can they imagine having cancer and having to pay \u20ac75 per dose of chemotherapy - not per day, but per dose?  Remember \"Prime Time\" and the lady carrying her son up the stairs.  Remember the number of times I have asked whether we can ring-fence a couple of million euro as a budget for paediatric home care.  Remember the child in Celbridge who has Down's syndrome and who is down to a day and a half a week.<\/p><p>I remind the House of the recent scandal in Uganda in which \u20ac4 million went missing.  It went into somebody's bank account and it has been proven this was fraudulent.  We gave Uganda \u20ac33 million in 2010 and, in the same year, the Ugandan Government spent $740 million on six very smart fighter jets - I cannot even pronounce their name, but they are some type of nuclear fighter jet.  That $740 million was spent on fighter jets while Irish Aid gave \u20ac33 million to the Ugandan Government, of which at least \u20ac4 million was used fraudulently.<\/p><p>Let us go back to Bertie Ahern and our reputational interest.  He was right in those times of rich and plenty to put Ireland up on the world stage and he was right to think of our reputational interest.  Today, however, we have to think of our citizens.  Each and every Senator is meeting people month by month, week by week, who are in need and desperation, people who are about to default on their mortgages, with all of the emotional and financial stress they must suffer.  We plan to spend \u20ac624 million on foreign aid in 2013, which represents 0.53% of GDP.  Perhaps we could begin to think of shaving this down to 0.5% in 2013 and forget the 0.03%, which would save approximately \u20ac24 million.  I will let Members put that \u20ac24 million in their pockets for the next three days and imagine what they might do with it.  Ten years ago, Africa received seven times the amount that was given to Europe under the Marshall Plan following the Second World War.  To go back to my 0.5% idea, those Members who are interested in our standing in the United Nations and in our reputational interest will be interested to know that we are still perhaps the ninth or tenth per capita charity giver of foreign aid in the world.  As a matter of urgency, will the Leader grant us a debate on foreign aid in the new year?  Can we make plans for the next five years until we get our own country ship-shape?  Charity begins at home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800005#D00200","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1355834400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Following on from Senator O'Brien, I ask that we might take, on Thursday perhaps, a half-hour debate to pass No. 12, which concerns violence in the Congo.  It will cost us nothing but will give support to those brave people, including Irish people, who are working there to prevent this kind of violence.  I will reserve my comments on the Social Welfare Bill for the debate later today.<\/p> <p> I am glad Senator O'Keeffe raised the issue of the killings at Sandy Hook, which were appalling.  It highlights the problem of violence, which is not confined to the United States of America.  Many years ago, Professor Skinner demonstrated how when the population of rats increases beyond a certain level, violence breaks out endemically.  The same is true of humans.  We are seeing this type of mass turning on innocent victims all over the world, including in China.  It has been said that gun culture in America is a problem.  I do not understand how a gun can be connected to culture.  It is not connected to my understanding of culture.  It is a culture of death.  Americans are a frontier people and go back to that all the time but they should properly confront their history.  Their country was founded upon the massacre of the indigenous people.  A gun, the Winchester rifle, played a crucial part in that.  That needs to be looked at.  <\/p><p>One can see the impact of the removal of the human element from the equation.  For example, the drone mentality under President Obama which links into video games.  I never thought that 20 years after I opposed censorship of videos in this House I would again be speaking of the need for debate on the desensitisation that occurs when children are exposed to games in which they are rewarded for inflicting violence and obliterating people.  I was horrified to hear Mr. Henry McKean say on &quot;Newstalk&quot; that the most popular games among children of a school in my area which he visited were the most violent ones and others in which people are hurt.  Children are innocent.  They say these things honestly.  We need to honestly confront this problem.  People must first be dehumanised before they can kill.  We heard recently that civilians in the North of Ireland had been declared to be legitimate targets.  We also heard through the media that a nurse in London had taken her life because she was declared fair game.  I do not blame the two hosts of the Australian station because they are part of a system and were also desensitised.  Behind this lies the idea that people can be stripped of their humanity and have violence inflicted upon them.  This can be done through the media or with drones.  <\/p><p>The issue of rendition was raised in this House a number of years ago by a number of Senators, including the then Leader.  Various sources denied this was happening.  I draw their attention to the case last week in which Sami al Saadi was awarded \u20ac2.2 million.  He was kidnapped and tortured in the most brutal fashion, with the assistance of the British.  His wife and family were also kidnapped.  Sir Mark Allen who was responsible at the British end sent a telegram to his Libyan counterpart congratulating him on not paying for the air cargo.  That is the way the wife and children of Mr. al Saadi were described by Sir Mark Allen, an arch hypocrite who blogs as a Christian.  We need to confront the problem of violence and not only in the context of America, although tragically America is ahead of the rest of us in this matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800005#D00300","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355834700,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I rise today to raise the issue of the price women pay for motherhood.  An OECD report published this week indicates that the gender gap in Ireland widens as women have children.  Irish women begin to earn less than men after they have children.  I am speaking not about equality between men and women but about the earning potential of women after they have children.  The OECD report also indicates that men in Ireland work 344 minutes per day in paid work and 129 minutes per day in unpaid work, which amounts to 473 minutes work per day, while on the other hand women in Ireland work 197 minutes in paid work and 296 minutes in unpaid work, which amounts to 493 minutes work per day, which is more than the number of minutes worked by men yet the earning potential of women is reduced when they have children.  There is a need for a wide-ranging debate not only on closing the gender gap and women in the workforce but on women and men in child care, paternity and maternity leave and the ambience of why this is happening and not only in Ireland.  It must be a central strategy of every government to create more sustainable economies and inclusive societies.<\/p> <p>That applies to every society in the world.  The world's population is aging and this challenge can only be mastered if all of the talent available is utilised.  I call for a debate on this issue, given that we are due to debate the Social Welfare Bill today and especially whether the cut to child benefit is fair or unfair and whether the payment should be universal or otherwise.  I would like the issue of childcare to be debated separately in the Seanad.

They pay enormous rates; they are the only ones who have been paying water charges during the years; business is not great and now it seems they will have to pay property charges for those living in local authority housing.

If he or she stays in hospital for a period of up to ten days, he or she pays \u20ac75 each day.  After ten days, even if a person has to stay in hospital for an entire year and does not have a medical card, there is no further charge.  I refer to outpatient services.

For repeat visits in respect of the same illness the person concerned should not have to pay a further \u20ac75.  This is an underhand charge introduced by the HSE.

When one is aware of how close people one knows are to where that tragedy occurred, it acutely brings home the terrible tragedy that unfolded.  <\/p><p>I would like to second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Cullinane that more time be allocated for the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.   <\/p><p>I primarily wish to raise a matter we dealt with in the Seanad Public Consultation Committee last March in our report on older people.   A demand was made by many organisations such as Older and Bolder to rectify the problem regarding habitual residency clause to provide for a person who comes home to care for a loved one.  A few such instances were raised with me in my constituency.  Such a case was highlighted today on &quot;Today with Pat Kenny&quot; by Councillor Bell, a Labour Party councillor from County Louth, which involves a woman who returned from England, having given up her job, to care for her sick mother who was waiting for a liver transplant.  I ask the Leader and the Labour Party members to put pressure on the Minister to have this anomaly moved off the stage.  It is causing hardship and pain and it was an unintended consequence of legislation that was introduced to stop the trafficking of people to this country from eastern Europe and other places to avail of our generous social welfare benefits.  I know the Minister concerned will be in the House this week and I ask if this anomaly can be rectified.  That lady in County Louth and other people with similar cases, which are replicated throughout the country, do not deserve to be excluded because of the tight provisions of the legislation.  An amendment to the legislation would be appropriate to make sure that genuine cases are not damned, so to speak, by legislation that was never intended to adversely affect them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800009#H00100","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1355836200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I welcome the news announced by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, yesterday that a grant scheme will be provided for people who want to upgrade their septic tank.

At a time when those in other countries were saying: \"look at what is happening in Europe, we do not have confidence in any of those countries\", he said that his company was going to take an investment decision.  That company invested \u20ac8.5 billion in Irish bonds at a time when the Irish rates were way over the top and he has made a great deal of money on his investment and for his company's pension funds.   The reason I mention that investment is that we in Ireland need to have that sort of confidence in ourselves.  I find that too often too many of us say we will save rather than invest or start a new business.  Our savings are now very high, much higher than they have been for many years.<\/p> <p>The reason is that many people are saying they do not have confidence.  If we could only instil in Irish entrepreneurs confidence to invest in the country, we could demonstrate the same success with our investment as Mr. Hasenstab has demonstrated with his.<\/p><p>I can understand the feelings of Senator Mary Ann O'Brien on foreign aid.  Senator Mullins put very well his point that Ireland is one of the wealthiest nations in the world and that there are people starving and dying elsewhere.  We have an onus to look back at what happened in Ireland during the Famine days, during which we criticised others because they did not help us.  Those people in Africa who are starving and dying from hunger will have every right to look back on us in some years and label us a wealthy country that decided to reduce its investment in foreign aid.  We must continue to invest and we have a responsibility to do so.  The people in Africa deserve this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800009#H00300","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355836800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Let me continue on the subject of foreign aid.

Consequently, we are doing a little bit through foreign aid to correct the imbalance and help the natives of African countries to help themselves.  We really need to be careful.

It was awful for the Department to write to affected individuals about the earnings disregard and other changes only a week before Christmas, although these changes were flagged by the Government in its budget last year.

On the issue of health care, Health in Ireland: Key Trends in 2012 shows the changes which have occurred.  We speak negatively in respect of the health care system here but we need to look at the positive aspects.  There has been a 36% reduction in the number of deaths as a result of heart attacks, stroke and certain diseases and an 8% reduction in the number of deaths from cancer while at the same time the health service has continued to grow in terms of providing services.  For example, the number of day procedures has increased from around 350,000 per year to more than 880,000 per year, a 149% increase.  Also the number of outpatient visits to hospitals has increased from 2,185,000 to more than 3,583,000 per year, a 64% increase in outpatient appointments in a 12 month period.  While there has been ongoing criticism of the health service and the services provided these changes have occurred.  In the debate we need to look at the positive elements.  I accept we must continue to improve the service but let us not forget the progress made.  In regard to foreign aid, I have visited a number of countries and has been in hospitals where the basic essentials are not available, such as electricity and water supply, and where HIV is running at 40%.  In one country that I visited there were 700,000 children under the age of 12 where both parents had died as a result of HIV; that is the difference between what we are dealing with in our health service and what those countries are dealing with in their health service or lack of health service.

Therefore, under the Council decision, there is an obligation to accept a request for the initiation of criminal investigations.  However, we must also look at section 7 which sets out the actions to be taken following a request from Europol to initiate an investigation.  Paragraph (1)(b) provides that the competent authority, that is, the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na or the relevant office of the Revenue Commissioners, shall decide whether to comply with the request.

Amnesty International has found that almost every state in the EU has been guilty of human rights abuses, including abuses on the part of their police services.  The amendment seeks to enshrine human rights standards to strengthen the Bill.  It is perfectly reasonable that this should be a consideration when we are weighing up whether to provide information to Europol or to refuse to do so.  All legislation should be human rights proofed, particularly where it relates to justice and due process.  Clearly it should be a legitimate consideration.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 4 is a related point.  All our legislation should be human rights proofed, particularly when we are considering how justice information is being used.  Therefore, we need to ensure that both the processes used in the unit and by liaison officers are human rights proofed and that liaison officers are well trained in this regard and will be well informed as to the dangers of mishandling information or how human rights can be put at risk by failing to abide by due process.

In the budget, my Department's two priorities were to ensure those in most need of assistance would be protected and that we do as much as we can to help people to get ready to return to work.<\/p><p>Since I became Minister for Social Protection, I have been very conscious of how crucial welfare expenditure has been in protecting the very vulnerable and minimising poverty during a time of enormous economic crisis.  The remarkable poverty-reduction impact of welfare has greatly underpinned social cohesion.  This is in contrast with other countries affected by the economic crisis where the consequences of increased poverty are sometimes played out violently on the streets.  Social cohesion is a reason certain investors in sovereign bonds have backed the Irish economic recovery.  As a consequence of social transfers in Ireland, the at-risk-of-poverty rate has been reduced by 31%.  This is one of the highest reductions among all EU member states.<\/p><p>Welfare ought to be both a safety net and a springboard to a better future.  That is why I am attempting to transform the Department of Social Protection through our Pathways to Work plan from being a mere provider of income support to an effective and engaged public employment service that assists people on the live register or otherwise far from the labour market to start their progression back to work, training or a job placement.  We will be providing 10,000 new places on employment schemes next year and opening many new Intreo offices.<\/p><p>We will be providing more than 6,000 additional child care places for people transferring from welfare to work, with particular emphasis on after-school care.  Senators will recall our discussions this time last year, particularly on lone parents, in which we stated we wanted more opportunities for people in education, training, community employment, etc.  We stated we wanted to improve child care provision and discussed specifically the question of after-school care.  I am very pleased we are making a breakthrough in regard to this provision this year.<\/p><p>In moving from a passive to an active social welfare system, we are transforming a system that has been mismanaged and neglected over many years by Fianna F\u00e1il Governments.  Recent ESRI research on jobless households highlighted the utter failure of previous Governments to introduce any meaningful reforms to the social welfare system to encourage work specifically.  Jobless households are homes where unemployment, illness, disability or age mean that adults spend less than one fifth of the available time in employment.  The ESRI examined working-age adults and their dependent children and found that the percentage of jobless households grew from 16% in 2007 to 22% in 2010.  As such, in 2010, more than one in five people was living in a household without a working adult.  For children, the findings are even more damning and alarming.  In 2010, nearly a quarter of children were growing up in jobless households.<\/p> <p> In 2010 nearly one quarter of children were growing up in jobless households and the most damning finding of all is the astonishing fact that between 2004 and 2007, at the height of the boom, the share of households defined as jobless recorded a double-digit increase to reach 15% of the total.  The average across the eurozone in 2007 was just below 10%.  It is important to recall, and people will remember this, that the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and the then Minister and T\u00e1naiste, Mary Harney, travelled to jobs fairs around the world inviting people to come to Ireland.  The problem was they did not travel down to the local social welfare office to invite people on the live register to get back to work in Ireland.  That is part of our difficulty having built up this extraordinary level, by all European standards, of a 22% jobless household rate.  Allied to that is a figure that no other European country has, namely, 16% of our working age adult population are either on some kind of illness benefit, disability benefit or invalidity pension.  No other country in Europe has statistics like that, again raising the most profound questions about the way our social welfare system works to help people who unfortunately have become unemployed back to work.<\/p><p>During the 2004-07 economic boom Ireland was one of the few countries in the EU to experience an increase in the proportion of jobless households.  This occurred despite Ireland recording the highest rate of employment growth in the EU over the previous decade.  At the same time the tendency of jobless households to be in poverty was reduced due to the very significant increases in welfare rates.  The official data shows that in 2010, the last year for which figures are yet available, social transfers reduced income poverty by 60%, from 40% to 16%, as the full effects of the crisis were unleashed.  Furthermore, if pensions are included the impact on poverty reduction rose to 68%.  In simple terms, while the welfare system in other EU countries had a modest impact in reducing poverty, the Irish system's positive contribution to poverty reduction is an outlier.  <\/p><p>The reality is entirely at variance with the opinions expressed by some other well-informed commentators.  However, while the social welfare system has proven highly effective at preserving a threshold of decency for those most in need of support, it has largely failed to date in helping them into work or training to improve their prospects for the future.  Instead of introducing the kind of reforms that were brought into other European countries to change from a passive to an active social welfare state, including job search assistance, education, training and skill development and services like child care, the former Government had little ambition for the unemployed and its only solution in many cases was to write a cheque.  The fact is that until very recently the State was prepared to tolerate a large minority of our citizens being consigned to a life on the margins and inter-generational disadvantage underwritten by welfare payments.<\/p><p>This Government is challenging the way things have been done in social welfare in this State.  We have greater ambition for those citizens who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed.  From everything I know about the reforms we have undertaken in the past year people are delighted to be offered an opportunity, whether interning through JobBridge or participating in helping their own community in a local community employment or T\u00fas scheme.  People are so anxious to have an opportunity to contribute and, ultimately, to make themselves and their families financially self-independent.<\/p><p>We view each and every individual person on the live register or otherwise distant from the labour market as an untapped resource and a future employee who will participate in the rebuilding of this country and its economic recovery.<\/p> <p>We view it as the mission and patriotic duty of everybody who works for the State to work together to transform the system for people who are in jobless households, locked out of working and simply find it impossible to get back into the stream of work, education and training to become financially independent.  That ambition is the reason we are moving from a passive to an active social welfare state.  The Government is asking the hard questions about our system of social welfare.  Other countries have moved on.  For example, the Dutch went from being called &quot;the sick men of Europe&quot; to the Dutch miracle by questioning the basic assumptions underpinning their social welfare system.  Until the Government took office, we have never had that debate or made the fundamental decision to transform the social welfare system.  By not doing so, successive Governments essentially collaborated in the destruction of human potential and the locking in of generations of disadvantaged and wasted lives.  The Government will not tolerate that situation any longer.  We will work every day to transform the social welfare system, not as an end in itself but because doing so will transform the lives of those living and growing up in jobless households.  It should not simply be seen as social welfare expenditure but as an investment in the people and communities and their capacity to be offered opportunities in a positive way by the State.  In that regard, there will be no cuts to the core weekly payment rates and we will provide 10,000 new places in employment schemes next year and open many new<b><\/b>Intreo<b><\/b>offices to get people back on a pathway to education, training, work experience and employment.<\/p><p> The Bill defers the date on which age reductions in respect of the one parent family payment are to apply from the beginning of January 2013 and 2014 to the beginning of July in each of these years.  It will also extend the period over which the transitional arrangements for the continued payment of one parent family payment are to apply from the end of December 2014 to the beginning of July 2015.  This is to provide more time for the creation of the additional child care places to which I have referred, as I promised last year in response to contributions to the debate on last year's Social Welfare Bill in this House and elsewhere.  We had much expert commentary from Senators on all sides who acknowledged the importance of giving people who were parenting on their own an opportunity in life.  The pieces are now in place.  <\/p><p> Social welfare offices are being transformed not simply into payment offices but offices that help people in seeking education and training and findindg work.  We have extra child care places, particularly after school care places which will be available in the next six months in conjunction with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  We also have an additional 10,000 places in the community employment, JobBridge and T\u00fas schemes, as well as in a new scheme specifically for local authorities called the local authority social employment scheme.  I wish the private sector was able to provide more jobs, but clearly there is a time lag between economic recovery and the private sector being in a position to provide more employment opportunities.  <\/p><p> These are positive achievements.  I recognise, however, that the budget also contains measures that give rise to concern.  I avail of the opportunity afforded by the debate in this House to outline the reason the Government have taken these measures and to reflect on how we can best best with the very difficult situation in which the State finds itself.  None of us wants to cut social welfare payments for its own sake.  Howeveer, securing the long-term viability of the social protection system is a vital goal that services the interests of a society as a whole, not only those who directly benefit from social welfare payments.<\/p> <p>How can we best secure the long-term viability of the social protection system?  One aspect that we must recognise is that the amount we can spend is limited by the amount available to us.  We cannot bury our heads in the sand about this.  As Members are aware, the State has been spending far in excess of its revenue for several years and cannot continue to do so indefinitely.  I note all the parties in this House in their pre-budget submissions actually accepted the requirements to reduce expenditure and make savings.<\/p><p>Much progress has been made in reducing the general government deficit with most of the fiscal consolidation required to deal with that problem implemented.  However, in 2012 the deficit will still be over \u20ac13 billion, equivalent to more than 8% of gross domestic product, GDP.  The deficit has to be reduced further if we are to retain any say over our affairs and, ultimately, regain our capacity to determine our own economic and social development.  In that regard, the Government is committed to reducing the deficit to 7.5% of GDP in 2013, 5% of GDP in 2014, before reducing the deficit below 3% in 2015, so that we stabilise and then reduce the stock of debt.  This budget is a vital part of this.<\/p><p>Discussions are continuing on the promissory notes and other aspects of the banking debts imposed on the State.  I am confident a positive outcome will be achieved that will contribute to achieving these aims and reduce the burden on the taxpayer.  While almost 30% of gross government debt relates directly to support to the banking sector, no matter what outcome the Government achieves in this area, even it were to achieve the entire elimination of all banking debt and the associated interest payments, there would still be a current deficit.  Accordingly, it would still be necessary to reduce that deficit.  This is the context within which the Government has had to structure the 2013 budget.  Tax and other revenues had to be increased while, at the same time, expenditure had to be reduced.<\/p><p>I hear fairy stories from those who have met the troika claiming it says we can reduce expenditure any way we fancy.  That is not the way the troika operates.  Anyone who has dealt with the IMF in any country will know it is made up of a balance in both tax increases and expenditure reduction.  Perhaps we should all go to meet the troika together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800027#HH00300","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355843700,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I would love to go with the Minister the next time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800030#LL00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1355843700,"counter":172,"content":"<p>With the full agreement of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800030#LL00300","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1355843700,"counter":173,"content":"<p>The Minister without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800030#LL00400","speaker":"1152"},{"type":"speech","time":1355843700,"counter":174,"content":"<p>We will see what happens in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800030#LL00500","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1355843700,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Here we go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800030#LL00600","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1355843700,"counter":176,"content":"<p>The Minister should stop raising this comparison.

In last year's budget the Government announced that a further reduction of \u20ac540 million in expenditure by the Department of Social Protection would be implemented in 2013.  When the previous Government left office, the national programme for recovery projected approximately \u20ac800 million in cuts for this year.

Weekly payments have not been cut across the board.  The previous Government cut all main payments by a cumulative \u20ac16.50 per week.  If a household included somebody on carer's benefit and someone else on disability benefits, the cumulative cut was \u20ac33 per week.  It is essential that people can continue to rely on their basic weekly payments in order to have a sense of security about their incomes.  Weekly payments will be maintained for pensioners and all those under the age of 66, such as people on disability allowance and jobseeker's allowance, with the result that expenditure on social protection will once again be more than \u20ac20 billion in 2013.  This demonstrates the high priority the Government continues to give to social protection during these difficult times.  Social protection expenditure will account for approximately 37% of all Government expenditure.<\/p><p>I understand the concerns of those affected by the measures contained in the Bill, particularly in respect of cuts to child benefit and respite care grants.  I will deal with each of these payments in turn.<\/p><p>Child benefit is a universal payment to mothers at all income levels.  I am determined that any future reform of child benefit will preserve the principle of universality.  It is worth bearing this in mind given that from next January the United Kingdom intends to reduce or discontinue child benefit payments to households in which at least one person earns more than \u20ac62,000.  This change will cost families with three children and at least one parent earning more than \u20ac74,000 approximately \u20ac3,000 per annum, which is the equivalent of a pay cut of \u20ac5,000.  I intend to publish the report on family and child income supports by the advisory group on tax and social welfare reform in the new year.  I will then bring it to the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection for a full and informed public debate on the options available for the future structure of child benefit, with specific regard to taxing, means testing and other structural reforms such as supplementary child benefit payments.  I would be happy to discuss the report in this House if I am invited to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800031#MM00300","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1355844000,"counter":194,"content":"<p>The Minister is invited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800031#MM00400","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1355844000,"counter":195,"content":"<p>In the meantime, despite the budget reductions, our child benefit rates remain high by international comparisons.  We are still above the rate that prevails in the United Kingdom and the North, where the payment for the first child is \u20ac110 per month and the rate for second and subsequent children decreases to approximately \u20ac72 per month.<\/p><p>The respite care grant will decrease from \u20ac1,700 to \u20ac1,375 per annum.  This means the rate will still be higher than the \u20ac1,200 per annum which applied in 2006, when the construction bubble was at its peak.<\/p> <p>I am conscious that this represents a cut for carers.  However, to allow us to protect the core weekly payments that people receive, such as pensions, disability and carer's allowance, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments, such as the respite care grant.  Carers receive significant income supports, among the highest rate of income support in Europe.  Carers who live with the person for whom they care also receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits and the annual respite care grant in respect of each person for whom they care.  If a person gets certain qualifying social welfare payments and also provides full-time care and attention to another person, that person can keep the main social welfare payment and get the half-rate carer's allowance as well.  That carer can also receive an extra half-rate carer's allowance if he or she cares for more than one person.  Organisations representing carers made very strong representations to me at the pre-budget forum and elsewhere in regard to keeping those weekly payments intact.<\/p><p>The income disregard and means test for carers is the most liberal within our social welfare system.  A couple under 66 with two children, earning a joint annual income of up to \u20ac35,400, can qualify for maximum payment of carer's allowance, while such a couple earning up to \u20ac59,300 will still qualify for the minimum rate.  This year we will spend \u20ac771 million on payments to carers, an increase of almost \u20ac20 million over expenditure in 2011.  Even after the cut in the respite care grant, expenditure in 2013 will be higher again, at \u20ac775 million.  I expect the outgoing will be even higher, because of the enormous increase in the number of people applying for both the carer's allowance and the half-rate carer's allowance.<\/p><p>The value of the respite care grant has almost tripled in the past ten years, from \u20ac635 in 2002 to \u20ac1,700 in 2012.  While it is being cut next year, a grant of \u20ac1,375 is still a substantial sum.  The work of carers is recognised and valued by the Government as well as by those who receive that care.  The great work that carers do, often 24 hours a day, all year around, is testament to the deep level of commitment and love that carers have, which allows people to be cared for in their own homes.  The cutting of the respite care grant while the weekly carer's and domiciliary care allowance payment rates are maintained is not being done to devalue the work that carers do.  The fact that the Department will spend an increased amount in 2013, \u20ac775 million, to support carers and caring shows the status that is given to the work that carers do.<\/p><p>Since coming to office, tackling fraud and improving control have been priorities for me.  I am now introducing measures to enable the Department to recover overpayments quicker than previously.  Currently, repayments are frequently made at a level of \u20ac2 per week, which means that some overpayments take years to repay, if indeed they are ever repaid.  As well as providing savings, this measure will send a strong message that there is an obligation to return money owing to the Exchequer.  There is an obligation on the citizen as well as the Department to ensure that only entitlements due are received and what is not due is returned for the benefit of others.<\/p><p>The Bill provides that up to 15% of the individual personal rate can be withheld to repay an overpayment.  I am conscious that some overpayments arise because of departmental error.  While all overpayments must be repaid, including those that arise because of the departmental error, it is not my intention that people will face hardship as a result of these new arrangements.<\/p> <p>The circumstances of each case will be considered before the repayment amount is determined.  It is galling for people who are receiving their legitimate social welfare entitlements and no more to find that in the case of somebody living in the same area who has perhaps been involved in abuse of the social welfare system and owes money to the Department, it can only be recovered at a rate of \u20ac2 per week.  This measure will allow the rate of recovery to be at a figure up to \u20ac26 per week in regard to the main individual payment of the person responsible.  It does not affect their dependants' or their children's payments.<\/p><p>The household budgeting facility, whereby a person can opt to have a specified amount of his or her social welfare payment deducted by An Post and paid to certain utilities and local authorities, will be extended by introducing new provisions specific to the payment of rent to a housing body.  Tenants in local authority accommodation who are in receipt of a social welfare payment may opt to have a portion of their social welfare payment paid to a local authority against their rent.  Local authorities will require tenants in local authority accommodation who are in receipt of social welfare payments to sign up to the household budgeting facility before being offered accommodation.  Tenants will require the consent of the housing body before being allowed to withdraw from the arrangement and such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.<\/p><p>I will now turn to the main headings in the Bill.  Part 1 contains preliminary and general provisions in two sections.  Section 1 contains the Short Title, while section 2 provides for the definition of common terms used throughout the Bill.<\/p><p>Part 2 contains amendments to the Social Welfare Acts.  Sections 3, 4 and 9 provide for a number of amendments to the contributory pension schemes arising from the budget 2012 decision to provide for a new structure in respect of the reduced rates of State pension - contributory - and State pension - transition.  Section 3 amends the definitions of \u2018\u2018yearly average\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018alternative yearly average\u2019\u2019 for the purposes of rounding up or down.  Section 9 amends the provisions relating to the payment of reduced rates of State pension - transition - so as to enable the increases payable in respect of a qualified adult, as well as the personal rates, to be paid at reduced rates where a person has a reduced yearly average.  This change will apply to people who reach 65 years of age on or after 1 January 2013.  The section also provides that existing claimants will not be affected.<\/p><p>Section 5 reduces the amount of the annual respite care grant by \u20ac325 from \u20ac1,700 to \u20ac1,375.  Section 6 provides for the abolition of the weekly PRSI-free allowance of \u20ac127 with effect from 1 January 2013.  Section 7 increases the rate of assessment of self-employment income from farming and fishing from 85% to 100% in the case of the farm assist, jobseeker's allowance, pre-retirement allowance and disability allowance schemes.  In addition, it provides for the abolition of the annual child-related income disregards in respect of qualified children.  Effectively, it puts people living in rural areas on the same footing and the same level of assessment as people living in urban areas.<\/p><p>Section 8 reduces the monthly rate of child benefit by \u20ac10 per child in respect of the first, second and third child.  From January 2013, the monthly rate for each of the first three children will be \u20ac130.  The section also provides for a reduction in the monthly rate of child benefit by \u20ac10 per child, to \u20ac130, in respect of the fourth and each subsequent child from January 2014.<\/p> <p> Section 10 provides for an increase in the minimum rates of the pay related social insurance, PRSI, contribution payable by self employed contributors with effect from 1 January 2013.  Self employed contributors with reckonable income over \u20ac5,000 generally pay class S PRSI contributions at a rate of 4%, subject to a minimum payment.  The current minimum payment is \u20ac253.  This is being increased to \u20ac500 with effect from 1 January 2013.  Section 11 provides for an increase in the rates of voluntary contributions payable by former self employed persons and former employed contributors in line with the increase in the minimum self employment contribution from \u20ac253 to \u20ac500.<\/p><p>Section 12 reduces the duration of jobseeker's benefit entitlement from 12 to 9 months in the case of people who have paid at least 260 PRSI contributions and from 9 to 6 months in the case of people who have paid less than 260 contributions with effect from 3 April 2013.  This change will apply to new claimants and to certain existing recipients.  However, a person who has paid 260 PRSI contributions and has been in receipt of jobseeker's benefit for at least six months on 3 April 2013 will continue to be entitled to that benefit for a maximum duration of 12 months.  A person who has paid less than 260 PRSI contributions and has been in receipt of jobseeker's benefit for at least three months on 3 April 2013 will continue to be entitled to that benefit for a maximum duration of nine months.  <\/p><p>Section 13 makes changes in the recovery of social welfare overpayments by way of weekly deductions from a person's ongoing social welfare entitlements.  A deduction of an amount of up to 15% of the liable person's relevant personal individual weekly rate of social welfare payment is allowed for the purpose of recovering an overpayment.  A person will not be entitled to compensate for any overpayment deduction from their primary social welfare payment by seeking an additional payment of supplementary welfare allowance.  Increases payable in respect of a dependent adult or child-children are not affected.  <\/p><p>Section 14 provides for the postponement of the implementation dates of changes in respect of the one parent family payment.  The dates on which the age reductions from 12 to 7 years for entitlement purposes to apply from the beginning of January 2013 and 2014 are being extended to the beginning of July in each of those years.  The period during which the transitional arrangements are to apply are also being extended from end December 2014 to the beginning of July 2015.  <\/p><p>Section 15 provides for the extension of the household budgeting scheme for local authority rents by the introduction of new provisions specific to the payment of rents to a housing body.<\/p><p>Sections 16 and 17 provide for amendments to entitlement to jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance in respect of Sunday working.  Sundays will now be taken into account for the purposes of determining entitlement to jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance. <\/p><p>Part 3 of the Bill contains amendments to redundancy payment schemes set out in the Redundancy Payments Act 1967.  Section 18 amends the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 by abolishing the rebates paid to employers in respect of statutory redundancy lump sums paid to their employees.  This will apply in the case of statutory redundancy lump sum payments made to employees who are made redundant on or after 1 January 2013.  Rebates will be available to employers on or after 1 January 2013 in respect of statutory redundancy lump sum payments made to employees who were made redundant before 1 January 2012, at a rate of 60% and on or after 1 January 2012 but before 1 January 2013, at a rate of 15%.  <\/p><p>That completes the main provisions of the Bill.  Some of the savings achieved by these measures are being redirected to provide additional spending in the key area of job and child care supports.  An additional \u20ac14 million will be allocated for after-school child care places, targeted at primary school children.<\/p> <p>The places are aimed at low-income families where the parents are availing of an employment opportunity.  This initiative is part of the Government's overall strategy to support parents in low-income families to take up employment.  It formed a great part of our discussions in the Seanad last year.<\/p><p>An additional \u20ac2 million will be allocated to expand the school meals programme which aims to provide food to children, in particular hot breakfasts, which are available in a number of schools and assist children enormously.  A sum of \u20ac2.5 million will be allocated to a new area-based approach to child poverty initiative.  This will be handled in detail by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, under the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  It is about getting all the different services relating to children to join together to offer an integrated service.  We have had this approach before, in particular with the Young Ballymun initiative, and also in Tallaght and Darndale.  Instead of having perhaps 14 agencies interacting with certain families and children, there will be a unified approach to the provision of supports for children in families which require them. <\/p><p>I am using some \u20ac11 million of the savings from the jobseeker's measure to make a major expansion of our employment and internship programmes.  An additional 2,500 places for JobBridge internships are being provided in 2013, and an additional 2,500 places are being made available for T\u00fas in 2013.  The community employment scheme is to benefit from an additional 2,000 places in 2013.  I recall the fears of some of the Members of the House last year who suggested that community employment was under threat of disappearance.  I am glad to say that following the review we are expanding community employment.  Many CE schemes also avail of T\u00fas schemes.  On the ground, therefore, this will be a significant and important support to communities, not only in rural areas where we have many such schemes but also in many urban areas.  The additional places on employment and internship schemes complement the child care measures I referred to earlier.  Overall, therefore, expenditure on working age employment supports has been increased, from \u20ac95 million last year to \u20ac1.5 billion in 2013.<\/p><p>Since I became Minister for Social Protection, I have become very conscious of how crucial welfare expenditure has been in protecting people who are vulnerable and how it minimises poverty during the economic crisis.  I am also conscious of how much a stimulus it is to the economy in many different parts of the country, particularly in more rural counties where, together with State employment, social welfare transfers and payments are the mainstay of the income going to retail businesses.  For that reason, I have been happy to be able to protect the core weekly social welfare payments.  However, the finances of the country do not permit us not to reform social welfare.  We have to bring our expenditures and revenues broadly into balance over a period of time.  As we do that we can see - as we have already seen this year - that we can return to markets on a phased basis.  I recall, as Senators may, too, that this time last year the topic of discussion at Christmas time was whether one should keep one's money in Irish banks.  Do Senators remember people talking in that vein?  Some were talking about putting their money into Switzerland or bringing it over to the United States or to the United Kingdom.  That was one of the topics of conversation at the time.  Given all the reform that has taken place we have now come away from that danger.<\/p> <p>At this time last year State companies were not in a position to borrow as a result of the sovereign debt risk but recently they have been able to return to the markets in a limited way.<\/p><p>While these advances are limited in nature, they are extremely important in ensuring that the State will return to a position of financial stability.  Senators will be aware that in November, for the first time since 2005, there was a small increase in employment.  This increase was only in the region of 3,500 but it is vital nonetheless.  Senators will also be aware that figures released earlier today show an actual, if fractional, increase in domestic demand.

I will merely ask her one question.  If a member of a party other than hers had introduced a Social Welfare Bill such as this two years ago, what would the Minister have said about it?<\/p> <p>Would she have welcomed the taking of 20% off the respite care grant?  Would she have said that is turning a passive system into an active one?  I do not believe she would have.  I acknowledge the Minister's job is tough and that in this respect she will not make everyone happy.  The Seanad has a role to play, particularly today and this week.  If the Seanad is to be the Chamber it is supposed to be, it should be one where we can properly review legislation and if we believe there are areas of the legislation that the D\u00e1il has got wrong, and I firmly believe there are at least two such areas, Senators should not be afraid to vote down this Bill and send it back to the D\u00e1il.  Senators should not walk people up to the top of the hill and pronounce, with disgust and disappointment, on measures the Government is taking and not follow through on those actions, but that will be a discussion for tomorrow and Thursday.  From our perspective, we will be opposing every single part of the Bill.  We put forward clear alternatives and there are difficult decisions to be made.  <\/p><p>I want to ask the Minister about the 75,000 families who receive the respite care grant.  She mentioned core weekly payments being protected.  They are protected if the Minister has defined what is a core payment but she has not defined that pre-budget or up to now what it is.  A core payment for a family in Dublin or elsewhere in this country, whose members are doing their best to survive, is their monthly child benefit rate.  Since Deputy Burton took over as Minister for Social Protection a family with three children is \u20ac684 worse off than when she took office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800036#RR00800","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355846100,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Why?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800037#SS00200","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1355846100,"counter":210,"content":"<p>That is a core payment in my view but the Minister does not believe it is.  A respite care grant is a core payment, particularly for the 5,000 families who receive the respite care grant and get no further assistance from the State.<\/p><p>If we are to talk about finance, the economy and the banks, about which the Minister spoke at length in her contribution, I would point out that she did not mention the financial contribution carers make to this State.  They provide 990,000 hours of care per week.  If the HSE was to provide that care, it would cost approximately \u20ac4 billion a year, yet \u20ac325 is being taken from people who need this money.  I do not understand why this is being done.  If we are to talk on the premise of fairness, equality and protecting the most vulnerable, this is not the way to do it.  I think we would all believe that the child benefit system should be reformed.  Those who do not need it should not get it.  <\/p><p>The Minister did not mention in her speech that there are inventive ways to do things.  She did not mention the introduction of the free preschool year, which is another initiative I would stand over every single day of the week.  Every child on reaching the age of three years and three months is entitled to a proper preschool Montessori year before beginning national school.  Why was there no inventiveness in the budget?  Rather than that all recipients' of child benefit payment will be reduced to \u20ac130 a month.  The current Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, when in opposition, famously asked the then Minister, Deputy Lenihan, God rest him, a few years ago what he had got against the third child.  That got a great laugh from those on the Minister's benches at the time, and rightly so because it was a good quip.  To be serious about this matter, we need to consider the current situation.  Unemployment has never been higher, there is a mortgage crisis and nearly one in four mortgage holders across the board in middle Ireland are in arrears.  We will deal with the property tax later in the week but how can the Minister say to a family on an income of \u20ac30,000 or \u20ac40,000 a year that cutting child benefit in this way is fair?  It is not fair and the Minister knows that.  How can she say to the 75,000 families who receive the respite care grant that taking 20% of that annual payment from them is fair?  It is not fair.  All I ask is that we have a reasoned debate here during the next three days and that Senators examine the amendments tabled, stand up for the people who really need these payments and make sure this Seanad continues and uses this opportunity to show it will stand up to the D\u00e1il and say it got it wrong and that it must look at this legislation again.  That is all the passing of an amendment means.  <\/p><p>I thank the Minister for coming in here today.  I look forward to debating the specific amendment tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800037#SS00300","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1355846700,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  This is an important debate as it affords us an opportunity to re-examine the purpose of social welfare and the budgetary process.  Clearly, the Minister's Department is the most important in terms of expenditure.  It has a budget of &#8364;21 billion, almost 40% of total Government expenditure.<\/p><p>  Some aspects of the budget have been very controversial.  I will deal with them but will first address the overall picture.  This is an important day on which to hear an overview of what social welfare is about.  It should be a bridge from unemployment to work and from education to work.  It should not be about creating a welfare lifestyle, which concept has been bandied about considerably.  We are reaching the point at which we need an information campaign in the media about the purpose of social welfare.  Everybody understood the idea of Saorview but I am not so sure they understand the principle behind social welfare.<\/p><p>  Given the size of the budget, social welfare should be about fairness.  We are all trying to achieve this.  It is a question of giving people a hand up and of poverty-proofing.  It is about payments that are earned in the form of pensions or received by virtue of genuine circumstances.  I include the carer's grant and child benefit.<\/p><p>  Our approach must include the cutting out of fraud.  Fraud hurts everyone, including the worker paying the taxes.  It creates great hostility and hurts the genuinely needy.  These are some of the issues on which I want to touch in my contribution.<\/p><p>  I wish to refer to the activation measures in the budget and the important bridge from unemployment or education to employment.  I compliment the Minister on the 10,000 additional places this year and particularly on her innovative local authority social employment scheme.  When I examined the figures, I noted the Department is spending &#8364;1 billion on activation measures.  Given that our mission is to get people back to work, this is not enough.  We should be spending more in this area.  As the Minister stated, doing so would constitute a social welfare investment in people's futures, particularly the futures of those who are jobless.<\/p><p>  The most recent ESRI report, to which the Minister referred, shows that 22% of the population are in jobless families, which is twice the European average.  This is a damning figure.  Joblessness is not good for families.  This is particularly the case for children, who need to see purposeful activity and their parents going to work.<\/p><p>  When I am on the doorsteps, I am frequently asked why the welfare system does not require people to be more active.  I recall Fr. Sean Healy making a proposal over a year ago that people should work for their welfare at a rate that one's job would command if one were employed.  There is considerable dignity and purpose associated with such a practice.  One would be out and about and more likely to network and pick up work.<\/p><p>  There is a Twitter feed called @EireJobs, available at <i>twitter.com\/eirejobs<\/i>, on which approximately 200 jobs per week are advertised.  Has analysis been done to demonstrate that the jobs that are becoming available now require the skills of those who are claiming unemployment benefit at present?  Is there a skills match or mismatch?<\/p><p>  A Nobel laureate, Professor Christopher Pissarides, spoke in the House recently about the importance of retraining and education.  It is on this subject that I applaud the Minister regarding child care places.  Obviously, young women and young mothers cannot go back to work unless there are child care places.  Professor Pissarides spoke strongly about the need to ensure the unemployed are ready to return to work and that there is retraining.  He also spoke about the need for young people to be flexible and try many jobs until they find the one that suits them.  The education system should be preparing them for this.  There needs to be a tie-in with the education system in this regard.<\/p><p>  Professor Pissarides spoke about how policies should not restrict labour turnover.  He highly recommended job subsidies, stating that job subsidies that offer work experience are better than unconditional unemployment compensation.  Rather than giving jobseeker's allowance, it is better to invest the money in initiatives such as T\u00fas, JobBridge, internships and employment schemes.  Sweden, for example, has a very successful scheme that subsidises the hiring of unemployed workers to replace those on maternity leave and other types of leave.<\/p> <p>The authorities can pass on the unemployment compensation to the employer who then pays an extra portion that is higher than the compensation.  Everyone wins in that case.  The employer and the employee are paying PRSI, it is cheaper than supporting unemployment through transfers only, and the unemployed get work experience.  German studies have found that works when a similar scheme was tried in that country.<\/p><p>I will make another point on activation measures.  For social welfare purposes the rates for jobseekers on casual work should be calculated by hour rather than whole day.  That would also reduce their incentive to not work on certain days due to the social welfare rules.  That is quite controversial but in countries such as Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark, it is working well in that they do not have to leave a full day vacant to qualify for some social welfare.<\/p><p>In terms of what has happened since the budget was announced, we agree we must be fair and guard against poverty.  That is the challenge but the question is the way we achieve it.  Since the budget announcement the country and the Government have been rocked by two measures, namely, the cut in the carer's grant and child benefit.  I have reflected on that.  The Minister's hands are tied.  She had to take \u20ac390 million out of this budget, and that was after a very good negotiation to reduce it from \u20ac510 million.  The construct within which the negotiations are taking place appears to be wrong.  It is time that the programme for Government was renegotiated-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800038#TT00100","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355847000,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800039#UU00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1355847000,"counter":214,"content":"<p>-----because some of the promises made at the outset were unsustainable.

Three postmasters - one in the west, one in the mid-west and one in the south - have told me that in their view, and these are anecdotal reports which I cannot confirm, it is not fairly handed out in that some people deserve more while others may not deserve as much.

However, we have a number of concerns with regard to some of the choices made in the Social Welfare Bill.  As a group we have met and discussed the Bill that is before us today.  We are, as everyone knows, a group of Independents who come from a wide range of backgrounds including civil society, NGOs, the arts, education, business and human rights.<\/p> <p>Each of us has our own unique perspective and it was for this reason we were nominated by the Taoiseach to the House.  <\/p><p>The Seanad was established to give a voice to different and challenging opinions of Irish society.  We are doing so today.  As Independent Senators we all have a role in offering our particular opinion based on our experience and to challenge the Government and the D\u00e1il in decisions they have made.  Each one of us has taken time to reflect on our individual viewpoints.  In the past week I have had discussions with each of the colleagues in our group.  I was struck by the fairness and empathy of their considerations regarding the matters before the House.  We had hoped for, and would have supported, reform of the social welfare system.  However, we are faced with a proposal to make cuts instead of fundamental reforms.  <\/p><p>We have difficulty in supporting some specific aspects of the Bill.  We have tabled three amendments which can be summarised as follows.  In regard to the respite care grant, we cannot underestimate the importance of this grant to brave carers and the people for whom they care.  The proposed cut is inequitable and goes to the heart of our values as a nation.  In regard to child benefit, we are concerned about the absence of any measures to cushion families on low incomes against these cuts.  Can the Government consider counteracting these cuts for low-income families by increasing the family income supplement and the qualified child allowance or by implementing a second tier payment?  In relation to section 13, we agree that measures should be put in place to recoup over-payment but the manner in which this is done is important.  Recoupment should be phased or staggered in such a way that the relevant person maintains a minimum income threshold throughout the period of repayment.  <\/p><p>We do not plan to hinder the passage of the Social Welfare Bill today as it moves from Second Stage to Committee Stage.  On Committee Stage tomorrow we will give our individual viewpoints on the amendments we have tabled.  We will listen carefully to the Minister's response and reflect, and on that basis determine how we will vote.  We have a diversity of experience and perspectives in our group.  We do not impose a whip on group members.  There have been times in the past and I have no doubt there will be times in the future when we will not all vote in the same way.  However, on this occasion we anticipate acting in unison.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800039#UU00600","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355847300,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House for a debate on an important and, perhaps, one of the toughest Bills that will go through the House.  There is no doubt these are challenging times and some hard and unpalatable decisions had to be made.  When we came into government the country was in one hell of a financial mess.  The onus is on us to get the country back on track and get it moving again and bring back physical and economic stability to our country.  There is no doubt citizens have been hurt not only be decisions taken in this budget but in previous budgets.<\/p><p>We are well aware of the gap between what we spend and take in in taxes.  Unfortunately, this dictates that cuts have to be made in every Department.  That social welfare has the highest spend at more than 40%, means that cuts have to be made in social welfare.  All parties are in agreement that the deficit has to be closed but how we go about it is what we do not agree on.  <\/p><p>Before addressing the more controversial issues I wish to refer to some of the more positive aspects of the Bill.  An issue which has not been mentioned by the media and the Opposition is that the Minister did renegotiate the cutbacks in social protection from \u20ac540 million to \u20ac390 million.  People may say that is not much but I dread to think where one would have got another \u20ac150 million savings in this year's social welfare budget.  I am pleased the Minister was able to achieve that.  The cuts are hard enough to bear without a further \u20ac150 million.<\/p><p>I welcome the \u20ac30 million in new spending on unemployment programmes and child care.  I welcome specifically the 10,000 new places in the jobs activation programme and, in particular, the introduction of the 3,000 new social employment scheme places which is to be rolled out to local authorities.<\/p> <p>This investment is consistent with the Government's priority in getting people activated, getting them back to work or undertaking education or training, which we hope will improve their chances of getting a job in the future.  The plan is starting to work.  Private sector employment has started to grow for the first time in four years - albeit a very small change - but at least a change in the right direction.  I also welcome the roll out of the Intreo office which will reform the delivery of service for employment and income supports and will assist the unemployed with all their needs in a new, more efficient and user-friendly manner.  Also very welcome is the \u20ac14 million which is being directed to after-school child care places, \u20ac2 million to the school meals programme and \u20ac2.5 million for area-based child poverty initiatives.  I ask the Minister not to hand over the money to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs until she knows the child care provisions are to be set up.  I also ask the Minister to continue to develop and enhance these facilities over the coming years as they are essential to her proposal to get those who are parenting alone back into the workforce.<\/p><p>The Minister has managed once again this year to maintain the basic rates of social welfare.  I welcome that fact.  Many will say that is not the case, but in it is.  The Labour Party has always fought hard to protect the basic rates of payment and this coalition Government has made a decision to continue to do so.  I acknowledge the value the Government places on the free travel and free television licence schemes.  However, it reduced the number of units in the electricity and telephone allowance.<\/p><p>I know people will say we broke our promise not to cut child benefit.  We did.  There are no two ways about it.  Since we made that promise things have changed that greatly affect the economy in this country.  Europe has gone into recession.  More people are dependent on social welfare.  The demand on pensions has got higher.  There are 80,000 more people in receipt of the State pension since we came into government.<\/p><p>I am worried about the impact the cut in child benefit will have on people.  Many have got used to relying on this monthly payment to help to pay bills.  While I understand this is not the reason child benefit was introduced, it is a fact of life that many, though not all, had come to rely on it.  Many people say that taxing child benefit is the way forward.  I know the Minister favours this.  However, means testing is the best way forward as the people who most need it will retain it.  If child benefit is taxed I would be worried about the middle-income earner who would end up paying at the very least 20% tax on it.  That would be excessive for them.  I welcome a debate on the proposals in the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare chaired by Ms Ita Mangan.<\/p><p>I will now deal with the cut in the respite grant for carers.  Prior to and since my election to the Seanad I have worked continuously for one sector of society, namely, carers.  I am constantly highlighting the valuable work of the carer in every debate possible.  I even moved a motion at the Labour Party conference on carers.  I met the Minister to discuss some of the issues surrounding carers.  I asked her not to cut the half rate to carers as many carers were extremely worried about it.  I also asked her not to reduce the disregard for carer's allowance, not to touch the domiciliary care allowance or not to make changes to the disability allowance payment.  Thankfully the Minister delivered on those requests.<\/p><p>I did not see the cut to the respite care grant coming.  I very much regret this is where the Minister had to find the funding reduction within the social welfare spend.  No matter where the Minister would make the cut, it would hurt people because that is the nature of social welfare.  Social welfare was put in place to help those who have no other income and depend on the State to help them.  The Minister may know - I know my Labour Party colleagues know - I have written to her outlining proposals that I and my colleagues believe will benefit carers and will be cost neutral.  I have discussed this at length with my Labour Party colleagues who are very much in support of the proposal.  We are asking that 20% of the new job activation places would be allocated to the Carers Association throughout Ireland.  This would provide 39,000 hours per week and over 2 million hours each year, which would give carers a weekly respite from caring.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to my other proposal for carers, namely, to extend the eligibility for carers to partake in community employment schemes, which would give them access to training and upskilling in the event of them no longer being a carer.  It would also give them a break from caring and an opportunity to interact socially with other people outside the caring environment.  The third request is that an interdepartmental survey on the provision of respite care be carried out to identify gaps in the provision by the HSE.<\/p> <p>I hope she will meet her colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, and discuss it and come back to members with a satisfactory answer.<\/p><p>While I will be supporting the Bill, it is with a heavy heart.  The reason I am doing it is that I need to be on the inside working and fighting on behalf of the carers and other recipients of social welfare.  The new vulnerable in my eyes, is the low to middle-income worker.  I will continue to fight to protect what they have and I will keep the pressure on the Minister and her Cabinet colleagues to ensure that no further cuts are made to carers or to people with disabilities.  I will be actively pursuing our proposals with her.<\/p><p>I believe we must put a means test mechanism in place.

In what Senator Marie Moloney said in her carefully crafted speech, she seemed to be suggesting a way in which some degree of resolution could come to the carers.  I do not believe it will be sufficient.  I recognise the Minister has made a commitment to restore core community services, to give funding for 10,000 additional places and \u20ac35 million for new mental health services.  It is important to be balanced, especially when we are Independent Members.<\/p><p>I now want to deal with the notion of Independents.  The single most important thing that was said today was the statement from the Independent core of the Taoiseach's nominees.  That independence of mind, that careful consideration indicates very clearly to everyone that the game is now on, the ball is in play.  This House can for once do what it was constitutionally established to do.  It can do this without any sense of unpleasant party factionalism or confrontation with the Government because we cannot defeat it.  All we can do, is as we are charged on behalf of the people to do, when a difficult, dangerous and painful situation confronts our nation, is to respectfully ask our Government to go back and reconsider the situation over a period of 90 days.

It was some kind of brainwave of the Taoiseach to suggest that Seanad \u00c9ireann be abolished.  It was popular with the people.  It was a populist move.  The people would love to get rid of 60 politicians and would love it equally well if it was 60 politicians in the D\u00e1il or indeed the Taoiseach himself at the moment.  We are confronted with the situation.<\/p> <p>I would say to my colleagues over there that they are gone anyway unless they justify themselves.  Why not behave for once in the same manner as you do when you speak so freely out on the plinth?  Live up to those actions, stand up for the Republic and thereby justify our existence.  If we lie down and do not protest, we are handing the argument to those opponents of Seanad \u00c9ireann who will say &quot;Look at the lapdogs who did not even bark when the people were imperilled&quot;.  I ask Members opposite to consider their situation.  There are a large number of them who may, in hopes of a seat in the other House, decide cravenly to give in to the Government.  They have a fat chance.<\/p><p> It is important that we also correct some of the things that were said.  It was suggested that people are so much better off in this country than people in Holland.  In Holland, they have a really good health service.  A close friend whose wife suffered from multiple sclerosis took her immediately to Northern Ireland on his retirement because the services are so much better there.  These things cannot be quantified in miserable budgetary terms.  Even if one did, one would find that the abolition of the weekly PRSI threshold has an immensely magnified effect on the poorest.  I am not taking this from Sinn F\u00e9in; I am taking it from the ESRI.  I would not impugn Sinn F\u00e9in if its members did their sums correctly.  The ESRI study of budget 2012 shows it was regressive, with reductions of 2% to 2.5% for those with the lowest incomes as against losses of approximately three quarters of a percent for those on the highest incomes.  It shows that we are crucifying the most vulnerable.  On those issues, we must stand up.<\/p><p> It is also important that some of those voices be heard.  I have a small selection of the agonised e-mails that I and every other one of my colleagues have received.  I am not making a party political point.  There are decent people in every party and every corner of the House whose hearts ache as mine does.  I ask Members to listen to these e-mails.<blockquote>Once, I was the middle-class wife of a public servant.  Now, I depend on welfare; not what I have worked and hoped for for 60 years.  My car is being sold after Christmas.  I have to get a car with a smaller engine so that I can afford to tax it.  My three-year-old niece with an inoperable brain tumour will lose over &#8364;300 of her respite grant.  Last year, the grant was used to purchase a pair of boots which cost &#8364;700 so that she could walk.<\/blockquote>These are the human stories behind what we are being asked to do.  We will support the Minister's hand in going back to Cabinet and asking that these cruel cuts not go through.  Another e-mail states:<blockquote>We are freezing, have no oil, the kids are wearing two layers and gloves.  I am at my wits' end.  Please do not push me any further by taking the little bit of money I am getting away.<\/blockquote>I could not stand here and vote for these particular sections.  I know we are in economic difficulty.  Nobody needs to tell us.  Nobody should dare to say that people use the money to go on holidays abroad.  Perhaps that happened once, but I heard someone who had the audacity to say that respite carers should take their holidays in Ireland.  What planet is that person living on?  They are not taking holidays at all.  Suppose carers did not love their family members and did not sacrifice their lives for them.  Suppose they behaved callously.  The State could not possibly afford it.  Yet we are giving &#8364;4 billion to the Central Bank to burn.<\/p><p> We are not supposed to talk about the promissory note, but I demand the right to do so.  I am not convinced by what is being said.<\/p> <p>While we will hold the EU Presidency, Cyprus still has it.  Has anybody heard of Cyprus?  It is a Kitchener position no different to being on the front page of <i>Time<\/i>magazine.  I wonder if the penny has dropped?  Our Minister for Finance does not even chair the meetings of finance Ministers.  That shows how much effect we are going to have.  I will vomit publicly if I ever again hear how well behaved we are.  Even the Minister pointed out that there is no violence on our streets as there is in Greece.  While I do not advocate it, we are too passive.  We should surround the Central Bank on a particular day in our tens and hundreds of thousands and demonstrate to our masters in Europe the cost that is being bled out of the people of Ireland by measures like this.  I will support the Minister if she renegotiates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800042#XX01300","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355849100,"counter":237,"content":"<p>No clapping allowed in the Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800044#ZZ00300","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1355849100,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and commend her on a number of points.  First, she has succeeded in bringing her reductions to \u20ac390 million and she got \u20ac150 million savings.  We should all remember that \u20ac150 million in her own Department and that of the Minister for Health is to be funded by taxation measures at a time when we are trying to keep taxation low to encourage consumers to spend and employers to develop job opportunities.  Second, I commend her, in a difficult budgetary context, for maintaining core social welfare rates in jobseeker's benefit, jobseeker's allowance, carer's allowance and State pensions.  We need to repeat that and should be very proud of a budget which can deliver those rates in such difficult times.<\/p><p>I was encouraged to read the proposals in the budget regarding children, in particular the creation of 6,000 after-school child care places for primary school children.  The objective is to permit the parents of those children to partake in a training or employment opportunity, hopefully the latter.  It is a positive proposal.  Anyone who says the budget is anti-children is making misplaced comments.  There is additional money for the school meals programme and the area-based poverty initiatives which are helping the most vulnerable children in our society.  They also help their parents to develop employment opportunities and we do not hear enough about them.  We should repeatedly refer to them.  I hope the media will take them up and inform people of the very positive developments which will help children and encourage them.  Those of us who have worked with these programmes, including Members opposite, know their value full well.<\/p><p>Somebody said the budget was not reforming enough of social welfare.  The Minister spoke today of how she is changing the emphasis from the payment of income support to the development of employment initiative programmes.  I welcome the addition of 10,000 places on various programmes.  JobBridge has been particularly successful.  A recent independent report of Indecon set out that 52% of participants in those courses gained employment.  Up to 90% of participants were happy and gave positive reports of the necessary skills they developed and their confidence that they would be able to gain employment.  Community employment schemes have been extended and new places developed on local authority employment schemes.  These initiatives came from debates in this House.  The Seanad has proved itself useful in influencing the Minister, which she acknowledged in her speech.<\/p><p>It is important to recognise that the national carers' strategy was published in the last 12 months.  It had been long outstanding and shelved by previous Governments.  While I wish the respite grant could be maintained, the fact that carer's allowance, carer's benefit, domiciliary care allowance, relative's allowance and half-rate carer's allowance are still in place is positive.  I have spoken to many carers who are upset that the respite grant has been cut.  I ask the Minister, as Senator Moloney did, to consider introducing means testing in this area as there is some disquiet.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, is concerned about the need to get people back to work.  I have spoken to many who are availing of these very valuable employment schemes and they are positive.  To say that this is not a reforming budget in respect of its social welfare contribution is completely untrue. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800044#ZZ00400","speaker":"1114","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355849400,"counter":240,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Leas-Chathaoirleach.

The basic things expected by our people of their political and economic systems are simple.  They are equality of opportunity for youth and for others.  Jobs for those who can work.  Security for those who need it.  The ending of special privilege for the few.  The preservation of civil liberties for all.  The enjoyment of the fruits of scientific progress in a rising standard of living.<\/blockquote>Those words were true in 1941 and are true today yet we are discussing a Social Welfare Bill which contains a fundamental cut affecting the less privileged in society, those who are disabled and those who are elderly and vulnerable.  The cut equates to approximately &#8364;26 million.  There are 22 top bankers receiving salaries of over &#8364;500,000 each, which amounts to close to &#8364;15 million.  There are 88 retired bankers on pensions of over &#8364;100,000 each.  When those figures are added together they amount to the cut in the respite care grant.  That brings home Roosevelt&#8217;s words but the privileged appear to be protected and are not affected by cuts in the budget or any action on the part of the Government.  On the other hand, the most vulnerable are being attacked.  <\/p><p>  The cut in the respite care grant was a step too far, affecting people who are voiceless and unable to defend themselves.  The small saving of &#8364;26 million should be reconsidered.  There are very good Senators in the Government parties, and I hope that they will use the amendments which Fianna F\u00e1il and others will bring forward over the next few days to reflect on their consciences and vote according to what they believe is right, based on the words of Roosevelt and others since he made that speech in 1941.   <\/p><p>  I have done a simple sum, based on a rural family in which the husband receives a farm income of approximately &#8364;15,000 and farm assist, there is a disabled child who receives the respite care grant and the mother receives a carer&#8217;s allowance.  They will be penalised to the tune of &#8364;3,061 by this budget because the farm assist payment will be reduced by at least &#8364;47.50 a week, child benefit, if they have two children, by &#8364;240 a month, and the cuts in the respite care grant will amount to &#8364;325 annually.  If their overall household income is in the region of &#8364;29,000 they will be subject to a cut of approximately 10.5% in their overall household income.  That is a regressive budget.  No one could support that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800045#AAA00400","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1355849400,"counter":243,"content":"<p>The Senator is eating into Senator Byrne\u2019s time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800045#AAA00450","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1355849400,"counter":244,"content":"<p>That is why we are bringing forward our amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800045#AAA00500","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1355849400,"counter":245,"content":"<p>T\u00e1im bu\u00edoch do mo chomhleaca\u00ed, an Seanad\u00f3ir \u00d3 Domhnaill, as a chuid ama a roinnt liom.  In the programme for Government, the Government parties commit to protecting social welfare rates.  There is nothing in the programme for Government about core or specific rates.  The T\u00e1naiste, the leader of the Labour Party, reaffirmed that commitment on the 100th day in office of this Government.  That solemn commitment has been evident only in its breach.<\/p><p>Those affected by the highest cuts in this budget are those in receipt of the respite care grant and the back to school allowance.  The latter allowance is not covered by this Bill.  Why have they been targeted?  Why has this not been done more fairly?  Middle Ireland has been hit by child benefit cuts and the increase in PRSI.  The Labour Party promised to protect child benefit when it was in opposition and during the election but in government a Labour Party Minister has offered it up with no resistance from Fine Gael.  That is unfortunate and people should remember the commitments they made before and after the election. <\/p><p>Senators who voted across party lines to protect the Seanad are now called upon to vote across party lines to protect the most vulnerable in society and to use one of the few powers available to us, namely, to tell the D\u00e1il and the Government to think again and make fairer cuts and honour commitments made before and after the election.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800045#AAA00600","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1355850000,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I would like on my own behalf, and on behalf of the Labour Party in counties Laois and Offaly, to apologise to the electorate in our constituency for failing in this instance to abide by a solemn pre-election pledge to protect child benefit.  To say otherwise is merely splitting hairs and semantics.  When I, along with my colleagues, put up those posters and distributed those leaflets during the election, I believed we intended to stand over that commitment.  I earnestly regret that we have not.  I share the same deep sense of betrayal which is felt by many of those in my community and beyond who have contacted me, anxious and distressed by this across-the-board cut to child benefit.<\/p><p>We also promised to protect the most vulnerable, to be fair and ensure equity.  Again, a universal cut to the carer's respite grant surely fails that test.  It is not that I am looking to apportion blame but rather accept my share of the responsibility in these failures.  If we promised reform, we also promised to restore confidence and credibility in a much tarnished, discredited body politic which has been brought into much disrepute.  We will hardly do so by making false promises ourselves or breaking our promises.<\/p><p>The Government has a current expenditure in excess of \u20ac52 billion and the adjustment in tough cuts and taxes in this budget amount to \u20ac3.5 billion.  The main flash point issues amount to less than \u20ac150 million.  It is my sincerely held view that we could have addressed this amount differently rather than picking on children and carers.  The option of a temporary short-term solidarity levy or social charge on high earners in excess of \u20ac100,000 was roundly rejected by the coalition Government.  The choice the Cabinet made is beyond me.<\/p><p>It falls to more than the Labour Party to be guardians and gatekeepers of social solidarity, fairness and decency.  People complain about the hand of the troika and our lack of sovereignty.  True, we are not free agents and we are beholden.  However, our income tax rates and policy should not be set by faceless third parties.  After all, we already have a generous and attractive corporation tax regime.  Many high earners and corporate entities would willingly subscribe to a voluntary social charge or a voluntary corporate contribution in the short term, particularly if they felt that resources were ring-fenced and put to best use for those most in genuine need.<\/p><p>It would also be remiss of me not to acknowledge and commend the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, for her considerable achievement in substantially protecting those reliant on the bulk of her \u20ac20 billion social protection budget and safeguarding weekly payments to the disabled, carers, widows, pensioners and the unemployed.  This is no mean achievement and one I do not disregard.<\/p><p>However, the time has come for the overhaul and reform of the child benefit system.  Children's allowance was introduced as a universal payment in the 1930s but we live in a much different and more complex society today.  With the budget's cut in child benefit, it is unfair that a family on \u20ac20,000 should be subjected to the same financial hit as those on \u20ac100,000 and over.  On such difficult decisions, the Seanad does have a responsibility.<\/p><p>No Member has a monopoly on courage or righteousness.  One road is as hard as the other. However, I do take exception to the personalised and vitriolic nature of attacks we have witnessed recently.

As we are all aware, the country is watching and listening to what we do here today.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, is a member of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Cabinet and is responsible for a Department that provides an investment of 37% of government expenditure for the protection and well-being of the people.  She has the opportunity over the next several days in the Seanad to adopt a new tone of governance, a form of deliberative and representative democracy that demonstrates a dialogic approach between the Government and the people.<\/p><p>Since the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform announced the outlines of the 2013 budget, a national conversation has erupted in which all of us as public representatives have listened and participated.  Over the course of the past several days, especially when the Social Welfare Bill was debated in the Lower House, a few prime issues have risen to the top of the budget debate.  As my colleague and group leader, Senator van Turnhout, has so forcefully outlined, Independent Members have put forward amendments to the Bill to deal with these issues.<\/p><p>There is not one person in the country who does not understand that our economy is in a terrible way, that our recovery has so far been anaemic, that savings must be made and, above all in light of the financial and social crises, that we must limit the damage done to the most vulnerable, especially when budgetary choices are made.  Governing with a dialogic approach requires, even in the toughest times, that those who lead demonstrate flexibility and empathy.  The people need to be listened to and those who govern must trust the people.  The Minister for Social Protection said she had reduced the original amount to be cut by \u20ac150 million.  It is a significant amount, for which I commend her, as I do on the other reforms she has introduced.  However, as of today, I, as well as the majority, do not understand why the Government did not approach some key budgetary measures differently.<\/p> <p>Why did Fine Gael and the Labour Party fail to increase the universal social charge for those earning more than \u20ac100,000 per annum?  We have been told it is because the Labour Party lost the battle and Fine Gael promised not to increase taxes.  I have heard even those on more than \u20ac100,000 acknowledge that an increase would have been a fairer way to proceed than to make reductions in the respite care grant.  Even to increase the universal social charge by 1% or 2% could have compensated for the saving of the \u20ac26 million which was achieved by cutting respite care, and that cut would not then have had to proceed.  We have not heard credible, logical, value-based reasons for choices such as these.  Further, why did those who govern postpone the capping of tax relief for the pensions of high earners until 2014?  What credible, logical, value-based reason could there be not to introduce a saving of \u20ac215 million for 2013, thereby allowing the Government to maintain the incomes of children in the poorest and hungriest households?<\/p><p>The Minister says she has to cut child benefit across the board, from rich to poor and middle-income households alike, and that a fairer, more equitable reform of child benefit must wait until the expert report on that topic is debated.  Why?  Rich and poor alike do not understand the logic of that wait.  Ireland needs a form of governance that is credible, listens to the people and demonstrates that equality of empathy is present.  To make a few changes, even now, to the budget will not unravel the whole thing.  Rather than set us on a slippery slope, it would demonstrate a new form of governance and those the Minister was willing to trust would be more likely to respond with renewed hope and determination.  I ask the Minister to call a meeting with the Taoiseach, the T\u00e1naiste and the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform - the Economic Management Council - to ask them to listen to the people and to feel with them, which is the nature of empathy, and to make key changes even at this stage.  The alternative is that Fine Gael and the Labour Party risk leaving what Adrienne Rich calls &quot;a rusted legacy&quot;.  There is still time to image the possible and engage in a way of governing that engenders hope for all our people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800047#CCC01400","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355850600,"counter":262,"content":"<p>The next Senator has five minutes, but I will advise her after four minutes as I am trying to get as many speakers in as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800048#DDD00200","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1355850600,"counter":263,"content":"<p>We have two more days on it.

Carer's allowance and tax relief for carers were cut, as were widow's pensions, invalidity pensions and pensions for the blind.<\/p> <p>In 2011, under the then Minister, Deputy \u00d3 Cu\u00edv, Fianna F\u00e1il and the Progressive Democrats slashed the core weekly payments on which the most vulnerable groups in society relied.  They cut both the carer's allowance and the carer's tax relief, as well as the widow's pension, the invalidity pension and the blind pension.  I do not ascribe blame because the entire situation had collapsed and the Government had to do something.  We are now being blamed for continuing with what we were bequeathed by the previous Government and every Minister has to cut the cloth accordingly.  Nobody likes to make cuts in the Department of Social Protection because they affect the most vulnerable in society.<\/p><p>The respite care grant has been reduced but it trebled over the last ten years.  Carers have the hardest job in the country and if one put a monetary value on the work they do because, for example, those for whom they cared were hoisted into hospitals, it would make for an interesting analysis.  We currently spend \u20ac771 million on carers but that should be weighed against what is spent on nursing homes.<\/p><p>We must ensure the budget is fair and that everybody pays a fair share.  However, we also want to ensure those who can pay their share stay in this country and employ people.  The Irish tax system is one of the most progressive in the world according to an OECD report published in 2011.  The OECD defines the tax wedge as income tax plus employee and employer social security contributions.  Ireland comes second in the world and first in the EU for progressivity, which means fairness.  I rarely hear that mentioned in the newspapers.<\/p><p>I want those in need to get the money.  That is what the Minister, Deputy Burton, has done.  She is tackling fraud to ensure the money goes where it is needed and to ensure those who are not in need do not fraudulently receive payments.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, is working with the Minister, Deputy Burton, to put the money where it is needed at a time when we do not have all the money we want.<\/p><p>I pointed out earlier that a report by the OECD reveals that Irish mothers pay a huge price for having children.

I hope we will be able to make positive changes to the Bill but social welfare reform is regarded across Europe as essential.  Even Germany, which is Europe's strongest economy, cannot afford to continue paying many forms of welfare.  <i>The Sunday Times<\/i> stated that any country which spends more than &#8364;20 billion per year on social welfare at a time when its tax take is just &#8364;36 billion is clearly dysfunctional.  We have to make tough decisions and the Minister and the Government are making them.  How can we sustain the State when the weekly social welfare payment of &#8364;188 is more than twice the amount paid in the UK or Germany?  I am proud that we look after every citizen in the country but I tell foreigners about the amount of social welfare we pay in this country I am told I must not be speaking the truth.  In Italy and other EU countries people do not receive unemployment benefit if they have not worked.  The principle of unemployment benefit should be that one gets benefits if one has worked.  While this may be an unpopular view the editorial in last Saturday's <i>Irish Independent<\/i> got it right in noting: <blockquote>far from being concerned at the huge amounts being spent on social welfare, politicians of all parties compete with one another to express their 'social concern'...It's time for some tough love on social welfare.  Benefits have to be cut and fraud eradicated.<\/blockquote>  All areas of the &#8364;53 billion currently spent by the State must be examined.  The economist, Jim Power, recently argued that the people who are opposed to any examination of social protection expenditure should recognise that it is financed by those who work and pay taxes.  The latter should be allowed to comment on how their hard earned money is spent.  The resources needed to provide a safety net to the less well off can only be generated through job creation.  This point is often forgotten, however.  We have to consider where the money spent on social welfare is being found.<\/p><p>  The right kind of reform of social welfare can spur growth in the economy.  I cannot understand why it is so difficult to means test benefits.  By taxing child benefit and other benefits, the Government could raise revenue and help deprived children directly.  Ireland currently pays the fourth highest rate of child benefit in the European Union, behind Denmark, Germany and Luxembourg.  We must run the country as a business and we cannot afford to pay this anymore.  We can learn from other countries in this regard.  I believe the Minister has done that on this occasion and I will be supporting the Government on the Bill.  I hope, however, the Minister will consider some of the changes that have been proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800049#EEE01400","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1355851200,"counter":289,"content":"<p>Everybody expected a tough budget.

She knows many families struggle to send children to school, to put clothes on their backs, to put food in their mouths and on tables, to put heating oil in tanks and pay gas and electricity bills.  Many families are in negative equity and many families struggle to pay basic bills.  We must ask ourselves whether this budget makes life any easier for those families or whether it makes it a lot more difficult.  We must be fair and honest and admit it will make life more difficult for the majority of middle income and low income families, particularly those on social welfare, because of the kind of cuts in this budget.<\/p><p>  With Fine Gael, the Minister, and the Labour Party specifically, went to the electorate and made clear, solemn and unequivocal pre-election promises.  One Labour Party Senator has apologised for that.  The Labour Party said it would not cut child benefit.  It said that was a red line issue which was non-negotiable.  However, the Labour Party has turned its back on the people who voted for it.  It has also reneged on its promises with regard to the respite care grant and college fees.  Some of those constituents have e-mailed me.  One said: &quot;The cut is a cut too deep for the most vulnerable in society.  Please do not pass it.&quot;  Another wrote: &quot;Hi, I am a mum of two autistic boys.  My husband passed away suddenly three years ago at 39.  This cut to the respite care grant and children's allowance will cripple us as a family.  Please help.&quot;  People are pleading for help from the people they voted into office to protect them, but those people have let them down. <\/p><p>  In one of her final speeches as Opposition spokesperson for the Labour Party, the Minister said in the D\u00e1il at a time when Fianna F\u00e1il was seeking to cut child benefit.<blockquote>  Child benefit is keeping many families afloat.  Child benefit is keeping bread on the table.  It is paying the food bills of a significant number of families who have had a massive reduction in their income.  Child benefit is, has been and will continue for a long time to be mainly an issue for mn\u00e1 na h\u00c9ireann and their children.<\/blockquote>She was right to say that.  However, now she comes in here and asks us to vote for a cut in child benefit - something she said was a protection for the women of Ireland and should not be cut, but protected.  Again, the Minister has failed these people.<\/p><p>  The former Labour Party Minister of State in the Department of Health, Deputy Shortall, challenged the Minister across the floor of the D\u00e1il to stop using the word &quot;fairness&quot; in the context of this budget, because it is anything but fair.  Senator C\u00e1it Keane asked about the alternatives.  We have set these out in our alternative budget.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800050#FFF01200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1355851800,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I have heard of those fairy tale economics so many times I cannot number them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800050#FFF01300","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1355851800,"counter":305,"content":"<p>The fairy tale economics come from the people making the bad choices.

As for what Fianna F\u00e1il did when in government, in the immortal words of a very distinguished former Leader of the House, &quot;that was then and this is now.&quot;  The people adjudicated on that performance and we lost 58 seats.  We must, therefore, comment on what is happening in the here and now.  AS I was not made Minister for Finance, I can say whatever I like about the budget and it is perfectly credible, given that I was elected to the House.<\/p><p>I have met the troika.  I do know if many Labour Party Senators accompany the Minister's delegations to the troika, but I have accompanied ours.  On many occasions the troika has made it crystal clear that where the money is found is irrelevant, provided the bottom line is the same, savings are made and we achieve what is desired to be achieved.  That is a fact.  If it is not, when the Minister next goes to see the troika, I will accompany her at her invitation and I am sure others would like to come, too.  I agree that we should meet them collectively.<\/p><p>As much of the ground has been covered, I will focus on one point.  There were and are options.  Those earning over \u20ac100,000 a year - the Members of these Houses are decidedly middle class and will know many of the people to whom I refer - were conditioned and expected to be hit by paying an extra 3% through the universal social charge.  For six months it was the single item leaked most and it met with least resistance.  I do not know what goes on in negotiations in the Cabinet room and who was sticking up for those would have been affected, but that increase of 3% would have brought in \u20ac200 million, which means there would have been \u20ac174 million left after putting the respite care grant back in place which could have gone towards child care sevices.<\/p><p>Who are we hitting?  There are other potential levies, for example, on off-sales of drink or products with a high sugar and fat content.  There could have been further reductions in the pensions area to cover other items.  Therefore, there were options.  The IMF has stated in recent days in the context of the next budget that we have cut enough.  In the absence of growth in the 1980s, when there were tough budgets, we were able to offset some of the pain against the fact that there was a buoyant global economy.  However, that is not the case now and we are hitting the most vulnerable, including those in mortgage arrears.<\/p><p>This is an opportunity to kick the Bill back to the D\u00e1il.  I believe that is the will of the people.  The will of the people on this issue is to say have another look at this.  Here are genuine options in the interests of the people.  It is not a question of being disloyal to Fianna F\u00e1il, Labour or anyone else.  It is a question of showing that this House is representative of the people.<\/p><p>This is an opportunity to kick the Bill back to the D\u00e1il, which is the will of the people.

This is probably the toughest debate in which any of us will ever be involved and the decisions made this week will certainly compound matters.  Previous speakers referred to letters received.  We have all received the most heartfelt letters and I speak as a parent of a child with special needs on the autistic spectrum and who fits all of these criteria.  The last thing I want to do and the last thing I am sure any of us wants to do is to make cuts.  We do not want them; nobody does.  I have met the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and expressed my fears and concerns to her and she has gone into great detail in explaining the bigger picture.  As Senator Feargal Quinn said, we have to look at the bigger picture.<\/p><p>The nub of the issue of the respite care grant is that there is no respite care service.  The respite care services are absolutely appalling.  I have a child who, if I am lucky, will sleep three hours a night and he is now 15 years of age.  I could add the number of sleepless nights I have had and I then had to go and do my job.  At one stage, to put bread on the table, I had to drive 70 miles a day.  I did this for my children because I knew there was an end goal.  That is where the problem lies.  Respite care services have disappeared in the last year.  In my own area, as I said to the Minister, a service was available and there was a children's respite care unit.  I am talking about respite care services for children up to 18 years.  The respite care unit only opens now seven days in every 31.  God forbid if a child gets sick on those other days, if there is a bereavement, or an emergency.  <\/p><p>The most frightening aspect for any parent of a child with special needs who needs respite care is that there is nothing available.  There are many people who would gladly give up their respite care grant altogether if they could be assured proper respite care services were in place.  As I have outlined in the House previously, I know of one person who is taking her first break in nine years to be a bridesmaid at her sister's wedding and who has now been told she cannot be guaranteed there will be a respite care service availabe in the area during that weekend - tough.  She now has to make the decision to either, possibly causing hurt and pain, take the child to England or forgo the trip.  That is only one of the thousands of e-mails that have absolutely broken my heart.  I know from first-hand experience exactly what all of these people are going through.  If nothing else comes out of this, we should get a proper respite care service up and running, for which the HSE would provide the funding and in which every penny would be accounted for.<\/p><p>Another vital issue concerns the need for an interdepartmental survey of respite care services and the breakdown between the services and the HSE.  In my area I have tried to get a picture of what the services are like and who avails of them.<\/p> <p>There are many people who would gladly avail of respite services if they were available to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800051#GGG01800","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355853000,"counter":332,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Senator Sean D.

It appears in retrospect that in an economy in which there is full employment the welfare economy gains.  The Minister is trying to correct this problem through the introduction of a welfare system that directs people towards work, rather than permanent welfare payments.<\/p><p>The IMF report of September 2012 states Ireland's spend on social welfare benefits is approximately 29% above the OECD average.  It is also 12% higher than the OECD-EU average.  The welfare spend more than doubled between 2000 and 2011.  People have referred to the meanness of the United Kingdom in terms of some of its welfare benefits.  The United Kingdom ponied up 3.8% of the \u20ac85 billion which was needed to rescue Ireland and we are still borrowing \u20ac13 billion per annum.  We ought to be a little more careful in our comments having received money under a rescue programme from the United Kingdom which we used to pay child benefit at higher levels than are available in the United Kingdom.  It must be realised that Ireland remains in dire financial straits.  Its presentation in the media abroad as a country which has stinted on social welfare benefits is not borne out by the facts.  In terms of how we allocate these benefits, several Senators have raised questions such as why the respite care allowance is not means-tested and child benefit is not included in taxable income or means-tested.  There are elements of the Minister's Department which in the past were always keen to have as big a social welfare sector as possible.  The opening statements in the report of the Department of Social Protection always referred to the millions of people who were dependent on it.  Perhaps they might not do so in the future.  We should target our resources at where they are most needed, as echoed throughout this debate.<\/p><p>According to the IMF, our bureaucratic costs as a percentage of national income are among the highest anywhere.  There is an entitlement culture, even among those whose incomes are way above average.  There is a tax avoidance culture, against which the Minister has written and about which she has spoken.  There is also a lobbying culture which operates away from the facts of how we are trying to cope with the operations of the economy at such a difficult time in managing the public finances.  There are many items Cabinet Ministers should have addressed before the benefits attacked in the Bill were targeted.  For example, the budgets for the Attorney General's office and the office of the Minister for Finance have increased by 11.6% and 16.5%, respectively; the budget for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has increased by 9.2%; the Exchequer pay bill in the Attorney General's office has increased by 12.2% and for the office of the Minister for Finance by 14.3%.  Of 40 pay budgets, 21 have increased at a time when we are supposed to be cutting back on public expenditure and directing money to where it is needed.  <\/p><p>There is a need for a greater focus in our budgeting on those in greatest need.  We need to move away from some of the expenditure items which, by international standards, remain high.  The Government must continue the reform package it commenced when it assumed office in the spring of last year.  There is a lot more to be done because, as stated by the Minister, we continue to borrow \u20ac13 billion per annum.  Being told that if the Government had a surplus, it could do A, B or C is irrelevant.  We do not have a surplus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800052#HHH01000","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1355853000,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his co-operation and appeal for co-operation from the next speaker, Senator John Gilroy, in respect of the time available to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800052#HHH01100","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1355853000,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Senator James Heffernan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800052#HHH01200","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1355853000,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Principles are often easily thrown about in this House.<\/p><p>A blanket cut across the board in child benefit is not fair.  I know of some people who can afford to go on a foreign skiing holiday after Christmas having banked their child benefit payments throughout the past year.  I also know that some people save the money and use it to cover the cost of sending their children to private schools, private tuition or colleges fees.  However, all of us who campaigned during the last geneeral election heard the stories about people who had to choose between meeting their mortgage payments and bringing their sick child to a doctor.  I met people whose meal most days comprised potatoes and soup.  Child benefit is a core payment for many such individuals.  I hope it will be possible to find a better way of administering the payment to ensure it goes to those struggling to make ends meet rather than to those who can afford to save it and spend it at a later date on a skiing holiday to the Alps or the Pyrenees.

It is difficult to maintain decent social services when one has rising demand and decreasing available resources.<\/p><p>I must vote against this Bill, however.  All we can do is have a Quixotic attempt to defeat it.  Defeat of this Bill has as much chance of occurring as the Mayan apocalypse in three days time.  It is important to make a statement because the carers of the severely handicapped young, the severely disabled old and those with cancer believe so.  I accept savings have to be made some place but there is an uneconomic aspect to this cut if one considers one extra day spent in hospital because there is no carer at home will wipe out the annual savings for that one person.  Hospital days cost \u20ac1,000 a day in the health system.

People find any reductions or changes in social welfare payments difficult.  Every euro in the &#8364;20.2 billion social protection concerns an individual, a family and a community somewhere in this country.<\/p><p>  Senator Cullinane gave an example of a widowed mother of two autistic boys.  Under our system, such an individual would get &#8364;33,000 per annum, gross and net.  It is not a high income but a significant one.  That figure also takes into account the reduction in the carer's respite grant and that housing benefits package, travel benefit and the medical card would be worth a combined &#8364;700 to that family.  In practice, for many other families it would be worth more.  It is not true that our social welfare payments are mean, low and miserly.  They are not as significant as we might like them to be, particularly for carers.  As Senator Moran pointed out, many carers have sleepless nights because their children are restless and active during the night.  That is a particular burden these parents carry.<\/p><p>  From my experience, as well as talking to Members such as Senator Moran and reading the article by the former Senator, Niall \u00d3 Brolch\u00e1in, in last week's <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>, I know many want assurances about the actual provision of the respite places. <\/p> <p> I agree with the proposal made by Senators Marie Moloney, Mary Moran and others that we need to map and audit the position in the provision of respite care places.  Senator Mary White will be aware, from experience, that what carers really need, regardless of whether they are looking after a elderly person or a young child, is an assurance that if they make contact with the relevant provider, they will be able to access a reliable respite care place or service.  To be honest, all the respite care grants in the world are not worth as much to most carers as the actual provision of respite care services on which they can rely and which can allow them to spend time with the rest of their families or take a short break, whether in Ireland or abroad.  It was for this purpose that the respite care grant, as originally designed, was meant.  I will be talking to the Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for the disability sector to see whether it will be possible to develop a programme of absolute structures in respect of respite care places.  As stated, I am aware that the provision of such places is the most important aspect of this matter.  It is really important to families who are caring for elderly relatives that these individuals can be placed in a nursing home, a community care home or one of the older public hospital facilities - perhaps for as little as two days or up to a fortnight - and that they can have check-ups, etc., while they are there.  I agree with the proposal made in this regard.<\/p><p>Senator Marie Moloney asked whether it would be possible to use some of the additional 10,000 places, particularly those relating to the T\u00fas and community employment schemes, in the context of extra provision.  Many community employment schemes provide preschool and after-school services.  They also provide a wide range of services for older people.  I would welcome proposals from organisations, associations and community employment schemes which provide services for younger and older people and families which require support in respect of the additional places being provided.  It is up to the former to bring forward such proposals which I will be happy to discuss with them.<\/p><p>I inform those Senators who, in all good conscience, feel obliged to oppose certain sections of the Bill that voting in favour of a 90 day pause would not be without-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800053#JJJ01100","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355854200,"counter":361,"content":"<p>On a point of order, there were Senators who did not have the opportunity to contribute to the debate because the time allocated for it had been exhausted.

This motion seeks to extend the period of effectiveness of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation ) Act 2010, or CISA, as it is known, by a period of 24 months up to 31 December 2014.  Scope for such an extension is provided for in section 69(1) of the Act, which states: &quot;This Act (other than <i>sections 51 and 67<\/i>), ceases to have effect on 31 December 2012 or a later date substituted by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.&quot;  The motion seeks to substitute &quot;31 December 2014&quot; for &quot;31 December 2012&quot;.<\/p><p>  The motivation for the CISA legislation is expressed in the recitals set out at the beginning of the Act.  These underscore the adverse impact of the banking crisis on our economy and the need, in the public interest, for strong powers to resolve the threat to the stability of the financial system generally.  The preamble to the Act also highlights the necessity for the functions and powers provided under the Act to reorganise the guaranteed domestic credit institutions in the context of the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 and the EU-IMF programme of support for Ireland.<\/p><p>  The House is of course aware of the extraordinary and exceptional challenges that have confronted and still face our banking system and the economy.  There is therefore a strong public interest in the continued availability of the extensive ministerial powers provided for in CISA to act on financial stability grounds to effect swift restructuring actions and recapitalisation measures.  The purpose of the bank restructuring measures set out in the joint programme is to ensure that the sector is proportionate to the size and the credit needs of the economy.  The aim was to capitalise the banks to the highest international standards, thereby rebuilding investor confidence in the Irish banking system and in due course restoring their access to normal market funding.  The objective was to facilitate a significant reduction in the domestic Irish banking system's reliance on funding from the Eurosystem and the Central Bank of Ireland and put the Irish banking system on a more sustainable funding platform.<\/p><p>  Under CISA, the Minister may, having consulted with the Governor of the Central Bank and formed certain opinions, make four types of proposed order addressed to relevant institutions - namely, direction orders, special management orders, subordinated liabilities orders and transfer orders - after which the Minister then applies to the High Court for an order in those terms.  The Minister may also issue a number of binding requirements under section 50.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Finance may make a proposed direction order, after which he must apply to the court for an order in those terms, directing a relevant institution to do or refrain from doing any act or thing, including directions to issue shares to the Minister or his or her nominee and increase the share capital of the institution to facilitate this.  The Minister may also apply for the delisting of the relevant institution's shares, alter the institution's memorandum and articles or equivalent, or dispose of a specified asset, liability or part of the institution's undertaking.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Finance may also make a proposed special management order, after which he must apply to the court for an order appointing a special manager to take over the management of the business of a relevant institution to carry on the business as a going concern with a view to preserving and restoring the financial position of the relevant institution.  A special manager will have all necessary powers to discharge his functions, including having the sole authority over the directors and employees of the institution.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Finance can, having formed certain opinions, make a proposed subordinated liabilities order in respect of certain relevant institutions and then apply to the Court for an order in those terms.  A subordinated liabilities order operates to impose burden sharing on subordinated creditors in that institution.  In taking this action, the Minister may have regard to a number of specified matters, including the extent and nature of financial support provided to the relevant institution and the amount of the relevant institution's indebtedness to its subordinated creditors.  Furthermore, the Minister must be of the opinion, having consulted with the Central Bank, that the making of the subordinated liabilities order is necessary to secure achievement of the purpose of CISA or for the preservation or restoration of the financial position of the relevant institution.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Finance can make a proposed transfer order in respect of the transfer of assets or liabilities of a relevant institution and then apply to the court for an order in those terms.  Transfers can only be made to a willing transferee, and to facilitate such a transfer the Minister can provide financial incentives, including payments, loans and guarantees to the transferee.  CISA addresses the transfer of foreign assets and liabilities, including those situated outside the EU.<\/p><p>  CISA provides the possibility of recognition of the domestic measures to which I have just referred by other EU member states through the mechanism available in the European Communities (Reorganisation and Winding-up of Credit Institutions) Regulations 2011, which implement the credit institutions winding up directive in Ireland.  This is particularly important given that many measures entered into by Irish credit institutions are governed by the laws of other EU member states.<\/p><p>  CISA also contains provisions to ensure there is appropriate judicial supervision of the exercise of the Minister's powers after the making of proposed orders.  These include a formal requirement to obtain, in all but exceptional circumstances, a written submission from an institution prior to the exercise by the Minister of any particular power.  The Act also contains provisions for court involvement in the process on an <i>ex-parte <\/i>basis as part of the exercise of these powers by the Minister in order to ensure that the legislation offers appropriate legal and constitutional safeguards in light of the strong powers it confers on the Minister.  Certain parties can apply to the court for the setting aside of orders made under the Act, which the court can direct in certain circumstances.<\/p><p>  CISA powers have been exercised on 12 occasions, particularly in the first six months of 2011, during which the banking system was fundamentally restructured to meet the 31 July 2011 troika targets for the system.  Members will recall the announcement made by the Minister for Finance in March 2011 on subordinated debt and the range of measures he introduced on that occasion concerning the pillar banks, including the application he made before the courts in respect of junior bondholders' taking a substantial reduction on their holdings in some of the banks as part of that restructuring process.  It is fair to say that the overall cost of the exercise was substantially less than the cost we had anticipated at the time, given the subordinated debt reduction and the substantial sale of the majority holding in Bank of Ireland, which most investors would not have considered conceivable at the time of the March 2011 announcement.  On ten of these occasions, the use of the powers was assessed and sanctioned by the High Court as required by the Act.<\/p> <p>The most recent exercise of the powers was to enable the transfer of Irish Life to the Minister for Finance in March this year.<\/p><p> CISA enabled the Minister for Finance to take these essential actions quickly, efficiently and with legal clarity.  The degree of restructuring of the banking sector achieved would not have been possible without the all-encompassing powers contained within CISA.  Moreover, CISA was uniquely structured to prevent events of default on banks' financial instruments where restructuring intervention was necessary to achieve the Government's goals for the sector as a whole.  This allowed the restructuring to take place without triggering a right for the holders of senior bonds and derivatives to demand immediate repayment or termination.  I also note that the subordinated liability order mechanism under CISA was at the core of the State's ability to recover significant sums through the haircutting of subordinated or junior bondholders in the relevant institutions to which I referred.  To date, every application to the Irish courts made by the Minister for an order pursuant to CISA has been successful.<b><i><\/i><\/b><\/p><p> A great deal has happened in the Irish banking sector since the passing of CISA in December 2010.  The covered banks have continued to make overall progress under the financial measures programme, which was a rigorous analysis of the capital and liquidity requirements of the domestic banks presented in March 2011.  I have made the point to the House repeatedly that the Irish banking system is now more heavily capitalised than, say, the Swiss banking sector in terms of funds following the prudential capital assessment review, PCAR, process put in place by the State.  It has been hugely significant in terms of the ability of the Irish banks to do two things, the first of which is to stop the haemorrhaging of the outflows of deposits which was such a feature up to that time.  Thankfully, we have now begun to see money coming back into the Irish banks, although not in a hugely significant way - I do not want to over-egg the pudding - but certainly that trend has stopped.  The second aspect is the ability of the Irish banks, particularly the Irish pillar banks, to obtain funds on the inter-bank lending markets, something that was not conceivable or possible and did not happen for a very long period.  These banks have progressed in regard to their recapitalisation, asset deleveraging, that is, the selling of significant assets they have around the world, deposit inflows and restructuring plans.  The recapitalisation of the PCAR banks, that is, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB, and the IBRC has been successfully completed.<br \/><font color=\"#222222\"> In regard to deleveraging,<\/font><i><\/i>this has been progressed well and total covered bank deleveraging of about &#8364;63 billion had been achieved up to the end of September this year.  Further significant disposals have also been targeted for completion by the end of the current quarter of 2012 as part of the pillar banks' planned rundown of non-core balances.<\/p><p> As regards funding,<i><\/i>the banks' positions have improved significantly.  Deposits in AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB have stabilised, with a gain in net inflows achieved since last year; international debt markets have opened up to the Irish banks, as we have seen recently.  Both Bank of Ireland and AIB have managed to raise significant funds independent of any guarantee, which, again, would not have been thought possible a year and a half ago, but that has happened and is a very positive step.  As part of the EU-IMF programme, the Irish authorities submitted revised restructuring plans<i><\/i>for all participating institutions by the end of September this year.<\/p><p> In regard to the eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, scheme which was before the House recently, a working group chaired by the Department of Finance and involving both the Central Bank and the NTMA has developed a strategy to exit the scheme in a way that is consistent with preserving financial stability.  The initial indications from the strategy are that a withdrawal of the ELG scheme could occur in the first quarter of 2013.  When I was before the House recently, I made the point to Senators that the withdrawal of the ELG scheme would be a significant development and I hope that will occur in the early part of next year.  It would be a strong signal to the banking sector that it could then return to some profitability based on its ability to obtain funds independent of any guarantee into the future.  That would be part of the normal process of transformation one would expect for the pillar banks and I hope that will happen early in the new year.  Depositors will be given sufficient notice in advance of the withdrawal of the scheme and any change in that<i><\/i>regard will be brought to the attention of the Houses of the Oireachtas as part of that process.  The guarantee will remain for funds that have been guaranteed until the endpoint of the time for which they were taken out.  I understand a five year time limit has been set; therefore, the clock started at the beginning and will stop at the endpoint, independent of any guarantee in place.<\/p><p> The work carried out on the restructuring of Irish financial institutions using the various powers provided for under CISA is not yet complete.  Without retaining CISA powers for another period, it is unlikely the Government would be able to be complete the process.  In particular, it is expected that orders may be sought under CISA in a number of transactions, including possible further restructuring of the Irish banks that may require a direction order and-or transfer order to implement.  We have seen how a great deal of progress has been made in restructuring.  However, the process is not yet concluded and it is vital that the Minister for Finance continue to be empowered with the statutory authority and have very clear powers to take any remaining necessary step as may be appropriate to ensure the process is completed.  <\/p><p> The failures in the banking sector almost brought the country to its knees.  We need decisive powers to tackle the mess out of which we are getting.  Extending the period of effectiveness of CISA is imperative to being able to fully meet that objective.  The Governor of the Central Bank is in agreement with the Minister for Finance that the provisions of the Act should, therefore, be available for an extended period to the end of 2014.  I commend the motion to the House. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800056#MMM00400","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355855700,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for bringing the motion before the House.  Irrespective of whether we like it, it is necessary.  The Minister of State has outlined the progress made on the stabilisation of the banks which started some time ago and which all of us welcome.  My only comment is that when we note the passing of this important motion, the progress being made in the banks raising funds and that their capitalisation levels are greater than those of the Swiss banks, as the Minister of State mentioned, what is forgotten - I am not saying by the Minister of State specifically - is that we must ask ourselves what are the banks doing for the punter, the customer and the taxpayer who bailed them out.  I spoke at length last year on a similar motion and nothing much has changed in that regard.  Businesses still have difficulties in accessing credit.  We still do not have mortgage resolution measures that we were promised would be forwarded to the Central Bank by 30 September.  The banks have still not come up with cohesive policies on how to deal with that issue.  In this respect, there is one nut for the Government to crack and it is not just the game changer of the Personal Insolvency Bill the Minister of State mentioned but also provision for those who are struggling to pay their mortgages.  This needs to be done.  Unfortunately, we are in situation where we have to do whatever is required by the banks.  Thing are improving, which is great, but are things improving for the punter?  No, they are not.  We will support the motion, but let us move to deal with the real issues affecting people.  I am not diminishing the importance of the motion which we have supported since the inception of the measure.  We brought it forward in the first instance and there was no question of not supporting it.  However, early in the new year I would very much welcome - I ask the Minister of State directly for this - a decent and open discussion on what the banks are doing not only for mortgage holders with totally unsustainable debt but also for those who are just clinging on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800057#NNN00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1355855700,"counter":399,"content":"<p>As Senator Darragh O'Brien said, this is a necessary evil, as I would describe it.

The question that must be asked is what has he done with these powers.<\/p> <p>It is often passed over in the narrative that, under the Act, junior bondholders with investments worth &#8364;10 billion were burned.  People choose to ignore that this happened.  This effectively gives the Minister a<i>carte blanche<\/i>to do with the banks as he sees fit.<\/p><p> I am concerned about the &#8364;7 billion in recapitalisation funds for the banks, primarily for the mortgage loan book.  The period the funding was to cover was not specified.  I presume it will apply to the entire life of the mortgage loan book.  However, as we can see from the statistics of the Central Bank and other bodies, there has been practically no writing down to date.  I appreciate that the banks may be waiting to see how the personal insolvency legislation will work.  There is concern because, although &#8364;7 billion was invested, there was no definition in regard to buy-to-let properties, on the one hand, and the family home, on the other.<\/p><p> I note there is no sympathy for those who took a punt on buy-to-let properties.  There will be repossessions by the banks.  Perhaps there will be more sympathy over the course of next year.  I contend the personal insolvency provisions apply primarily to the family home, and I made this point when considering the personal insolvency legislation.<\/p><p> With the new powers, will the Minister be required to sanction further recapitalisation if the mortgage loan book goes in one direction, as is our concern?  While there is evidence that the rate is decreasing, we do not know for certain whether this trend will continue.  Will the burden of picking up the slack fall back on the shoulders of the taxpayer again?  The taxpayer would certainly not be pleased with this.<\/p><p> Consider the position if funds are needed to recapitalise the Bank of Ireland mortgage loan book, bearing in mind that the State owns 15% of the bank and that Mr. Wilbur Ross came with private equity to take it over.<\/p><p> We saw the belligerent attitude of the bank towards its mortgage holders.  It was not very pleasant.  We also saw its belligerent attitude towards the State when it was mooted that the Parliament building on College Green be taken over in the national interest close to the centenary celebrations of 2016.

Towards the end of his speech, the Minister of State said the failures of the banking sector almost brought the country to its knees.  The word \"almost\" might be deleted as the banks did a pretty good job in that regard.  With regard to the pillar banks, are we creating a future duopoly?  Might we have decided to break up the pillar banks?  \"Too big to fail\" can mean \"too expensive to save\".<\/p><p>When the legislation was first introduced on 15 December 2010, it was to give the Minister the powers necessary to ensure restructuring would occur as quickly as possible.  That has not happened, as is evident from our having to renew the legislation.  There is cause for complaint about the Irish banking system.  It is still property based.  Some of the banks are still lending at a rate of 70% in this regard.  They do not know the small and medium enterprises but are pretending they do.<\/p><p>No. 24 on the Order Paper is an attempt to change our mortgage credit model to the Danish model.  I hope the Minister of State's officials will brief him on it.  It is a question of having Irish banks take a real interest in small and medium enterprises because they have not been doing so.  Since the turn of the millennium, the banks went on a property binge and engaged in personal lending.  Hardly any of the money they borrowed abroad went into industry or agriculture.<\/p><p>The Minister originally wanted substantial and immediate recapitalisation of banks.  It is disappointing that we must renew the legislation in that case.<\/p><p>Part 3 of the Bill gave the Minister the power to appoint a special manager in banks.  There has been dissatisfaction over the rate of attrition of managers in banks.  The rate has increased somewhat but it is felt that the managers got off fairly lightly.<\/p><p>Part 6 provides that the overriding duty of the directors of the relevant institutions will be to the Minister for Finance on behalf of the State.  Previously, the directors had a primary duty to the company.  This week, the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform is to question the public interest directors.  They have all signed up to appear.  As far as the public is concerned, they have disappeared.  Although they are very eminent, do they talk to the public or say anything at all?  We will know better after the coming two days.  I am delighted the public interest directors have accepted the invitation to appear before the committee.  The committee was disappointed that they appeared to go native after their appointment to the boards rather than serve the public interest.  We asked the managers of the banks about the function of public interest directors.  The managers regard them very much as part of their team rather than representatives of Members in this House or the other House.<\/p><p>Part 7 states the Minister can impose terms and conditions that relate to the non-payment of bonuses, and that the institutions concerned must comply with this.  Bankers' bonuses still cause concern.  I hope the renewal of Part 7 of the Bill will allow the Minister to address that.<\/p><p>Other provisions to be renewed give rise to concern.  Sections 63 and 64 provide for the limitation of the judicial review and of certain rights of appeal to the Supreme Court.  One should not interfere with the powers of judicial review or the Supreme Court on behalf of any bankers.  Is it necessary to renew these provisions?  I presume we would not wish to have to enforce them.<\/p><p>Section 75 states the right of appeal pertaining to the points which the High Court certifies for appeal to the Supreme Court is limited.  Perhaps some of these measures were introduced in a hurry two years ago.  People are disappointed in the banks.<\/p><p>The Minister of State concluded by saying the goals were to demonstrate to external parties what we were trying to do and to have profound restructuring of the banking system.  How profound is it?  Is the system still based on property?  Does the sector have the expertise to perform the tasks the Minister of State and I would wish it to perform in regard to small and medium enterprises?<\/p><p>The last requirement was that we should be in conformity with the regulatory capital requirements set by the Central Bank.  People see in publications that Permanent TSB may need another \u20ac4 billion.  Anglo Irish Bank, irrespective of its new title, is still a highly unpopular institution.  I do not know its value to the country at all.<\/p><p>We still have not dealt with the legacy of the Irish banking system.  With regard to ghost estates, there are 82,000 empty houses.  The activities of NAMA continue to annoy many Members on all sides of the House.  Consider also the price of property being held up by forbearance.<\/p> <p>Senator Michael D'Arcy referred to it.  He wondered why we should defend buy-to-lets and he has little sympathy for them.  It means that banking may be worse than we feel that it is if those three artificial props were removed.<\/p><p>The late Deputy Brian Lenihan junior - and we remember him fondly - thought the crisis would be all over in two years.  Instead the legislation has had to be renewed.  There is still a lot of work to be done before the banking system serves the economy in the way in which every Senator wishes.  Some questions need to be asked.  How much of the legislation needs to be renewed?

The way the legislation has worked over the past year has changed my concerns a little.  Hindsight is great and it is a pity that we do not have the same gift of foresight.  It is a pity that the legislation was not in place when the banks ran into trouble, not so much at the time of the guarantee but from St. Patrick's Day when there was a massacre over the Anglo Irish Bank shares.  It was blindingly obvious then that something was seriously wrong with our banking system, particularly at Anglo Irish Bank which suffered a collapse of 15% in shares over that weekend.  The regulator responded by putting a halt to short selling but that was the extent of his intervention at the time.  Perhaps if legislation like this had been on the Statute Book at the time we might have been able to act more decisively.<\/p><p>It has been said that the legislation has given the Minister for Finance wide-ranging and extensive powers.

If there are indications that it has not succeeded will the Government introduce a different type of legislation?  This legislation is so wide-ranging that its effect can be anything or nothing so I would like to see more tightly focussed legislation.<\/p><p>It is self-evident that we need to appoint a special manager but it is a double-edged sword.  Is there a concern that confidence in an institution will be undermined if it is known in advance that the Government is considering appointing a special manager?  <\/p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien said that it is time to see real banking measures.  I contend that the legislation is a real measure.  We know what would have happened if we had not introduced it.  The aim was to restore stabilisation in the banks and at last deposits are being made in banks again as well as new overseas deposit accounts.  We have seen a substantial reduction in our tier 2 liabilities which is welcome and the banks have resumed acting as clearing houses.  They can find money on the private markets again but a year ago such a suggestion would have been laughed at.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett made a good point about the public interest directors and said that they have become feral.  Like the Minister, they should be less benign and should be feral.  The Senator said that they had been domesticated but had now gone native.  Perhaps it is time that the Government made a statement on the role of public interest directors because the general public misunderstands their role and I am not clear about it myself.  Perhaps the Minister of State would take two minutes to outline what the Government expects the directors to do.  <\/p><p>I shall finish even though I have more to say.  I welcome the evident success of the legislation which has led to the imminent withdrawal from the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.  That is very important.  It indicates the fragility of the banks.  Every time that we talk about banking and withdrawing or implementing something it is important that we reassure the public.  We must ensure that the House sends out a message that we are not withdrawing the deposit guarantee scheme.  It is important that we do that.     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800059#PPP00200","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1355856900,"counter":406,"content":"<p>D'airigh muid go leor leithsc\u00e9alta \u00f3 Sheanad\u00f3ir\u00ed an Rialtais.

The Act, alongside the banking guarantee, was a key pillar of Fianna F\u00e1il's disastrous banking policy for which we are all still paying the price.  Sinn F\u00e9in rejected it then and pointed out how dangerous the Act was.   It contained a sunset clause which shows how controversial it was.  The Act gave sweeping powers to the then Minister for Finance, the late Deputy Brian Lenihan.  As Deputy Michael Noonan, then in opposition, correctly pointed out: <blockquote>I am concerned about the role of the Governor of the Central Bank under this legislation.  I would have expected resolution legislation to have conferred the special powers on the Governor of the Central Bank, rather than on the Minister.  In this Bill the special powers are conferred on the Minister on all occasions.  There is a section which states that the independence of the Governor of the Central Bank is not affected, but the powers taken by the Minister and the lack of additional powers being given to the Governor of the Central Bank are quite noticeable.  <\/blockquote>  Senior bondholders should have been taken to the barbers at that time and given a haircut.  The sentiment was echoed by Deputy Leo Varadkar at the time when he said:   <blockquote>It does not contain any provision for the restructuring of the debts of senior bondholders, particularly those who are not under the guarantee.  There is perhaps up to &#8364;16 billion of taxpayers' money that could be saved by imposing and losses and haircuts on those bondholders.  That is the key change of policy that needs to happen when we have a change of government in this country because the people are not responsible for the debts of those banks and should not be held liable for them.  That is the big lacuna in this Bill.     <\/blockquote>  The Fianna F\u00e1il banking policy failed because it protected the banks at all costs.  It was a bad policy then and it is a bad policy now.  We know that the banks are still not lending to the real economy yet squeeze customers who simply cannot afford to pay their mortgages.  They are spinning the numbers and recycling lending.  They are not doing what they should and that is lending to the real economy.  <\/p><p>  In 2010 Fine Gael and the Labour Party did the right thing and rejected the legislation as being bad and rushed.  Deputy Joan Burton, then the Labour Party's finance spokesperson, echoed the sentiments by stating:<blockquote>Today's stopgap Bill is too little, too late.  It is too late because the horse has bolted since the expiry of the original bank guarantee, and too little because it does nothing to address the treatment of liabilities other than subordinated bondholders.  It fails to address the issue of senior bondholders now out of the guarantee, the debts for whom amount up to &#8364;20 billion.  <\/blockquote>  Today the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government seeks to extend the Act.  We shall vote on an extension of a failed law.  It has clearly failed as bank lending shows yet the Labour Party and Fine Gael is asking us to extend the legislation that they opposed under a Fianna F\u00e1il government.  Section 69 is designed to let the Act slip into history and it should be allowed to.  Sinn F\u00e9in will do what it did in 2010 by rejecting this bad legislation and I hope that others will show consistency too.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800059#PPP00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1355856900,"counter":407,"content":"<p>What did Sinn F\u00e9in do in September 2008?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800059#PPP00400","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1355856900,"counter":408,"content":"<p>The last Government's banking policy landed us in this mess.

When anyone speaks about banking  they say that the major issue affecting people is the pressure banks are putting people under and the lack of lending in the economy.  The Government has provided support to the banking sector in this State but that support is not being replicated through lending to the citizens.  The banks are not making money available in cases where it should be made available.  The only people lending money at the moment, whether in the small and medium enterprise sector or to individuals trying to upgrade their homes, for example, is the credit union institution.<\/p><p>The banks have questions to answer, and I agree with Senator Gilroy who asked about the public interest directors who sit on the boards of these banks.  The irony of the role of the public interest directors is that they have a fiduciary requirement to the bank but they are supposed to represent the taxpayer, and I am not sure how they can balance both responsibilities effectively and efficiently on behalf of the taxpayer.  I do not believe it can be done and therefore the State, and the Department of Finance in particular, has an enforcement role that is not being expedited as effectively as should be the case.<\/p><p>The issue of bankers' pay arises but that is only one part of the problem.  There are 27 bankers in the State in receipt of remuneration of at least \u20ac500,000.  One hundred and sixty seven former bankers employed at a senior level are in receipt of pensions of over \u20ac100,000.  At the same time those banks were providing loans to individuals based on available valuations but if a bank provided a loan on a property of, say, \u20ac200,000 and that person is now in negative equity and mortgage arrears, the bank has at least some responsibility to help cover the cost associated with the repayments of that loan if the individual concerned cannot meet the repayment.<\/p><p>One in four mortgage holders in the State is struggling and nothing is being done to support those mortgage holders.  While we are happy to support this motion the Government must take cognisance of the fact that 25% of mortgage holders are struggling.  The banks will put additional pressure on them in the new year, as we heard last week, and that will exacerbate the problem.<\/p><p>On the issue of the payment caps and the ongoing review, I understand Mercer's have been commissioned by the Minister for Finance to undertake a review of the salaries being paid in financial institutions and that that report was due back before Christmas.  What steps, if any, will the Minister of State or the Minister for Finance take to implement any recommendations in the report?  If he finds that the report is weak, would he be willing to consider bringing forward legislative proposals to legislate for bankers' pay in the State in the new year because it is an issue that must be addressed?<\/p><p>The current chairman of AIB was directly involved in the HSBC scandal which rocked America in recent months where over $2 billion was paid back by that institution to the American Government after a report which was commissioned by the United States Senate.  The individual who is now the chairman of AIB was named and damned in that 330 page report.  I have read some of the report and my question is whether the Minister, following that report which I am sure his Department has read, has full confidence in the current chairman of AIB Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800060#QQQ00100","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1355857500,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I thank all Members for their contributions which we very much welcome.  It is fair to say that the task facing this Government is to get the banks out of the accident and emergency ward and into the real economy where they can become profitable and start lending again and, most important, we get our money back from them.  I was before a finance committee meeting last week where I made the point that more than \u20ac20 billion has been taken from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  That is our money and we want to get it back because that money has gone directly into the pillar banks in the first phase of recapitalisation, with other money, and therefore it is in all our interests that we get that money back over a period.<\/p><p>I very much agree with the comments made by a colleague of Senator Barrett, Mr. Colm McCarthy, in University College Dublin who has said repeatedly that if we have a single currency there must be within that single currency a means through which we can resolve banks that go bust in a collective way.  America has a federal system where effectively banks that go bust because of bad lending policies are propped up and reserved by the totality of the lending that goes on within that federal system.  Europe has gone through this contortion of recent years because we have not had in place a single supervisory system, a proper means of resolution on an EU-wide basis, and a deposit guarantee scheme in place.<\/p><p>In the next six months Ireland, as President of the European Union, will play a pivotal role in the way we bring forward the next two steps towards banking union.  The agreement to have in place the European Central Bank as the single supervisory system is a crucial decision taken last week but now we must go on in terms of agreeing a resolution system and a deposit interest guarantee system which will underlay and retrofit the essence of having a single currency, about which the Minister for Finance has spoken.  I agree with Mr. Colm McCarthy who has spoken about that.  We must have within a single currency a single means of resolution, a guarantee and supervision.  We have not had that in Europe and we are now retrofitting the entire system to put that in place.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Michael D'Arcy who spoke about a necessary evil, and Senator Gilroy said it was a pity we did not have this in place when the collapse occurred but we did not because we all believed that the banks would continue on their merry way.  Extraordinary lessons have been learned from that and that is the reason it is important that this necessary evil remains in place.  <\/p><p>Senator Gilroy asked when I envisaged this coming to an end.  As I said to the House recently, the Government is confident that the eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, scheme will be brought to an end in the first part of next year.  That will be a substantial shot in the arm for the pillar banks in terms of returning them to profitability but we would still need to have this power in place to ensure that if things were to go wrong again the Minister for Finance would have the powers to take the steps required in terms of guaranteeing the public interest.  In the long term, however, one would hope to see an over-arching European Union scheme in place which would give this country, and other countries within the eurozone in particular, a guarantee in that respect.<\/p><p>My old friend, Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh, referred to the commitments made before the last election.  I want to inform him of what we committed to at that time.  We committed to restructuring the Irish banking system, and the first announcement made by the new Government in coming into office in March 2011 was exactly that following the results of the prudential capital assessment review, PCAR, test.  The second commitment we gave was that junior bondholders would take a bath, so to speak, and they have taken a substantial bath in that between \u20ac7 billion and \u20ac8 billion has been successfully transacted in terms of that announcement in March 2011.<\/p> <p> The third commitment we gave, while wanting to deal with the issue of senior bondholders and attempting to negotiate it, in our election manifesto, was that we would not take any unilateral action in this regard.  I remember it well because I was beside the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, as the deputy finance spokesperson in opposition.  Why did we say that?  We said it because the very funders who are keeping the country afloat, the ECB system which is continuing to fund emergency liquidity into the Irish banking system, and the view of those countries and, in particular the majority of the ECB, is that it should not happen.  I agree with the Senator that there remains a legacy issue.  That is what the Government is attempting to negotiate with our EU partners, the unique legacy issue that Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande have accepted needs to be resolved for Ireland.  This is a work in progress.  We have attempted to work this out since coming to office and both parties have shown a strong determination to get the country to a better place by renegotiating the debt position as a result of the legacy debts lefts by Anglo and other institutions.  We are determined to get a result for the country by diplomacy and clever political actions but not by throwing the baby out of the pram and certainly not in the circumstances where the national funding required for the country and the funding required for our broken banking system is coming from third parties who do not want us to do such a thing.  We remain hopeful that we can get the deal required.  <\/p><p> Everything we have done since coming into office has been in terms of the solid commitments we gave before the election as can be judged against that background.  I refer the Senator to our banking policy paper published in the manifesto a month before the last election and he will not point out one difference between what we said we would do in opposition and what we have done in government.  That is a test I put to him during the Christmas period if he is sitting in front of the fire.  He should take out our banking policy before the election and test it against what we have done.  We said we would introduce massive restructuring and we have done that.  We now have pillar banks.  We have a very substantial Department of Finance which has broken away with a new Department and has a strongly focused banking unit within it which deals on a bilateral basis with all of these banks on a daily basis.  All the old directors are gone.  We have had significant deleveraging of the banks, significant bank assets have been sold off and we have a much smaller banking system, as set out in our banking policy announced before the last election.  The objective is to move the banking system from intensive care into a more normal arrangement where we can get funds back into our banks on a consistent basis.<\/p><p> Points have been raised about the review issue.  A review of bankers' pay and bonuses is under way by Mercer which I understand has yet to come to the Department of Finance; the objective was by the end of this month.  Obviously it will be a matter for the Minister for Finance in the first instance to reflect on that review and to bring it to Government in due course.  We also said we would do that in March 2011 - we have done it.  It is a matter for Government as to when it will be published but I hope the review will meet the time in terms of what is required for bankers' pay and bonuses into the future.<\/p><p> I have noted comments made by colleagues on all sides concerning the public interest directors.  As Senator \u00d3 Domhnaill mentioned, they have a fiduciary requirement in that under company law they are responsible for the interest of the bank or the company but equally they have responsibilities on behalf of the public interest.  It is that balance they have got to strike in a circumstance where they do not report to the Minister for Finance on an annual or daily basis.  That is not their task; their task is to get the balance right between bringing the banks, of which they are members of the board, to a healthier position and representing the public interest.  I look forward to their engagement tomorrow at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  Since coming to office, the Government has not appointed any new public interest directors.  It is fair to say there is an open debate between the Department, the Minister and the Government about the role of the public interest directors and about their ambition and what they are at on a constant basis.  The Minister for Finance is open to hearing the views of the committee and Members of the House on the future role and objective of the public interest directors in a context where we have not appointed any of them.  This is not a diminution of the people in question who are of high standing and the role they play but there is an open debate on this question.  We would appreciate the views of colleagues on all sides in coming to a considered view as to the future role of public interest directors within the pillar banks. <\/p><p> I have answered the question on the review.  I agree with colleagues that the job of the banks is to go back to their traditional task which is to lend with prudential risk, to get money into the real economy.  We have given them a mandate of investing &#8364;21 billion over three years for each of the pillar banks into the real Irish economy.  We have given them the task of getting their mortgage books into a better state, about which we are all ambitious.  We will begin to see more progress next year once the insolvency Bill is through and the agency is working. <\/p><p>  I have taken a great interest in what the banks have said in their submission to the Central Bank concerning the new schemes which will be put in place.  They need to get on with the task in 2013.  I agree with the Governor of the Central Bank who spoke about the need for the banks to get on with the task of writing down some of the debt on a case-by-case basis where they believe that is appropriate.  The tools are in place through the insolvency legislation, therefore, there can be no more excuses.  It is worth saying that the banks have met their target so far.  Much of that lending is for the purpose of restructuring existing businesses.  Colleagues appear to think that is not new lending. It is new lending, because without that restructuring many of the jobs within those businesses would go belly up.  We have got to get the balance between absolute new lending when it comes to SMEs and restructuring existing debt to ensure those businesses can remain viable.  The Government has also put in place the micro loan financing scheme and the loan guarantee scheme as a means of helping those businesses that cannot get credit from the banks.<\/p><p> As to the future of the CISA we will have to wait and see.  This is a long process.  The progress made so far is leading to a more normalised banking system.  I note that according to the <i>Financial Times<\/i>Mr. Draghi of the ECB is the man of the year, I do not disagree with that selection.  He gave the banks across Europe three year funding at 1% and has consistently argued that one of the roles of the ECB is to buy up national bonds and debts.  Both policies appear to be working well.  When comparing the situation in December this year to December last year, are we in a better place?  Yes, we are.  Is Europe in a better place?  Yes, it is.  Have we seen progress in the past 12 months?  The six pack, the two pack, the fiscal treaty are in place and now there is agreement on a supervisory system and much more detail to come.  Enormous progress has been made during the year.  <\/p><p> In December 2011 people asked how many weeks Greece had got to go before it was out of the euro.  That question no longer applies.  The Greek issue has been resolved somewhat in terms of the new funds that have been put in place.  We are in a better place across the eurozone because of the actions taken by the political leadership across the euro area.  We are definitely in a better position because our banks have been well capitalised and have the funds and the means through which to get lending going again.  It is that nebulous confidence trick that is required not only to get lending going again but for lending to be drawn down.  There is little point in banks making funds available to businesses if they do not draw it down.  The Credit Review Office has consistently made the point that it is one thing for the banks to make moneys available, it is another for businesses to draw it down.  <\/p> <p>We saw the figures published today by the Department of Finance showing growth in GDP and GNP.  Our projections for this year have come in on target in terms of growth.  We are hopeful that next year we will see a significant improvement in GDP figures which will have an impact on the domestic economy.  The big task is to get people back to work as a result of the shock of some years ago where effectively 12.5% to 13% of GDP was knocked out over three years.  That is the task the Government faces in working with the banks to achieve what we want.  This motion is an essential pre-requisite to that in terms of giving significant powers to the Minister for Finance to take the measures he has to take.  These are the big stick powers required if a situation like this re-emerged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800060#QQQ00200","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355859000,"counter":413,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1355859000,"counter":414,"content":"<p>V\u00f3t\u00e1il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800063#TTT00150","nonspeaker":"Senators"},{"type":"speech","time":1355859000,"counter":415,"content":"<p>Will the Senators claiming a division please rise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800063#TTT00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355859000,"counter":416,"content":"<p>Senators David Cullinane and Trevor \u00d3 Clochartaigh rose.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355859000,"counter":417,"content":"<p>As fewer than five Members have risen I declare the question carried.

However, this is the first piece of good news for County Wexford in a very long time.  The figures for my county are stark.  Unemployment stood at nearly 25% at the end of the second quarter, which is one of the worst rates in the country.  According to the figures from census 2011, almost 13% of heads of household in the county are unemployed, which is the second highest rate in the country, and the youth unemployment rate, at 47%, is the third highest in the State.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation indicated while giving a presentation at a south-east forum that County Wexford received only three out of the IDA's 33 visits to the south east to attract foreign direct investment.  This is extremely disappointing in light of the statistics I have outlined.  Wexford is one if Ireland's largest counties and we are perceived as doing quite well because we are on the eastern seaboard and located relatively close to Dublin.  Three visits from the IDA do not instill confidence for the prospect of foreign direct investment in the county, however.

In the aftermath of the closure of TalkTalk last year I established a special group to focus on the south east because I recognise that it faces serious problems.  The structural rate of unemployment is much higher than elsewhere and the wave of investment which preceded the Celtic tiger years passed the region by.  The problem is not solely one of IDA companies, however.  The issue of regional development is broader than what at the end of the day comprises less than 8% of the total workforce nationally.  We must consider how best to utilise the region's many strengths and get the various groups to work together.<\/p><p>In the context of the action plan for jobs, Senator Michael D'Arcy and I recently attended a meeting to discuss progress in the south east.  While everyone recognises the significant problems that persist in the region, we have made an impact.  The IDA has paid much more attention to the south east, with the number of visits to the region increasing to 33 from 13 in the previous year.  IDA companies made three visits to Wexford, in addition to two visits by foreign companies under the food rubric of Enterprise Ireland.  This compares to a total of two visits over the previous five years.  While the number of visits could be said to be low, it is a dramatic improvement on what was previously the case.<\/p><p>The Senator acknowledged the welcome announcement by Eistech.  We need to examine sectors in which it is possible to develop regional strengths.  We have seen that with Eistech, which is an aggressive, growth-oriented company led by dynamic people.  The company was established a mere 12 months ago with nine employees but it now employs 400 and is committed to employing an additional 250 in the south east.  This is the sort of indigenous company we need to nurture and grow.<\/p><p>While we will continue to focus on investments by IDA companies in the south east, we must also build the region's strengths and nurture indigenous enterprise.  As part of the action plan for the south east, all of the agencies have examined their existing portfolios of companies to determine whether they had the capacity for expansion, and some did.  We also investigated the new start-ups and allocated competitive start-up funds.  These companies have generated new projects which we hope to develop further as job-creating projects.  This is a broad-based strategy and, while I acknowledge there is a long way to go, we are seeing a real effort by the agencies and a focus on an area that must contend with structural problems.  With the collaboration of agencies in my Department, along with education institutions and local authorities, we will build a coherent response to the challenges in the south east.

My understanding is that for children who have spina bifida and hydrocephalus there is a severe difficulty in accessing vital urology services.  My understanding is that the post of paediatric urologist was advertised but not filled and that while one person was interested in the post the position was not taken up, although it was offered.  My understanding is that in the long term because it is a specialist area the likelihood of the post being filled is remote.  My understanding is that the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London has offered to provide backup support and that there is a need for a more co-ordinated approach between the HSE and Great Ormond Street.  I am highlighting the issue because of parents of children in the Cork region.  At one stage they believed the problem was going to be resolved and that there would be a centre in Dublin to deal specifically with the matter.<\/p><p>It appears that the necessary backup support that the parents require is not in place and there is a need for a proper structure.  The set up is rather disjointed at the moment and they are concerned about this, especially for the long term.  Urology is a specialist area and it needs particular attention.  If treatment is provided to children at a younger age then the problems that arise can be dealt with far more effectively later on.  This is the reason the parents are particularly keen for a more co-ordinated approach between the HSE and Great Ormond Street to deal with the matter for the entire country.<\/p><p>I realise several additional paediatric consultants have been appointed in the past 18 months but none of them has this particular speciality.  At a meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children I asked whether some of the existing paediatricians could train or acquire the necessary skills.

I apologise on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, who is unable to be in the House this evening.  As Senator Burke noted, this is an important issue.  I understand Ireland has the highest incidence of spina bifida in the western world and therefore it is important that this issue is highlighted in the House.  Were the Minister here he would say that this is a complex issue concerning physical disability.  Children with spina bifida have multiple problems caused by the condition.  The majority of children and adults with spina bifida have hydrocephalus, to which Senator Burke referred.<\/p><p>Best practice recommends that multiple professionals are involved on a spina bifida team.  We know that on average 30 children per year are born in Ireland with open spina bifida, the most severe form.  I am aware that early intervention by a specialist and local team is essential to optimise the long-term functioning of these children and to prevent medical complications later in their lives.  The Children's University Hospital, Temple Street is the national tertiary care centre for spina bifida and hydrocephalus.  All infants born in Ireland with spina bifida are transferred to Temple Street after birth for ongoing neonatal management.  The model of care being developed by the HSE involves sharing care between the specialist team in Temple Street and the local team.  The best care should be provided nearest to the patient's home with guidance and support from the specialist team.  However, it is acknowledged that there are many complex issues which are best managed by the specialist team.<\/p><p>A multi-disciplinary spina bifida clinic was established in Temple Street last year in February 2011.  However, I am advised that there has been no dedicated urological input to date.  A recruitment process was under way in 2009 and 2010 from which the hospital had hoped to recruit a urologist.  Unfortunately the recruitment process found no suitable candidate for the post.  However, a new recruitment process is in train and it is hoped that the post will be re-advertised before the end of the year.  The HSE is hopeful that the new recruitment process will succeed in hiring a suitable candidate.<\/p><p>As an interim arrangement, children requiring urgent urological input are prioritised clinically and seen in the United Kingdom under the treatment abroad scheme.  Where a patient is refused access to the treatment abroad scheme the hospital is currently in final negotiations with St. George's Hospital in London with a view to having that hospital treat children pending the appointment of a permanent urologist.  Arrangements are currently being made to have a consultant visit from the UK to cover clinical priorities here.  In addition to the consultant urologist post, other key staff will also be required to develop the model of care, including, for example, in the areas of occupational health, continence, nurse management and orthopaedic surgery.  A business case is currently being developed by the HSE to progress the matter.  The Government is acutely aware of the challenges that patients with spina bifida and their families face in managing their condition.  I am committed to providing the best possible health service and will continue to work with the HSE to ensure the best possible outcomes for these patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800064#UUU00400","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1355859600,"counter":432,"content":"<p>Basically, this is an issue about co-ordination.

The failure to address the problem will lead to increased numbers of people with renal failure and they will require dialysis for the rest of their lives at a great cost to the State.  The parent concerned has suggested that even the simplest of procedures which should be available is not available in the Cork area at the moment.  Will the Minister of State relay this to the Minister for Health?  I will write to the Minister myself on the matter.  However, there seems to be a falling down in the follow up.

I am grateful to the Senator for raising this matter.  My understanding is that the Mac Diarmada family residence is located in a rural part of County Leitrim near the village of Kiltyclogher.  The site contains a collection of buildings centred around a traditional farm cottage residence and including a number of farm outbuildings.  The entire complex represents a very fine example of a vernacular farmstead typical of the era.  It comes under my responsibility as it is formally listed as a national monument in State care.<\/p><p>The property is in the ownership of the State and is cared for by the Office of Public Works national monuments service.  The Mac Diarmada homestead buildings are in generally good condition and do not require major intervention.  Indeed, the general view might be that a substantial intervention would alter their essential character and obliterate the very thing that makes them worth preserving.  There is, of course, a need for ongoing conservation of the collection of buildings.  The Office of Public Works is especially conscious of its obligations in view of the upcoming 1916 commemorations, when all of the properties in its care with a connection to this era - including the Pearse museum in St. Enda's, Rathfarnham, which is in my own constituency, and the Pearse cottage in Rosmuc, which is in Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh's constituency - will play an important part in the remembrance of these significant events in our national history.  <\/p><p>Along with the general approach to significant works on the site, it has been necessary to carry out a limited but substantial conservation project at the main residence.  I understand that the OPW has spent \u20ac30,000 on this in recent works.  It is important that the local community knows that such moneys have been expended on the site.  This is a traditional thatched building.  The roof suffered quite badly during the heavy snowfalls of recent winters, to a point at which both the external roof surface and the supporting structure were quite badly affected.  This year, the national monuments service of the OPW undertook a project to address these issues, and I am pleased to report that the problem has been fully rectified.  The roof has been rethatched and underlying structural improvements have been made, with a total investment in the site of \u20ac30,000.  The OPW is confident, therefore, that the building is in good condition and needs no further substantial work at this stage.  Closer to the time of the 1916 anniversary, my office will look afresh at the site and will address the position of the surface presentation so that the general appearance of the site and the buildings will be ready for any commemoration events.  <\/p><p>I will speak in reply to the main point raised by the Senator that resources should be directed towards the provision of tourist facilities and services at the Mac Diarmada homestead.  The OPW does not provide a guide service at this site and there are no proposals to do so in the short term.  Such a decision would involve substantial ongoing costs, which are a difficulty at this time.  Notwithstanding the current interest in sites associated with the 1916 Rising, the OPW is not certain there is sufficient level of interest in the long term to sustain such an operation.  There is as yet no compelling evidence to warrant the provision of such extensive visitor facilities.<\/p><p>The OPW strategy will, however, remain focused on ensuring that the opportunities to present the site are availed of where possible and that any interest manifested by visitors is catered for.  The OPW engages actively with the local community with regard to the site.  There is an active Se\u00e1n Mac Diarmada commemoration committee in County Leitrim with which the OPW engages by means of a contact based in the local library in Manorhamilton.  The OPW also facilitates small events, seminars, tours, etc., at the property as requested, in co-operation with interested locals.  I have encouraged the OPW to remain in contact with this group in order to build on its very good relationship with it.  <\/p><p>As the Senator may be aware, I have this year pioneered a new development in the OPW called the communities involvement initiative.  Properly constituted and insured local community-based groups interested in the development and promotion of such sites would co-operate with the OPW to help present such sites to visitors and other interested parties.  The OPW cannot possibly present a full visitor service at all of the many wonderful sites in its care.  However, it may be possible for it to enter into co-operative arrangements with other parties so that local knowledge can be utilised and sites can be opened for guided tour groups.  The OPW will, at my request, launch the community initiative for 2013 shortly.  I encourage this and other groups with an interest in our heritage to contact the OPW national monuments service in order to explore the possibilities presented.  The OPW is willing to work with local communities in order to make sites accessible for visitors.  This arrangement has worked very well at approximately 20 sites.  It is an effective handing over of a site to a local community in circumstances in which the OPW no longer has the funds to guide this.<\/p><p>I can assure the Senator - who is a friend of mine - that the next time I am in County Leitrim I will be more than happy to visit the Mac Diarmada homestead and meet the local committee in order to take the initiative forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800065#VVV00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1355860200,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

T\u00e1 m\u00e9 thar a bheith bu\u00edoch di as teacht isteach leis an gceist seo a fhreagairt.  The Minister will be aware of concerns raised previously about JobBridge.  We believe it is stopping the provision of real jobs and is leading to exploitation of workers.  There are many ludicrous examples of internships which are not real but which are being tolerated.  Vacancies for hotel receptionists, waitresses, car valets and telesales assistants are all advertised on the website as of 6 o'clock this evening.  These internships are potentially displacing real jobs.  It does not necessarily take 40 hours a week for nine months to learn how to clean a car, change a bed or carry plates.  All of these jobs are relatively easy to learn but they involve hard work and in our view this is work which should be paid for.<\/p><p>The level of unemployment and under-employment across all these fields is critically high.  JobBridge further reduces the number of paid jobs available.  The Government should be embarrassed to call this a jobs initiative.  In our view, JobBridge is the new minimum wage.<\/p><p>The Minister stated that JobBridge is a central plank of the Government's jobs strategy, but there is zero evidence of strategic thinking.  A genuine internship programme would improve a person's job prospects.  There are no jobs, so why should employers hire people when they can get them for free, courtesy of the State?  The scheme is so poorly designed that it is ripe for exploitation.  It needs to be significantly reformed.<\/p> <p>In 2010, the US Department of Labor produced six criteria governing internships, one of which provides that an employer cannot hire an intern for free unless he or she derives no immediate advantage from the intern's activities.  This is designed to ensure that an internship is a benevolent act by an employer, rather than a form of exploitation.  We would agree with this.<\/p><p>We have a number of concerns about the application of the JobBridge scheme, particularly in the public service.  We would like to know whether there is any vetting of those who take up these internships.  Are safeguards put in place for them during the course of their employment?  We do not suggest that those availing of schemes such as JobBridge should not be entitled to enter into jobs in the public service, for example in Departments, organisations, agencies and companies.  In such bodies, however, it is possible that they will come into contact with sensitive information and personal details, etc., some of which could be very important.  When we discussed the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012 last week, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, said that ten people had been brought into the bureau under the JobBridge scheme to clear the backlog of vetting applications.  That is where this concern arose.  We feel there is a need to ensure safeguards are in place so that JobBridge applicants who are employed in State bodies are monitored to ensure sensitive information is treated with the appropriate gravity and care.<\/p><p>The other concern we have that is specific to the public service is an obvious one.  The JobBridge scheme is meant to be a route to employment, but where is the employment in the public service?  The Government is quite proud of the recruitment embargo in the public service.  There is questionable value in forcing people to work for their welfare for a few months, in workplaces that need real full-time labour, before showing them the door again.  While they might pick up some experience, it is absurd that people who want to work and are keen to do so cannot be allowed to do the additional full-time work that needs to be done in parts of the public service.  We cannot match the two up.<\/p><p>We are concerned about the possibility of young interns being exploited, and we are particularly concerned about the possibility that the State would be exploiting them.  These interns will do what they can to impress and improve their knowledge.  Many fine, skilled young people are being lumped into Departments and agencies that are struggling to cope with their own workloads.  There is every possibility that the young people in question will find themselves exploited by having to cover enormous amounts of work far beyond their experience.  That is why I have asked the Minister this question this evening.  In light of the confirmation by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, last week that ten interns have been placed in the vetting bureau, it is important for us to get a breakdown of the number of JobBridge participants who got placements with State Departments, organisations, agencies or companies and were subsequently given employment by the bodies in question when those placements came to an end.  I ask the Minister to provide some clarification in response to that question.

It provides internship opportunities of six or nine months for unemployed people on the live register in organisations in the private, public, community and voluntary sectors.  Its aim is to assist in breaking the cycle whereby jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience.  It gives such people an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills in a working environment.  The JobBridge scheme has made significant progress since it came into operation on 1 July 2011.  Some 13,049 internships have commenced to date.  As of 13 December last, some 5,612 participants are on internships and some 2,235 opportunities are advertised on <i>jobbridge.ie<\/i>.  An interim evaluation of JobBridge, which was conducted by Indecon international economic consultants and published on 5 October 2012, found that 52.3% of JobBridge finishers have progressed into employment with their host organisation or another employer since finishing their internship.  As the study pointed out, this is one of the best outcomes in Europe for a work placement programme.<\/p><p>  I wish to advise the Senator that to date 2,645 placements, or 22% of the total, have been in the public service.  The interim evaluation report that was published by Indecon in October 2012 found that 49% of interns who finished their internships in the public sector are now in paid employment.  The report found that 27% of those interns who finished their placements in the public sector are now in paid employment with their host organisations.  The other 22% of interns who progressed into employment did so with other organisations.  A significant proportion of those progressing into employment with other organisations did so on foot of the high-quality skills and experience they gained during their internships.  For the purposes of the Indecon report, the public sector was deemed to include the community and voluntary sectors.  It must be acknowledged that the progression outcomes into employment from placements in the public sector are encouraging.<\/p><p>  One of the main benefits of JobBridge for interns is that the scheme gives participants an opportunity to gain new job skills and high-quality work experience.  Many interns consider that the scheme improves their chances of gaining employment.  Some 89.3% of interns believe JobBridge has given them new skills.  The scheme helps to boost participants' self-confidence, assists them in identifying job opportunities suitable to their abilities, keeps them close to the job market and helps them to establish contacts and networks.  The scheme has had positive effects on the subsequent employment chances of participants who would not have secured employment in the absence of the scheme.  The findings suggest the scheme has been an effective labour market intervention, in terms of achieving movement off the live register.<\/p><p>  JobBridge is a pillar of the Government's jobs initiative, which was announced in May 2011.  Its goal is to help people seeking employment to gain valuable work experience and enhance their prospects of getting a job.  I am delighted that an independent review of the scheme has found that this goal is being achieved.  This is a scheme for a particular set of people - those who unfortunately find themselves unemployed.  It is not for everybody.  I continuously meet people and their parents who tell me the scheme has been strongly positive for them.  The Senator will appreciate that it is very rewarding to hear that at a time when many fine people unfortunately find themselves without jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121800066#WWW00200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1355860800,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her reply, although I do not think she answered the specific question I asked.

I am aware of people with fantastic primary and master's degrees - even a number of people with PhDs - who have encountered such difficulties.  The Senator is profoundly wrong.  I invite him to examine the figures and think again.  Between 130,000 and 140,000 people leave the live register every year to take up employment in Ireland.<\/p> <p>We are not talking about people who might leave the country or drop out of the labour force.  They actually leave the live register to take up employment. The critical point in taking up employment is that one's best opportunity, particularly if one has just completed a course or is moving to a new career, is in being able to say to an employer not only that one wants to work for that person and has good educational or other qualifications but also that one has worked and has relevant experience.  One of the problems is that in the recession we could build up a cohort of people who would have many educational qualifications, some at a very high level, but who would never have had an opportunity to work.
