The State will convert its remaining Preference Shares (&euro;2.14 billion nominal) into &euro;2.67 billion of ordinary shares at a price to be agreed with AIB.  The cumulative effect of these measures, along with the expected issuance by the bank of Tier 2 and AT1 instruments, will provide AIB with a strong, market-facing capital structure and will facilitate the first significant return of capital to the State by AIB.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to other moneys expected to be recouped in the coming years, the conversion of a portion of the Preference Shares fast tracks the bank's ability to remunerate and redeem State aid through the bank's own cashflow and also opens up the possibility of the State monetising some of its equity investment through a sale process in the future.  While the conversion and redemption will bring to an end the annual payment of dividends on the Preference Shares it is important to note that the State will retain 99.8% ownership of AIB into the future.  Following this capital reorganisation I am confident that the bank will be capable of resuming ordinary dividends in the future helping to replace this lost income.  The future payment of these dividends is a matter for the Board of AIB and\u00a0its regulator and given the fiduciary and regulatory obligations involved, I cannot be specific about the exact timing and quantum that might be involved.<\/p>  <p>  As I stated in my Budget 2016 speech, the proceeds from the sale and redemption of the State's investments in the banks will be used to reduce the\u00a0general government debt.  However, any proceeds received beyond the lifetime of this Government, will be a matter for the next Government.<\/p>  <p>  The receipt of these monies will benefit the Exchequer, reduce the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement and result in debt reduction.  In this regard I would stress the importance of continuing to reduce Ireland's debt ratio over the medium term to ensure market confidence in Ireland and rebuild our fiscal capacity. <\/p>  <p>  The State also holds &euro;1.6 billion of contingent convertible capital notes (CoCos) in AIB which were issued on 26 July 2011 with a maturity date of 28 July 2016.  It is expected that the full value of the notes will be returned to the State by the bank on the maturity date.  This has been included in the baseline budgetary figures for Budget 2016.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that National Debt is the net debt incurred by the Exchequer after taking account of cash and other financial assets, while general government debt (GGD) is a measure of the total gross consolidated debt of the State compiled by the Central Statistics Office (CSO).  This is the measure used for comparative purposes across the European Union.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The redemption of &euro;1.36 billion of the State's Preference Shares for &euro;1.7 billion in cash, is expected to be received in the coming months.  Assuming all other things being equal, the general government debt will reduce by the &euro;1.7 billion in the year in which the cash is received.  Ceteris paribus, this would reduce the debt to GDP ratio by c. 0.75% of GDP. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800072#WRA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Corporation Tax Regime","counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800072#WRA01125"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[40380\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800072#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"for an explanation of the recent spike in corporate tax receipts; the extent to which it is linked to recent changes made in relation to the so-called double Irish and the knowledge box; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The approved reorganisation involves a number of elements including\u00a0a redemption of the State's Preference Shares to the value of &euro;1.7 billion in cash, as well as converting the remaining Preference Shares into Ordinary equity.  The reorganisation will generate\u00a0a substantial return of capital for the taxpayer and starts the process of the bank repaying the State for its substantial support. <\/p>  <p>  The reorganisation which involves\u00a0the removal of non-standard instruments from the bank's balance sheet is a mutually beneficial arrangement.  It allows the State to begin monetising its investment in the bank while allowing AIB make clear progress in its journey towards re-emerging as a competitive, investable bank.<\/p>  <p>  Between 2009 and 2011 the State invested &euro;20.8 billion in AIB, including investments in EBS which AIB acquired. I believe that, over the course of time, the State will be able to recoup all of that investment through interest, dividends, fees and, ultimately, the sale of our shares. <\/p>  <p>  As I have previously indicated, all capital returned from the State's investments in the Irish banks, will be used to reduce the national debt.  This is the prudent course of action,\u00a0it\u00a0reduces our ongoing borrowing costs and ensures the future strength and stability of our economy.  I have also indicated that while the Capital Reorganisation begins the process of the bank repaying the State aid it was granted, any decision to sell shares in the bank is a matter for the next Government.  Officials in my Department will however continue to work with the bank in the coming months to ensure that the next Government has optionality in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  On the second part of the Deputy's question, I would broadly agree with the views expressed by the outgoing Governor of the Central Bank regarding the lack of competition.  The Irish banking and financial services sector would benefit from increased competition, though we have made some progress\u00a0in this regard through initiatives such as the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), which facilitates competitive loans for Irish industry.  I would anticipate competition in the sector will continue to improve, driven by domestic or international institutions as the economy recovers, the housing sector normalises and demand for new business investment expands.<\/p>  <p>  While the dynamics of competition naturally affect the performance and profitability of AIB, this is true of any business.  The competitive environment is only one of many factors that influence the value of AIB and it will be up the next Government to decide on the appropriate timing of any sale of shares in the bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800072#WRA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":29,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[40180\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800072#WRA02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the proceeds from the sale of shares in Allied Irish Banks can be better utilised for capital projects rather than to reduce the State's debt; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This is due to the fact that is classified as a 'financial transaction' whereby it is essentially the exchange of one form of asset (shares, equities, loans) for another kind (cash). Consequently, the sale of any shareholding in Allied Irish Bank (AIB) would not count as general government revenue but any additional spending would be supplementary to existing expenditure projections.  Therefore, there will not be increased capacity to spend on capital projects as a result of the sale of shares in AIB without affecting the general government balance. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that as part of Budget 2016 a capital plan for the period 2016-2021 was prepared by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and published by the Government.  Compliance with the fiscal rules that apply to Ireland under the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact was taken into account in the formulation of the capital plan.<\/p>  <p>  However, while not improving the deficit cash proceeds arising from the sale of AIB shares would result in a reduced requirement for Exchequer borrowing which ultimately results in lower debt.  A lower debt level is not only beneficial in terms of the fiscal sustainability of the State but would also lead to reduced interest payments in future years.  The strategy of reducing the National debt is consistent with the Government policy of repaying the borrowing previously undertaken to finance the bailout of the banking sector during the financial crisis.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, therefore, my strong view is that public indebtedness rose partly due to the recapitalisation of the Banks; the appropriate way of treating one-off revenue from divesting the State of its banking assets is to use these proceeds towards debt reduction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800072#WRA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Loans Sale","counter":31,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800072#WRA02150"},{"type":"question","counter":32,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[40307\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800072#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if it is appropriate for the National Asset Management Agency Project Arrow to be completed, while investigations into the purchase of Project Eagle are ongoing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":33,"content":"<p> The Deputy is aware that all sales are conducted by NAMA in accordance with its statutory independent commercial mandate.\u00a0\u00a0Whilst I therefore have no role as Minister for Finance in such sales, I have full confidence in the transparent and competitive manner in which all NAMA sales are conducted.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Against that backdrop, the sale of the Project Arrow portfolio of loans by NAMA represents another significant deleveraging and risk mitigation milestone for NAMA.\u00a0 The cash proceeds raised from the sale will be applied towards redeeming NAMA's senior debt, which is guaranteed by the Irish State.<\/p>  <p>  This sale is fully in line with NAMA's publicly stated policy, in accordance with its obligations under Section 10 of the NAMA Act, of taking advantage, to the greatest extent possible, of favourable Irish market conditions to accelerate disposals in an orderly way with the target of redeeming 80% of its senior debt, a cumulative &euro;24 billion, by end 2016 and all of its senior debt by end 2018.\u00a0 Following on from the Section 227 review of NAMA which was conducted by my Department, I fully endorsed the NAMA Board's policy in this respect.\u00a0 In addition to ensuring, in accordance with Section 10 of the Act, that NAMA obtains the best achievable return for the State on its acquired bank assets, NAMA's accelerated deleveraging is creating wider collateral benefits for Ireland.\u00a0 This can be seen for example in terms of the creditworthiness of the sovereign.\u00a0 I welcome therefore the fact that, as signalled by this sale, NAMA will continue to take advantage of the current favourable market conditions to sell loans and assets at favourable pricing for the Irish State.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the sale of Project Arrow was conducted fully in accordance with NAMA's policy that the sale of all loans and the sale of properties by debtors and receivers should, wherever feasible, be openly marketed to ensure that the best price available in the market at the time of the sale is achieved in all instances.\u00a0 As has been publicly outlined by NAMA, Project Arrow was launched onto the open market on 6 July 2015.\u00a0 Reflecting the continued strong investor interest in Irish property, 17 prospective bidders were provided with access to the Phase 1 data room by Cushman and Wakefield, the\u00a0loan sale broker appointed by NAMA to execute\u00a0the sale.\u00a0 Indicative Phase 1 bids were received from five bidders on 14 August 2015 and three bidders were shortlisted by the NAMA Board for Phase 2.\u00a0 Binding and valid bids were received from two bidders on 12 October 2015 and clarification on elements of the two bids was sought and received subsequently.\u00a0 On 23 October 2015, NAMA announced Promontoria Holding 176 B.V. an affiliate of Cerberus Global Investors (\"Cerberus\") as the preferred bidder, subject to contract.\u00a0 The NAMA Board decision was based on the strong and clear recommendation of Cushman &amp;amp; Wakefield.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Cerberus has therefore emerged as the preferred bidder for the Project Arrow portfolio following an open market, robust and highly competitive sales process.

This will bring individuals into the charge to PRSI on a more gradual basis and will ensure that many low income earners will see an improvement in their net incomes.  This will remove a disincentive for employees to supply labour in the range of incomes affected by the PRSI step, which should be of benefit to employers in terms of employee availability for work.<\/p>  <p>  The entry point to the top rate of employer's PRSI is also being increased by &euro;20 per week to &euro;376 per week with effect from January 2016.\u00a0 This will ensure that the increase in the minimum wage does not result in the weekly income of a full-time minimum-wage worker entering into the higher rate of employer's PRSI. This will ameliorate the cost of the minimum wage increase to retail employers.  The PRSI changes are being brought forward by my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, in the current Social Welfare Bill.<\/p>  <p>  In my Budget speech, I referred to a number of measures which would support retailers and other merchants by reducing costs and incentivising electronic payments.  At present, the fees retailers in Ireland face for accepting card payments are excessive.  A new EU regulation is halving interchange fees to 30 basis points for credit cards, and the corresponding fee for domestic debit cards will be halved to 10 basis points.  These changes significantly reduce the costs of accepting card payments and, combined, these reductions will save retailers an estimated &euro;36 million in fees per year.  These changes come into effect on 9 December this year.\u00a0 In addition, the transaction limit on contactless payment cards was raised from &euro;15 to &euro;30 on 31 of October.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  To support these EU and industry changes, I decided to abolish the stamp duty charge on debit\/cash machine cards\u00a0and replace it with a 12c per transaction charge for withdrawing cash from an ATM, capped at an annual maximum of &euro;2.50 or &euro;5, depending on card type.  There will be no charge for debit card transactions.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2016 I also announced also a number of measures which, while not specifically targeted at the retail sector, would be applicable there.<\/p>  <p>  The Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) is targeted at job creation and retention and provides tax relief for investment in qualifying SMEs.  The scheme allows an individual investor to obtain income tax relief on investments, up to a maximum of &euro;150,000 per annum.  Relief is initially available to an individual up to a maximum of 30% of the amount invested.  A further 10% tax relief is available where it has been proven that employment levels have increased at the company after 3 years or where evidence is provided that the company used the capital raised for expenditure on research and development.

When the application process is finalised, the Registry will provide an application form and explanatory notes in order to assist credit unions.

In September I concluded a series of\u00a0follow up meetings with these banks and the reality is that\u00a0the majority have put options in place to allow borrowers reduce their repayments. <\/p>  <p>  It is up to the individual banks themselves to advertise their rates and products but as I am sure you are aware, some banks have focussed on fixed rate offerings\u00a0or rates based on loan-to-value, while others have\u00a0reduced their variable rates. \u00a0I had asked the banks to provide options by which borrowers could reduce their monthly repayments and I believe options have been put in place.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, it is a matter for each individual borrower to\u00a0decide what suits their circumstances but I encourage borrowers to contact their bank to see what is available to them or consider moving to another bank, where possible, if the offer is not satisfactory.  For example, some fixed rates are now substantially lower than some variable rate products and therefore could result in significant savings for customers.<\/p>  <p>  The reality of the situation is that\u00a0the majority of lenders have put options in place to allow borrowers reduce their repayments, however my Department will continue to keep the situation under review. <\/p>  <p>  There has been discussion in the public domain regarding whether the regulation of interest rates would lead to a reduction in mortgage costs for borrowers.  I believe that competition rather than regulation represents the best long term solution to this issue and Central Bank and ESRI research supports this position. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard,\u00a0the Governor of the Central Bank has indicated his opposition to the administrative control of interest rates.  While he acknowledged that a reduction in bank interest rates benefit the economy at large, it was his firm belief that the introduction of administrative control on interest rates in Ireland would be bad for the country as a whole in the medium term including because of its negative effect on the entry of other banks to the market.<\/p>  <p>  You will also be aware that on 12 November the Central Bank published a consultation paper on proposed increased protections for variable rate mortgage customers.

Following on from that, an implementation timetable for the 2012\u00a0Act was devised in consultation with stakeholders, including credit union representative bodies.<\/p>  <p>  Commencement of all sections of the 2012 Act has been aligned with the credit union financial year and the introduction of the underpinning Central Bank regulations, with a view to implementation of the 2012 Act in a coherent and cohesive manner. This has provided credit unions with the time necessary to ensure that\u00a0the required processes\u00a0and procedures are in place prior to implementation of each tranche.<\/p>  <p>  I have met with the three credit union representative bodies and the perceived impact of the new regulations was discussed. It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations by the Registrar of Credit Unions.\u00a0These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the Central Bank's feedback statement on CP88, as part of the consultation process I proposed that in the interests of clarity and fairness, credit unions are provided with details of the process of applying for a retention of savings above the limit amount.\u00a0 I have been informed by the Registry of Credit Unions that all credit unions have been contacted giving further information on its application criteria for the retention of savings in excess of &euro;100,000.\u00a0 The Registry of Credit Unions intends to engage with the representative bodies and to invite comments from them prior to finalisation of the application process. When the application process is finalised, the Registry will provide an application form and explanatory notes in order to assist credit unions. It is anticipated that application forms will be available during December 2015.\u00a0 It is envisaged that applications will be accepted in the first quarter of 2016 and that applicant credit unions will be informed by the end of the second quarter of 2016 on the outcome of the process, which is well within the 12 month transitional period. Where a credit union has demonstrated that it meets the criteria, it will be in a position to retain members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000 held at the commencement of the regulations. <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the steps that have been taken to provide clarity for credit unions on the criteria for the retention of savings over &euro;100,000 and also welcome the Central Bank proposed engagement with the representative bodies to seek their comments on the application process.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also informed me that it is committed to undertaking a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit, once the impact of the restructuring process can be assessed. It is envisaged that this review will commence within three years of the introduction of the regulations. My officials have asked the Central Bank to consider accelerating  this review and this is under consideration by the Central Bank. The Central Bank has agreed to provide regular updates to my Department on developments in this matter.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that it has been necessary to put lending restrictions in place in credit unions where there are regulatory concerns and resultant risk to members' savings. These  lending restrictions are\u00a0reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether or not they are still set at appropriate levels.<\/p>  <p>  In February 2015 the Central Bank commenced a lending restriction review initiative, whereby credit unions that are subject to a lending restriction, but are satisfied that they have made the necessary improvements and have embedded these improvements in robust risk sensitive lending practices, could apply for a review of their lending restriction. The closing date for receipt of applications to review lending restrictions under this initiative was 30 September 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank further informs me that 59% of applications received have been reviewed.\u00a0 Of the applications which have been fully reviewed, 83% have had their lending restriction lifted and are now operating under the board's stated credit risk appetite. C.40% of credit unions that applied made their application in September. These applications are currently under review.<\/p>  <p>  This review has reduced the number of credit unions with lending restrictions as currently approximately 39% of credit unions have a lending restriction compared with 52% at the start of the review process.<\/p>  <p>  As indicated in the Central Bank consultation paper CP88, where credit unions can demonstrate improvements in their credit risk management practices in line with strengthened regulatory framework, it is anticipated that the use of credit union specific lending restrictions as a regulatory tool will reduce over time.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further informed me that it has now contacted all credit unions inviting them to attend upcoming information seminars being held around the country from 17 to 30 November. These seminars will provide credit unions with the opportunity to engage with the Central Bank\u00a0 on the new regulations and to discuss development of the credit union business model,\u00a0including any changes to the regulatory framework that might be required to facilitate those developments.\u00a0 This engagement will also enable the Central Bank gain a better understanding of the sector's objectives regarding longer term lending, including the provision of\u00a0 mortgages to members. and to review the conditions that currently apply for credit unions to be approved to extend their longer term lending limits.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is\u00a0absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800078#WRG01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":175,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[40764\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800079#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding credit unions and the regulatory reserve ratio; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":176,"content":"<p>The issue of the regulatory reserve ratio for credit unions is a matter for the\u00a0Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank who is the independent regulator for credit unions.\u00a0 Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the rationale for the introduction of a 10% Regulatory Reserve Ratio in 2009 took account of a number of factors including the World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU) recommendation of 10% of assets, the level of reserves in the sector at that time and the limited ability for Irish credit unions to raise capital compared to credit unions in other jurisdictions and other financial institutions (credit union reserves are only generated from retained earnings).<\/p>  <p>  I have\u00a0further been informed that in relation to a risk weighted approach to reserves, as previously indicated consideration will be given to a risk weighted approach by the Central Bank post sector restructuring.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is\u00a0absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800079#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":178,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[40765\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800079#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding credit unions and the use of surplus funds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":179,"content":"<p>The issue of credit union investments is a matter for the\u00a0Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank who is the independent regulator for credit unions.\u00a0 Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.<\/p>  <p>  Section 44 of the Credit Union Act, 1997 provides that a credit union may establish a special fund to be used by the credit union for such social, cultural or charitable purposes (including community development) where it is approved by a resolution passed by a majority of its members present and voting at a general meeting. Funds established under section 44 do not require the approval of the Central Bank.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that it\u00a0is supportive of such initiatives by credit unions provided they fall within the provisions of section 44. These provisions include a requirement that funds paid into such a special fund can only be paid out of the annual operating surplus of a credit union and that no funds may be paid into such a special fund unless adequate provision has been made out of the annual surplus to cover all current and contingent liabilities and to maintain proper reserves.\u00a0The payment of\u00a0funds into the special fund\u00a0should not affect the financial stability of the credit union. In addition section 44(3) of the 1997 Act specifies that the amount of funds which may be paid out of the annual operating surplus into such special fund shall not exceed 0.5% of the value of the credit union's assets.

We discussed NAMA's involvement in Northern Ireland's economy generally and the recent interest expressed in NAMA's Northern Ireland portfolio.<\/p>  <p>  NAMA's strategy in Northern Ireland was aimed at generating sustainable activity and transactions in the Northern Ireland property market both through orderly sales and through targeted initiatives such as vendor finance and joint ventures that were designed to overcome the lack of funding in the market and enhance the future value of Northern Ireland assets through a programme of investment funding.<\/p>  <p>  We also discussed how NAMA's concerns reflected the concerns of members of the Northern Ireland Executive about the negative impact\u00a0\"fire sales\" would have on the economy.<\/p>  <p>  We discussed the very strong level of engagement NAMA had in Northern Ireland with all key stakeholders, which was supported by NAMA's Northern Ireland Advisory Committee.\u00a0 NAMA was investing to enhance the value of its assets in Northern Ireland and had advanced significant amounts of new money into the Northern Ireland economy to assist in such projects as the construction of a new 95-unit housing development in Milmount, Dundonald, close to Belfast and to complete Lanyon Plaza and the Soloist Building which form part of a landmark office development in the centre of Belfast. This investment came at a time when there were very few other sources of funding for projects in Northern Ireland. As was also\u00a0being reported in the press at the time, NAMA was working closely with local housing authorities and approved housing bodies in Northern Ireland and had recently announced the sale of over 50 apartments to Oaklee Housing Association in Belfast.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware,\u00a0prior to this meeting, on 24 June 2013, I had\u00a0received\u00a0an unsolicited\u00a0expression of interest for the NAMA Northern Ireland Loan Book, via\u00a0the then\u00a0NI Minister for Finance Sammy Wilson, from Brown Rudnick on behalf of its client, PIMCO.<\/p>  <p>  The Brown Rudnick letter had suggested a semi-exclusive sales process and put forward\u00a0a number of suggestions regarding the future management of the portfolio for Minister Wilson to consider.\u00a0 Typically this\u00a0would\u00a0not be\u00a0a cause for concern.\u00a0 An\u00a0interested party\u00a0will often seek a closed or exclusive sales process because it is in their interest to remove competition and increase their chances of success.\u00a0 So, while it may have been\u00a0somewhat naive to suggest such an approach, it was not surprising and gave me no cause for concern as\u00a0I was aware NAMA would favour conducting an open market process for any such\u00a0sale.<\/p>  <p>  In my reply to Minister Wilson, of 25 July 2013, I\u00a0advised that Brown Rudnick should approach NAMA directly with their expression of interest and clarified that NAMA would not run an exclusive process but would have to run a competitive and transparent sales process.\u00a0 At that time,\u00a0I also referred the letter I had received to NAMA for their information.<\/p>  <p>  These documents are in the public domain and are available on the Department of Finance website.<\/p>  <p>  Following my receipt of this letter and prior to this meeting in Stormont, NAMA also had\u00a0received a third party approach\u00a0on\u00a0behalf of PIMCO\u00a0to sell the loan portfolio on an exclusive basis.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of these communications, it was known to all at the meeting that an interest had been expressed on behalf of PIMCO\u00a0in acquiring NAMA's Northern Ireland portfolio on an exclusive basis.<\/p>  <p>  During the meeting\u00a0I stressed two key considerations that NAMA would have to take into account in any potential sale: process and price.\u00a0 That is,\u00a0NAMA would not enter into any exclusive sales process, as this would militate against achieving best value for its assets.\u00a0 Rather, if a sales process was undertaken, NAMA would openly market its assets as part of a competitive process.\u00a0 Furthermore, NAMA would have to be satisfied that it had achieved best value.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledged that, to my knowledge, at that point in time,\u00a0only one party had expressed interest in acquiring NAMA's Northern Ireland portfolio\u00a0which we know was PIMCO.\u00a0 I acknowledged this during the meeting as a challenge to moving forward with PIMCO's\u00a0interest, pointing\u00a0out\u00a0that a sales process could not be undertaken\u00a0with a single interested party.\u00a0\u00a0As I had stated\u00a0previously in my reply to Minister Wilson on 25 July 2013,\u00a0a single expression of interest\u00a0would present a\u00a0challenge because NAMA would not launch an exclusive sales process.<\/p>  <p>  However,\u00a0I indicated that there was likely to be a way forward if this expression of interest was credible.\u00a0 It\u00a0was reasonable to expect that\u00a0if one party had expressed credible interest, there may be other parties who may also be interested.\u00a0 I indicated\u00a0that as in the past, as the result of single expressions of interest, it was open to NAMA to test the market and determine if there was sufficient interest (i.e. other interested parties)\u00a0to conduct an open sales process that would\u00a0maximise value.<\/p>  <p>  As\u00a0is now well established,\u00a0following\u00a0the expression of interest from PIMCO, NAMA did test the market interest in its Northern Ireland loan book and ultimately appointed Lazard, a major international investment bank, in January 2014 to advise on and oversee the sales process for Project Eagle.\u00a0 Based on its assessment of the market, Lazard invited eight other major global investment groups, alongside PIMCO, to participate in the process.\u00a0 NAMA,\u00a0in line with its well established policy on asset and loan sales, instigated a competitive market sales process in February 2014.<\/p>  <p>  Sales processes often emerge through reverse enquiries.\u00a0 This is a normal commercial practice\u00a0in any market.\u00a0 After an approach is made at an attractive price, the key for NAMA is to test that by reference to an open market process, which was clearly the case in this instance.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to the recently published minute of this meeting taken\u00a0by the Private Secretary to the First Minister, I would point out that - while not inaccurate - this was not an agreed minute of the meeting and so would not have had the benefit of comment\u00a0by myself or my officials.\u00a0 The minute would naturally have reflected\u00a0the elements\u00a0of the meeting deemed most important by the minute taker and as it is not a verbatim record of a meeting\u00a0will naturally\u00a0reflect the minute taker's interpretation of what was said as opposed to what may have actually been said or intended.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding\u00a0a reference to \"working together\"\u00a0in the minute -\u00a0as I have\u00a0previously outlined (PQ41 of 3 October 2013)\u00a0both sides shared an understanding of the importance of NAMA\u00a0to the economy in Northern Ireland and\u00a0the care\u00a0needed\u00a0in\u00a0dealings in Northern Ireland regarding\u00a0NAMA's management of the portfolio.\u00a0 I did not intend to imply that my\u00a0administration would work with PIMCO or\u00a0any other\u00a0potential buyers in any way but rather\u00a0I would have expressed my confidence that NAMA would be able to work with potential buyers to overcome any difficulties and I would have committed to maintaining an open dialogue between administrations to the extent that was helpful.<\/p>  <p>  As is on the public record, subsequent to this meeting, I\u00a0discussed the progress of the sales process on a limited number of occasions with my counterparts in the Northern Ireland Executive.\u00a0 Through all of these discussions, I made it clear and maintained that the commercial decisions, as always,\u00a0remained solely  for NAMA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800079#WRH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Liquor Licence Data","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800080#WRJ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[40885\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800080#WRJ00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"to set out the number of publican licences issued for each of the years 2011 to 2015 to date by category and based on the cost of licence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1207","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of publican licences issued during the licensing years (i.e. years ended 30 September) 2011 to 2015 inclusive, broken down by category based on cost of licence, are as set out in the following table.<\/p><p>Number of Publican Licences Issued 2011 to 2015.<table><tr><th>Turnover Band &euro;<\/th><th>Duty\/Cost <\/th><th>No. Issued2011<\/th><th>No.Issued2012<\/th><th>No. Issued2013<\/th><th>No. Issued2014<\/th><th>No. Issued2015<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>0 -

The latest data show that\u00a0GDP increased by 6.7 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter of this year. This comes on the back of an\u00a0increase of 7.2 per cent in the first quarter. As a result, GDP per capita is now above its pre-crisis peak. In Budget 2016, published in October of this year,\u00a0my Department forecast that\u00a0the economy would\u00a0grow by 6.2 per cent in 2015\u00a0and\u00a04.3 per cent in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the recovery is now being felt in the domestic economy with consumption up over 3 per cent in the first half of this year and investment up over 20 per cent. In fact, last year domestic demand made its strongest positive contribution to economic growth since the crisis began. This is very important as the domestic sectors are both jobs-rich and tax-rich. The external sector is also showing continuing signs of growth with exports increasing by almost 14 per cent\u00a0in the first half of this year.<\/p>  <p>  The economic recovery is also clearly evident in the labour market where we have now had twelve successive quarters of solid annual employment growth. As a result, the unemployment rate has fallen by over 6 percentage points since its peak in early 2012.<\/p>  <p>  The recovery is also helping improve Ireland's credit rating. The impact of the economic and financial crisis resulted in a number of rapid downgrades to Ireland's credit rating. For example, Moody's reduced Ireland's rating from AAA to sub investment grade within 24 months. Importantly, Moody's returned Ireland to investment grade at the start of 2014 as the Government's fiscal and economic strategy began to bear fruit. 2014 also saw Standard and Poor's and Fitch increase their credit ratings to an A rating.<\/p>  <p>  Over the medium term, my Department expects that\u00a0the economy can\u00a0grow by around 3\u00a0per cent per annum on a sustainable basis. However, achieving a sustained economic recovery cannot be taken for granted and is contingent upon a number of factors including sustainable public finances, maintaining our competitiveness position and ensuring inflationary pressures remain in check over the medium term.<\/p>  <p>  Substantial progress has been made in terms of improving Ireland's competitiveness in recent years.  There has been a significant improvement in Ireland's economy-wide cost competitiveness. The European Commission in its autumn\u00a0forecasts estimated\u00a0that relative\u00a0unit labour costs in Ireland\u00a0fell by 1.6 per cent annually\u00a0in 2015. This is one of the largest declines across all EU Member States and compares with a 0.4 per cent fall in the EU, and increases of 1.2 per cent in the UK and 0.3 per cent in the US over the same period. Competitiveness gains have been achieved through productivity improvements. In fact, according to Commission forecasts, Ireland experienced the fastest productivity growth in the EU this year.<\/p>  <p>  It is vitally important that this competitiveness is\u00a0preserved and continues to support growth.  We must also be cognisant that recent favourable exchange rate movements and gains from the fall in oil prices\u00a0may unwind in the future.\u00a0 Therefore, we need to stay focused on continuing to improve\u00a0Ireland's competitiveness through other channels such as wage and price restraint and productivity improvements.<\/p>  <p>  For instance, relatively low consumer price inflation over the last five years has meant that Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to our euro area peers. In fact, annual HICP inflation in Ireland has been below that of the euro area average for every year since 2008.<\/p>  <p>  Inflationary pressures remain subdued with annual HICP inflation at 0.0 per cent to end-October. The main factor depressing inflation over the past year or so has been energy prices.  Core inflation - which strips out energy and unprocessed food - is a better indication of underlying developments in the domestic economy and has averaged 1.2 per cent over the past year.  It is anticipated that the annual rate of inflation will\u00a0pick-up gradually\u00a0as the domestic recovery continues, supported by quantitative easing, to rates\u00a0consistent with\u00a0price stability, i.e. close to but below 2 per cent, without the need for corrective action.<\/p>  <p>  As well as monitoring the overall performance of the economy, my Department also monitors individual sectors on an ongoing basis.  Key sectors of the economy are subject to scrutiny as part of this process and inflation is one, of many, economic indicators that is carefully analysed. My approach has been to help rebuild the economy sector-by-sector, by implementing targeted measures to support the most affected sectors. Government policy will continue to monitor for and to guard against the build-up of sectoral imbalances and to avoid over-dependence on a single sector, as was previously the case with Ireland's construction sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800080#WRJ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Arrears Proposals","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800080#WRJ01150"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[40892\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800080#WRJ01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"to outline the extent to which he continues to monitor the manner in which the various banks continue to accommodate customers who have found themselves in difficulty during the past number of years, with particular reference to the need to ensure a positive accommodation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[40902\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800080#WRJ01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"to outline the extent to which the level of mortgage arrears continues to be managed in a way that accommodates the circumstances of borrowers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":209,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 83 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank publishes Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions Statistics on a quarterly basis.<\/p>  <p>  Statistics for quarter 2 of this year were published in early September.  This publication provided further evidence that progress is being made in addressing mortgage arrears.  In summary, the position is:<\/p>  <p>1.  Quarter 2 2015 marks the eight consecutive quarter of decline in the number of mortgage accounts for principal dwelling houses in arrears.  This cohort has declined by 6.3 per cent relative to Q1 2015.<\/p>  <p>2.  Over 118,500 PDH mortgage accounts were classified as restructured at end-June, reflecting a quarter-on-quarter increase in restructured accounts of 1.9 per cent,  86.3 per cent of which were deemed to be meeting the terms of their current restructure arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  Based on Central Bank data, mortgage accounts with no arrears now make up 87% of all mortgage accounts.  The continuing improvement in data trends shown in the Central Bank quarter 2 mortgage arrears returns are welcome and show that where there is meaningful engagement between lender and borrower, in the majority of cases an outcome that is beneficial to both parties can be reached.<\/p>  <p>  In addition my Department continues to monitor and publishes Mortgage Restructures data on a monthly basis that covers mortgage accounts for the six main lenders. The figures in the latest publication for September 2015 (published on 12 November 2015) show that Primary Dwelling Home (PDH) mortgage accounts in arrears continue to decline and now stand at 73,060 representing an improvement of almost 24% compared to September 2014.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I must reiterate that active engagement by indebted borrowers\u00a0with their lender\u00a0is key to achieving a\u00a0sustainable resolution, and I would urge borrowers in arrears, who have not already done so, to take that first step by contacting their lender directly or MABS for an\u00a0independent assessment of their situation and\u00a0advice on available resolution options.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800080#WRJ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises Supports","counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800080#WRJ01450"},{"type":"question","counter":211,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[40893\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800080#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"to outline the extent to which he expects credit availability to small and medium-sized enterprises to improve in line with requirements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":212,"content":"<p>In terms of credit availability to SMEs\u00a0from the banking sector,\u00a0I would draw the Deputy's attention to the recently published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey April - September 2015 (). A\u00a0total of 1,500 telephone interviews were conducted with a random sample of Irish micro, small and medium SMEs. The survey shows that, when pending applications are excluded, 85% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved. Both AIB and Bank of Ireland have increased new lending significantly year on year. Bank of Ireland recently announced new credit approvals for Irish businesses to the end of September 2015 of &euro;3.6 billion, up c.13% on the same period last year. Permanent TSB have also recently commenced lending to SMEs. The Credit Review Office (CRO) continues to review loan applications which have been rejected by the banks and is overturning 55% of appeals. I would encourage any SME who has had a credit application declined to avail of the services of the CRO ().<\/p><p>The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland's (SBCI)\u00a0mandate and objectives include the fostering and driving of competition in SME lending through the provision of low cost long term funding to both banks and non-bank providers of credit to SMEs.  In doing so, it seeks to facilitate the growth of smaller participants and the entry of new market participants by providing them with the low cost liquidity that will enable them to compete with the larger banks.\u00a0 SBCI funding is offered on substantially the same terms and the same price to all SME credit providers that are credible, credit worthy, can meet its operational requirements and pass on the benefit of the lower cost funding to their SME clients.\u00a0 This creates a new forum for competition in the use of SBCI funding between banks and non-banks and enables emerging and newly entering SME credit platforms to grow their businesses.  Over 3,200 Irish SMEs benefitted from SBCI loans in the SBCI's first\u00a0seven months in operation (March to\u00a0September 2015), borrowing &euro;110 million in total through AIB and Bank of Ireland.\u00a0More recently, the SBCI has announced its support for two strong emerging non-bank providers of credit to SMEs with a &euro;50 million facility now up and running with Finance Ireland, a provider of leasing and hire purchase financing for vehicles and equipment and a &euro;25 million facility with Merrion Fleet, which provides vehicles and fleet management services to SMEs at a lower cost.\u00a0 Furthermore the SBCI has a pipeline of new SME credit providers that it intends to bring to the market over the next six months and beyond, which will further enhance competition and support new types of finance in the market.\u00a0 Further details of the SBCI's current supported products and where they may be accessed are available on its website ().<\/p><p>The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and my Department have worked on an amendment to the existing guarantee scheme to provide funding to SMEs whose banks are exiting the Irish market. My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, is bringing legislation to the Oireachtas which will enable the development of a more flexible Credit Guarantee Scheme with longer duration and more products and providers included.<\/p><p>The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides loans of up to &euro;25,000 to small businesses who have been refused credit by commercial banks. Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices\u00a0nationally to administer this fund.\u00a0This scheme is currently being reviewed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with a view to making proposed changes to enhance its effectiveness.<\/p><p>With over &euro;2bn of Government supports available to small business in Ireland from over 20 Departments and Agencies, it is vital that SMEs can quickly access information on this range of supports available to them.

Following this meeting,\u00a0a report by the Central Bank on\u00a0the factors influencing standard variable mortgage rates in Ireland was submitted to my Department\u00a0and published shortly thereafter.  The report found that the current interest rates in Ireland are determined by a large number of factors including nationally specific features such as increased credit risk resulting from high levels of non-performing loans and lengthy and uncertain processes of collateral recovery, limited competition, and the constraints on bank profitability arising from legacy issues of the financial crisis, such as an increased regulatory requirement for capital. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank data in the report show that the average interest rate on outstanding loans in Ireland was close to the median across a sample of twelve euro area countries.  However, this largely reflects the composition of interest rate types in the Irish mortgage market where low interest rate tracker mortgages represent a large proportion of outstanding loans bringing down the average. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent data covering rates at end\u00a0September 2015 was published in a Statistical Release by the Central Bank on 13 November.

In this regard, Government Departments, including my own, have been working on this matter for some time.  Under the Department of Finance\/Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) research programme agreement, my Department commissioned research to be undertaken on scoping the potential economic implications on Ireland of a change in the EU\/UK relationship.  The research was published on 5 November and is an important contribution in deepening our understanding of the potential issues arising.

However, I want to emphasise that the main focus of our work is now on examining how to support UK membership of the Union, rather than planning for its withdrawal.  In this context, the Deputy will be aware of the publication of Prime Minister Cameron's letter to the President of the European Council on 10 November 2015 in which he sets out in broad terms the changes that the UK intends seeking in the renegotiation of its membership of the EU.

I have directed the Agencies that no effort be spared in the search for an alternative investor for this facility.<\/p>  <p>  I have spoken to senior executives at the company on these issues.

This does not include the value of pollinators in terms of non-food crops and maintaining bio-diversity in the wild. The value of honey produced in Ireland in 2014 was estimated at slightly over &euro;3m.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has not conducted a study to assess the possible impact of a significant bee disease outbreak, however I fully recognise that a disease outbreak, and especially an exotic disease outbreak, could have a significant negative impact on the Irish bee population. <\/p>  <p>  My Department recognises the importance of maintaining and further developing a healthy honey bee population. With this in mind, the signing into law of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 repealed the out-dated 1908 Bee Pest Prevention Act. American Foulbrood and the Small Hive Beetle are both notifiable diseases under the Notification and Control of Animal Diseases Regulations 2014 (SI No 110 of 2014). While American Foulbrood has existed in Ireland for many years the Small Hive Beetle has never been found in Ireland.\u00a0In response to the 2014 outbreak of Small Hive Beetle in Italy my Department established a sentinel apiary programme earlier this year.\u00a0This programme was established with the support of the Federation of Irish Beekeeping Associations and the Native Irish Honey Bee Society.\u00a0Volunteer beekeepers in areas which are considered to represent greatest risk for the introduction of pests such as the Small Hive Beetle, as well as other beekeepers are participating in this programme.\u00a0Over 20 beekeepers providing a representative geographical spread across the country are involved. A similar programme has also been rolled out across Northern Ireland. The sentinel apiary programme is designed with the objective of providing early notification in the event that any exotic pest or disease affecting honey bees arrives in Ireland. My Department co-ordinates the programme and has provided the equipment and guidelines to the beekeepers and also provides the diagnostic service to implement the programme.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a bee diagnostic service is operated from the Teagasc laboratories at Teagasc, Oakpark in Carlow.

Officials in my Department follow up where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The option of national action to limit or ban imports of bees must respect the primacy of EU Regulations. The EU has strict bee health certification requirements which apply to the international trade in bees. In accordance with Article 3 of Council Directive 92\/65\/EEC European Union Member States must not prohibit or restrict for health reasons the international movement of bees once all requirements set down in EU legislation have been met.

This judgment in the UK Courts found that the policy of disclosure of <i>all<\/i>criminal convictions under the UK's vetting legislation was contrary to Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.  The UK Courts found that there must be some assessment of the relevance and proportionality of offences, in particular old, minor offences. The UK Courts also found that there must be a coherence between vetting legislation and legislation dealing with spent convictions.  The Court found that the rules governing vetting or spent convictions must be sufficiently clear and understandable as to allow any person applying for vetting, or relying on spent convictions provisions, to be aware what convictions will and will not be disclosed\/deemed spent. <\/p><p>Following the Court of Appeal Decision the Government agreed that the provisions of both the Spent Convictions Bill and the Vetting Act would both require amendment to harmonise their provisions within the principles set out in the UK Court decision. <\/p><p>As I have indicated in previous replies to PQs, following a very detailed review of procedures an Administrative Filter  for Garda Vetting Disclosures has been introduced, which provides that certain minor offences that are over 7 years old are no longer disclosed.<b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b>This Administrative Filter already gives effect to most of the main provisions likely to be contained in the amended Act.  I would point out that under the provisions of this filter well over 80% of all convictions will no longer be disclosed and these same provisions will also apply in regard to Spent Convictions.  I should also point out that these provisions are more generous than those currently in the Spent Convictions Bill as this Administrative Filter removes the limit on the number of minor motoring and minor public order convictions that can become spent.  Since such motoring and public order convictions account for a very high proportion of all convictions in the courts this will provide a considerably more generous provision in regard to spent convictions.  Although the Administrative Filter requires disclosure of all Circuit Court Convictions where a person is applying to work with children or vulnerable adults, I should state that it is my intention that the Spent Convictions Bill will allow certain Circuit Court convictions to become spent for other purposes.<\/p><p>A copy of this Administrative Filter is set out.<\/p><p><b>Garda Vetting Procedures<\/b><\/p><p><b>Administrative Filter<\/b><\/p><p>In anticipation of the amendment and commencement of the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012, an administrative filter in respect of Garda Vetting Unit Disclosures will operate in accordance with the following procedural guidelines. <\/p><p><b>A.

The care needs of these young people are generally met by directly provided residential services or a privately commissioned service within Ireland.  While services continue to be expanded and improved in Ireland, including the development of secure mental health facilities, there may be instances where the need for a particular specialised placement is not available here.<\/p>  <p>   For a small number of young people, Tusla is on occasion required to make arrangements for their placement in care and treatment facilities outside of the State, primarily in the UK, to allow for access to an individually tailored mix of care and therapeutic services and psychiatric treatment not currently available in this country. This is done on as infrequent a basis as possible and only where such placement is considered to be in the best interest of the child.

At the end of August 2015, there were five children placed in an out of state secure placement. All five children had an allocated social worker and an up to date written care plan.

The regulations stipulate that all care plans are to be reviewed and updated on a regular basis and sets out the frequency for these reviews to take place. A review of the care planned for a child under the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, is a process to monitor and review the progress of the plan and to update it if required.  A key consideration for the social worker is to consult with the child, family members, foster carers, and other people involved with the child to ensure that his or her needs are being met and that the care being provided is optimal.<\/p>  <p>  Children, depending on their identified need, may be placed in foster care either with relatives or general foster carers, residential care, special care or other placement types.  The majority of children are placed in long term stable placements.<\/p>  <p>  The latest figures from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, indicate that, in August 2015, there were 6,345 children in care. Of these, nearly 93% are in foster care, either with relatives or a general foster placement.

From September 2016, I am expanding the ECCE programme to allow children to access free pre-school from the time they are 3 years of age until they start primary school.  There will be three intakes of eligible children during the pre-school year: children who reach the age of 3 between April and August can access the programme from September; children who reach the age of 3 between September and December can access the programme from January; and children who reach the age of 3 between January and March can access the programme from April. <\/p>  <p>  Under this extended programme, the number of weeks of free pre-school a child will benefit from will depend on their birth date and on the age at which they start primary school.

I recognise that the red deer of Killarney National Park and the surrounding area are of national conservation significance and that the subject of culling is quite emotive.  There is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure that deer populations occupying the same land resources are managed at sustainable levels, and in a responsible and ethical manner.<\/p>  <p>  Wild deer in the State are protected under the Wildlife Acts.  It should be noted that while the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department does licence hunting of Deer, my Department does not own the deer population.  They roam freely throughout the countryside and are present in many parts of the country.  My Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, published Deer Management in Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Action in March this year which recommends a series of actions on deer management and conservation in a number of areas including addressing the impact of deer in places where they are widespread.  An Irish Deer Management Forum has been established to implement the various actions listed in the Report.  The Forum itself comprises representatives from the main stakeholder areas such as landowners, forestry, hunting and conservation organisations as well as representatives from both Departments.<\/p>  <p>  My Department carries out localised annual deer counts on State lands such as in Wicklow and Killarney National Parks and I am aware that deer species are increasing in range and numbers.  Where appropriate, and depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats, especially woodland, culls need to be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.<\/p>  <p>   With regard to Killarney National Park, every year, as part of the ongoing management of deer populations within the Park, deer numbers may need to be reduced.  It is intended to commence culling this month, once the rut has finished.  This work will be undertaken by qualified and competent National Parks and Wildlife Service personnel of my Department.  The proposed cull is no different to what has happened in previous years.  Park rangers during their normal daily duties often take spot counts of deer on the lowlands. Sika deer numbers are not out of control in the Park and are at much lower densities than can be found in Wicklow.  However the NPWS would like to further reduce the numbers of this non-native species. <\/p>  <p>  While, red deer numbers have not significantly increased in the uplands of the Park, low land numbers have increased and these deer are very visible.  Unfortunately, Deer cannot be herded like domestic animals so it is not possible to relocate the Deer from the lowlands to the uplands. Deer are large, mobile wild animals.  They will range over considerable areas during an average year in search of food, but herds tend to maintain loose territories which stags will defend.  There are herds on the mountains around Killarney and other herds in lower areas around the lakes. There is not enough food on the mountains alone to maintain all the animals so even if all the deer could be moved up the mountains many would quickly move back down to the lower lands to avail of the food there.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of roads safety, I am of the view that improving sight lines for motorists as well as improved (possibly larger) signage is likely to be the most effective measure to assist motorists in remaining vigilant when driving through areas where populations of deer can be expected. Officials from my Department have discussed this with Kerry County Council and I understand that Kerry County Council have prepared a scheme of works (which includes a number of measures including trimming back of overhanging tree branches, enhancement\/relocation of road-side signs, etc.) in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111800098#WRBB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"973"}]
