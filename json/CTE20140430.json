The meeting is being webcast and also broadcast on the UPC Oireachtas channel; therefore, members should be mindful of any electrical interference they might be causing.<br\/>I welcome representatives of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI.  We are joined by Mr. Lorcan O'Connor, director; Ms Cathy Clarke, head of the regulation division; Mr. Randall Plunkett, head of the case management division; and Mr. Christopher Lehane, head of the bankruptcy division and official assignee in bankruptcy.  They are here to assist the joint committee in its examination of the issue of mortgage arrears and the progress made in putting in place solutions aimed at resolving difficulties in the sector.  In the year since the Insolvency Service of Ireland was established Mr. O'Connor and his officials have been developing a new legal infrastructure and service dedicated to providing sustainable solutions for insolvent debtors.<br\/>This is the last of a series which began in early April with a meeting with voluntary organisations providing assistance for those struggling to manage their mortgages.  The committee continued with a number of meetings during which we questioned the chief executive officers of Ulster Bank, permanent tsb, AIB and Bank of Ireland on progress made by them in meeting mortgage arrears resolution targets and will conclude the current round of meetings with a discussion with the Governor of the Central Bank this afternoon.  We will begin this morning's discussion with opening remarks by Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Lehane, following which members may put questions to the delegates, as appropriate.  It is important that we manage our time well to derive the maximum benefit from the meeting.  Each member will have a strictly limited time slot within which questions may be put and replies given.  Questions from members and replies by delegates should be clear and concise.<br\/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

As the Chairman mentioned, the official assignee in bankruptcy, Mr. Christopher Lehane, will address some specific points about bankruptcy and the family home which were specifically requested by the joint committee.<\/p><p>  It is important to remember that the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI was established only one year ago.  When I speak to my counterparts in the Insolvency Service of England and Wales, the Insolvency Service of Northern Ireland or, for that matter, other equivalent organisations, they speak in years, rather than months, when referring to their experiences in their initial establishment or even the roll-out of a completely new business service.  Those involved in the regulation of those practising in the financial services sector provide a similar commentary, yet in that relatively short time of one year, from a standing start, we have achieved an enormous amount, both directly and indirectly.<\/p><p>  We have developed a whole new legal infrastructure and service dedicated to providing sustainable solutions for insolvent debtors and these solutions are being put in place.  While the initial uptake of debt relief schemes by debtors is slow, I am confident that the number of cases in the system will grow significantly in the coming months.  The statistics published by the ISI earlier this month point to a trend that is moving in the right direction.  The slow start in terms of volumes is mirrored in the experience of other jurisdictions when new debt relief measures were introduced.  It takes a little time for people to become comfortable with them.  I expect thousands to have availed of our services within the next year.<\/p><p>  In terms of the ISI's indirect impact, it is worth remembering that this time last year insolvent debtors were not obtaining debt agreements with their creditors.  The position is now very different and the ISI has been a significant catalyst for this change.  Until it published its guidelines on a reasonable standard of living and reasonable living expenses, negotiations on allowable expenditure between debtors and creditors never passed \"Go\".  What was once the most difficult aspect of addressing personal over-indebtedness is now not even on the agenda and since the autumn we have seen evidence of a growing number of agreements between insolvent debtors and creditors being successfully concluded.  This would not have happened but for the introduction of the new debt solutions and the reform of bankruptcy laws.<\/p><p>  Since we met in July last year a number of milestones have been reached by the ISI.  In August it began authorising approved intermediaries and personal insolvency practitioners.  We now have over 200 practitioners.  There are 135 personal insolvency practitioners known as PIPs - they deal with the debt settlement arrangement, DSA, or the personal insolvency arrangement, PIA - and over 80 staff known as responsible persons within MABS offices who have been authorised as approved intermediaries and are trained to help those who wish to apply for a debt relief note.  I expect the number of practitioners to continue to rise.<\/p><p>  In September we published our strategic plan through to 2016, but, more importantly, we also began to accept applications for the new debt solutions.  October saw the first protective certificate issued, while November saw the first debt settlement arrangement approved by creditors.  December saw the reduction in the period of bankruptcy from 12 years to three and the formal transfer of the office of the official assignee to the ISI.  January saw the first debt relief note issued, while February saw the first personal insolvency arrangement approved by the courts.  March saw us take on our 500th case and earlier this month we published our first quarterly statistics report.  The ISI will shortly launch an information campaign, in consultation with the Citizens Information bureaux, MABS, PIPs and other stakeholders, a campaign which will include information sessions around the country offering opportunities to avail of one-to-one advice.<\/p><p>  I turn to a particular initiative under way that will further assist in increasing the numbers availing of the new alternatives to bankruptcy.<\/p> <p> In February this year the ISI hosted a conference for creditors and practitioners in Dublin Castle.  A major aim of the conference was to initiate the development of protocols for the DSA and the PIA.  Agreed protocols will make the insolvency application process simpler and faster for creditors, practitioners and debtors.  The development of these protocols does not require any amendment to existing legislation and is in line with best practice in other jurisdictions.  Let me use an analogy: conveyancing solicitors do not write individual contracts for the sale or purchase of houses.  If they did, each individual transaction would take far longer than it does and clearly cost a lot more than at present.  Instead, for a regular transaction, use is made of the standard terms and conditions produced by the Law Society of Ireland.  Similarly, a protocol for insolvency applications will soon have standard terms and conditions that will assist in achieving transparency and greater acceptance rates for all concerned.<\/p><p> At the conference the ISI announced an ambitious target to have the DSA protocol agreed this spring.  Thanks to the high level of commitment shown by all of the participating stakeholders, we are on track to achieve this.  Members of the steering group and the working group, set up only at the end of February, have already spent over 2,000 working hours on developing the protocol.  We have a further session scheduled for this afternoon.  Our aim is that the steering group at this afternoon's session will sign off, in principle, on the draft protocol.  There are some stages prior to it being issued, but they should take only a few weeks.  In the United Kingdom the equivalent process took over two years to develop.  We are noting a clear desire among participating stakeholders to have the protocol up and running in as short a timescale as possible.  An equivalent protocol in the United Kingdom has resulted in acceptance rates for protocol compliant IVAs - the equivalent of DSAs - exceeding 95%.  That is what I want to see happen here.  Once the DSA protocol is complete, it will be followed by a PIA protocol which will deal with the additional aspects of secured debt.<\/p><p> While I am proud of what the ISI has achieved in its short existence and while I am firmly of the view that the Personal Insolvency Act and the ISI will assist many thousands of insolvent debtors badly in need of help, it would be remiss of me to ignore recent comments made before the committee by certain creditors.  Before doing so, I must stress that the ISI is an independent statutory body with clear functions set out in section 9 of the Act.  It is not its role to question a creditor's approach to any given case.  We are not pro-debtor, but we are not pro-creditor either.  Our primary purpose is to deliver the infrastructure required to facilitate the debt relief notes, the debt settlement arrangements and the personal insolvency arrangements.  The concepts behind the debt relief note, DRN, and the DSA are tried and tested in other countries.  The PIA dealing with security debt is a new concept.  However, the Act carefully balances the interests of both debtors and creditors when dealing with secured debt.<\/p><p> While I was disappointed with the comments made by one creditor, in particular, to the committee, I cannot say I was altogether surprised.  The creditor was blunt about how it intended to approach PIAs, in particular.  However, making a global policy statement on how it intends to deal with applications does not take full account of the new reality that the new debt solutions, including the PIA, are designed to deliver better outcomes for both debtors and creditors.  If a creditor stands in the way of a solution, there are mechanisms available to debtors to deal with this.<\/p><p> Despite the statements made here, on a case by case basis we will achieve solutions for debtors.  If, however, I am proved wrong, we hit a brick wall and do not make progress in individual cases, we will report this to the committee and recommend change.  At this time, however, only a few months into the process, the sample size of cases is insufficient to make this assessment.  Both the Minister for Justice and Equality and the ISI have indicated that the effectiveness of the legislation will be kept under review.  If issues arise that need to be addressed, they will be addressed.  Monitoring creditor engagement will obviously be a key focus.<\/p><p> In the short term the ISI remains focused on developing the DSA and PIA protocols.  While some have been critical publicly of the ISI on the issue of the number of individuals seeking an insolvency solution, I observe that the ISI opened in record time and was taking applications within six months of establishment.  Our presence is contributing to breaking a stalemate between stakeholders which, in some cases, has lasted for six years or more.<\/p><p> In addition to providing mechanisms to address individual cases of unsustainable debt, the enactment and operation of the new insolvency legislation have an even broader impact.  The legislation redefines the overall framework within which lenders and debtors assess their options for dealing with insolvent debtors.  It can already be seen that as a result of the enactment and coming into operation of the Personal Insolvency Act, some financial institutions are taking more active and constructive steps.  They are moving towards a long-term sustainable debt solution rather than short-term debt amelioration.  This would not have happened without the personal insolvency legislation and the establishment of the ISI.  These new debt solutions are not just good for debtors but are also in the interests of creditors.  They offer an efficient and fair means of tackling what is a very large problem for everybody.  Ultimately, it is in the interests of us all to return an insolvent debtor to solvency to ensure his or her well-being and give him or her the second chance he or she deserves.<\/p><p> I invite Mr. Lehane, the official assignee in bankruptcy and head of our bankruptcy division, to speak to the committee on the recent changes to bankruptcy legislation and what they might mean for a debtor and his or her family home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorcan O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398849000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I will talk about four areas.  First, I will highlight the significant changes made to the Bankruptcy Act and deal with my own role.  I will then deal with two areas which I believe are of particular interest to the committee, namely, income payment orders and the treatment of the family home in bankruptcy.  <\/p><p>  As members are aware, there were significant changes made to the Bankruptcy Act which came into effect on 3 December.  The most significant by far was the reduction in the automatic discharge period from 12 years to three.  Another significant change is a requirement that one needs debt of &euro;20,000 if either a creditor or a debtor is to petition for bankruptcy.  Formerly, the figure was only &euro;1,900.  There is a requirement for a court to consider, with regard to both creditor and debtor petitions, whether it is appropriate to adjourn proceedings to allow a debtor to attempt to enter into a debt settlement arrangement or a personal insolvency arrangement.  There is an increase in the amount of the estate that does not form part of the bankruptcy estate.  This is called the accepted assets and the specified value has increased from &euro;1,900 to &euro;6,000.  Pensions, where a person is adjudicated upon after 3 December, no longer form part of the bankruptcy estate, subject to the five year claim period, whereby, if a pension crystallises in the time, the official assignee can exercise his or her right in that respect.  There is an increase pertaining to the avoidance provision for three years where there are fraudulent preferences, as in circumstances where one creditor would be preferred over another, where one would sell an asset under value or where one would make fraudulent transfers, commonly known as transfers to the spouse in advance of going bankrupt in an effort to keep an asset out the bankruptcy estate.  There is a limit of five years on income payment orders.  There was, under section 65, no limit on the period within which an income payment order could be brought in.  The Act has significantly capped this figure at five years.  <\/p><p>  Regarding an application, the official assignee or a trustee in bankruptcy, if I am replaced by a private trustee, can apply to the court to have the period of bankruptcy extended.  This can be extended for a further five year period beyond the three year automatic discharge period.<\/p><p>  Another change which affected me was the change in the administrative structure pertaining to bankruptcy, whereby the office of the official assignee, formerly an office within the Courts Service, moved to the ISI.  This is for very understandable reasons, given the synergies between the two insolvency processes.<\/p><p>  I will now talk about my role.  When a person is declared bankrupt, all of the property of that individual passes to me, or invests in me as official assignee.  I have the same powers and rights of the person made bankrupt in respect of the property.  My primary role is to investigate assets, gather them in and distribute them to the creditors.<\/p> <p>It is, effectively, the equivalent of the liquidator.  <\/p><p>  The two issues that I believe are of particular interest to the committee are those of income payment orders and family homes and bankruptcy.   An income payment order, as understood under the Act, can last for up to five years.  The process within the office is that when a person is made bankrupt, on his or her adjudication, I assess his or her capacity to contribute towards the bankruptcy debts to see if there is a surplus - applying the reasonable living expenses criteria of the ISI - that he or she can contribute.  Up until now, the practice has been that we have put in place agreements whereby we move into a process of applying for orders in respect of them.  That is because under the law, the entitlement of the official assignee to apply for a order is that he or she must apply prior to discharge.  In the absence of any provision that will enforce income payment agreements beyond the discharge period, it is a necessary requirement that I apply for income payment orders.  If a bankrupt person has surplus income, an income payment order will be sought.  It is in the interests of a debtor to co-operate in these matters in order that the income payment order is put in place at the earliest stage of a bankruptcy.  In the normal course, he or she will be moving out of bankruptcy in three years; therefore, if he or she engages early, the five year period will start early and there will only be a two year period afterwards.  If a debtor does not have surplus income initially but will at some stage in the bankruptcy, as official assignee, I will seek an income payment order but will generally limit the amount of the remainder of the five year period since adjudication.  That effectively means that in the third year I will not seek an income payment order for five years in the normal course.  I will discount the period within which in the course of the bankruptcy I have assessed the individual.  If he or she does not have capacity or a surplus above reasonable living expenses, it is not the Armageddon certain individuals believe, whereby I would use it effectively to have a period of eight years of bankruptcy.  It will depend on what the process is.  One will find from the media that, unfortunately, there are individuals who evade the office and effectively go missing and I cannot locate them.  Where people fail to co-operate, fail to disclose their income or simply fail to pay, it could be that by the time I eventually trace them and obtain their income it is in the third year.  They will find that the five year period will extend for the full duration of the three year period.  <\/p><p> The final topic I will deal with is the family home and bankruptcy.  For obvious reasons, when people move into bankruptcy, they are concerned about what will happen to the family home.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland has published a useful guide to bankruptcy that explains in a simple, step by step way, everything that happens when people move into bankruptcy, including their property, debts and income.  We have also published a scenario pack giving practical examples of various family home cases.  It deals in detail with the assessment of one's income, one's ability to pay if there is a surplus and how the role of the ISI official impacts on a person.  It is always subject to whether one has the capacity to pay a mortgage to the extent that a financial institution will accept.  I will be dealing with that issue in more detail.<\/p><p> For the benefit of the committee, I will set out the three key sections of the Bankruptcy Act concerning the family home.  First, section 136 states an unsecured debt can only be claimed through a bankruptcy.  Therefore, if one has an unsecured debt that is not recovered within the bankruptcy process, one has no opportunity outside the process to recover it.  If one does not receive a dividend, that is it and the unsecured debt is written off.  The section goes on to state, \"This shall not affect the power of a secured creditor to realise or otherwise deal with a security in the same manner as they would have been entitled to realise or deal with it if the section had not been enacted\".  In my appendix, I will deal with how this operates in practice.<\/p><p> Section 44 of the Bankruptcy Act states that when a person is made bankrupt, all of the property of the bankrupt vests in me as the official assignee.  Section 615 states, \"The court shall have the power to order postponement of the sale of the family home, or shared home within the Civil Partnership Act, having regard to the interests of the creditors, of the spouse or civil partner, and dependants of the bankrupt\", as well as the circumstances of the case.  I will deal with this in more detail in Appendix 1.  What happens, however, is that I cannot sell a family home; I must apply to the bankruptcy judge who can effectively delay it.  The judge cannot absolutely say one cannot sell the home because if there is equity, the role of the official assignee is to effectively liquidate that equity.  In that case, a bankruptcy judge will simply delay the process, having regard to all of these factors, including the family and dependants.  <\/p><p> I have set out my five main policy views on how I will approach dealing with the family home.  Where there is positive equity in the family home, all other assets will be realised before I have regard to the family home.  The official assignee's interest in the family home will be sold to the spouse, where possible.  When a person is made bankrupt, it splits the family home interest - half goes to the official assignee, while half remains with the spouse.  The family home will not be sold earlier than six months after the adjudication order, unless to the spouse.  The bankrupt will be offered the opportunity of doing a composition, effectively a deal, with his or her creditors with the proceeds of the other assets sold before the family home will be sold.  It is not usual that there are two buy-to-lets and there is a pool of assets that become available within the bankruptcy estate, with me leaving the family home as the last asset.  It is possible that the creditors might agree to the sale of the buy-to-lets, accept a pool of assets and effectively leave the person concerned in the family home.<\/p><p> A minimum sum of &euro;5,000 will be sought by me for negative equity interest of the official assignee.  When a person is made bankrupt, the interest vests in me.  When a person is discharged from bankruptcy, that interest continues to vest in me.  I will not approach the spouse of the person in negative equity.  It may be that the full three year period has passed.  At a minimum I will seek a sum of &euro;5,000 for the spouse to buy me out of the half interest that continues to vest in me.<\/p><p> In Appendix 1 I deal with the three options of the secured lender when a person is declared bankrupt, the actions to be taken by me and the consequences for the debtor.  In appendix 2, I set out the findings of a recent survey we carried out of bankruptcies in the past four years to establish the consequences of bankruptcy for family ownership. <\/p><p> I will briefly go through Appendix 1 to explain what happens when a person is made bankrupt.  While it is true that the same levels of protection around the family home within a personal insolvency agreement, PIA, do not apply in bankruptcy, it is not automatically true that when a person is made bankrupt, he or sh e loses the family home.  The First Schedule to the Bankruptcy Act sets out three options for a secured creditor.  If a mortgagor - a person who is borrowing - goes bankrupt and the lender is considering his or her position, the First Schedule to the Bankruptcy Act sets out three options for what he or she can do.  First, the bank can rely on its security and not claim in the bankruptcy.  Second, it can abandon the security and claim for the full debt in the bankruptcy.  Third, it can realise, sell the house and claim for the shortfall.<\/p><p> Where there is positive equity, the financial institution sells the property.  This will only arise if the mortgage is not being paid.  In the normal course, if the mortgage is being paid, banks do not bankrupt people.<\/p> <p> Banks do not seek to sell a family home if someone is paying the mortgage.  It would be absolutely ludicrous and crystalise the negative equity.  Where there is positive equity and no capacity to pay and the mortgage has not been paid, the banks have the right to sell the family home under the mortgage deed.  If the mortgage is not being paid on terms acceptable to the financial institution, it can sell the family home and claim interest on the mortgage up to the date of the sale.  If there is any balance, it is given to me as official assignee.  However, there may be judgment mortgages on the property constituting prior charges to the right of the official assignee, who effectively gets the unsecured assets.  If there is no judgment mortgage on the family home, the proceeds will be paid to me.  If we look to the right, we will see what the consequences are in the case.  The house is sold and the person has lost the family home.  However, the surplus from the sale proceeds might generate a pool of assets and that might mean that the person within the bankruptcy can go to his or her creditors and say: \"I have &euro;60,000 and owe &euro;300,000.  Will you accept a dividend of this and release me from bankruptcy?\"  In those circumstances a person could get out of bankruptcy much more quickly than in the three year automatic discharge period.  If the family home is gone in the classic situation where a man has been made bankrupt, I would allow, as official assignee, an allowance for accommodation for renting for that individual and his family within the reasonable living expenses with which members are familiar.<\/p><p> Where there is positive equity of, say, &euro;20,000, and the mortgage is being paid on a family home, my role is to realise that equity for the benefit of creditors.  It will be half of that figure, or &euro;10,000.  I will go to the wife and say to her: \"Do you have the capacity to pay?\"  I have already said the process can last six months or longer.  I do not pressurise them immediately to sell the family home for &euro;10,000, but section 61(4) of the Bankruptcy Act applies.  Even if I am selling to the spouse, I must obtain a court order.  It is a formality before the court when I am selling to the spouse.  If the house is sold to someone other than to the spouse, the position is as I have set it out.<\/p><p> Where there is negative equity, the issue is whether the mortgage is affordable.  Does the borrower have the capacity to pay?  The fact that the property is in negative equity is irrelevant.  If the financial institution sees that the mortgage is being paid, it will not sell the family home.  That would be to crystalise the negative equity, which would never be done.  However, if there is negative equity, the position of the official assignee is that there is nothing for him to sell on the open market.  The issue for him is not whether he will sell the house, but whether the mortgage payment the bank seeks is reasonable having regard to the family requirements, including dependants.  Do they need a five bedroom house in an expensive part of Dublin which carries a massive mortgage and a requirement to pay a mortgage of &euro;4,000 to &euro;5,000?  That sum is way beyond what would be enough to provide in the normal course for that family.  In that case, I will not allow the mortgage payment and the family would have to move.  What is allowed within reasonable living expenses is that which is sufficient for the family and not a balloon mortgage payment.  They should cut their cloth and move.  Otherwise it is to expect creditors to maintain a lifestyle which is gone as the tiger economy has collapsed.<\/p><p> The second option for a secured creditor is to abandon the security.  This is very rare.  When a bank has security over a house, it will not walk away from its security which is the priority it has over unsecured creditors.  It practically never happens.  It would only happen if there was a prior mortgage and, in effect, the security has no value.  The third option, which is being taken now, is to sell the family home.  The financial institution realises its security and claims the shortfall in the bankruptcy as an unsecured creditor.  As a financial institution is claiming in the bankruptcy, it is subject to 75(2) of the Bankruptcy Act which provides that it can only claim mortgage interest up to the date of adjudication.  The consequences are that the home is lost and the shortfall after the dividend, if any, is written off.  The spouse is still jointly and severally liable for the full mortgage unless she goes bankrupt.  In the circumstances, the official assignee's decision is whether to allow rental payments for the family.  Of course I will, but in accordance with reasonable living expenses under the ISI guidelines.<\/p><p> The next paragraph of my submission deals with the rare situation where, instead of realising the security, the institution values the security and claims for the shortfall in bankruptcy as an unsecured creditor.  That is very rare.  It is much preferred to opt to allow the mortgage to continue to be paid on acceptable terms.  That avoids crystalising the security, which continues to appreciate providing value should the person cease being able to pay.<\/p><p> In April 2014, having seen questions raised at previous sittings of the committee, I sought to provide detail to members and an accurate picture of what happens when people go into bankruptcy.  We went back and interviewed all bankrupts going back to 2011 and the findings are set out.  We split them into two periods.  In 2014, we have had 82 bankruptcies.  Many people are simply attending for interview now and we are obtaining their profiles.  The consequences for them of going into bankruptcy are only hitting now.  It is more beneficial for the committee to see the historical picture split in two.  The real numbers have come in since the change in the Bankruptcy Act on 3 December 2013.  Of the 73 bankruptcies the statistics showed on Monday - it is 82 now - 40 are still in the family home and 33 are renting, of whom 14 voluntarily surrendered the properties.  In the period 2011 to 2013, of the 121 bankruptcies, 66 are still in their homes and there are issues in relation to potential proceedings to be brought by me and family law proceedings.  The balance can be read from the table itself.  I pass back to Mr. Lorcan O'Connor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Christopher Lehane","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398850200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Hopefully, that gives members an overview of progress within the ISI and some specifics on the family home and bankruptcy.

The legislation includes this as an option in a non-exhaustive list; therefore, it is disappointing that certain creditors are saying that under no circumstances will they entertain that kind of solution.  I would distinguish some comments from others made before the committee in April. Certainly I acknowledge that there is a very big difference between secured and unsecured debt.  Were we to blur the lines, we could end up with a scenario where we would all be paying our mortgages at credit card level interest rates.  Clearly, that is not something we want.<\/p><p>  Secured debt brings with it certain rights and options.  It is also important to say the write-off of debt is not the be all and end all.  When an insolvent debtor comes through the door of a personal insolvency practitioner, he or she is tasked with finding a solution that will return the debtor to solvency.  In many cases, that may not require a secured debt to be written off.  There is what is called by many a waterfall set of solutions.  Extending the term of a loan, reducing the interest rate on a loan or carrying out other tweaks could return the person to solvency.  If that is the case, there is no need to look at or even consider the potential to write off debt.  However, there will be situations where, having exhausted all of these points, there is still a difficulty or an issue to be addressed to return the person to solvency.  <\/p><p>  The final point I will make in distinguishing between some of the comments made is that a number of creditors said they would regard it as extremely unusual or have difficulty in foreseeing circumstances where they would be required to write off debt because their other forbearance measures are so generous.  I see this as very different from a creditor saying that, irrespective of forbearance measures, it does not contemplate ever agreeing to a secured debt being written off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorcan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1398850800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>To come back to the waterfall set of solutions and simplify matters, the most benign solution is used at the start and the solutions become more drastic and severe as the difficulties are examined.

The implication is that they do not see scope for the ISI in their resolution processes.

When a person becomes bankrupt, in terms of buy-to-let properties, if they are all in negative equity, I would surrender them to the financial institution.  If there is equity in them, I would recover that amount and pay in that respect.  The truth is that those commitments that have been causing huge distress for people in terms of sleepless nights improves in bankruptcy because they no longer have all those commitments.  They do not pay off their credit cards.  Whatever funds I get, they get a dividend.  The capacity of an individual to pay the mortgage, therefore, improves.

We can name names, we all know who they are.  Bank of Ireland makes it very clear that it would veto any PIA which involved writing off some mortgage debt.

Mr. O'Connor said in his opening remarks that if we hit a brick wall we will review this and we will make recommendations.  I would submit to him that his organisation has hit a brick wall.

Prior to the committee hearings earlier this month, I would have made the point that it is in the commercial interest of creditors to engage in a PIA and all other arrangements.  I will continue to be of that view.  When the IVA process was introduced in the UK, initially probably all the banks were sceptical but some banks engaged to a greater or lesser extent than others.  Over time they all became comfortable with the process and, generally speaking, they are now all supportive of the IVA protocol that is in place and the IVA solutions and, in many cases, they encourage debtors to avail of that solution.  The reason I think that process will hopefully evolve over time in respect of all creditors, including those who were quite clear as to what their current position is, is the simple maths of it.  I would give the Deputy one example of what a PIA can offer to a creditor.  We often focus on the protections it can deliver for a debtor but I would focus briefly on those it can deliver for a creditor.  Let us say a creditor has a mortgage of &euro;300,000 and the PIP having examined the individual's circumstances. and applied forbearance measures around term extensions, interest rate adjustments and so on, can identify a sustainable mortgage of &euro;200,000, the PIP would go to the individual's bank and say that he needs a &euro;100,000 of that mortgage to be written off, to be warehoused or something done in respect of it to solve the problem.  If the bank says \"No\" to that, that person would go to Mr. Christopher Lehane and seek to be declared bankrupt, but what would be the position if the market value of that house is &euro;100,000?  What that means is that by voting \"No\" to a PIA, instead of writing off &euro;100,000 of the mortgage, the bank would have to write-off &euro;200,000.  When it comes down to the hard cold facts hopefully people realise that in certain circumstances a PIA should be supported.<\/p><p>  We produced statistics at the beginning of the April and the numbers were very low in terms of those that had gone through the system but the trend, I suggest, was a positive, showing that the number of new cases each week and each month were increasing.  We have already seen a significant move since even the beginning of April, notwithstanding the Easter period in the intervening time.  We have now significantly more cases, more than 100 protective certificates, more than double the PIAs, more than double the DSAs, and a significant increase in DRNs.

While I take the Deputy's point about the spirit of the legislation and so on, bankruptcy is nonetheless a relevant point.  Deals were not being done this time last year because the debtor did not want to wake the sleeping dog in the corner.  If the bluff was called, a 12-year bankruptcy was not an attractive option to pursue.

In the absence of such options and if all of one's income is being used to meet reasonable living expenses, there is nothing to offer to creditors.  In that situation, it is unlikely that a debt settlement arrangement, DSA, or PIA would work.  However, this does not mean that there is no solution open to such a person.  For example, a DRN, is available for those with debts of less than &euro;20,000 or bankruptcy is an option if their debts are greater than &euro;20,000.<\/p><p>  The conversation could move on to question whether someone's living expenses were set at the appropriate level.  We did a great deal of work in preparing our guidelines.  When they were published last spring, they were based upon more than a decade of work by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  The figures were not picked out of the blue.  Rather, they were based on extensive building blocks that led to an overall number.

A list of scenarios was helpfully provided in Appendix 1.  It is difficult for people to get their heads around this issue when facing the stressful decision of whether to apply for bankruptcy.  I put a point to Mr. Ross Maguire when he appeared before the committee a number of weeks ago.  He advocated bankruptcy as a viable option for many debtors, but people are reluctant to go down that road.  They believe that if they lose their family homes, they will never again have the opportunity to get credit to purchase another.  What is Mr. Lehane's response?  He has asserted that, in many cases, someone will retain at least a share of his or her home and the official assignee's share in it might remain for a long time, but many people remain concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000009#H01100","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398852000,"counter":66,"content":"<p>It relates to a couple of points, the first of which is destigmatising bankruptcy.  There is a reality to be faced by people who have got into that level of indebtedness, namely, whether bankruptcy is a bigger problem or a solution to the problem.  It wipes out unsecured debts and makes one's capacity to pay one's mortgage possible.  Ironically, one may go from an interest-only capacity to interest and capital.  When one is reassessed after bankruptcy, one has the power to pay the full mortgage whereas one previously did not.  If a spouse is involved, he or she is jointly and severally reliable for the full mortgage.  In the classic situation, if one spouse enters into bankruptcy, the other is still on the hook for the full amount.<\/p><p>  I set out my policy clearly to address the reality of the situation.  The issue becomes one of whether &euro;5,000 is a reasonable amount.  If a spouse owns one half and I have applied a value of &euro;5,000, at what stage could they approach me - it is a time of their choosing, not mine - with &euro;5,000 and get their family home back, given their capacity to repay the mortgage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000009#H01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Christopher Lehane"},{"type":"speech","time":1398852000,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lehane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000009#H01300","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1398852000,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. O'Connor and his colleagues and thank them for their presentation.  I will address a couple of points.  Regardless of whether the witnesses like it, the average person does not want to declare bankruptcy.<\/p> <p>Regardless also of the process entered into, once they declare bankruptcy the family home becomes part of the equation.  The purpose of the process is to protect the family home.  That is one of its key ingredients.  I would be nervous about the bankruptcy route as an option.  <\/p><p> I have had only a quick look at the figures provided.  The devil is in the detail.  I accept the insolvency service is still a relatively new entity.  Appendix 2 of the documentation provided includes data for the first quarter of 2014 and the period from 2011 to 2013.  Based on these figures - Mr. O'Connor can correct me if I am inaccurate - 54% of people who entered bankruptcy during the first quarter of 2014 lost their homes, which equates to 37 out of 69 people.  A person who enters bankruptcy has at least a one in two chance of losing his or her family home.  Equally between 2011 and 2013, some 58%, or 70 people, in bankruptcy lost their family home.  <\/p><p> On the PIAs, according to the first quarterly report only four PIAs were entered into and the secured debt write-off in this regard was 19%, which strikes me as low.  As things stand the person who goes the bankruptcy route has, at least, a one in two chance of losing his or her home.  Even where the banks provide restructures and write-downs under the PIAs, only 19% of the value is being written off.  Mr. O'Connor stated that the banks should be buying into the PIAs because they are to their benefit.  An issue which arose at a recent meeting of this committee is that of positive equity.  The perception is that people who are in positive equity but in mortgage arrears are more vulnerable than people who are in negative equity.  In other words, because a property is in positive equity and a person is in arrears with his or her mortgage payments a bank as opposed to providing a write-off will opt to sell the property.  Why would a bank opt to provide a write-off when a property is in positive equity?  In these cases, family homes are being sold and risky assets are being removed from the banks' balance sheets.  I would welcome some commentary from Mr. O'Connor around the issue of positive equity.  <\/p><p> In regard to the 523 applications received by the service in the first quarter, the result was 70 protective notices, 44 debt relief notices, seven debt services arrangements and four PIAs.  Reference is made on page 5 of the presentation to recent comments made by the banks.  Two institutions have stated that over their dead bodies would they allow write-offs in terms of mortgage debt in PIAs.  Mr. O'Connor said earlier that if a creditor stands in the way of a solution there are mechanisms available to debtors to deal with this.  Perhaps he would outline those mechanisms.  As in other countries in the world, in terms of home ownership, in Ireland, the family home is of emotional significance.  Bankruptcy should be a measure of last resort.  We want the mechanisms to work.  Perhaps Mr. O'Connor would respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000009#H01400","speaker":"1060","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398852600,"counter":70,"content":"<p>It is true to say that the protections around the family home that are inherent within the personal insolvency legislation and the PIA do not exist in bankruptcy.

All creditors, without exception, have been fully committed to the development of a protocol, including those that have been somewhat circumspect with regard to the engagement more generally.  That augurs well.  It shows that creditors realise that this is going to happen whether they like it or not and are saying, \"Let us work towards trying to get a protocol in place that at least ticks as many boxes as possible around our concerns or around where we think efficiencies can be brought into the system\".

We hear that two of the largest banks in the State are going to do that, but Mr. O'Connor is still saying that he will continue to keep it under scrutiny and review.  I am sure he has read the committee's transcript but I put a question to Mr. Richie Boucher of Bank of Ireland.  There were questions leading up to it.  It was in reference to the fact that, on average, 19% of secured debt had been written off in a PIA.  Mr. O'Connor has now informed the committee that the figure has increased to 41%.  I put it to Mr. Boucher, and I quote, \"The personal insolvency service told us an average of 19% of secured debt is written down on average based on PIPs' proposals.  The bank is saying it will torpedo every single one of these through the veto the Government gave it if it has the opportunity\".  Mr. Boucher said in response, \"That is correct\".  He has told this committee that he will torpedo every proposal by a PIP who recommends a secured debt write-down.

The classic situation is where the woman is on the hook for &euro;300,000 and the man, within his reasonable living expenses, is being allowed to contribute to the mortgage.  If the woman is not working, he will be able to pay the full mortgage within his reasonable living expenses.  From the point of view of his creditors, reasonable living expenses allows him to pay the full mortgage.  However, it is the reality that in many cases where the wife may not be working and reasonable living expenses are not coming from the wife, they are coming out of funds that could be taken and paid to creditors.  A minimum of &euro;5,000 is asked for, but it will not be asked for immediately.  It will be asked for whenever the spouse is in a position to contribute.  The official assignee's role is to be fair to both creditors and debtors.  In a couple of years, it may be that half of the interest in a house in Dublin is such that it is very much in the interest of the spouse to pay &euro;5,000 when the house is worth up to &euro;60,000 more.  It is a commercial decision to try to see how people can get back the half interest in the house.

Given that establishing a centre of main interest can take anything from six months to one year, it is potentially a two-year period compared to a three-year period here.  The person loses any protection of the family home because, by definition, moving to another jurisdiction means that a home in this jurisdiction cannot be the family home.  People lose jobs they may have in this jurisdiction and there is also disruption to family.  There is a difference.  In certain circumstances, it remains attractive for a person to go to the UK, and there is no law preventing it.

The pass rates for cases were low, the reason being that banks were still trying to learn and still trying to get comfortable with the process and they did not have a protocol in place.  We have done our best to try to learn from that because we do not want a decade of banks not necessarily engaging fully with these processes.  We are within weeks of issuing a protocol.

I am wondering what can be done in terms of legal change.  An area about which I am very concerned is the position of separated couples and couples where the relationship has broken down.  In my personal practical experience, it is proving to be incredibly difficult in relation to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and in trying to deal with any debt.  Is there any logic as to why we could not change the law to sever the mortgage as well?  It seems illogical that the joint tenancy can be severed while leaving the mortgage on that property extant, in other words, with the remaining mortgage holder liable for the entire debt.

We have the figures from the banks.  For example, I have seen the figure from Bank of Ireland and it amounts to well over 90%.  Term extensions increase total payments, interest-only arrangements increase total payments, recapitalisation of arrears increases total payments, and so on.  Furthermore, we have Bank of Ireland's pretend split mortgage, which actually charges the full amount on the shelved portion.  To me, that is not a sustainable solution to a debt crisis; rather, it is an extend-and-pretend solution to a debt crisis.<\/p><p>  Here is my major concern.  I have no doubt that Mr. O'Connor and his team are doing their best, but let us consider all mortgages in arrears, of which there are 176,000 in total.  This includes buy-to-let and owner-occupier arrears.  Now, let us consider Mr. O'Connor's figure of 4,000.  This means a little over 2%, or approximately one in 50, of the mortgages that are in arrears will come through what I believe is a good process.  The Government target is essentially for the arrears figure to go to zero by the end of this year.  The banks are ahead of these targets because they will be financially penalised by the Central Bank otherwise.<\/p><p>  The legislation is probably not bad legislation, notwithstanding some things I would change, for a business-as-usual economy.  However, I believe it is utterly flawed.  Therefore, the important task Mr. O'Connor has in terms of dealing with the crisis - not in a business-as-usual situation - for the next ten or 20 years is impossible because by the end of the year the banks will have forced through many voluntary arrangements which are not remotely sustainable.  The banks are allowed to define what \"sustainable\" is and the Central Bank is utterly complicit in allowing the banks to do so.  Therefore, they will get away with it, and approximately one in 50 of the restructures will come through the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  From a national debt recovery perspective, this is useless, although it is great for the 2% because they will have superior solutions to those the banks are voluntarily offering, not in all cases but in many cases.  In that context, does Mr. O'Connor believe anything can be done now or this year to increase the 2% to a far greater level?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000015#O01600","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398855600,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I agree that we should be trying to achieve as high a number as we can.  Those availing of ISI solutions can be assured of greater transparency - this applies to all stakeholders involved - and a holistic solution.  On occasion, the voluntary solutions the banks are offering may only solve the mortgage problem, but there could be other credit union loans, credit card loans and so on that must be dealt with.  There are advantages in availing of the ISI services in this regard.  That is not to say people should not try to solve their problems short of the ISI, but I agree with the broad thrust of Deputy Donnelly's statement.<\/p><p>  Deputy Donnelly asked what we can do to try to get the number as high as possible by the end of the year.  The first thing we can do is to roll out an information campaign again.  We had one this time last year when we were launching the organisation and we tried to produce as many cases studies and guides as possible.  We were keen to have several cases successfully through the system before we engaged in a further round of information.  It is important for us to be able to demonstrate that, for example, Joe went through successfully and to outline his situation at the moment, and we are able to do that now.  We are planning, in consultation with the several stakeholders, including the Citizens' Information Board and others, to have several information sessions which will be light in terms of presentation, perhaps only half an hour or an hour explaining the options, but to have scattered throughout the room a dozen local personal insolvency practitioners, several people from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service offices and several people from Mr. Lehane's bankruptcy division as well as representatives of the ISI.  The idea is for people to be able to sit down and have a face-to-face ten or 15 minute conversation that evening with the people concerned to tease out their initial queries.  That might lead to people formally meeting with a personal insolvency practitioner or whoever.  That is one thing in terms of information.<\/p><p>  The second thing is the protocol.  I cannot overstate the importance of the protocol because it is moving what is a blockage in the system.  It will smooth out the entire process and make it more efficient.  We are very close to publishing it.  I am hopeful that we will publish it during the month of May.  I believe it will encourage personal insolvency practitioners, because they will then have far greater confidence that the cases they are taking on will successfully go through the system.  It should help creditors because they will see that the goalposts are not moving from one case to another as they come before them.  Furthermore, they will know, broadly speaking, what will come forward and they can focus on the commercial proposal.  It also helps debtors because they will know where the goalposts are, since they will have been fixed, and they will know what they are signing up to.  Far more clarity has been brought to the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000015#O01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorcan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1398855600,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Connor has referred to information campaign and the protocol.

I see people who have taken out equity releases, for instance, and whose mortgages are completely unsustainable.  We have spoken about people's distress and pain.  These people are trying to achieve the impossible because they have a view that going bankrupt will make them a failure.  In the United States, on the other hand, it is a badge of honour for a person to come through bankruptcy and go on to achieve success.  We have all heard about the people who visited Ireland recently and bought castles - people who went on to be spectacularly successful after going into bankruptcy.<\/p><p>  We must work to remove the stigma associated with bankruptcy, starting with this committee.

There was reference today to how terrible a thing it is for anybody to lose their family home.  It is not always a terrible thing.  There are people who have got out from under an incredible burden that was impossible to deal with.  I made the point in a talk I gave recently - my comments were reported in the newspapers - that the day the bankruptcy button is pushed, the problems of the individual in question become my problem.  I deal with all of their issues and that is stressful.  I am dealing with every commercial decision on the person's behalf; he or she is out of the picture very quickly once the process begins.  I have to run and jump to deal with all the issues and impress the reality of the situation on creditors.  For the debtor, release has come and he or she can begin to move on.  Moreover, in some cases, it is all the other commitments that are gone and the family home may now actually be affordable.  The family home is not always last.<\/p><p>  We have to stop thinking of bankruptcy as always something that should not be done.  It is the fourth option, it is a valid option and people should avail of it more.  All the figures the Deputy mentioned were on Mr. O'Connor's side of the house.  We have 82 bankruptcies at the moment.  If we were anything on a par with the figures for Northern Ireland, we would be greatly adding to the solution.  We are not doing so because there is still the stigma to which I referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000016#P01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Christopher Lehane"},{"type":"speech","time":1398856200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Mr. Lehane is the expert on this issue in this country.

The answer is that it is a possibility that people might regard a reduced period as more favourable.  Personally, however, I would stick with three years.

If they go to a debt management firm, they cannot bring them down the road towards an insolvency arrangement; therefore, they will almost certainly try to encourage them to enter an informal arrangement with the bank.

First, the Insolvency Service of Ireland began authorising personal insolvency practitioners and, second, the Central Bank introduced debt management regulations.  I welcome these two developments.  Debt advice is extremely important and it is important that the quality of that advice be appropriate because there can be very significant consequences for those acting on it.  We want to ensure there is no unnecessary overlap or duplication.  A PIP is statutorily obliged to set out all of the options for his or her client, including alternatives to the Personal Insolvency Act.  In that sense, they will lay out all of the options.  The difficulty that has arisen which I suggest is an unintended consequence is the exemptions PIPs have from the debt management licensing regulatory framework to the extent that they are performing their duties under the Act.  However, situations may arise where an informal deal is appropriate and in that instance we are of the view that if it is possible, the service should be covered also within the remit of the ISI or that at least there should not necessarily be duplication that could result in difficulties for the practitioner as well as the debtor.  We would not like to see a debtor going to a practitioner and spending a number of hours setting out his or her financial position - it is probably an emotional process - at the end of which the practitioner will state he or she does know how to help him or her but it involves X and that the debtor needs to go next door to talk to somebody who can supply the service when he or she will have to go through the emotional process again.

If he looks at page 18 of the document circulated, he will see that it refers to section 136 of the Bankruptcy Act which effectively states the rights of secured creditors are not affected in bankruptcy, while the first Schedule sets out the various options.  To answer the question directly, when a person becomes a bankrupt, a set of mortgage possession proceedings which are wrongly called repossession proceedings - the banks have never been in possession of the house - are taken.  My position is that on the basis that the banks are taking repossession proceedings, people must be in a situation where they have been unable to repay their mortgage.  In moving into bankruptcy they are fully entitled to go back to the bank in that regard.  Sometimes I come across possession proceedings that are historical.  In terms of people who have gone bankrupt, in repossession proceedings there is a period in which the wife can go back to the bank and say her capacity has improved and the possession proceedings are withdrawn.<\/p><p>  Would I prevent repossession proceedings going ahead?  The answer is no.  Under section 136 of the Bankruptcy Act, I am the official signee.  I move and have the same rights as the debtor.  I do not have any power to stop them proceeding to take the house.  All I can do is facilitate the man - the classic situation - to make the payments and if they are not grossly above what would be a reasonable amount for the house - this answers the Deputy's second question - I will not stand in the bank's way.  The repossession proceedings go ahead because I am only an assignee of the individual's rights.<\/p><p>  On the second issue regarding the mortgage and the rent, we consider the household requirements of, say, a man with four children.  He needs a four-bedroom house.  If it is in any way reasonable and within close proximity - we do not have a rigid figure - we will not force a family out of a house.  We will allow this as a mortgage payment and allow them stay in the house.  We do not get down to pettiness of valuing the video recorder but, unfortunately, it is an issue.  The bankruptcy inspector views the house and considers items above the value of &euro;6,000.<\/p> <p>That &euro;6,000 is the man's share of the house contents.  Equally, the wife will have &euro;6,000.  That amounts to &euro;12,000 as the value of contents.  There is a lot of flexibility.  It is not reinstatement value; it is second-hand value.  We do not find ourselves taking out, as, unfortunately, did happen years ago, the video player, and sometimes even bikes and other such items.  Nothing is that petty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000018#R01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Christopher Lehane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1398858000,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I am glad for that clarification.

The first was the situation that applies when somebody misses a payment within an arrangement and the arrears.  The legislation provides that where there are arrears of three months the creditor has the right to go to court and seek for that arrangement to be terminated, and if the arrears extend to six months, the court automatically terminates the arrangement.  Having said all of that, as we develop a protocol we are trying to put in place flexibility around that legislative consequence.  For example, the protocol is looking at whether we can put in place payment breaks so that if somebody's car or washing machine breaks down, he or she is given a payment holiday to solve that rather than have this arrears consequence kick in.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's second point related to inheritance and windfall.  As I stated, there is the variation mechanism, which can go up or down.  If somebody is better or worse off than they started out, there is a mechanism whereby the arrangement is altered to reflect the new reality.  If, in bankruptcy in the UK, one comes into an inheritance, it goes to the creditors.  Here, if one comes into a material inheritance or windfall, the variation will kick in and it will be down to the commercial terms of that arrangement as to what happens to those moneys.<\/p><p>  In terms of the compulsory nature of the protocol, in the same way that the arrangements are voluntary-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000019#S00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorcan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1398858000,"counter":274,"content":"<p>No guidelines are given to personal insolvency practitioners as to what happens with inheritance above a certain level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000019#S00800","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398858000,"counter":275,"content":"<p>It would be down to the debtor and the practitioner, who will identify a proposal that is satisfactory to them to be put to creditors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000019#S00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lorcan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1398858000,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Is it the case that the legislation does not allow for a 100% sum to be taken?

When I was last before the committee in September, I noted that there were indications the mortgage arrears resolution process was working and, while there was still some way to go, momentum was building.  Based on the evidence of recent months, that momentum has been established and we are starting to see progress by all banks in working to address mortgage arrears issues.  It is still fair to say, however, that full resolution across the system will take a significant amount of time.<\/p><p>  Under the mortgage arrears resolution targets imposed by the Central Bank last year, the banks are required to meet quarterly targets on the resolution of mortgage arrears.  To date, we have received returns from the banks for three quarters, and we reported the outcomes of our first assessment in November.  We recently concluded our audit and assessment of a sample of the banks' end-2013 target returns, which the committee discussed recently with the various institutions.  Based on the information submitted, the banks have proposed sufficient numbers of solutions to meet the targets of proposing solutions for 50% of arrears cases and concluding 15% of them.  I am aware that the term \"concluding\" risks becoming slightly Orwellian; as we know, there is still a lot to be done where a case is treated as \"concluded\".  I am conscious of avoiding terminology that might mislead people and, as such, I am starting to think of these cases as \"confirmed\" as much as \"concluded\".  Having said that, we might be best to keep with what has been published.<\/p><p>  Our audit effort on this occasion was channelled towards what we viewed as the highest-risk areas.  We focused on examining the areas and issues which have caused us most concern and which the banks must address now if they are to build a sustainable, long-term process to deal with arrears.  The audit process involved examinations of individual loan files, based on institution-specific samples, distinguishing, for example, between situations where a bank could be perceived as still relying on short-term solutions and where a bank seemed to be relying on what might be called \"bulk campaigns\", that is, offering similar solutions across the board for a range of cases rather than tailored solutions.  We zoomed in on such practices where we saw them as potentially being a problem.<\/p><p>  I would summarise our findings by saying that although we noted a number of areas of deficiency in the course of the audit, as I will mention below, by and large, the evidence is consistent with a process which is working more or less to target.  We should bear in mind, however, that the targets are limited and our conclusion does not mean everything is sailing perfectly.  A number of key issues emerged in the audit, all of which have been communicated to the banks to address.  First, in some banks, communications with borrowers on proposed sustainable solutions were too frequently verbal in nature and did not provide sufficient clarity to borrowers in respect of the ultimate solution proposed.  Second, there is evidence that despite the requirements for proposed solutions to be sustainable in the long term, short-term loan modifications are still too prevalent in some banks.  Third, affordability assessments were often not evident on files  reported as sustainable.  In a sense, this is a technical breach in that the assessments might actually have been done but were not evident on the files.  We want to ensure, however, that the banks are doing them properly.  Fourth, in a limited number of cases we found issues of potential breaches of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, relating to the timing of the letters in advance of legal proceedings for repossessions commencing.  The code of conduct is an important underpinning to the targets process.  The process is a prudential action and the code of conduct is there to protect the borrower.  The two work in tandem.  The Central Bank will commence a review of CCMA compliance in the second half of the year and these findings will be taken into account as part of the targets review.<\/p><p>  We are communicating the specific issues and actions identified for each bank, including actions arising from our wider insights into the effectiveness of their strategies to resolve mortgage arrears.  While these issues are significant and it is important that action is taken to address them, they should not impede progress on dealing with arrears cases.  We expect the banks to continue to progress cases to sustainable and long-term solutions.  In the meantime, we will continue to review their operations and strategies and where there are deficiencies or we believe things should be done better, we will let them know.  Addressing mortgage arrears was never going to be a short-term issue.  Our view has always been that it would take time to tackle the issues and a number of years to work out.  We are now at a point were progress is evident and, notwithstanding specific areas for improvement by banks, we are moving along the right path.

The initial approach to the crisis in mortgage arrears was to offer everyone affected interest-only repayment arrangements.  This was very much a wait-and-see approach.  The next step in the process involved the Keane report, which prescribed a number of options, and the most recent developments relate to the changes to the bankruptcy laws and the establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland.

This is where the code of conduct on mortgage arrears is underpinning.  I am assured that, with only a few exceptions which I mentioned in the speech, in the vast majority of cases we are satisfied the bank has made the required efforts to engage.

We have been encouraging this from way back, but it did not happen much.  To accelerate that in the case of multiple debts, we started down this route of a pilot programme, more or less facilitated or catalysed by the Central Bank.  We tried to knock heads together.  We tried to get the two representative bodies of the credit unions, some of the non-bank lenders, credit card companies and the banks to come in and discuss how to deal with a borrower who has multiple debts, how to allocate the secured and unsecured debt, and how it gets divided up.

AIB is rolling out split mortgages where part of the debt has been written off.  Bank of Ireland has a rigid policy of no debt write-off whatsoever.

They can decide what solution is offered, including a threatening legal letter.  If the solution is a split mortgage, the bank can determine its terms.

As these approaches gain traction and we get more actual cases, banks will learn from one another what works and what does not.  That is the current position.

In other countries there has been this element.  In some of them big banks have been stating they must ensure they pass the stress tests and should go slow in lending and adjust their international portfolios.  Banks here have been going through an adjustment of their portfolios since before the troika arrived.  There have been massive sales, downsizing, deleveraging and so on and it is on these that they have focused their attention.  I do not see their decisions on new lending and particular designs of loan restructuring as having been a major consideration.

I will paraphrase the Governor words: this is not in the borrower's interests, it is not in the shareholders' interests and it is not in the taxpayers' interests to make these blank statements, especially with regard to the way the bank deals with personal insolvency practitioners.

Many older couples who are in positive equity are deeply concerned at the way the whole situation with positive equity mortgages is going.<\/p><p>  I am keen to raise several issues which have not come up so far, specifically in respect of buy-to-let properties.  One thing we are all aware of is that the number of people now living in the rented sector has risen substantially.  One in five Irish families now live in rented housing and in urban areas the number is far higher.  Yet we know there are significant numbers of distressed buy-to-let mortgages.  I wish to focus on the issue of receivers.  Since 2013, approximately 3,700 receivers have been appointed to buy-to-let properties.  I wish to draw the attention of the Governor to a case I had today.  A lady received a letter dated 25 April advising her that a receiver had been appointed to a buy-to-let property and that she was to have vacated the property by the end of April.  I wish that was an unusual situation, but it is not.  The manner in which receivers are treating people who live in buy-to-let properties is outrageous.  It shows not only a complete and total disregard for the law but a disregard for human beings for whom these properties are homes.<\/p><p>  I am asking the Governor to do two things.  It is necessary to have a code of conduct for buy-to-let mortgages, similar to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears for homeowners, which would protect the interests of tenants in those properties and in particular respect the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, which provides for security of tenure.<\/p><p>  We have poor data on the scale of buy-to-let receiverships, the number of tenancies that are being potentially impacted and the actions that are being taken on the part of lending institutions.  I call on Professor Honohan, as the Governor of the Central Bank, to take this issue seriously.  We are at a point at which the market is rising.  We are seeing receivers being appointed with the sole intention of sale, and there are rising rents and so forth.  This could possibly undermine the lives of many thousands of people who live in rented properties.  I do not expect the Governor to respond to this; I am simply putting it to him that this matter must be addressed urgently and something must be done in this regard.<\/p><p>  Another issue that I am dealing with on a regular basis is the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  I can see that the code of conduct on mortgage arrears is falling down significantly in terms of people being deemed to be non-co-operative borrowers where there is marital breakdown or a relationship breakdown and one party to the situation is co-operating while the other is not.  I suggest that we need to revisit the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, particularly in respect of relationship breakdowns, which are the case in many arrears situations.  It is clear that in relationship breakdown situations we have a particular difficulty with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and people being classified as non-co-operating borrowers.<\/p> <p> Professor Honohan referred, as did other speakers, to the interbank aspect and how difficult it is to have parity across institutions.  What is of particular concern to me, however, is the treatment of individuals by particular banks, in so far as there is no evidence that people are receiving fairness and equality of treatment.  There is no effective appeal process within the banking sector where the solution offered to a customer has been determined to be a sustainable solution.  I was particularly concerned when the delegates from the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service told us that in more than 50% of the cases they dealt with, what they regarded as sustainable packages for clients in terms of what they were capable of paying were overruled by lending institutions.  It was the MABS delegates' view that what people are signing up to as being sustainable solutions are not actually sustainable solutions in the long run and, as such, there is a real necessity to have some element of independence in the process of determining what is, in fact, a sustainable solution.<\/p><p> My final point relates to the role of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  We do not have a level playing field between lender and borrower in this country and the ombudsman is not doing anything to address that.  I have been flooded with letters from people who are entirely dissatisfied with the lack of any independence in this process.  In the course of my work as a solicitor, I never encountered a case where the resolution of a distressed mortgage was what I would call freely negotiated.  In fact, in every single case, the legal fees were paid by the borrower, as were the valuation fees, the purpose of which are to protect the bank's interest.  It is outrageous that there is no independent financial or legal advice available to people who find themselves in mortgage distress.  I am asking Professor Honohan to consider putting in place a bank levy to fund independent advice services.  We must have transparency within the financial institutions so that customers know how a solution that is deemed to be sustainable was arrived at.  Under the current code of conduct on mortgage arrears, the Governor might be able to find out why an individual was offered a particular solution but the individual cannot access that information.  We do not have a level playing field either within institutions or between them, and something must be done about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000029#DD01800","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398864300,"counter":473,"content":"<p>The Senator has made some very important points regarding problems that have bubbled to the surface because of the scale of debt distress.

One point that is sometimes made is that the more process we put in, the longer it takes to get a solution.  I am not sure that is a good argument.  We had hoped that by defining targets for the banks in terms of what we are calling sustainable solutions - I realise that heading in the table includes letters, but that is not where it will end up - we would be tying their hands in a way that forces them to do something that actually is good for the borrower when combined with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  That does not give a level playing field, but it does constrain the banks relative to what they might otherwise do.  They might, for example, have preferred to get out quickly in many cases or do nothing at all.  The latter is the more likely because in our experience of the banks, they did nothing for years and years.  We have tried to move down the route towards sustainable solutions.  As part of that, we have considered the idea of trying to provide a better level of information for customers.  The personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, process is part of that, with the personal insolvency practitioners helping borrowers to put together a package that can deal not just with one creditor, but with many.  While the process is not satisfactory, we should not rush off in every direction.  Most of these issues are not specifically matters for the Central Bank, but we have tried to work with the banks that are under our control.  I hear what the Senator is saying and take it on board.<\/p><p>  On the issue of tenancies and so on, the Senator has raised it with me before and I looked into it.  She knows the situation perfectly, namely, that it is an entirely separate piece of regulation.  All of it applies to banks, but in respect of their compliance with the law rather through any particular code the Central Bank establishes.  The consumer protection code is relevant to the extent that the banks themselves are dealing with tenants.

Before making my next point, I emphasise that I have the height of respect both for the position the Governor holds and for him as an individual holding that position.  However, in light of the testimony we have heard from the banks and from organisations which are trying to help borrowers in distress, and from everything I have seen come through my own door and through various discussions we have had, I was very disappointed with Professor Honohan's opening statement.  Were I a banker, on the other hand, I would be reasonably happy with it.  The message is that things are more or less going according to plan, that the Central Bank has identified four areas in which change is required and is working with the banks to ensure it happens.  That certainly does not represent any type of call to arms.<\/p> <p>It does not indicate that any alarms went off in the Central Bank to warn that something was going quite seriously wrong and that the approach needed to be changed.  If I were some of the banks who came before the committee two weeks ago, I would be pretty happy.  My interpretation would be that the Central Bank is more or less okay with the way the banks are proceeding to deal with this matter.  If I were a borrower whose mortgage is in distress or an individual who was trying to assist such borrowers - not to mention the fact that I am a Deputy - I would be extremely disappointed with what I have heard today.<\/p><p> I am of the view that the Central Bank is taking a hands-off approach to this matter.  Let me explain why I believe this to be the case.  We know the banks are allowed to define what constitutes a sustainable offer and that they do so within parameters set by the Central Bank.  However, the banks have quite a broad remit in the context of what they view to be sustainable.  The banks now have more or less unlimited contact with their customers as a result of the changes to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  We are aware that not only can the banks veto any insolvency proposal, but two of them have stated that they will - as a matter of policy - veto any such proposal which includes a write-down of secured debt.  We know that the banks are allowed to categorise customers - Irish citizens - as being uncooperative.  This is not Professor Honohan's fault; it is as a result of the changes introduced in the legislation.  It is outrageous that Irish banks are allowed to deny Irish citizens access to the legislative process of insolvency by stating that they believe them to be not co-operating.  If a borrower wants to make an appeal against the actions of a bank, it must go to the bank itself.<\/p><p> I believe everything I have just said to be true.  We are also aware that there is absolutely no consistency.  Representatives from the four main lenders came before the committee last week.  A previous speaker already outlined the interactions that took place with Mr. Richie Boucher, and Bank of Ireland has stated that it will veto any PIA which includes a proposed write-down of unsecured debt.  We know that Bank of Ireland's split-mortgage concept is a farce.  This is because it charges the same interest on the shelved portion as it does in respect of the non-shelved portion.  The figures presented by all of the banks show that Bank of Ireland's rate of legal proceedings initiated is two to four times higher than the other three institutions.  We all know that the difference between financial recovery and financial ruin for those in Ireland who are dealing with unsustainable debt largely comes down to the bank one is dealing with.  A person can be really unlucky and have his or her loan sold to LoanStar, Oaktree Capital or any of the other unregulated entities.  He or she can also be unlucky in that he or she might be obliged to deal with Bank of Ireland as opposed to one of the other three banks, from which he or she might obtain a deal.  We are aware that there is very little quality on offer and that thousands of legal letters have been sent out.  The vast majority of the so-called sustainable proposals take the form of either legal letters or extend-and-pretend measures such as interest-only arrangements, recapitalisation of arrears and so forth.  I do not believe that the approach to take in dealing with an unsustainable debt crisis is to increase the total payments due during the course of the type of arrangements to which I refer.  Essentially, the latter is actually what is happening.<\/p><p> I hope Professor Honohan's sense of urgency and that of the Central Bank are greater than what has been outlined here.  Does Professor Honohan find it acceptable that there is so much inconsistency across the banks in the context of how they are dealing with people?  Does he find it acceptable that several of them are publicly stating they are going to go against the spirit of the insolvency process?  Does he find it acceptable that so few insolvency agreements have been concluded to date?  Does he find it acceptable that the vast majority of so-called solutions involve either legal threats or an increase in the total amount that borrowers will be obliged to repay?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000030#EE01400","speaker":"1107","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398864900,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I can see how the wording of my statement may have informed what the Deputy just said.

The Chairman referred to the fact that when I came before the committee just over a year ago, I had referred to tearing my hair out, etc.  After the meeting in question we introduced this regime or process and I thought it would not be productive to make empty gestures of frustration, particularly when the process started to generate actual results.  The glass is either half-full or half-empty, or an eighth full and seven eighths empty in this regard.  Deals are being done, split mortgages - some more effective than others - are on offer and there are numbers in four figures in respect of term extensions and arrears capitalisation.  The Central Bank has engaged outsiders and is using its own staff to try to probe the latter to see whether they are really viable.  We have rejected some, but viable arrangements are being reached.  I accept, however, that they are not all perfect.  I am sure the quality of both the engagement and the communication, which is so crucial for the well-being of the borrower, is very mixed and uneven.  I am of the view, however, that the process is gaining traction.  The more cases that are dealt with, the more people will learn from them and converge on the most effective types of arrangement.<\/p><p>  It will be a long haul.  After what Deputy McDonald said, I am afraid to use particular words.  If I use the word \"unpleasant\", people will be of the view that I am being condescending or something of that nature.  I accept that it is an extremely difficult process for borrowers and it is not being handled well.  However, it is being handled, and something is happening.  I have no doubt that the Deputy and his colleagues are being approached by constituents - particularly those whose arrangements are not working - who want to relay what has happened to them.  I am sure there are numerous cases in which the arrangements reached are not working.

Why has the Central Bank not eased or shown more flexibility in terms of credit union lending?  For the credit unions to start lending, as the Minister has said, the Central Bank must ease or lift unreasonable or inflexible lending restrictions.  Serious consideration must be given to the role credit unions can play in helping to return prosperity to communities and the mortgage arrears resolution process must take into account that even when people have committed to prioritising and meeting mortgage repayments, there may be a need for a small line of credit to assist with essential expenditure.  For example, if somebody's only means of transport to go to work is a car and that breaks down they cannot get to work and they do not get paid, which has an impact on their ability to keep their mortgage repayments up to date.  It is important that the Central Bank recognises the need for this service and supports credit unions in providing it.  I am aware an emergency loan of &euro;500 is available but that is not much use these days, particularly if an emergency arises.<\/p><p>  The restrictions in section 35 of the Credit Union Act limit or prohibit a credit union from granting credit to a member whose repayments were rescheduled due to a change in financial circumstances but whose ability to repay has improved.  In other words, the section 35 restrictions are preventing members from benefiting from improvements in their financial circumstances.  That should be revisited and revised because some people are being disadvantaged as a result of their membership of credit unions.<\/p><p>  On the tiered regulatory approach, the proposals in Consultation Paper CP 76 mark a significant departure for the Central Bank from its role as a regulator.  The proposals, if implemented, would give the Central Bank an operational role in the day to day management of credit unions impacting directly on the core areas of lending, savings and investments.  The intention behind the tiered regulatory approach was to have the appropriate regulatory burden on credit unions, not to micro-manage them.  If this intention is to be realised, the Central Bank would need to take full consideration of the feedback received and revise its proposals before the next phase of consultation.<\/p><p>  In terms of engagement with credit unions, I speak to people involved in credit unions on a regular basis and I am being told that the Central Bank is not responding to individual credit unions in a timely manner, which is impacting on the operational management of credit unions.  I have been told about instances where individual credit unions have submitted information required to move forward to the annual general meeting, AGM, or sought agreement for necessary expenditure but they are facing inordinate delays in getting a response from the Central Bank.  They may not even get a response for a status update on their query.  What supports is the Central Bank putting in place to ensure the necessary back-up is available to assist credit union chairpersons and directors?  Directors of credit unions are not the same as directors of banks but in certain cases they are being treated like directors of banks.  Instances have been brought to my attention regarding the treatment received by credit union directors from the Central Bank, which is appalling.  I met one person who was very upset by the treatment received in the Central Bank, and it has impacted on the person's health.  That is very unfair in terms of some of the people I know very well.  They are decent people who are trying to provide a voluntary service in their community and it is unacceptable that people should be treated like that by officials in the Central Bank.  I ask Professor Honohan to comment on that type of behaviour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000032#GG00900","speaker":"973"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398865500,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I re-emphasise that we regard the credit union sector as something that should grow and be a more important and stronger part of the financial sector, particularly in dealing with households, microbusinesses and so forth.  We have been taking steps to help the process of strengthening the sector.  We have been working with the Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo.  We have had an attempt to save the Newbridge Credit Union in a new structure through merger.  That did not work but we managed to achieve another merger.  Weaker credit unions consolidation into stronger but still locally based credit unions is ongoing.  That is not what the Deputy raised but I want to emphasise that we regard that as important.<\/p><p>  I believe the credit union movement can become much stronger but I am not sure that the necessary strengthening of the credit union sector will be welcomed by some excessively narrow localism that leads credit unions to be too small to be effective.  That is my own view, and I believe it is a view of some people within the sector but also some outside it.  In most other countries the credit union sector consolidated somewhat 30 years ago.  It is very small here.<\/p><p>  There are some restrictions and there is a perception that they apply to more credit unions than is the case.  I understand that fewer than 10% of credit unions are under restrictions for the total amount of lending they will do in a particular month.  The vast majority of credit unions are not restricted in the amount of lending in aggregate they would make in a particular month.  Some credit unions have individual loan size restrictions but the level at which the limit is imposed ensures that the vast majority of those credit unions can continue to make loans that are significantly more than the average loan for the sector, which is &euro;6,000.  That is the average loan size for the sector as a whole.  The restrictions in place on a large number of credit unions tend to be for amounts between &euro;10,000 and &euro;30,000.  Where a credit union has restrictions in the size of individual loans because of issues the Registrar has with them those loan sizes are sometimes &euro;10,000, &euro;30,000 and amounts in between.

It would be terrible to think that borrowers would not be treated with respect.

I could comment that we are contemplating expanding, and probably will expand, our staffing in the area of credit unions.  The observation has been made that, since most credit unions are small and of relatively low impact on the economy because they are local in impact, we have applied a limited amount of regulatory resources.  We should increase that.  I expect, although the decision has not been finally taken, that we will substantially increase the number of staff dealing with the credit union sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000033#HH00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1398866100,"counter":510,"content":"<p>Professor Honohan stated the average credit union loan is &euro;6,000.

Regulatory capture comes to mind.  This must be the worst ever illustration of it.

The late Professor George Stigler won a Nobel prize for pointing out that regulatory capture is a form of political corruption that occurs when a regulatory agency, created to act in the public interest, instead advances the commercial or special concerns of interest groups that dominate the industry or sector it is charged with regulating.

Public interest directors would form the subject of my first question.  Public interest directors were supposed to deal with that.  My impression is that they are useless, like a lighthouse on the Bog of Allen.  Do they ever come to Professor Honohan?  They were meant to redress that balance between the public and the interests which had captured the regulator, such as in the case to which the Vice Chairman referred.<br\/>Professor Honohan mentioned that we have 13,000 plus cases, or 15%, resolved.  Does that mean there are 85,000 to go?  That is question two.<br\/>When the bankers were in, I asked Mr. Boucher his present policy.  He is lending up to 90% of the value of the property and up to 4.7 times income.  I would put the question to the Governor that this is unsustainable.  The 10% deposit should be 20%, which, as Professor Honohan will be aware, works much better in Denmark where there is a much lower rate of default, and it should be 2.5 times income.  If, however, Mr. Boucher is operating in this way, does this mean a problem will occur?  There are already signs of a property bubble.  As principles regulation does not work with those without principles, the Central Bank should have quantified rules, such as the ones I have mentioned, where if the Governor feels the market is overheating, he would want to raise the 10% deposit requirement to 20%, which I would certainly do, and reduce 4.7 times income to 2.5 times income.  Otherwise we will always have this problem.<br\/>That brings me to the next question.  Where borrowers have gone widely outside even those limits, which I regard as too loose, have we ever made the decision that the bank loses because it was engaged with reckless lending, that is, lending somebody multiples of income where the income was not properly checked?  Professor Honohan mentions in his presentation that too often the relationships were &quot;frequently verbal in nature&quot; and &quot;affordability assessments were often not evident on files reported as sustainable&quot;.  Bankers have to bear some of the responsibility in these matters and we should at least be able in the theoretical case of Mr. Bloggs, where the bank was totally irresponsible and there was no way Mr. Bloggs could ever have repaid the loan, to decide against the banks in that instance.<br\/>On the buy-to-lets, Professor Honohan mentioned property rights.  We have to be insistent on that.  The debt is against the person who borrowed, not against the person who lives in the house.  Professor Honohan should, as the regulator, tell the banks they may pursue whoever built the buy-to-lets, but if we can prove the person has been paying his or her rent the whole time, they cannot evict, directly or indirectly, that person.  It is a long time ago since Charles Stewart Parnell was looking for fixity of tenure in Parliament.<br\/>As we have Professor Honohan here, I ask that the Setanta Insurance issue would be pursued in Malta, not here.  I am getting tired of bailing out insurance companies, as I am sure is Professor Honohan.  We have had Quinn, PMPA and ICI.  Professor Honohan may have seen an article in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>two Sundays ago about how Ireland has made a great leap forward and is a wonderful place for insurance, and then two days later yet another insurance company goes bust.  I hope there is no case that the Irish would have to bail out a company that was regulated in Malta.<br\/>On all the mistakes we saw to which the Chairman alluded, I presume we have rules that one does not play golf, dine or socialise with the sector one is supposed to be regulating, minutes are kept, persons are checked in and out, and it is put on a proper basis.  Knowing Professor Honohan as a former colleague, I am sure he is doing all that, but the public needs assurance.  This was not loose touch or light touch regulation.  It was merely non-supervision.  It has done &euro;64 billion and counting worth of damage.  Professor Honohan even mentioned we have been at this for five years.  I am disappointed at the progress.  This Parliament has been here for three years.  We really need to have more than 15% of the cases resolved at this stage.<br\/>Having said all that, I wish my former colleague every success.  However, we need to speed it up.  The problem Professor Honohan must address with all his 1,300 staff is that the tradition of regulatory capture, which was appalling, has no place ever again in the regulation of the financial sector in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000033#HH01200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398866100,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I will take the questions one by one.  Of course public interest directors are appointed by the Minister for Finance.  From time to time, I have had occasion to have meetings, usually at their initiation and, occasionally, at my instigation, with public interest directors, more in the early days of the crisis and not so much now.  However, these are public interest, not Central Bank, nominees.<\/p><p>  Senator Barrett is correct in saying if one has 13,000 restructures out of 127,000 arrears of more than 90 days, there is an awful long way to go.<\/p> <p>I refer to 13,000 concluded or confirmed, while some 62,000 are proposed.  We know where they are going but we do not really know with half of them.  They will be starting down the legal route and, as has been extensively discussed, we hope and expect they will deviate back towards restructuring arrangements.  However, the Deputy's numbers are right and there is still a big task ahead.  The only question is whether it is fruitful to complain rather than build on what exists.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked a very interesting question about loan-to-value ratios and debt-to-income ratios.  These are the tools of choice that I would have thought the Central Bank could bring into play well before the emergence of another property boom.  There has not been a need to employ them.  Even if property prices jump up in Dublin during most of 2014, it is not representative of a credit-driven set of circumstances.  The use of loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios, which remain controversial worldwide, represents the way to go.  Now that there are standards and procedures in Europe for macro-prudential rules, there are ways of saying to Europe we are going to introduce certain measures although they may not be in harmony with those in the rest of Europe.  As long as Europe does not say \"No\", we can do that.  This is not a matter for today or tomorrow.  I refer to a framework that will need to be created for the long haul.<\/p><p> With regard to the condition of tenants, I will be told that we do not have the power in the Central Bank to restrict the use of rent receivers and the consequences for tenants and that this is governed by other laws.  Senator Aideen Hayden suggested that the interpretation I adumbrated was not correct.   Perhaps she is correct; perhaps there is something that could and should be done.  I take it as an action point to dig further into the issue but I am not optimistic.<\/p><p> On the Setanta case, let me offer some points of information that might be of use.  The company had a licence in another part of the European Union and started operating here in 2007.  Although the Central Bank had no information about the company's balance sheet and finances, and the fact that it had grown to a sizeable scale, by November 2013 we had become concerned and had some concrete suggestions that there could be problems with this.  We drew this to the attention of the Maltese regulatory authorities, and they took a series of actions over the following weeks.  That has led to the circumstances in question.  We were not behind hand in using the information we had, communicating it to the prudential regulator and getting the action.  If we had known earlier, had information earlier and acted earlier, perhaps it would have been a smaller hole.  If we had not done anything, it would no doubt have become a bigger hole.  It is a partial result.  The insurance compensation fund is established under legislation to provide for Irish-based risks.  That is a matter for the courts and any change in legislation that might occur.  In principle, that is what would be used.  It is not a matter for the Central Bank anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000033#HH01300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1398866700,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I thank the Governor for attending.

Were there terms and conditions attached to the giving of those funds?  We hear quite often, particularly from Bank of Ireland, that the bank was provided with funds from the Government for the purpose of recapitalisation.  We are told Bank of Ireland is repaying those funds and doing so at a profit to the Central Bank and State.  I have a fundamental problem with that.  We might be able to address the mortgage crisis partially through this.  I would have believed recapitalisation was for the betterment not of the shareholders but of the citizens of the country.  The fundamental role of a board of directors is the protection of the shareholders according to its fiduciary duties.  However, when a state steps in and recapitalises the banks, it does so for the betterment of the public so any funding provided to recapitalise banks should be provided with strict conditions attached.  There should be no early repayment of the loans.  What I propose should be done particularly for the purpose of debt write-down.<\/p><p>  In some of the questions, particularly those of Deputy Donnelly, I noted the view that an interest-only mortgage is an acceptable form of functioning loan.  I do not believe it is acceptable that somebody could be in debt for 30 to 50 years in some cases and paying off large amounts of interest although not having an asset at the end of it.  There has to be capacity to pay and to be released from the debt.<\/p><p>  If I were to ask a question on the recapitalisation of the banks in particular, I would ask what conditions were attached, whether the Central Bank understood it was for the purpose of writing down debt and whether it would involve a liability on a balance sheet for the medium and long-term for the institution.  From my perspective, the only people who have been fundamental winners consequent to the recapitalisation of the banks by the Government in 2011 are the shareholders.

Has Professor Honohan, at any stage, given an instruction to bank directors to conduct an internal inquiry as to whether they were in breach of their fiduciary duties at the time the banks collapsed?  Some of the directors have appeared before us here and said that they have had no inquiry into why the economy collapsed.  They have no idea why the property cycle collapsed or why their own banks collapsed because they have not done an internal inquiry.  That is not appropriate.  If there was a problem in any institution governed by this State, there would be an internal inquiry immediately, whatever about an inquiry at a higher level.

Ultimately, every man, woman and child is feeling the consequences.  Professor Honohan knows this and I am not trying to be too populist about it.

This committee has had a number of discussions on the matter, and we are hoping at the end of all this that we might put together a short report on it.  As Professor Honohan said, addressing mortgage arrears was never going to be a short-term issue, but on the other hand we did not expect it to become a long-term issue.  There is a sense, however, that it is dragging on.  People are now talking about austerity fatigue because they feel this crisis is dragging on.  Mortgage arrears have had a significant effect on the psychology of people one meets daily.  It even concerns people who are not as affected as the thousands who still have to work out their own arrears situations.<\/p><p>  Would Professor Honohan recommend any changes?  How does he define his own role in this?  Is it simply to implement policy or does he see himself as having a leadership role, making strong recommendations to us and getting them moved on?<\/p> <p>There is a real need.<\/p><p> It is funny.  When we had the banks in here, they took up a very strong commercial position, which Professor Honohan would expect them to have.  They are there to respect their shareholders rather than Government policy.  Many of the organisations who came here the week before the banks did were focused on the question of what we were really doing to help people out.  They seemed to present, although there were variations on the theme, a sense that things were not moving fast enough for people in arrears, that banks were prevaricating, holding back and seeing if they could squeeze a last drop out of those in serious financial trouble.  Deputy O'Donnell raised the issue of banks going after those individuals who have positive equity.  Can Professor Honohan tell the banks to tidy up those issues where there is negative equity and arrears before going after positive equity?  It appears that what we used to call the \"low hanging fruit\" is being exploited very quickly by the banks to see what they can grab and pull at.  Perhaps, in ten years time the people who really are in serious financial trouble and are now having psychological and emotional trouble as matters drags on will be discarded.  I do not like the approach being taken by the banks and I wonder if it is our fault as regulators or if there is more the Central Bank could do with the legislation it already has.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000035#KK01400","speaker":"1095","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398867900,"counter":545,"content":"<p>It is partly an organisational issue, which is improving.

The area of advice to borrowers is one which has been a gap and it is gradually being filled from various sources, including the personal insolvency practitioners, which is why it is very important the banks do not behave in a way that is suggested in relation to personal insolvency arrangements.  It is partly an information thing, therefore.

I thank Professor Honohan for attending.  I am not formally a member of the committee any more for reasons which have nothing to do with finance or financial analysis but involve party Whips and how they are applied in the country.<\/p><p>  Professor Honohan will recall that in the summer of 2009, the late Mr. Brian Lenihan, who was then Minister for Finance, had asked PricewaterhouseCoopers to do a listing of bills of lading of loans for transfer to NAMA.  I want to give a chronology and at points along it to ask a question.  I hope it will be a good prompt and an opportunity to ask questions.<\/p><p>  We met in the summer of 2008 in Professor Honohan's offices in Trinity College.  I remember having done a bit of analysis on the six Irish-owned institutions and a very clear picture emerged as to how they stood at the time the music stopped and where they had come from over the preceding four years.  There had been &euro;200 billion of turbo-charged lending.  As Professor Honohan stated in one of his answers earlier, it was a credit-fuelled bust, which is something which had not happened before at this scale.  The &euro;200 billion on what was the starting &euro;200 billion was a 100% increase in the size of the balance sheets of the six Irish-owned institutions in less than four years.  That is red hot.  It is like looking at the needle in the thermometer of one's car going into the extreme of red.  Does Professor Honohan agree that the boards of banks, on which sit the people of probity to run banks under a licence to take deposits given by the Central Bank, should have been aware at an early stage that there had been an abandonment of prudential balance sheet management?  It is measurable in 2008 by looking at the loan-to-customer deposit ratios of the six Irish-owned institutions, which were AIB, Bank of Ireland, PTSB, Irish Nationwide Building Society, EBS and Anglo Irish Bank.  The ratio stood at a weighted average of 173%, which was 83% above the prudential norm of 90% that should apply to high street banks.  That is a form of measurement of the contribution of the banks and their boards to the asset price bubble which was built on the credit bubble.  As a proportion of 90%, 82% is 92%.  It is measurably and objectively right to say that the Irish-owned banking sector created 92% of the asset-price bubble.<\/p><p>  When the bubble collapsed, like a Ponzi scheme, the question was: \"What is left?\"  It was the wreckage of assets and the banks' insistence on collecting all the credit they had advanced into the asset price bubble.<\/p> <p>To me, that is all wrong and I hope Professor Honohan agrees.<br\/>When I met Professor Honohan in October 2009 after his appointment, I said that it was apparent from the balance sheets of the banks that losses of the order of &euro;50 billion would probably need to be pencilled in for just the commercial and land development bubble and that in addition to that, there could be up to &euro;35 billion on the mortgage loan books, and give or take that we were going to be in the order of &euro;92 billion to &euro;100 billion.  Five years later, that is exactly where we are.  Yet back in March 2010 at the time that the first prudential capital asset review was carried out, Mr. Elderfield insisted that the modelling of the three B's - Blackrock, Boston and Barclays - indicated that their model was very reliable and showed that AIB would need &euro;6.7 billion before the year end, that Bank of Ireland would need &euro;3.5 billion and that AIB would sell off the Polish bank, which was the best capitalised part of the group and was cash-flow sustainable, into an economy that was not asset price-blown by a credit price bubble.  That was the decision.  The Pied Piper story was told and everybody fell for it.  Fast forward to March 2011 when there had to be another prudential capital asset review.  This was going to be final because on 30 September 2010, the final figures had emerged.  The late Brian Lenihan said it was &euro;50 billion but it was wrong again.  <br\/>All this could have been avoided if people stopped and looked at the balance sheets and the recoverability of assets that had been created out of a credit-fuelled bubble.  Let us take the example of Bank of Ireland.  How much of the funding for Bank of Ireland's balance sheet in 2008 was from senior secured bonds alone, leaving aside the subordinated loans?  The answer is &euro;61 billion.  That is 40-something percent of the Irish national income.  It is mind-blowing and is on top of the 173% of loans to customers' deposits.<br\/>Today we hear that a Chairman for the impending banking inquiry has been appointed.  I might be excluded from the inquiry.  It is not that I wanted to do it but somebody who understands these things needs to be on the committee to say, &quot;Here are the balance sheets of the banks from 2001 to 2008.  Let's calibrate them and see what was the credit creation, what was the funding behind that asset bubble and where do the responsibilities and accountabilities lie?&quot;  I do not want scalps or people shot at dawn.  I want boards of directors who are <i>in situ<\/i>and getting very good fees to talk and perhaps look thick if they do not know the answer to the question of why they abandoned the policy of fractional reserving.  It needs to be done.  It is a simple exercise.  We do not need a Nyberg report and with respect, we do not need Professor Honohan and his team to carry out a big exercise.  Nor do we need a Watson or Regling report.  The balance sheets give the answers.  That is what frustrates me.  <br\/>When we come back to macro-prudential rules, they are the ones that will stop a credit bubble.  The Danish economist Niels Thygesen swivels around the world visiting all the prudential meetings of the banks and various countries.  Do members remember the meeting in The Four Seasons hotel about three years ago?  At lunch time, I asked Mr. Thygesen about what could have happened if at meetings with the banks, he and his regulator colleagues had asked to look at the short-form balance sheets of the banks and loans to customers' deposits.  I asked him whether if they had been kept at below 100%, this massive credit bubble could have occurred like it did.  He said &quot;No&quot; and I agreed.  One knows mathematically that one keeps back 10% of a deposit that comes in, one lends out 90%, that 90% comes back, one lends out 81% and one keeps back 9% and so on.  Add them all up and it comes to the original deposit of 100% and one has lent out 641%.  That is it.  If on top of that, one adds something like three and a half times' income as a macro-prudential rule for preventing a credit-fuelled asset price bubble, this is the sustainable income of the customers because there is now so much short-term contract employment that one does not know what can be maintained.  One could take another approach in terms of loan-to-value ratios when the value of a property is the consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000036#LL01600","speaker":"1183","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1398868500,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I must interrupt Deputy Mathews.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014043000037#MM00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1398868500,"counter":562,"content":"<p>This always happens.

It could be &euro;80,000.  What is four times' that?  It is &euro;320,000.  One is in the ball park.  They are the macro-prudential templates that keep everything safe but the members of boards were where it all went wrong.  These members probably did not even understand balance sheet structure and engineering.  If they had, somebody would have said \"Stop\".  Alternatively, perhaps they were greedy and wanted a return on equity.  This meant that they piled in by issuing bonds at &euro;61 billion in the case of Anglo Irish Bank to get an extra return on equity.  Then they are not bankers.  Only 18 months to two years ago, one of the directors of Bank of Ireland came from the betting industry.  It is funny, is it not?  Twenty-five years ago, that would have been unthinkable.

I draw their attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise that the opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  <br\/>As members are aware, we have two not-for-profit community groups represented.  In addition, Irish TV is a commercial entity.  Obviously, there is a lot happening in broadcasting all over the spectrum, including the drafting of a broadcasting Bill that is due to be introduced.  It is important, therefore, to hear different perspectives and about the needs of each group and to see if there are similarities between them.

I am the chairman of Dublin Community Television, DCTV.  I am joined by Mr. Ciaran Moore, the former manager of DCTV, and Ms Marilyn Hyndman, the manager of Northern Visions TV in Belfast.  <\/p><p>  The activities of our colleagues involved in community radio predate ours and we learned much from them.  They raised points about the need for reliable funding.  Funding that recognises the need to cover training and mentoring, as well as the cost of content production, is an essential part of supporting community media.  In this presentation I will quickly outline our view of community television and its social significance.  To further the benefits to be gained from community television, we propose two ideas to be considered by the committee in the context of forthcoming legislation.  The first concerns the creation of local funding for community broadcasting.  The second concerns the delivery of a national community channel alongside three other Saorview channels.<\/p><p>  I will speak briefly about the social benefits of community broadcasting.  For almost a century, broadcasting has helped to integrate local and national communities.  For example, the papal visit in 1979 and the 1990 World Cup created a sense of a shared experience and identity.  Today, such shared media events are rare.  With a multiplication of channels, platforms and viewing options, people now share very few media experiences.  The media ties that have helped to bind local and national communities are unravelling.  Social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook allow people to voice opinions, offer arguments and showcase their creativity.  They allow them to speak as active producers, rather than remaining passive consumers, as in the case of old media.  People now commonly expect media to be participatory and give them a voice.  Unfortunately, these platforms can also tend towards atomisation and a polarised cacophony of opinion without any real debate.  Social media allow everyone to speak.  However, they offer no guarantee that one will be heard.  Community broadcasting offers a compromise position between people being integrated but passive, as in the case of traditional models of broadcasting, and active and atomised in terms of new social media.<\/p><p>  DCTV has worked hard to make engaging, well produced programmes.  It is important to mention that, as in the case of community radio, DCTV is owned by a co-operative.  It is owned by its members.  Its key objectives are empowerment, diversity and participation.  The process of making television, training people and building skills and confidence in local communities is central.  It is often more important than the popularity, critical reception or technical polish of the finished product.  Over six years, more than 3,000 people were involved in producing hundreds of hours of television with DCTV.  We have included a list of notable productions in supporting material for the committee's consideration.  While this television may have had varying production values and audience appeal, we tried to ensure it was \"good television\" in the sense that it empowered those who made it.  This raises a key limitation in policy and funding which, to date, has been guided by an understanding of \"good television\" that is limited to programmes as they appear on screen.  Policy has effectively been blind to the benefits of engaging people in production, training them in media literacy and making them active producers rather than passive receivers of media content.<\/p><p>  With this in mind, we offer two proposals.  The first concerns local funding.  DCTV believes local funding can facilitate an alignment between community broadcasting, education and community development.  Community television needs support, training and mentoring to be built into its costing model.  We believe there is an opportunity for a local fund to accompany the national broadcasting fund to be managed by existing structures at local level.  Media for social benefit should form an important part of the new local economic and community plans for each area.  We propose that a local public service broadcasting fund be created, keeping a percentage of the public service broadcasting charge in the area in which it is collected.  This would help to build media skills and develop community and local broadcasting all over Ireland.  When combined with the local community development programme and Leader funding, this would offer a way to build digital and creative skills in all of our communities.<\/p><p>  I now turn to our proposal for an all-island community channel.  DCTV has followed the creation of digital terrestrial television, DTT, with interest.  The Broadcasting Act 2009 set out that two digital channels would be devoted to the Oireachtas and film.  These have not materialised - in large part because of carriage fees that must be paid to RTE Networks, now 2rn, to recoup the cost of building a digital transmission system.  Ironically this means that Ireland's expensive DTT infrastructure is badly underused.  There are only eight channels on Saorview, unlike international averages of more than 40 channels on national digital platforms.  As community broadcasters, we propose that more imaginative use be made of money from the broadcasting charge to cover the cost of four new Saorview channels.  In addition to the Oireachtas and film channels mentioned in Chapter 6 of the 2009 Act, we also advocate the creation of a community channel and an arts channel.  Based on the Department's review of the cost of the Oireachtas channel, we believe an allocation of &euro;5 million per year from the public service broadcasting charge would see four new channels added to Saorview.  This would strengthen the service availed of by more than 350,000 people and create space for innovation and community development.  Already, a consortium made up of Northern Visions in Belfast and DCTV, with support from Cork Community Television, has submitted a combined expression of interest in establishing an all-island channel to the BAI.  This was favourably received.  Such a channel would offer an exciting opportunity for communities all over the island of Ireland.  An all-island community channel would empower communities by carrying their programmes.  It would also ensure their voices were heard by providing national television coverage on Saorview, Freeview, cable and a range of mobile and digital solutions.  This facilitation of grassroots discussion and debate would be a valuable contribution to local democracy and civil society on the island of Ireland.  It would also support the ongoing efforts under the Good Friday Agreement which addresses relationships within Northern Ireland and between Northern Ireland and the Republic.<\/p> <p> I would like to reiterate that community television contributes to society by representing and empowering diverse communities.  We would suggest to the committee that a combination of local funding and a national community channel would best realise the opportunities that community television presents.  I thank the members of the committee for their time and we will respond to any questions they may have later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014043000005#J00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eddie Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1398857100,"counter":650,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Brennan for his comprehensive presentation and thought-provoking suggestions, which are important.

I thank the Cathaoirleach and members of the committee for inviting us as new broadcasters to put across our views.  It is a brave move to sit down and talk to us because we believe we are the future of television in Ireland.  People ask why has Irish TV come about or why is it being launched.  It has come about out of a sense of frustration and fear - frustration that we were not able to get work for the creative sector and for the people who were working with us and fear that we would not have any work and that we may have had to emigrate like many other people.  There was also a burning desire to do something for ourselves and to fight back.  We believe we have created something that will benefit every county of Ireland and that will also fill the remit of the Government in connecting with the global diaspora.<br\/>Irish TV will be launched officially tomorrow night.  If anybody would like to come along they are more than welcome to attend.  It will be launched by An Taoiseach.  He has given it his support and watched it develop during the past three years.<br\/>Irish TV is Ireland&rsquo;s first international TV channel, bringing local stories from every corner of Ireland to a global audience and connecting the Irish diaspora with home.  It is a unique and innovative TV platform for Ireland to broadcast its message internationally and connect with the estimated 70 million people of Irish descent.  From tomorrow we will be broadcasting 24 hours a day, producing 50 unique home-produced programmes per week, with original content each night from 6 p.m. until 12 midnight.  <br\/>Irish TV is a &euro;15 million project, backed by London millionaire and Irish citizen, John Griffin.  We are very serious about what we are doing for the industry.  Our headquarters are based in County Mayo.  We have four regional offices already established and operating in Tyrone, Manchester, London and Cleveland.  We are committed to the project and we know that it will work.  We have been working on it on a pilot basis for the past three years and the reaction from every corner of Ireland is why did it not happen sooner.<br\/>We broadcast in Ireland on the free to air service, which is very important in that people do not have to pay to get the service.  We are on the commercial platform Sky TV, Freesat, and on Eircom's eVision.  The current household reach for Irish TV is 3 million households.  Irish TV is currently in carriage negotiations with UPC through its partner, Virgin Media.  We have also approached RTE NL to discuss carriage on Saorview.  I concur with Dr. Eddie Brennan's view that Saorview should be made available in a much more cost-effective model to create a platform for new broadcasters.  At present it costs &euro;1 million plus to get a channel on Soarview.  We have also entered talks with RTE about content sharing and distribution of RTE Digital content worldwide on the Irish TV networks.  We will be entering talks with TG4 and TV3 very soon.  <br\/>In the UK, Irish TV is available to Northern Ireland and UK households on Sky TV and on Freesat.  We are currently in carriage negotiations with Virgin Media and with the local broadcasters in the UK.  The British Government is very excited and interested in the development of local TV services.  I believe that the model we have come up with will benefit the entire country of Ireland.<br\/>In Europe, we are at an advanced stage of negotiations with a number of European broadcasters who see the value in what we have worked on during the past three years - the structures, the content and the ability to distribute it globally.  In America, Irish TV programming has been broadcast on various PBS networks across the US in the past two years. The Public Broadcasting Service, PBS, has 354 member television stations which hold collective ownership.  Irish TV is continually in talks with the PBS regarding distribution of Irish TV content across America and that is growing all the time.  We are also in talks with Comcast Corporation, the largest cable company and home Internetservice provider inthe United States, about distributing the content on its networks and we will have news on that very soon.  <br\/>While one would think of the traditional places in which the Irish diaspora are based, namely the UK or America, we have had an important delegation from China, comprising the lead broadcasters in China, visit us.  A delegation of seven key media owners travelled to Ireland to negotiate carriage partnership with Irish TV and now we have been invited to go China to see where the synergies and links are between the two countries.  They are examining our content and structures and want to see how they can tie in and benefit both countries as we move forward.<br\/>We are also in negotiations with carriers and broadcasters in Australia and in Africa, which shows the level of interest in what we have done from very humble beginnings.  Those are our terrestrial partners.  In this context I am talking about the television in the corner of the room, which is very important at present because, unfortunately, the rollout of broadband has not been fast enough to create what we are building towards, which is the future of television online.  People can watch our content on their television in the corner of the room.<br\/>On the Internet platforms and IPTV, Irish TV is available on mobile telephones, iPads, tablets and computers via the Irishtv.ie and <i>Irishtv.com<\/i>websites - the dotcom site being very important for the American market.  The future of television is something for which we have been planning during the last three years.  People will have heard of IPTV.  Irish TV is currently developing an Internet protocol television system, or IPTV, which will deliver the content to the consumer wherever they are in the world more effectively anywhere and anytime via a set top box and app.  IPTV offers the viewer the ability to stream content directly from the Irish TV content delivery network, CDN.  This is the future of television, namely, that people will be able to access whatever channels they want directly through the Internet, but it must be interfaced with the IPTV to make sure one's browser is not buffering all the time if one is watching content on one's phone.  We are at the advanced stages of having that system in place and rolled out very soon.  IPTV services will bring to the consumer the ability to watch live TV; time-shifted television or catch-up TV, of which we heard a good deal, which replays a TV show that was broadcast hours earlier or days ago and start-over TV - these are words we will hear much more about in the future and we are developing the products for them; and video on demand whereby if one wants to watch a programme one can do so whenever one wishes.  People no longer watch the Nine O'Clock News at nine o'clock; they watch it when they are ready to do so.  That is what we are providing through our technology and the work we have done in the background.<br\/>From a broadcasting licence perspective, Irish TV is currently regulated by Ofcom in the UK.  The broadcast licence is currently held by Irish TV's channel partner, Information TV, but we are in the process of obtaining a broadcast licence under the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.  That is because our headquarters are based in Westport in Ireland.  We want to contribute to the broadcasting Bill as well. <br\/>Our content is unique and has a focus on connecting people to their locality.  Irish TV aims to shine a light into every corner of rural Ireland and bring the real essence of Irish life to a worldwide audience.  Irish TV is an all-Ireland channel and each of the Thirty-two Counties will have their own TV channel as we move forward, which will be available via IPTV. <br\/>Dr. Eddie Brennan spoke about a community channel.  We have a community channel operating on a commercial basis.  The State should not have to contribute to make something viable or operational.  If there are structures in place that are operational and if the State can support them to broaden it and to fill its remit of connecting with the global diaspora, then it is a win-win situation for everybody.<\/p> <p>Obviously, it will create employment across the country.<\/p><p> Starting from tomorrow, every county will have its own half-hour television show called \"County Matters\".  The message is simple - every county matters, wherever it is.  Rural Irish life is unique, with its own cultures, traditions and events that resonate with each county.  People in rural Ireland are proud of their localities and local events.  At the heart of these programmes are people.  Wherever there are people, Irish TV will be there to cover their stories.<\/p><p> Irish TV is a local television service made possible by attracting a global audience that attracts global media buyers.  We are not asking for support.  Rather, we are asking the committee to consider what we have done and how we can all work together to improve it.  Irish TV has more than 260 independent production houses in Ireland and overseas, delivering original content and programming everyday.  Initially, we will employ 150 people across the island of Ireland, creating unique content every day.  For this reason, I am proud to be able to contribute to the committee.<\/p><p> The Broadcasting Act 2009 refers to the State's intention to be inclusive of the diaspora.  It is important legislation.  Irish TV is providing that service.  It contributes to meeting the demographic, cultural, linguistic, educational and social needs of Irish society, individual groups and Irish communities outside the island.  Irish TV co-operates with independent producers and established television channels in marketing outside the State what is on offer in Ireland.  Irish TV is providing the State with the perfect platform to connect with the local and global Irish communities.<\/p><p> We hope that Irish TV will be included in the upcoming broadcasting Bill as a beneficiary of public funding via the new broadcasting charge.  The funds derived by Irish TV from the broadcasting charge would support the creative sector in every county, in that they will provide access to a local and global television platform.  There are creative people in every county and it does not mean that their ideas are not good if they are knocked back due to a lack of television access.  We will provide a new platform for them to tell their stories.  Irish TV should be supported via the broadcasting charge in fulfilling the State&rsquo;s remit in connecting with the global diaspora and providing a platform for local communities in every corner of Ireland.  Irish TV promotes Ireland globally as a great place to visit, live and work, which is a key strategic message for the Government and all State agencies.  Therefore, we should benefit from the broadcasting charge.  We hope that some of its funds will be ring-fenced for us.<\/p><p> The broadcasting Bill should facilitate the roll-out of the Irish TV channel on the Saorview service, as Irish TV covers the State&rsquo;s remit as set out in the 2009 Act.

There is a diversity of media activity involved, so I might address that along the lines of the groups that are presenting, starting with CRAOL.<\/p><p>  A great deal of work is being done at community level.  Some community radio stations were not able to continue operating due to funding difficulties.  We are dealing with the broadcasting Bill predominantly, but how does CRAOL acces funds through Pobal?  There is a pot of money under the Bill.  How are we going to get the best out of it?  The same question arises for Dublin Community Television and Irish TV.  We need the Bill to be all-encompassing.  Heretofore, a small percentage of the licence fee went to independent operators.  We hope that the committee's deliberations on the Bill will be taken into consideration.  It should not just cover the national broadcaster, but also community and independent radio and television stations.<\/p><p>  I take the point about Saorview.  It is something that we need to pursue as a committee.  Given the presentations, it seems that the pot of money must be considered carefully.  If the Bill is to decide on how it is divided up, we must ensure that a certain amount is made available at community and local levels.  There is a pile of artistic activity and so on that is not being given a forum.  Organisations must build up expertise.  For example, the national broadcaster has been successful since its infancy and has seen the involvement of many fine people and programmes.<\/p><p>  The language used by our guests indicates that we must be careful, as this Bill will determine how all broadcasters will fit into the system for the next 15 to 20 years or longer.  Broadcasting is progressing at a considerable pace.  We will try to include the points made by our guests in any of our deliberations on the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014043000007#L00300","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speech","time":1398857700,"counter":655,"content":"<p>The Deputy's question related to Pobal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014043000007#L00400","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1398857700,"counter":656,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014043000007#L00500","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398857700,"counter":657,"content":"<p>There are 22 fully licensed community stations, of which 14 are funded under the community services programme, CSP, by Pobal.

We were then notified in early February that our funding would end on 30 June, despite the fact that we had applied for funding for a new three year contract up to end 2016.

There is huge uncertainty in this regard for the five full-time and other jobs at my station.  We have agreed to enter into negotiations with Pobal on the metrics in terms of what we should deliver and how that will be measured and to ensure there is a common understanding by the Department of Social Protection and Pobal.

This is an area that, as legislators, we have not discussed enough.  For years the only operators in this area were RTE, various local radio stations and Sky TV.  The message from citizens as we develop alternative ways of communicating and listen more to what they are saying is that there is a gap in communications.  Citizens believe they not alone have the ability but also the right to contribute to and be part of that communications process and I agree with them.<\/p><p>  It is great to hear the perspectives of three groups.  I was impressed to hear the CRAOL representatives say community radio stations could not be bought or sold.  On their not having playlists and, as such, more Irish content, perhaps the delegates might elaborate on this and, in terms of the stations being community based, the mechanism that is used by communities to influence their policies, direction and programme content.  In the absence of a group of shareholders or directors, how does the community influence these choices?<\/p><p>  Reference was made to the potential scope for expansion of local community radio stations.  This might scare the Government a little because it likes to know what it is getting into and, particularly, what will be the financial consequences of its becoming involved in things.  Has any thought been given to what would be reasonable scope for community radio stations and the level of funding that would be required to sustain this?  <\/p><p>  My final question is directed at each of the organisations.  It is difficult for any business, be it commercial or community, to survive if it cannot plan.  In other words, there must be certainty for any head of business in terms of activity for three to five years ahead and, in particular, the resources required to do that work.  Perhaps a representative of each of the organisations might comment on whether there is a lack of certainty in planning, the impact of this and how in their view it could be addressed.<\/p><p>  I would like to receive a little more information from Dublin Community Television, Northern Vision and Irish TV on their experiences in setting up these companies and, in particular, Ms Hyndman's proposal to expand Northern Vision on a 32 county basis and whether there might be opportunities in that regard in the roll-out of the Good Friday Agreement.  <\/p><p>  I have one other question for the representative of Irish TV which I assume has a board of directors or shareholders.  I congratulate those involved.  It is a big investment in a good idea.  I wonder if the station had been developed three years ago, would it, rather than other operators, would have engaged on particular issues with the GAA.  Had it been in operation for the past three years, is this the type of platform that could have been used?  Mr. O'Reilly might also comment on whether, if the station grows and is successful, it would be at risk of takeover by organisations such as Sky. He might also talk us through the mechanics and cost of providing quality home produced programming for the diaspora.  Nobody would argue against this being done and, of course, it should be done.  However, are the mechanics and cost of doing so likely to increase year on year?  What are the projections of how much the station will raise by way of advertising in Ireland and other jurisdictions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014043000008#M00900","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1398858900,"counter":668,"content":"<p>Do the witnesses wish to take the questions in order?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014043000009#N00100","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398858900,"counter":669,"content":"<p>On the first question about how we ensure that the local community has an influence on the work and mechanisms of community media, there is an open door policy.  First, the community owns the registration.  Obviously we are in different legal frameworks.  Some of the community radio stations might be companies.  In the case of my radio station, it is a co-operative.  Participation is at all levels.  At governance level, anybody can put themselves forward to be a member of the committee of management.  These are voluntary positions so anybody from the community can come and join, nominate or get a nomination and be elected to the committee.  That means they are deciding on the policy and strategy of the organisation.<\/p><p>  From the point of view of programming, again there is an open access or open door policy.  There might be people from the local community who may be interested in doing a radio programme.  They might have an opinion as an individual or they might be from a community or voluntary organisation in the local area who wish to highlight the work they are doing in the community.  The way the community media will react to that is, first, we provide them with training in communication, how to put their message across.  Then we offer them training on production, so they can produce their own radio programme if they wish.  Then they are offered the opportunity to do a radio programme.  As the committee can see, there is a straightforward mechanism for engaging the community in producing community radio.<\/p><p>  There is also the issue of editorial control.  Who decides what is important, what is news and what should be on the radio is the person or community organisation that is producing the programme.  The only editorial control that is exercised in community radio is to ensure that any content broadcast falls within the guidelines and the legal restrictions in Ireland.  There is no programming director or editor telling people what should be in the programme.  That is the difference.  We do not look at our audiences as consumers but as possible volunteers or possible members of our committee.  That is how we guarantee participation - through open door access, training and access to broadcasting time and technology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014043000009#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sally Galiana"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398858900,"counter":670,"content":"<p>The Deputy raised the issue of the scale, growth and the limits.  It is reasonable to be concerned about that.  As individuals or as representatives of CRAOL, it is not for us to put a limit on the growth of the sector, but perhaps I could quantify what has happened so far.<\/p><p>  The first concept and framework for community licences was rolled out by the BAI in 1995.  There were six of them; 19 years later there were 24 stations fully licensed.  As Deputy Moynihan mentioned, there has unfortunately been some attrition in the past 18 months to two years and two of those stations are no longer in existence.  That has much to do with operational funding.  However, there have been 22 stations in existence over that 19 year period.  If we assume that the rate of licensing is going to double over the next ten years, one would imagine there will be no more than just over 40 stations or so.  That is assuming that everything improves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014043000009#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Gibbons"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398858900,"counter":671,"content":"<p>To add to that, the licensing process is quite detailed for new developing members.

There is some delay because of the changes in the Broadcasting Act and the changes in the regulations.<\/p><p>  What we are discussing here today is the current situation in Ireland.  Hopefully, in 50 years there will be 400 radio stations and we will have to look for other solutions for the sector.

Community media is a community development process.  We work with partners and people in local communities to put together ideas for projects.  We found there was no certainty in that process itself.  One works with an organisation and spends six months building a project together.  DCTV tried to put a great deal of work into that, but we had a 50% success rate.  From a commercial application perspective, that is hugely successful and for a model built around television commissioning, it does not matter if one fails, but we had already done a great deal of work with these community organisations and with different neighbourhoods, but suddenly the funding did not arrive.

I will take a couple of minutes to put it all into context before answering the Deputy's other questions about the Good Friday Agreement.  We put in a bid to Ofcom in 2002 to become a local broadcaster for Belfast.  It was successful.  We were broadcasting in the period between February 2004 and the digital switch-over in 2012.  We knew that local public service television was on the horizon and towards the end of that period we again made a bid to Ofcom to become a local public television service.  We were again successful in that bid, so we will begin broadcasting towards the end of September this year.  We will be broadcasting on Freeview Channel 8 to approximately 260,000 households.  We will also be broadcasting on Virgin Media on the cable.  Those negotiations have been taking place with a network of local television stations across the UK.<\/p> <p>There are negotiations to go onto Sky's yellow button service.  Internationally, we provide five hours a month to Today's Ireland, which is anchored by the RTE news service.  We agreed in principle to give Today's Ireland a local news service from the North once we start broadcasting.  That will go out to 41 million households across the USA.<br\/>The hub of the network is in Birmingham and we are all connected to the hub.  The UK local public service television goes out to around 14 million households across the UK.  We are all linked to the central hub and it gives us the opportunity to share programming between local television stations.  We are particularly interested in that in respect of Scotland and the Good Friday Agreement.  There are two stations at the moment in Edinburgh and Glasgow which have been licensed to Scottish television.  We have spoken in principle about those kinds of content sharing initiatives, but we are also interested in sharing programming with England and Wales because there is a significant Irish diaspora there and also because of economic and social development and being able to share processes.<br\/>Dublin and Cork make a variety of programmes for different demographics and we have been sharing programming.  We have broadcast programming from Dublin and Cork and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  We are interested in its being developed and continuing.  I was asked about the Good Friday Agreement.  Community relations is a cross-cutting theme across all social and economic strategies in the North and, when we put together the bid, it was uppermost in our minds that we wanted to support the peace process.  We see it as vital in the national community television channel.  There are other considerations.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provides project finance and support to organisations in the North.  Many of them are our partners or we have worked with them, and it is a valuable contribution.  The national channel can support other areas such as education.  In Belfast, we are working with the fourth largest college in the UK.  It has links with the south of Ireland and the national channel is important in terms of economic corridors, not just for the eastern seaboard but between Enniskillen and Sligo and between Derry and Donegal.  In many ways, linking communities on the island of Ireland can develop many processes, not just community relations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014043000009#N01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Marilyn Hyndman","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398859500,"counter":679,"content":"<p>We are in negotiations with the GAA.  Our structure is based on the GAA structure.  We have a three person crew in every county covering the stories and they see the value in it when we cover a local GAA match or a local festival.  In bringing together those elements from 32 counties, Irish TV is the national platform.  We are a community television channel run on a commercial basis.  If we came in saying that we wanted support to set it up, the sum would amount to twice as much.  The jigsaw is so fragmented.  Irish TV is trying to take all of the elements of the creative sector, bring them together and put the structure in place so there will be no duplication within the sector.  Having spoken to Dr. Eddie Brennan, I can see many ways we can work together.  We have a very structured system for planning.  We have regional editors in the four provinces and crews in each county.

We could cover our house with lovely letters thanking us for our submissions, telling us that we had been unsuccessful on that occasion and that the next commissioning round would be in six months.

There is no reference to public service in the Act, but there is a reference to social benefit.  There is a specific remit for community broadcasters to provide a social benefit in our broadcasting.  The regulation has certain other measures.  As regulated broadcasters, we are covered by the same rules on advertising, complaints processes and so on.<\/p><p> Another point is that there is a media production environment.

We have heard interesting, positive and different testimonies from each.  The position is evolving with a new broadcasting household charge from the old television licence.  While it might not make much difference to a household in terms of pounds, shillings and pence when it comes to paying for the television licence, there is a difference in that the charge will be levied at the same rate on every household from Malin Head to Mizen Head.  I am keen to touch on a related issue.  Some households will get far more from this than others if the household charge is divided as has been suggested.  How do the deputations propose to address that?  For example, Dr. Brennan referred to a local fund that would be more or less spent where it is collected as well as an all-Ireland fund, both derived from the one household charge.  Frankly, someone could feasibly benefit twice as much in an urban area because far more funds would be raised in that area for a local fund by comparison with a corresponding local service to a more rural area.  For example, the practicalities of the area I represent mean this simply would not happen there.  We would not get any quality of service to households.  I am keen to hear how that could be addressed.<\/p><p>  Each of the deputations has mentioned the extra dimensions they bring, not only in broadcasting but in service, training, employment opportunities and so on.  They have broadened out the picture to include the benefits they provide to communities and the State.  Each of the witnesses might have a different observation on my question.  Is it appropriate for the broadcasting charge fund to be used to fund training, even if it remains the same as the fund collected for the television licence?  Is there duplication of funding?  Why not have links to the Dublin Institute of Technology through various organisations or links through the Department of Social Protection to other funding mechanisms?  These could be better targeted by the Exchequer to deal with exactly what the witnesses are trying to achieve rather than use a broadcasting charge fund for the same purposes.  What is the risk of a duplication of effort?  Could a station access one particular stream of Exchequer funding for one purpose and then expect the household to supplement that through another fund?  The witnesses may have observations on that.<\/p> <p> I conclude by wishing Mr. O'Reilly every success with what sounds like a very exciting commercial business.  I have a little difficulty, however, in terms of where he sees a public service component in it.  It seems to be more commercial than CRAOL and the general community television model.  How does he see public service funding fitting neatly into the package he is proposing?  At the same time, I acknowledge that it would be a not-for-profit endeavour which would support wages and salaries.  That, of course, is good.  My question is about how any public service funding might support its activities.  I acknowledge it is a broad question.  For example, if Mr. O'Reilly's business were to receive additional funding from the broadcasting charge, would it go towards paying salaries and meeting administration costs rather than actual pure broadcasting content and the pure technical support required to that end?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014043000011#P00700","speaker":"995","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398860700,"counter":691,"content":"<p>I will answer some of Deputy Noel Harrington's questions and refer the issue of the division of funds to Mr. Moore.  <\/p><p>  In terms of education, the Deputy asked whether the money would be going to DIT, for example, where I am a lecturer in the school of media.  One can see, of course, how there might be a relevance to channelling the money towards established trainers.  As chairperson of DCTV, I am actively exploring links between the company and DIT and other colleges.  There is a difficulty, however, in that what we are trying to do is facilitate engagement with media production and increase participation in media.  If one offers a media course, it will appeal to people who are interested in making media.  However, there might be a minority group which is concerned with representing a particular social issue, for instance, or a community group that is representing a particular sporting interest.  In such cases, the primary concern is with representing that issue, not learning how to make media.  By having the training funding centred on community media stations, whether radio or television, one can engage people's existing interests in the community and deliver media training in that sense.  On the other hand, if we were to create silos, so to speak, for media training, a lot of people who have something important to say will not engage with that media training because it is not their primary interest.  Their interest is in representing whatever their particular concern might be.  I would welcome collaboration between DCTV and colleges which are delivering media training.  There are already linkages with DIT and Griffith College.  However, it is also important to have funding for mentoring and training which goes to the community broadcaster.<\/p><p>  I will refer the Deputy's question on the division of funds to Mr. Moore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014043000012#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eddie Brennan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398860700,"counter":692,"content":"<p>When we put forward our proposal, we discussed mechanisms for making it work.  We use as a model the current broadcasting fund, which is 7% of the public service broadcasting charge and allocated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  Our view was that perhaps 50% of the fund might be split on a <i>pro rata<\/i>basis between the 31 local authorities, with the remaining funding allocated according to the amount collected.  If the fund was, say, &euro;15 million, there would be an allocation of between &euro;600,000 and &euro;1 million per local authority.  While there would be some disparity in terms of the numbers, one of the important aspects of the fund was that there would be resources available for people to engage in tactical interventions and fit media skills, including media production skills, into other activities.  It has to be of a certain scale.  There is no point in a small rural county getting tens of thousands of euro because that is not enough to have an impact.<br\/>To follow on from what Dr. Brennan said, often the types of training and experiential learning people receive when they engage with community media spark an interest in these skills which transfers over into third level and other training courses.  One of the activities of which I was most proud during all my time with DCTV was our work with a number of small youth centres which were running local training initiatives.  These initiatives involved engaging with young unemployed people, many of whom did not have a leaving certificate or other formal accreditation.  We provided a single media module which was promoted on the basis of helping people to make their own neighbourhood television programme.  The media training was effectively a carrot - after all, everybody wants to be on television - which helped the organisers to recruit people into a formal education setting.  We are not in any way seeking to replace the existing structures.  Rather, our objective would be to partner with those training providers to deliver innovative small projects such as the one to which I referred.  In many cases, the people we are training in media skills will not end up in media careers.  In our view, it is about equipping people with basic literacy skills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014043000012#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciaran Moore"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1398860700,"counter":693,"content":"<p>I echo that point.

Some of them come with a basic level of skills and education, but the majority do not.

If we could be certain of having sufficient funding to cover the basic costs of running the projects, it would allow us to submit only five applications, say, instead of 20.  It is not necessarily about certified training.  In my community in Coolock a lot of people do not want to go into formal education but are happy to go up to the studio and learn in an informal, hands-on way how to broadcast a radio programme.  We do not see the funding going directly into training but rather supporting our activities towards the production of more diverse and better quality programmes.

In fact, CRAOL is a recognised FETAC-QQI centre and our community radio stations deliver certified FETAC training on our behalf.<\/p> <p>We are already doing that.

There is little or no focus on community media in media courses in this country.

We will also be able to highlight, for example, the three people employed in their counties in particular capacities.  If one asks people about the charge at present, they indicate that they are of the view it will go to somewhere in Dublin and that they will never heard about it again.

There is clearly a commercial sector, public service, community broadcasting, online ventures and so on.  It is important to have collaboration, shared content or other sharing schemes but it is important also to recognise the differences.  While Mr. O'Reilly's scheme is excellent, and I wish him the best of luck with it because it is an exciting project, it is important to recognise also that there is a difference in what he is doing as an online commercial venture and a not-for-profit, regulated community broadcasting venture.  Nonetheless, collaboration would be an exciting prospect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014043000014#S00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eddie Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1398861900,"counter":718,"content":"<p>Unless there are some final questions-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014043000014#S00300","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1398861900,"counter":719,"content":"<p>I assume we will do a report for the Minister at the end of this process.

We talk about change coming down the track in broadcasting, and the witnesses illustrated that in their presentations.  I thank all the witnesses for their contributions and for enlightening all of us on the obstacles and challenges they face but also the opportunities they believe are available in modern communications.  It seems likely that the Broadcasting Bill will be forwarded to this committee shortly by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Today's meeting gives us a good insight into the issues that need to be addressed in that Bill and will help us in that regard.
