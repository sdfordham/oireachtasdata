While Irish based after-market services providers undoubtedly can benefit from their proximity and relationships with the Irish based operations of International Leasing firms, the global nature of both businesses means that cost competitiveness, flexibility and capability are the key determinants in companies&rsquo; decision making processes.   <\/p><p>  The dynamics of the aircraft maintenance business worldwide are complex and fast changing, partly due to the mobility of the assets &ndash; the planes themselves - and, also due to the influence of both the aircraft manufacturers and the engine manufacturers.  In many cases, under complex sale contracts, these manufacturers are increasingly determining where maintenance of their equipment is carried out. <\/p><p>  Despite the very globalised nature of both the leasing sector, and also of the maintenance sector, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have, of course, collectively been seeking to actively encourage more collaboration between the international leasing companies and the maintenance operators who are located here in Ireland.  Such synergies are promoted by the Agencies&rsquo; direct engagement with relevant companies, in an effort to develop better linkages between these two sectors of the aerospace industry.  You will appreciate however,  that in cases where leasing companies are making decisions relating to on-going maintenance  of their fleets, such decisions are solely a matter for those leasing companies themselves and are made  on commercial, business efficiency and cost grounds.   <\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s success in building up a world-class Aircraft leasing sector has brought very significant benefits to the economy.  The sector now employs over 1,000 people and controls assets of over &euro;80bn.  We have 9 of the top 10 lessors by fleet size here in Ireland.  Its development to this levels has been achieved by a favourable financial climate which has been developed and we have also specialist, multi-disciplinary, personnel available with the requisite skills. In relation to work to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness for Aircraft leasing, a wide range of financial and taxation incentives have been put in place over the years. These include rules on VAT, depreciation provisions and exemptions on various measures. Also of course, in relation to Corporations Tax, the attractive 12.5% rate applies.  These incentives are kept under constant review and we are very conscious of the need to be able to offer an attractive business and financial environment to attract and retain companies in such an internationally mobile sector.  <\/p><p>  IDA Ireland globally has been engaged on an on-going basis to attract companies in all parts of the aviation sector into Ireland both to increase employment and improve the scale of the industry in Ireland. These efforts will continue.<\/p><p>  Given the circumstances I have outlined, it is not considered that the very unfortunate closure of the Lufthansa engine maintenance plant in Rathcoole will adversely impact on the position of the leasing sector here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300052#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wage-setting Mechanisms","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300052#WRA00650"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[2960\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300052#WRA00700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on the merits of a new national wage agreement; the way he feels this would impact on the prospects for jobs and consumer spending; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>I am aware that a number of public statements have been made in recent weeks, accompanied by media speculation, concerning the prospect of a return to some form of national-level wage bargaining for the private sector.<\/p><p>  The commentary has been framed in a very constructive manner; it has been driven by concerns about the potential economic and industrial relations issues that might arise over the medium term as the economy continues to stabilise and wage bargaining perhaps returns as a noticeable feature on the Irish industrial relations landscape.<\/p><p>  The return to such wage bargaining is already visible and I note, in this regard, that the Irish Business and Employers&rsquo; Confederation has indicated that around half of its members expect to experience some level of pay increase over the next 18 months. This will have a positive potential impact on domestic demand.<\/p><p>  It is vital that any wage increases negotiated are not excessive, do not hamper the emergence of job opportunities, increase costs locally or impact on our competitiveness internationally.<\/p><p>  We must never forget that Ireland&rsquo;s economy had become increasingly and critically uncompetitive in the five years up to 2008. Regaining cost competitiveness, which has included wage restraint among other things, has been key in our fight to recover. We must be very careful that the gains so hard fought for over the past few years are not eroded. <\/p><p>  Indeed, it could be argued that we have further to travel in this regard. According to the 2013 Forf&aacute;s Report on Labour Market Competitiveness, despite some reductions, labour costs in Ireland remain above OECD averages. The Report found that Ireland has the 17th highest total labour cost level in the OECD-32 and the 11th highest net wage level in the OECD-32. <\/p><p>  At the moment, I believe that firms and employers are taking stock of how the next 24 months will possibly pan out. Each assessment will be different and I do not believe that there is a homogeneous model for all Irish business at the moment. Rather, I think that employers must make their own assessments based on their personal experience of how their own business and sector is performing. <\/p><p>  We know that some sectors are expanding at a faster pace than others while some are only beginning to stabilise and return to growth. In such a current scenario I am not convinced that a national wage agreement is feasible or desirable. Indeed, I have noted, IBEC&rsquo;s view that that local bargaining based on company-level realities is the appropriate manner in which to deal with wage pressures at this stage.<\/p><p>  With some exceptions, Ireland has been through a period of industrial peace. IBEC and ICTU have agreed two separate Private Sector Protocols for the Orderly Conduct of Industrial Relations and Local Bargaining. This has played a significant role and I would hope that any disagreements arising during pay negotiations where they arise at company level do not cause industrial unrest.<\/p><p>  However, I can assure the Deputy that it is an issue that I am monitoring closely. The next 18 months will be key in terms of getting the economy expanding again and I am determined to ensure that the gains achieved and the image of Ireland as the best small country in the world in which to do business is not damaged. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300052#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Schemes","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300052#WRA00875"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[2965\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300052#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of jobs supported by the competitive start fund operated by Enterprise Ireland; his views on the operation of the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>Enterprise Ireland offers a range of financial and non-financial supports to assist companies through all stages of the business development cycle.

Firstly, a new operation called AvantCard was established following the purchase of part of Bank of America&rsquo;s Credit Card portfolio by Apollo. This operation employs approximately 250 staff, who manage the Irish card customers. These staff transferred from Bank of America to AvantCard (Apollo) under the EU Transfer of Undertakings Regulations on March 13th   2013.

The purpose of the Directive was to implement the Framework Agreement on part-time work concluded by the European cross-industry organisations UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the Framework Agreement, which was annexed to the Directive, was to eliminate discrimination against part-time employees and to improve the quality of part-time work.  It also aimed to facilitate the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis and to contribute to the flexible organisation of working time in a manner which takes into account the needs of employers and employees.<\/p><p>  Accordingly, the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 provides a wide degree of protection for part-time employees, including the general protection that a part-time employee shall not be treated in a less favourable manner in respect of his\/her conditions of employment than a full time employee.<\/p><p>  With regard to employees on zero hours contracts, who are a category of part-time employee, I note that these contracts must be entered into freely by the employer and the employee &ndash; one cannot be forced upon an employee.  Zero hours contracts are normally found in sectors such as retail, healthcare and hospitality.  I am very conscious that in<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>certain circumstances, they may be of great benefit to both employers and employees.  They allow greater flexibility for both, reducing the employer&rsquo;s pay costs, while workers can decide when and if they want to work.  Such contracts may be preferred by employees who require flexibility to facilitate educational or other personal requirements and banning such contracts could do a disservice to these workers.  However, this is an area I will keep under review.<\/p><p>  Section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 contains a specific protection for such employees.  The zero hours protection applies to all employees whose contract operates to require them to be available whether they work on a casual basis or not.  It covers situations where, for example, an employee is sent home if things are quiet or is requested to be available for work and is not, on the day, asked to work.  Where an employee suffers a loss by not working hours he\/she was requested to work or be available to work, the zero hours provisions of the Act ensure that he\/she is compensated for 25% of the time which he\/she is required to be available or 15 hours, whichever is the lesser.  The level of compensation may be impacted if the employee got some work.  Claims of breaches of section 18 may be referred to a rights commissioner.<\/p><p>  An expectation of work does not, however, entitle an employee to compensation.

A joint Irish EIB High Level Working Group (HLWG) was established to identify concrete and flexible mechanisms to enhance the Bank&rsquo;s support for Ireland&rsquo;s growth agenda. The EIB and Ireland are strongly committed to working together to enhance the Bank&rsquo;s activity in the country and this commitment is beginning to bear results with increase contacts at many levels.<\/p><p>  Total funding, by the EIB Group to Irish projects in 2013 was &euro;1.193 billion, representing a 21% increase on 2012 levels, including funding for SMEs in the form of &euro;200 million in loans to AIB targeted specifically at SMEs.  <\/p><p>  In addition to securing a higher level of funding for Irish projects in 2013 than in 2012, funding went to a larger number and broader range of projects than in previous years including infrastructure projects, with loans to the University of Limerick, the Grangegorman PPP, Irish Schools Programme, the Dublin Cross City Luas Project and the N11\/N7 Motorway. EIB support has also been secured in the renewable energy sector including a loan to AIB for small to medium renewable energy projects in Ireland; the Bord G&aacute;is Onshore Wind Programme, which consists of the construction and operation of six onshore wind farms located in Ireland, and the ESB Renewable Connection. Moreover, there was specific support for micro and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the form of a loan to AIB for &euro;100m. Furthermore, the European Investment Fund (EIF) has supported the recently announced Development Capital Scheme in Ireland and has continued its support for the Microenterprise Loan Fund managed by Microfinance Ireland.<\/p><p>  Close engagement between Ireland and the EIB will continue in 2014 with a number of proposals being discussed between the Department of Finance, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the EIB for further support of Ireland&rsquo;s growth agenda. For example, as announced in Budget 2014, given the importance of the export sector to sustainable economic growth and employment, officials from my Department and Enterprise Ireland, as well as well as the Department of Finance, are in discussions with the EIB on the feasibility of an EIB-supported trade finance initiative which would proactively support Irish exporters in growing their businesses abroad. Work in support of this will feature in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014.<\/p><p>  The EIB support for Ireland&rsquo;s growth agenda will contribute to job creation and will complement this Government&rsquo;s drive for job creation through the Action Plan for Jobs in the coming year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300052#WRA02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Skills Shortages","counter":33,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300052#WRA02250"},{"type":"question","counter":34,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[2895\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300052#WRA02300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the initiatives he is taking in view of the report by the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation regarding serious skills shortages in the ICT sector here; if he will establish an Irish technology visa; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":35,"content":"<p>The rapidly evolving technology sector represents both a challenge and an opportunity for Ireland, and it is my intention and the intention of my colleagues in Government to harness to the greatest extent possible developments in this sphere to the benefit of the country.  Since the Oireachtas Committee Report was issued in October 2012, a study undertaken for the European Commission in April 2013 projects that there may be up to 900,000 ICT job vacancies in Europe by 2015. In addition, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) published a report in November 2013 which projects that there will be more than 44,500 potential job openings for ICT professionals in Ireland over the period from 2013 to 2018, including almost 20,400 potential job openings for both new graduates and skilled professionals between 2013 and 2015.<\/p><p>  Almost half of applications for new Employment Permits during 2013 were from applicants with critical ICT skills, both within and beyond the ICT sector itself. The Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) 2013 committed to delivering a range of additional measures to streamline and simplify the Employment Permit application process, with shortages in the ICT sector specifically in mind. These have all been delivered. <\/p><p>  For example, an ICT Green Card employment permit application may now be made in respect of all sectors of the economy, not just in the ICT sector itself, in recognition that ICT skills are in short supply across the economy. An Intra-Company Transfer Permit holder or a Contract Service Provider Employment Permit holder can now apply for other types of Employment Permits. The &euro;30,000 salary threshold for IT Graduates (both graduates of Irish and foreign colleges) has been reduced to &euro;27,000, as well as for Specialist Language Support &amp;amp; Technical or Sales Support with fluency in a non-EEA language for client companies of the Enterprise Development Agencies, many of which are in respect of ICT skills. This year, the application process is being enhanced by the development of a &lsquo;Trusted Partner Registration Scheme&rsquo; to allow fast tracking of applications for employment in selected enterprises that are enterprise agency clients.  <\/p><p>  Other changes to the application process, which include moving the Employment Permits call centre to NERA and the introduction an eForm, have reduced processing times for issue of Employment Permits by an average of 33% over the course of 2013. <\/p><p>  Together with the Minister for Education and Skills, I am currently developing a new ICT Action Plan, informed by the progress to date in implementing the measures under the first ICT Action Plan, and the EGFSN Report. That report presents new demand scenarios for high level ICT skills to 2018. The Plan will bring together actions by industry, education providers and the state sector to meet the challenge of ICT skills shortages, with an expected launch date shortly.  The focus of the new Plan will be on building the supply of graduates and skilled professionals with core ICT\/electronic engineering qualifications at honours degree level and above.<\/p><p>  Whilst I have no plans to introduce a Technology Permit, I am pleased that the scope of the new ICT Action Plan is being broadened to encompass measures to increase the supply of highly skilled and experienced ICT professionals from abroad, to meet expected skills demand in the short term.  I also intend to bring before the Houses an Employment Permits (Amendment) Bill during this session to underpin an employment permits regime, specifically focussed on plugging skills gaps and minimising their impact on enterprise growth.  I am confident that the changes to the application requirements specific to the Highly Skilled Occupations &ndash; which includes ICT skills - will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a destination for ICT professionals and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300052#WRA02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Company Closures","counter":36,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300052#WRA02450"},{"type":"question","counter":37,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[2777\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300052#WRA02500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the outcome of discussions that he had with Lufthansa Technik in relation to saving the hundreds of jobs at the company's plant; the reason for the closure, including addressing the level of State investment that had been made in the facility over the past number of years; the future plans for the site and buildings; the options that exist for alternative employment; and if he raised the fact that the company approvals were transferred from the IAA to its German counterpart during the year, which would indicate that they had made a decision to close substantially earlier than the announcement.

Over recent years IDA Ireland held constant engagement with the company in an effort to help them deal with various issues and challenges. Unfortunately the company were faced with declining revenues and shrinking international opportunities and, following an extensive company review which was carried out, they took the decision to close several plants worldwide, including the Irish engine casing facility in Rathcoole.  Lufthansa&rsquo;s other aircraft maintenance operation based in Shannon continues to operate. <\/p><p>  The reasons for this closure are complex; modern aircraft engines require less maintenance, the aircraft manufacturers and the engine manufacturers now play a greater role in determining where maintenance is carried out, competition from lower cost Asian centres is intense and it is, or course, a very mobile and globalised industry. There have been new entrants into the sector and, in addition, currency movements have further increased competitive pressures. <\/p><p>  In relation to State Investment in the Rathcoole operation over the years, total grant aid paid to the company in respect of Employment, Capital, Research and Development and Training since 1978 was &euro;10.7m. There is no contingent liability to the State in respect of these grants. <\/p><p>  Regarding the site and buildings, while the Lufthansa company own key parts of the plant, other external companies own some peripheral parts of the overall site. A potential new operator would obviously have to come to an acceptable arrangement with the current owners. The IDA is actively pursuing the attraction of potential new investors to take over the plant and have created a profile of the workforce and their skills, for marketing purposes.<\/p><p>  With regard to licences\/permits, maintenance organisation approvals are issued in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 2042\/2003 of 20 November 2003 as amended, annex II, Part 145.

The appellate functions of the EAT will be amalgamated into a reconfigured Labour Court.<\/p><p>  Significant progress has also been achieved to date, in advance of the enabling legislation, insofar as the technological, structural, administrative and staffing changes required to underpin the Workplace Relations Reform Programme are concerned, including the following measures which have already been put in place:<\/p><p>  - Transfer of the Equality Tribunal into my Department to be part of the WRC<\/p><p>  - A Single Contact Portal, <\/p><p>  - An e-complaint facility, <\/p><p>  - Staffing and Structures Plan, <\/p><p>  - Workplace Relations website, <\/p><p>  - Early resolution service, <\/p><p>  - Enhanced technologies and processes including a request for tender for the procurement of a world-class customer relationship management solution which was published in December last year.

I am also very conscious of the difficulties that the absence of such cover can cause to householders and businesses. However, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals. The issue of provision of new flood cover or the renewal of existing flood cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are accepting.<\/p><p>  The idea of making flood insurance compulsory has been considered. However, it would mean that in areas where there was likely to be regular flooding, the cost of insurance would almost certainly be prohibitive and could make premiums unaffordable for policyholders in general.<\/p><p>  On the question of legislation, the Government has also examined the introduction of a scheme to protect householders who cannot obtain household insurance in respect of flooding from regular insurance bodies. However, this approach was not considered financially viable because it was believed that over time it would incentivise industry to discontinue the provision of cover in medium and high risk areas thus making the cost of such a scheme prohibitive.<\/p><p>  What the Government can do, however, is try to address the underlying problem through appropriate remedial works where this is economically feasible. The Office of Public Works (OPW) is committed to doing all it can to alleviate the impact of flooding through the provision of defences as well as a comprehensive assessment of flood risk throughout the country and development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme. This commitment is underpinned by a very significant capital works investment programme which will see up to &euro;225 million being spent on floor relief measures over a five year period from 2012 to 2016.<\/p><p>  Most of the damage arising from the recent stormy weather was in coastal counties in the West and South.\u00a0 OPW, along with other relevant Departments and Offices, will be providing financial support to local authorities in relation to the repair of public infrastructure damaged in the storms. In OPW's case the support will relate to damaged coastal flood defence structures such as rock armour revetments, sea walls.<\/p><p>  In relation to the issue of the provision of flood cover in areas where the OPW has carried out flood relief works, the OPW and Insurance Ireland have been engaged in discussions to agree on a sustainable system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes and works undertaken by the OPW, or in certain instances by local authorities with OPW funding, and where the standard of protection afforded by these works could be verified.\u00a0 These parties have reached agreement in principle but with some operational details to be finally sorted by the insurance companies.<\/p><p>  The outcome of these discussions means that the insurance industry will have a much greater understanding of the extent of the protection provided by flood defence works and will, therefore, be in a position to provide the necessary flood cover to householders in such areas. In cases where individuals which are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance and believe that they are being treated unfairly it is open to them to contact the Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. Their service can be contacted at (01) 676 1914 or by email at <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300054#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Documents Issuance","counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300055#WRD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":102,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[3464\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300055#WRD00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if and when a P45 might issue with any outstanding salary in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":103,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no role in questions regarding to outstanding salary and a related P45, which are a matter between the employer and the employee in the first instance.

There is no equivalent scheme in Northern Ireland.  Under the rebate scheme, the amount of the repayment will vary in accordance with the average price at which auto-diesel is available for purchase in the State during a repayment period, subject to a maximum of 7.5 cents per litre.  The rebate rate applicable for the current repayment period is 6.2 cents per litre.<\/p><p>  The scheme is available to qualifying road transport operators established in the State and in the EU who are tax compliant and properly licensed and who purchase diesel in the State for use in a qualifying vehicle.  Qualifying vehicles, in the case of passenger vehicles, are vehicles that conform to certain classifications under EU law and that are engaged in the lawful carriage of persons, including buses, coaches and certain minibuses.<\/p><p>  The auto-diesel for rebate must have been purchased by the qualifying road transport operators either in bulk (a quantity of 2,000 litres or more), or by means of a fuel card approved by Revenue for that purpose.\u00a0 Purchases in bulk must be made from a licensed mineral oil trader, and delivered to a premises or place that is under the control of a qualifying road transport operator.\u00a0 These purchasing restrictions are necessary for the management and control of the repayment scheme by Revenue, to minimize the risk of abuse.  In addition to the diesel rebate scheme, it should also be borne in mind that the rate of mineral oil tax on auto-diesel in Ireland is considerably lower than in Northern Ireland; &euro;479.02 per 1,000 litres compared with &euro;695.93 in Northern Ireland at the current exchange rate.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the transport of passengers and their accompanying baggage is exempt from VAT in Ireland under paragraph 14(3) of Schedule 1 to the VAT Consolidation Act 2010.  In this respect, services provided by the coach and bus sector are exempt from VAT.  This means that a person who provides a bus or coach service does not register for VAT and does not charge VAT on the supply of their services.  This also includes the hiring of a bus or coach with a driver.\u00a0 Persons who are exempt from VAT cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services, such as fuel, that are used for the purposes of the person's coach and bus service.<\/p><p>  An Irish coach or bus service operator may be entitled to a VAT deduction when that operator engages in the transport outside the State of passengers and their accompanying baggage.  This is defined as qualifying activities in section 59 of the Value-Added Tax Act 2010.  For example, an Irish coach operator who incurs Irish VAT on diesel that is used in the transport of passengers in Northern Ireland will be entitled to a deduction for the portion of the VAT that relates to transport in Northern Ireland.  A Northern Ireland coach operator who is engaged in the transport within this State of passengers and their accompanying baggage will be entitled to claim a deduction for UK VAT on diesel purchases, since transport services there are zero rated, but is not entitled to any refund of Irish VAT incurred on the purchase of diesel in the State.<\/p><p>  I would point out that VAT law in Ireland and the UK must comply with the EU VAT Directive.  As passenger transport was exempt in Ireland on 1 January 1978, it is possible under the VAT Directive to continue to apply that exemption.  As passenger transport services were charged at the zero rate in the UK on 1 January 1991, the UK are entitled to continue to apply a zero rate to passenger transport services.  It is not possible under EU law for Ireland to apply a zero rate to such services as we did not apply a zero rate to them in 1991.  Given the lower mineral oil tax on auto-diesel in the State and the diesel rebate scheme, I am satisfied that operators in the State are not at a competitive disadvantage compared with operators based in Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300055#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Exemptions","counter":119,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300055#WRD01350"},{"type":"question","counter":120,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[3314\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300055#WRD01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason off-street parking when provided by local authorities or county councils is taxable at the standard rate, while on-street parking charges are deemed exempt from VAT; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Revenue would not have access to this information for fuel purchased at the pump by means other than a fuel card.  There are a number of fuel card providers who can supply suitable fuel card services to road transport operators and forecourt operators.

He\u00a0addressed\u00a0the Institute of International and European Affairs on Friday 17th January and earlier that day I met him in my Department.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><p>  During my meeting with Mr Regling, I updated him on\u00a0developments in Ireland following the successful exit from the EU\/IMF Programme in December, including the very successful bond issuance by the NTMA on the 7th of January.  We also discussed recent developments in the Eurozone and the future prospects.<\/p><p>  We issued\u00a0the following agreed statement at the end of the meeting: &quot;Ireland has undergone a major transformation in recent years and is now well positioned to grow and create jobs in the years ahead. Having been frozen out of the markets in 2010, the commitment of the Irish people and the support of funding from the IMF and the EU including the EFSF (the predecessor to the ESM) enabled Ireland to make the necessary fiscal adjustment over a phased period and to make a full return to the financial markets. The success of the Irish programme is evident and Ireland is now viewed as a safe place to invest. The market reaction to Ireland's exit strategy and in particular the very strong investor appetite for last week's 2024 Bond highlights the positive sentiment towards Ireland in the financial markets.<\/p><p>  The recovery in the Eurozone is underway and the new architecture put in place since 2010, of which the ESM is a key component, safeguards the stability of the Euro area and will prevent similar crisis occurring in the future. There are many challenges ahead both in Ireland and across the Eurozone and policy makers must ensure that the recovery continues and that the focus is on generating economic growth and jobs.&quot; <\/p><p>  I understand that a number of \u00a0the comments made by Mr Regling during his visit\u00a0have been widely reported, including those to the effect that the reduction in Ireland's borrowing costs can be attributed at least in part to the decision not to impose losses on senior bank bondholders, and that\u00a0there was, at this\u00a0stage,\u00a0no unanimous support in the euro zone for retroactive recapitalisation of financial institutions.\u00a0 However, Mr Regling also\u00a0noted that the timeline involved in this matter was dependant on the SSM coming into being, which is scheduled to come on stream in the latter part of this year.<\/p><p>  The Eurogroup meeting of 20th  June 2013 agreed on the main features of the ESM's Direct Bank Recapitalisation instrument (DBR). The DBR instrument will come into effect when the Single Supervisory Mechanism is operational. There is a specific provision included in those main features that provides for retroactive recapitalisation. This provision states that: &quot;The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.&quot; Therefore, the agreement that we were active in negotiating keeps open the possibility to apply to the ESM for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks should we wish to avail of it. \u00a0The SSM is expected to be place and operational towards the end of 2014.<\/p><p>  Finally,\u00a0as I have previously stated we will ensure that our case for\u00a0retrospective direct recapitalisation\u00a0is made at all levels as appropriate.\u00a0 I remain confident that the commitment made by the Euro-area Heads of State or Government in June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns will be respected.

This Government continues to work\u00a0to create an environment conducive to the entry of such new entrants primarily through the implementation of policies to promote economic recovery and employment creation but also through different initiatives to ensure that there is an adequate pool of credit to underpin the recovery.\u00a0 This is a theme common to our EU partners and Ireland has been leading the debate at EU level on the mechanisms to promote, for example, alternative forms of financing for SMEs. It is important though that we establish an environment conducive for banks and alternative credit providers to enter the Irish market and compete. <\/p><p>\u00a0 In this regard: we are working to manage and minimise potential market expectations of future State support for the state owned banks which could act as a deterrent to new market entrants; we are working to establish equality\u00a0in the assessment of credit risk through the establishment of an industry wide credit register to allow for the appropriate measure of risk in lending, allowing incumbent and new lenders to lend with full visibility of the risk of that lending. The Credit Reporting Act\u00a0was passed\u00a0at the end of 2013; we are working to reduce switching costs to allow customers to move between banks more easily, enhancing competition and forcing banks to work hard to retain their customers on a commercial basis; we are encouraging risk sharing partnerships to encourage new lending, such as the AIB\/European Investment Bank lending initiative; alternative innovative mechanisms to involve other lenders are actively being explored and progressed such as the initiative with the German State Development Bank, KfW; and we are in regular dialogue with potential market entrants as they evaluate potential opportunities in Ireland and will be supportive of new entrants as they emerge. <\/p><p> \u00a0The RBS review by the UK Government confirms the continuing role that Ulster Bank will have in the lending and deposit taking business for all customers here in Ireland.

This Government has also taken steps to ensure that the Irish financial market is accessible to any financial institution considering establishing in Ireland.

Payments are made in respect of members of the party elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and members elected\/nominated to Seanad &Eacute;ireann at the last preceding general election or a subsequent bye-election or, in the case of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, nominated to it after the last preceding general election.  <\/p><p>  The legislation also provides that payments may be made to a member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, who at the last preceding general election or at a subsequent bye-election was elected as a member other than as a member of a qualifying party. Such qualifying independent TDs are entitled to an allowance, currently amounting to &euro;41,152 per annum.  A similar provision in the Act provides for an allowance currently amounting to &euro;23,383 per annum for independent Senators.  <\/p><p>  The conditions governing entitlement to payment of the allowance are set out in the Act.  The primary restriction in the Act on the use of the allowance is that it may not be used in respect of election expenses. The allowance is non-taxable and is paid monthly in arrears into a bank account specified by the beneficiary of the allowance. It is not claimed in the same manner as expense allowances. <\/p><p>  The legislation provides that each party leader must to prepare a statement of expenditure for the party leader s allowance, to have it audited by an independent auditor and furnish it with the auditor s report to the Standards in Public Office (the Commission) Commission. Based on the accounts submitted, the Commission is required to make a report in relation to the use of the Party Leader's Allowance and cause a copy of the report to be laid before the Oireachtas. Allowances paid to independent members are not subject to these oversight provisions<\/p><p>  I have no plans to discontinue payment of the allowance. Following a review of the allowance and a consultation process with leaders of qualifying political parties, qualifying independent members and with the Standards in Public Office Commission, I published the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Bill 2013 in October 2013.  The Bill has passed all stages in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and is scheduled for Second Stage in this House shortly. <\/p><p>  The Bill provides for a reduction of 10% in the rates of the allowance, representing an estimated full year Exchequer saving of &euro;0.84 million. The same audit and reporting provisions that will apply to parliamentary leaders will also apply to independent members in receipt of the allowance.  For the first time, independent members will have to record and account for expenditure from the allowance, all of which is to be expended in respect of parliamentary activities, including research. The Bill includes other necessary measures all of which will increase transparency, accountability and ensure citizens can see that their money is being spent as it was intended.<\/p><p>  The total amounts paid to each qualifying independent TD from 9 March 2011 to end 2013 are set out in Appendix A.

Start-up companies in particular are a very valuable source of job creation.<\/p><p>  In support of this mission EI invests in a significant number of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), a proportion of these being start-ups in the early stage of development, many developing disruptive new technological applications. Investing in SMEs is inherently risky, particularly so in the case of early stage and seed investments. It should be emphasised that Enterprise Ireland supports companies in an effort to alleviate the market failure for Irish companies in accessing finance. It should also be borne in mind that EI&rsquo;s focus is on the economic return from any investment, i.e. jobs and exports, and not just the financial return.<\/p><p>  EI, when making an investment, will always seek that the company raises matching funding from the private sector where, at a maximum, Enterprise Ireland accounts for less than fifty percent of any investment. This ensures that the private sector shares a larger proportion of the investment risk. Private sector participation can be from the promoters, private investors and business angels, venture capital or private equity funds. In advance of making an investment, EI undertakes an in-depth commercial evaluation process. <\/p><p>  The investment write offs for the period 2008 to 2012 can be attributed to companies not achieving market success, in what was a difficult economic period. EI would, in many cases, be writing off investments in line with other private sector investors in any particular company. Equity investment write off over the period 1999 - 2012 (&euro;67m) on foot of investments made over the same period (&euro;427m), represents a 16% write off.

Before any investment or grant is written off, Enterprise Ireland conducts a thorough due diligence process to ensure that all monies, if any, which are recoverable by EI, have been recovered.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s recovery due diligence process is often carried out in tandem with the recovery processes undertaken by the private sector investors.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the challenges of developing SME&rsquo;s into successful growth companies, Enterprise Ireland client companies continue to have a significant economic impact on the Irish economy, spending more than &euro;19bn per annum and being collectively responsible for more than 300,000 jobs in every county throughout the State. In 2013, EI companies created 18,033 jobs resulting in a net increase of 5,442 jobs. In the same year, EI clients export performance continued to be strong and are expected to rise from the &euro;16.2bn level achieved in 2012.

There are now over 161,000 people directly employed in IDA Ireland client companies, the highest number in the history of the agency.<\/p><p>  IDA Ireland markets Ireland as a location for FDI on the basis of a number of selling points viz a pro-business and technologically advanced environment and the availability of an educated and talented English speaking workforce with the blend of appropriate skill sets.  The Agency also offers a range of affordable, state of the art property solutions. Ireland is strategically located between Europe and America and is the only English speaking member of the Eurozone.  Ireland has an attractive corporation tax rate and complies fully with OECD guidelines and EU competition law. Ireland has a good track record of attracting and retaining high quality investments across a range of sectors.  In addition, there is good road access to key cities, ports and international airports. <\/p><p>  All these factors, together with Ireland&rsquo;s improvement in competitiveness in recent years has led IBM Global location trends to rate Ireland first in the world for inward investment by quality and value and first in Europe and second globally for the number of investment jobs per capita.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s recent exit from the bailout and the decision by Moody&rsquo;s to raise the rating on Ireland&rsquo;s sovereign debt to investment grade will have a very positive impact on the on the Irish economy. Investment agency ratings are used by foreign investors when they are deciding where to locate their businesses.  I am confident that the continued work of Government in restoring the economy and the publication of the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs will lead to the attraction of further foreign direct investment into the country and the creation of additional much needed jobs.<\/p><p>  To respond to the significant job losses in manufacturing in the years up to 2010, and to build on the potential for this sector, I asked Forf&aacute;s to undertake an analysis of Manufacturing in Ireland and the resultant Strategy, which I launched in April last, sets a comprehensive suite of recommendations to develop the sector, and these actions are now being progressed (including through the <i>Action Plan for Jobs<\/i>  ).  The Strategy identifies that an additional 20,000 jobs can be created in Manufacturing by 2016.  The tide is already turning, as in the years 2011 and 2012 there was a net increase of 3,700 jobs in the Manufacturing sector. This trend has gained momentum with the latest Central Statistics figures (QNHS-Q3 2013) showing that almost a further 8,000 jobs have been created in the period since the Strategy was published.  There are now 213,600 people directly employed in the sector in Ireland and a similar number of people employed indirectly: the total supported within the sector is therefore about 427,000.  A particularly attractive feature of manufacturing in Ireland is the fact that many of the present jobs are not in the main urban areas, but dispersed into regional locations, thereby providing a valuable employment focus in areas where alternative jobs are scarce. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300061#WRK01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Targets","counter":280,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300061#WRK01750"},{"type":"question","counter":281,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[3494\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300061#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his expectations for the creation of new jobs through indigenous industry, manufacturing and services, in the current year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":282,"content":"<p>The manufacturing sector, which had lost 50,000 jobs in the years up to 2010, has seen a modest return to growth in employment over the last few years, with an additional 8,000 jobs having been created in the last year alone.

I am satisfied that the engagement of consultants provides valuable support to the Department and that the procurement of consultants is compliant with best practice in realising value for money.<table><tr><th>Year 2013<\/th><th>-<\/th><th>-<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>CONSULTANTS ENGAGED<\/td><td>PURPOSE OF CONSULTANCY<\/td><td>&euro;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Naked Objects Group Ltd<\/td><td>BOMi - Business Objects Modelling Advice &amp;amp; Expertise<\/td><td>234,463<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Naked Objects Group Ltd<\/td><td>BOMi- Technical Development Advice<\/td><td>168,181<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ESRI<\/td><td>SWITCH Research Programme<\/td><td>150,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion<\/td><td>External Service Delivery - Employment Services<\/td><td>140,989<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Haywood Associates<\/td><td>BOMi- Technical Development Advice<\/td><td>87,872<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Axiom Consulting<\/td><td>Report on Organisation Development<\/td><td>74,812<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ESRI<\/td><td>Analysis &amp;amp; measurement of Deprivation &amp;amp; Poverty<\/td><td>69,979<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Deloitte &amp;amp; Touch&eacute;<\/td><td>IS Internal Audit Services<\/td><td>48,688<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Accenture<\/td><td>Mobile Opportunity Exploration<\/td><td>33,388<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mercer Ireland Ltd<\/td><td>Long-term Pensions Policy Research <\/td><td>18,450<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ESRI<\/td><td>Profiling of &ldquo;Stock&rdquo; Live Registrants<\/td><td>16,873<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Microsoft<\/td><td>Support to Technical Architecture Group<\/td><td>11,515<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Irish Research Council<\/td><td>Social Inclusion Research Innovation Awards <\/td><td>11,103<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mel Cousins &amp;amp; Associates<\/td><td>Review of Best International Practice regarding In-Work Supports<\/td><td>10,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TOR Financial<\/td><td>Models of National Employment Based Pension Systems<\/td><td>9,900<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ESRI<\/td><td>Evaluation Research (BTEA)<\/td><td>9,809<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>PricewaterhouseCoopers<\/td><td>Provision of Financial Advisory Services (for Payment Services Evaluation)<\/td><td>7,380<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Deloitte &amp;amp; Touch&eacute;<\/td><td>Provision of Security Partner Services<\/td><td>6,540<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Irish Nutrition &amp;amp; Dietetic Institute<\/td><td>Update of the Diet Supplement Diet Cost Report<\/td><td>4,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mel Cousins &amp;amp; Associates<\/td><td>Guidance documentation for deciding &amp;amp; appeals officers<\/td><td>2,400<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>OECD<\/td><td>Youth Guarantee Advice<\/td><td>0*<br \/><br \/><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><i>*Final invoice &euro;50,000 yet to be processed.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300062#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Legislation","counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300062#WRL01350"},{"type":"question","counter":306,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[3221\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300062#WRL01400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if pensioners will be given a right to be represented where matters relating to pensions and pensioners are being discussed; the historical reasons for this not being the case; if she will introduce legislation to facilitate same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"976","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":307,"content":"<p>The matter of representation by pensioner groups in consideration of a change to scheme benefits needs to be considered in a broader industrial relations context.

When a DB scheme is set up, the level of employer and employee contributions is agreed and established in contract in the Trust Deeds and Rules of each scheme.  The Trust Deeds and Rules differ from scheme to scheme and reflect the level of obligation of the parties involved.  <\/p><p>  Significant challenges exist for many DB schemes and many employers, trustees and scheme members are making great efforts to ensure their ongoing viability.  This process is generally managed through dialogue between the parties, where efforts are made to reach agreement regarding the steps that must be taken to secure scheme viability.  This may include a mix of measures such as increased employer\/member contributions, longer working and amended benefits.  <\/p><p>  In developing the legislative changes contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013, very significant efforts were made to identify an approach that strikes a reasonable balance between the interests of pensioners, active and deferred members across the broad range of scheme portfolios and scheme structures.  To ensure the broadest range of views and expertise was considered, the consultation process included a stakeholder consultation.  This included groups representing older people and pensioners, the pensions industry, employers and trade unions.  Written submissions were also sought from the groups and informed the review process.  In addition, the Department engaged external technical and actuarial specialists to undertake modelling exercises which assisted in the review process.<\/p><p>  Before the recent changes were introduced, when a DB scheme wound up and was underfunded, pensioners received 100% priority for their benefits, often at the expense of current and former employees.  The legislative changes aim to provide for a fairer and more equitable distribution of scheme assets whilst also facilitating greater sharing of the risk between all the beneficiaries when a scheme is underfunded.  However, a principle underlying the changes was that pensioners would continue to be afforded the highest level of protection, particularly those on low to moderate pensions with protection levels set at 100% of pensions up to &euro;12,000; 90% of pensions between &euro;12,000 and &euro;60,000; and 80% of pensions greater than &euro;60,000.  <\/p><p>  Pension schemes generally make an allowance for the State pension when calculating final pensionable salary for the occupational pension.  This is often referred to as a &quot;co-ordinated&quot; or &quot;integrated pension&quot;.  In the case of a co-ordinated pension, the recent changes to the Pensions Act will not apply to the State element of a co-ordinated pension.  Those on an un-co-ordinated defined benefit pensions typically include pre-1995 employees in the civil and public service and commercial semi-state organisations.  The pensions of these individuals are generally higher than those who have an entitlement to the State pension.  This is apparent in an analysis of pensions in payment which shows that the median pension for pensioners of commercial semi-state organisations is &euro;21,500 compared to &euro;11,000 for pensioners in the private sector. <\/p><p>  Any consideration by the trustees of a scheme to restructure scheme benefits under the Pensions Act is not an arbitrary task.  The trustees of pension schemes have a fiduciary duty under Trust Law and the Pensions Act to act in the best interest of all scheme members.  The Pensions Act and statutory guidance issued by the Pensions Board sets down detailed criteria which the trustees of a scheme must comply with before application to the Pensions Board to issue a direction to restructure pension scheme benefits.<\/p><p>  In relation to the pension fund levy, this is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  This levy, which was introduced to fund the Jobs Initiative in 2011, will be abolished from the 31st of December 2014.  An additional levy on pension funds at 0.15%, to continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative and current and future State liabilities in relation to pensions, will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015. <\/p><p>  In the case of both a company and the scheme being insolvent, the State will guarantee that existing pension benefits will be protected to a level of 50%, with pensions of &euro;12,000 or less being 100% protected.  In this context, I must emphasise that the Pensions Board is working with pension schemes, particularly schemes in a poorly funded position to help these schemes achieve a more sustainable funding position thereby decreasing the likelihood of State intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300063#WRM00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Supplement Applications","counter":312,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300063#WRM00350"},{"type":"question","counter":313,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[3255\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300063#WRM00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the documentation outstanding in respect of an application for mortgage interest relief in the case persons (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":314,"content":"<p>The following details are outstanding in relation to the application for mortgage interest supplement from the person concerned;<\/p><p>  - the original loan application and approval forms (all components of which are required),<\/p><p>  - a four-year mortgage statement showing repayments made,<\/p><p>  - confirmation from the person&rsquo;s employer of employment and wages over the previous 13 weeks, <\/p><p>  - clarification of the number of days and hours worked and of how his wages are being paid and into what bank account,  <\/p><p>  - details of his partner&rsquo;s AIB bank account and to provide bank statements covering a six month period. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300063#WRM00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Appeals","counter":315,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300063#WRM00550"},{"type":"question","counter":316,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[3285\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300063#WRM00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a disability allowance will be reinstated in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":317,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the disability allowance appeal by the person concerned has been referred to an Appeals Officer who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.  <\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300063#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Live Register Data","counter":318,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300063#WRM00750"},{"type":"question","counter":319,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[3309\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300063#WRM00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide in tabular form the percentage of claimants on the live register in December 2013 who were single claimants; the percentage who were couples; the percentage who were couples with one child; the percentage who were couples with two children; the percentage who were couples with three children; the percentage who were couples with four children; the percentage who were couples with more than four children; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":320,"content":"<p>A breakdown of the live register in December 2013 by number of dependents is detailed in the following tabular statement.<\/p><p><b>Breakdown of live register claimants by number of dependents, December 2013<\/b><table><tr><th>Percentage<\/th><th>Number of Claimants<\/th><th>Live Register Category<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>72.1%<\/td><td>285,114<\/td><td>Are claiming for themselves only (i.e. no dependents) including people signing for Credits.

A significant reform programme to ensure appropriate resources are focused in the provision of opportunities, supports and assistance for unemployed persons is well advanced.  The rebalancing of resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities &ndash; payment processing, control and activation - has resulted in changes in the way CWS services are delivered and the rationalisation of some Community Welfare Service clinics.<\/p><p>  In Co. Kildare, in preparation for these changes, the Department contacted all affected customers directly, advising them of the changes in the services.  The Community Welfare Service in Athy which was formerly available two mornings per week at a walk-in clinic is now available Monday to Friday through initial telephone contact, which means the service can be delivered without the need to attend a clinic.  Telephone calls are followed by appointments if necessary, home visit or application by post for non-urgent claims. <\/p><p>  All calls are returned within one working day and emergency calls are prioritised.  Where any customers are not able by reason of illness or disability to attend an appointment arrangements will be made to see them in their home.  A fast referral service has now also been put in place with a standard Referral Form issued to local organisations and representatives. <\/p><p>  Prior to the restructuring, several changes to the operation of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme (SWA) in South Kildare\/West Wicklow had already been made.  All claims for Rent Supplement were centralised to a dedicated unit.  All claims for Mortgage Interest Supplement were centralised to one office within the area.  A system of Integrated Decisions was put in place in Newbridge Local Office in order to expedite claims for Jobseekers Allowance, Jobseekers Benefit and One Parent Family payment and thus minimise the recourse to SWA in these cases. <\/p><p>  The result of these initiatives has been to greatly reduce the dependence on SWA, and the local Community Welfare Service, in local areas.

Increasing Ireland's levels of renewable energy and energy efficiency is critical for reducing our heavy dependence on imported fossil fuels and thereby improving the sustainability of our energy supply.  Ireland's target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources, as mandated under the Renewables Directive (2009\/28\/EC), is a significant contribution in the context of the current Energy and Climate Framework objectives.<\/p><p>  The period between 2020 and 2030 is the next critical phase in the evolution of both EU climate and energy policy and the European Commission has just published on 22 January 2014, a Communication setting out its ambition for a 2030 Energy and Climate Framework.  As Minister with responsibility for energy policy, I welcome the inclusion of a target for renewables, which I, along with Ministers from seven other Member States specifically called for this.  I look forward to examining the Commission's proposals for 2030 in more detail and to working closely with all relevant Departments on this important cross cutting issue to ensure a fully coordinated approach is taken.  Not only is the renewable energy sector of key importance for how emissions targets in the context of Climate Change policy are met, it also provides a real, and sustainable, economic opportunity for Ireland, both in terms of a secure, indigenous, source of energy and as a clean energy export.<\/p><p>  Regarding 2050 policy, I published a scoping report in November 2013 on a low carbon roadmap for the electricity generation sector that will feed into the national roadmap envisaged under the Government's forthcoming Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill.  The public consultation on this scoping report has just concluded. A total of fourteen responses were received and I intend to publish these on my Department's website shortly.  In addition, I intend to publish the third iteration of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) later this year.  Reducing energy consumption through efficiency remains the most cost-effective means of reducing greenhouse gases and one of the primary means of achieving Ireland's climate change objectives.  My Department intends to publish an energy policy green paper later this year which will involve a full public consultation process.<\/p><p>  The Geological Survey of Ireland (GSI) operates a number of programmes and projects which aim to provide data or planning toolkits to support policy and interventions by a range of public bodies and agencies in relation to climate change mitigation.  The INFOMAR seabed mapping programme is a joint venture between the GSI and the Marine Institute.  The near shore mapping acquired has contributed to improved coastal flood modelling taking into account the effects of climate change including sea level rise.  Work is also under way in conjunction with the British Geological Survey to complete a feasibility study on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in the Irish Sea basins.  CCS technologies may assist in reducing Irish CO2 emissions in the medium term.  GSI is also conducting a shallow geothermal project, providing best practice guidelines with a view to supporting industry and homeowners in this emerging renewable energy sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300065#WRO01600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Expenditure","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300065#WRO01650"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[3431\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300065#WRO01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the role Bord G&aacute;is and his Department had in the formation and spend of moneys by Irish Water; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The role of my Department is to drive the overall water sector reform process which includes developing the policy and legislation and ensuring delivery of the implementation strategy which was published in December 2012. <\/p><p>  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (BGE) had responsibility for most of the deliverables under the Government water sector reform implementation strategy. BGE developed a detailed programme initiation document within the framework of this strategy, which outlined all of the tasks required to establish a fully functioning integrated public water utility and provided this to my Department in August 2012. They also provided an associated budget to my Department which outlined the costs involved in each area of activity, totalling &euro;150m, plus &euro;30m contingency, and reflecting both the use of BGE and external resources. The budget reflected the range of tasks to be undertaken from financial, governance, regulatory business capability, systems, brand management and customer engagement perspectives. <\/p><p>  In addition, Irish Water has progressed the domestic water metering programme, the full cost of which is &euro;539m excluding VAT. <\/p><p>  All costs incurred by Irish Water in 2013 were financed by a loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), with the exception of a grant of &euro;0.57m for a pilot metering study funded by the Department. No other Exchequer funds or voted Department expenditure has been provided to Irish Water in 2013. My consent was given with the consent of the Ministers for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, for Irish Water to enter into the loan arrangement with the NPRF. My Department is awaiting a report on the actual drawdown of the loan during 2013. Reports to date indicate that almost &euro;100m was spent in 2013 on establishment costs and some &euro;35m has been spent on the initial stages of the metering programme. <\/p><p>  The company also indicated that to date, as part of the establishment of the company, some &euro;50m has been spent on external service providers. The procurement by Irish Water of external resources was a matter for the company and I had no role in approving individual contracts. However, the company indicated to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht last week that the following major companies were used by the Irish Water Programme to help deliver the required systems and processes in the establishment of Irish Water - IBM, Accenture, Ernst &amp;amp; Young and KPMG. Further details of the contracts relating to the establishment of Irish Water are set out in the submission made by the company to the Joint Oireachtas Committee and this submission has been published on the company&rsquo;s website at <\/p><p>  As the establishment costs were to be included in the overall funding model for Irish Water, they would also be examined by the Commission for Energy Regulation as an integral element of the independent economic regulation of Irish Water. Against this background, and in advance of the establishment of Irish Water, my Department provided confirmation to BGE that spending being properly incurred on the water services activities would be recoverable in the event that the project was not proceeded with or, subject to meeting certain conditions, be recoverable as part of the funding model to be reviewed by the Commission. This initial commitment was provided by my Department in December 2012 and updated on a number of occasions in advance of the incorporation of Irish Water and the consent to the NPRF lending. The consent for Irish Water to enter into the loan arrangement with the NPRF was provided in July 2013, with an understanding of the overall estimated budget involved. It is also the Department&rsquo;s expectation that establishment costs and metering costs will be included in the regulatory asset base for Irish Water. <\/p><p>  The Water Services Act 2013 requires Irish Water to submit separate accounts to me not later than six months from the end of the financial year with a view to the laying of such accounts before each House of the Oireachtas. In 2014, Irish Water, which now has statutory responsibility for water services, will receive &euro;240m in equity from the Minister for Finance and almost &euro;490m from the Local Government Fund but no other funding from the Department&rsquo;s Vote. It is anticipated that Irish Water will finance other costs from borrowing and this will be the subject of appropriate Ministerial consents in due course. My Department has requested a detailed cash flow projection in this regard for 2014 from Irish Water, which would include projected annual establishment and metering costs. We are also awaiting updated budget information on operational costs. Irish Water has agreed operational budgets with local authorities for the component of costs which they will meet during 2014. <\/p><p>  Irish Water is currently preparing a Capital Investment Plan for 2014 &ndash; 2016 that will provide for the transition of projects previously included in my Department&rsquo;s 2010 - 2013 Water Services Investment Programme. On the basis of the proposed State equity provision and borrowing, this programme is likely to give rise to spending of some &euro;310m in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300067#WRQ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Staff","counter":423,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300067#WRQ00850"},{"type":"question","counter":424,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[3386\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300067#WRQ00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 711 of 5 November 2013, if he will outline in detail the number of staff who have been directly hired by Irish Water in 2012, 2013, and to date in 2014; the number that have directly transferred from local authorities; if he will provide a breakdown of the number of staff earning &euro;70,000 or more, &euro;80,000 or more, &euro;90,000 or more, the number paid &euro;100,000 or more, the number paid &euro;125,000 or more and the number paid &euro;150,000 or more; of all those staff the number who have provision for bonuses in their contracts, and specifically for each position that has bonuses as part of its employment contract, to outline the salary applicable and the amount of bonus as percentage of salary they are entitled to and the associated duties of that position, and in general the criteria that must be met to qualify for a bonus; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 transferred statutory responsibility for water services to Irish Water and provided for local authorities to act as agents for Irish Water, with this relationship being expressed through Service Level Agreements.  The majority of the existing staff remain employees of local authorities working under such arrangements from 1 January 2014. As such, no staff transferred from local authorities or from other public sector positions to Irish Water.<\/p><p>  Any employees of Irish Water who came from the local authority sector or from the public service sector immediately prior to taking up a post with Irish Water applied for advertised posts and were recruited through a competitive process.<\/p><p>  Irish Water is currently recruiting to build up the internal capabilities required within the organisation and the number of staff employed is an operational matter for the organisation. It was agreed by the Steering Group for the Water Sector Reform programme that, to ensure skills within the sector were fully availed of in building up the new organisation, competitions for positions in asset management, capital delivery and operations would be restricted to staff in the partner organisations i.e. Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, local authorities and my Department in the first instance. Open competitions are held for all other positions and details of these are available on Irish Water&rsquo;s website <i>. <\/i><\/p><p>  Data supplied by Irish Water indicate that at present 310 staff appointments have been made in Irish Water. The breakdown of these staff in terms of their employment immediately before recruitment is as follows: 59 were recruited from Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann; 107 from Local Authorities; 5 from my Department and the balance, 139, were externally recruited. <\/p><p>  I and my Department will not necessarily have access to details of expenditure and other organisational matters in relation to Irish Water. In this context, and to support and assist public representatives in their role, my Department has requested Irish Water, on behalf of myself and Minister O&rsquo;Dowd, to take early action to ensure that public representatives are regularly briefed on matters pertaining to the organisation and operation of the utility. Irish Water is currently considering how best to support and respond to the Parliamentary and public representation needs of elected representatives at national and local level. <\/p><p>  Pending the establishment of these arrangements, my Department requested the information sought in the questions from Irish Water in relation to salaries and I can indicate that the salaries of the 310 employees of Irish Water can be broken down as follows: <table><tr><th>Salary <\/th><th>Staff <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Less than &euro;70,000 <\/td><td>183 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;70,000 - &euro;79,999 <\/td><td>42 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;80,000 - &euro;89,999 <\/td><td>35 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;90,000 - &euro;99,999 <\/td><td>21 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;100,000 - &euro;124,999 <\/td><td>19 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;125,000 - &euro;149,999 <\/td><td>9 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Over &euro;150,000 <\/td><td>1 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>\u00a0-<\/td><td>310 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>  The employment terms and conditions for Irish Water staff are a matter for the company and I understand that these are in line with the arrangements applying with Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.

The model offers market based pay ranges for all employees which includes a pay at risk element called Performance Related Award (PRA). A pay freeze will remain in place until 2016 as this is a key element of reducing overall payroll costs within the Group. \u00a0As such, Irish Water does not pay increments or any form of automatic pay award; the pay model applied allows for part of salaries to be placed at risk and this element of pay is only earned subject to performance. <\/p><p>  In this model, where an employee does not meet expectations they will not be eligible for a performance award and underperformance will be dealt with under the Irish Water Disciplinary Procedure and will lead to sanctions up to and including dismissal.

In line with the Code of Practice for the corporate governance of State bodies, the determination of the remuneration of the senior management of commercial State bodies, with the exception of the Chief Executive, is a matter for the Board of the body and not one in which I have a statutory remit. <\/p><p>  The Managing Director of Irish Water was appointed by the Board of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, and his remuneration package was approved by me, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and following consultation with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The gross salary payable to the Managing Director of Irish Water is &euro;200,000 per annum. In accordance with his approved Contract of Employment, the Managing Director of Irish Water is afforded the use of a company car (Honda CRV) on terms determined by the Company. <\/p><p>  I and my Department will not necessarily have access to details of expenditure and other organisational matters in relation to the company. In this context, and to support and assist public representatives in their role, my Department has requested Irish Water, on behalf of myself and Minister O&rsquo;Dowd, to take early action to ensure that public representatives are regularly briefed on matters pertaining to the organisation and operation of the utility. Irish Water is currently considering how best to support and respond to the Parliamentary and public representation needs of elected representatives at national and local level. <\/p><p>  Pending the establishment of these arrangements, my Department requested the information sought in the questions from Irish Water and I can indicate that nine regional managers working on the domestic metering programme have been provided with leased cars on the basis that they are on-call and may be required to travel twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. The cars are 1.6 diesel engines and the models are: one Kia Optima, one Kia Sportage, two VW Passat, and five Ford Mondeos.   <\/p><p>  A car allowance of &euro;10,500 is paid to twenty seven Senior Managers who are required to use their own cars in the course of their duties with Irish Water. This is a fully taxable non-pensionable allowance, subject to tax, PRSI and USC. This is in lieu of the payment of mileage expenses as would pertain in other circumstances, as the company views this as a more cost-effective option. <\/p><p>  Irish Water has confirmed that while no member of staff has a debit or charge card, two credit cards have been issued for business use in Irish Water. These cards are for company purchases or costs on behalf of the business. The cards have been issued in the name of the Managing Director and the Head of Customer Operations. In 2013 approximately &euro;10,000 was spent on each card. The only commitment to date in 2014 relates to an amount of &euro;375. Irish Water is preparing a breakdown of the various payments, which they will directly issue to the Deputy.   <\/p><p>  The holder of the card does not approve the payment of the credit card bill, in other words, there is a further sign-off as part of the approvals process. All charges to the credit card must be accompanied by supporting documentation <\/p><p>  Irish Water provides health insurance of VHI Plan C or equivalent for nine of its Senior Executives, no other staff benefits are in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300067#WRQ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":434,"content":"<p>Question No. 162 answered with Question No. 158.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Voluntary Sector Funding","counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300068#WRR00250"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[3404\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300068#WRR00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will ensure that funding for volunteer centres will not be reduced as it would have a severe and negative impact upon their ability to carry out important work and functions; if in particular he will recognise the imposition of an 8% cut to a volunteer centre (details supplied) would be detrimental to its continued vital work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":437,"content":"<p>In our current economic circumstances difficult decisions continue to be necessary, but the Government remains committed to supporting the community and voluntary sector.      <\/p><p>  While allocations in most expenditure programmes remain constrained for 2014 , my primary concern has been to make every effort to ensure that the daily front-line services, including volunteer centres, provided with funding from my Department, are protected to the greatest extent possible.

The primary purpose of the Act is to replace the system whereby a vehicle was declared off the road retrospectively with a system under which the vehicle must be declared off the road in advance. <\/p><p>  The Act provided for a three month transition period from 1 July 2013 to 30 September 2013 to allow vehicle owners to bring their motor tax status up to date by making either or both a retrospective and prospective off-road declaration, as appropriate. <\/p><p>  The new arrangements have been fully in force since 1 October 2013.  These only allow for a future declaration which must be made in the month before tax falls due.  The declaration of non-use can be made at any time during that month, either via the local motor tax office or online, and is free of charge. The declaration cannot be made along with a payment of arrears which is payable only once a full month has elapsed i.e. where a vehicle has been without tax for a full calendar month.  The minimum period for which a vehicle licence can be taken out is three months. <\/p><p>  As the Non-Use of Motor Vehicles Act 2013 made minimal other changes to the existing taxation system, no changes were made to the duration of vehicle licences, which can be taken out for three, six or twelve months, or to the payment of arrears which are required to be paid in conjunction with the taking out of a vehicle licence, where there is a gap of more than a month between the expiry of the last vehicle licence and the renewal of the next licence.   <\/p><p>  There was extensive public notice of the Act&rsquo;s coming into force and widespread awareness-raising of the new arrangements from before the start of the transition period.  The measures are aimed at closing an evasion loophole, costing taxpayers approximately &euro;55m per annum, which was facilitated through the use of retrospective declarations.  They are also intended to ensure that motorists keep their vehicle status up to date, that is, the vehicle should be either taxed or the subject of a declaration of non-use.

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel.  The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995.      <\/p><p>  In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. <\/p><p>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994.  A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.<\/p><p>  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.<\/p><p>  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:<\/p><p>  - Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service;<\/p><p>  - Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years;<\/p><p>  - Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.<\/p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks. A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter.  In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.<\/p><p>  It is intended to finalise negotiations with the Representative Association as soon as possible in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300071#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":524,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300071#WRU00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Horse and Greyhound Fund","counter":523,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300071#WRU00750"},{"type":"question","counter":524,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[3219\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300071#WRU00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the State funding that is given to the Irish Responsible Gambling Board directly or indirectly through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.","asker":"959","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":525,"content":"<p>Government support for the horse and greyhound racing industries is provided under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund which was established under Section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001.

While improved farm efficiencies and productivity are essential to producer profitability, price is a major contributor in increasing returns to beef farmers. Cattle prices have reached historically high levels in recent years because of supply shortages in the domestic and export markets.<\/p><p>  However, because of the country&rsquo;s dependence on beef exports, cattle prices are largely determined by the industry&rsquo;s export performance. With the assistance of Bord Bia, the industry been very successful in positioning Irish beef in key European markets with almost 66% of export volumes now destined for the higher value standard retail, premium foodservice and retail or quick service sectors. Maintaining this export performance in a competitive environment requires a continuous focus on satisfying customer demands and adding value to our unique grass-fed beef product through improving its animal welfare, sustainability and carbon footprint credentials on the basis of Teagasc R&amp;amp;D activities.<\/p><p>  Neither I nor my Department can exert any control over the prices obtained by producers for their livestock but I have put in place a number of support measures to underpin the viability of primary production. These include the Beef Genomics Scheme (BGS) for which &euro;23 million has been set aside in this year&rsquo;s budget. The BGS which will begin the process of building a genetic database for the beef sector that will position Ireland as a global leader in beef genetics and ultimately lead to a more efficient and profitable farm sector. <\/p><p>  In addition to the BGS, &euro;9 million in funding will be disbursed under the Beef Data Programme (BDP) in 2014. The objectives of the BDP are to improve the genetic quality of the national beef herd through the collection of essential breeding and production information and to stimulate improvements in the competitiveness and output quality of the Irish beef industry. <\/p><p>  Apart from the BGS and the BDP, a further allocation of &euro;5 million has been earmarked for the continuation of the Beef Technology Adoption Programme (BTAP) in 2014. Some 6,200 farmers received an annual payment of &euro;825 in relation to their participation in the second year of the BTAP. In total, these supports, added to residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme, amount to an investment of almost &euro;40m in this strategically important sector in 2014.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the economics of beef production, the particular difficulties experienced by producers who market cattle over the winter period were considered by the industry-led Beef 2020 Activation Group, which was established to set out the actions necessary to achieve Food Harvest 2020 targets. The Group&rsquo;s report noted that a more widespread use of contracts would provide price certainty for winter finishers but acknowledged the problems faced by the processing industry in moving to a generalised contract system. <\/p><p>  The solution proposed by the Group is a winter finishing minimum price negotiated annually between the individual processor and the individual farmer for spring marketed animals taking account of over-wintering costs. This arrangement would aim to protect those farmers who bought-in or valued on-farm cattle at a price consistent with the actual beef price in the Autumn against serious loss. It would not protect those who overvalued their own stock or overpaid for bought-in cattle. Such an arrangement would assist producers and processors who wished to enter into mutually beneficial commitments based on market realities and would undoubtedly remove a substantial proportion of the farmer&rsquo;s financial exposure. These recommendations refer to the nature of the contractual agreements between farmers and producers and are of course a matter for industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300072#WRV01100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":557,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300072#WRV01150"},{"type":"question","counter":558,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[3356\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300072#WRV01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"with regard to farmers who are being paid AEOS 3 payments and who joined up over 12 months ago, the reason the 2013 payments of &euro;4,000 in total is not being paid until March 2014 and at that only 75% is first paid and the remaining 25% afterwards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":559,"content":"<p>Area-based schemes under the Rural Development Programme, 2007-13, are subject to EU Regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications, including cross checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, to be completed before payments can issue.

The preparation and publication of the HSE's annual Service Plan in each of the years 2011 to 2014 has taken place against a background of significantly reduced financial and human resources as a direct consequence of the very significant deterioration in the public finances that the State has had to contend with in this period. The resultant financial constraints has necessitated reductions in health service spending of over 20%. The numbers employed across the HSE have reduced by over 14,000 in this period.<\/p><p>  The HSE has, in each of the years from 2011 to date, continued to focus its efforts on minimising the impact on front line services by utilising new, innovative and more efficient ways of using reducing resources. The delivery of services has, as a consequence, focused on the dual challenge of protecting patient outcomes while, at the same time, reducing costs. This has required increasing emphasis on models of care that treat patients at the lowest level of complexity and provide safe quality services at the least possible cost.<\/p><p>  Despite these resource reductions the annual HSE Service Plan has managed, to a very significant extent, to maintain core service levels while also supporting growing demand for its services arising from population growth, increased levels of chronic disease, increased demand for drugs, higher numbers of medical card holders (up by 590,000 since 2008) and new cost intensive medical technologies and treatments. Additional funding has also been invested over this period to meet a range of critical service needs, and areas such as primary care and mental health services have benefitted from this funding. The roll out of such initiatives as the National Clinical Care Programmes and the Special Delivery Unit initiatives are also delivering greater value for money and productivity.<\/p><p>  In this regard, the 2013 edition of <i>Health at a Glance <\/i>published by the OECD shows that Ireland continues to make substantive headway in improving health outcomes. Mortality due to cancer fell by 21%, ischemic heart disease by 59% and cerebrovascular disease by 54% between 1990 and 2012 and in all three instances the rates of improvement in Ireland were above the OECD average. Life expectancy in Ireland has increased by a full four years since 2000 to reach 80.6 today, again above the OECD average. This has been achieved during a period when the average length of stay in acute hospitals has also reduced and the number of patients receiving treatment they require without having to stay in hospital (that is, day case patients) has increased as a percentage of total discharges by over 50%.<\/p><p>  The men and women who deliver our health and social care services are to be complemented for maintaining and, in many cases, improving the ever expanding range of services provided to the general public despite such reduced resources over the past four to five years. Their efforts have been highly commendable in these most challenging of times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300076#WRZ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Insurance Prices","counter":659,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300076#WRZ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":660,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[3411\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300076#WRZ01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the action his Department is taking to help stop health insurance customers from cancelling policies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":661,"content":"<p>There are currently just over 2 million people, or 44.6% of the population with private health insurance.

In this regard, I appointed Mr. Pat McLoughlin to work with insurance companies and my Department on an independent review process to identify effective cost management strategies to help ensure the long-term sustainability of the private health insurance market.  I am currently examining Phase 1 of Mr. McLoughlin's report, <i>Review of Measures to Reduce Costs in the Private Health Insurance Market 2013<\/i>, which was published on 26th December 2013.

There are numerous lower cost plans available from all four health insurers and it is quite possible for consumers to find a similar level of cover in the market for a cheaper price. The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits. The HIA plays an important role for customers, both in ensuring that they have accurate information, and in enforcing the implementation of the law protecting consumers in relation to health insurance. The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300076#WRZ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Prices","counter":662,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300076#WRZ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":663,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[3412\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300076#WRZ01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the price differential for generic drugs (details supplied); his plans to cut the cost of generic drugs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":664,"content":"<p>The State has introduced a series of reforms in recent years to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditure. These have resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001\/2002 levels.<\/p><p>  In relation to the specific product Montelukast, the originator product Singulair came off patent in March 2013. Under the terms of the 2012 Agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the HSE reduced the price of Singulair to 70% of its initial price in Quarter 2 2013 and will reduce it to 50% of the initial price in Quarter 2 2014. Under the terms of the 2012 Agreement with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), generic versions of Montelukast are currently priced at 50% of the originator initial price. In Quarter 2 of 2014, the price will be reduced to 47.5% of the initial originator price.<\/p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 provides that from June 2013 the maximum price of all new medicinal products reimbursed under the community drug schemes will be set in accordance with the criteria set out in the Act. The Act also provides that the HSE must review all items currently reimbursable under the GMS and other community drug schemes (including prices) within three years to determine if they should remain on the reimbursement list and, if so, what price should apply. In addition, the Act introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients. It is estimated that reference pricing will yield &euro;50 million in savings in 2014.<\/p><p>  Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicinal products. Generic substitution will be introduced incrementally with the IMB prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State. The Board is in the process of reviewing an initial 20 groups of medicinal products, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines.  They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.<\/p><p>  The first List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, containing groups of atorvastatin products, was published by the IMB on the 7th August 2013. The List has been updated since then by the addition of 11 more priority groups of  medicinal products. The IMB is updating the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products on an ongoing basis and it expects to complete the assessment of  the first top 20 priority groups of medicinal products by end Quarter 1 2014.  A second list of 20 priority groups of medicinal products has now been identified and this list includes montelukast products. It is expected the IMB will have completed assessment of these 20 groups of products in Quarter 4 2014. Details on when each group of medicinal products will be assessed for interchangeability will be published on the IMB website in due course (www.imb.ie).<\/p><p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices. The first reference price for atorvastatin products was implemented on 1 November 2013 resulting in a 70% reduction in the price paid by the HSE for these products compared to May 2013. The second reference price for esomeprazole 20mg products was implemented on 1 January 2014 and the HSE expect to implement reference prices for esomeprazole 40mg on 1 February 2014 resulting in a 56% reduction in the price of these products compared to May 2013. The HSE also expect to implement reference prices for rosuvastatin products with effect from 1 February 2014 resulting in a 40% reduction compared to the prices paid in May 2013.<\/p><p>  In addition, the consultation process is also underway in relation to three more groups of medicines which have been designated as interchangeable by the IMB &ndash; Omeprazole, Lansoprazole, and Pravastatin. It is expected that reference prices will be implemented for these groups of medicines with effect from 1 March 2014. The HSE will continue the process of setting reference prices for the remaining groups of interchangeable medicinal products published by the IMB in accordance with the processes and timelines set down in the legislation. It is expected that 80% by value of the off-patent market for prescribed medicines will be subject to reference pricing by end 2014 resulting in further significant reductions in the price of generic medicines. Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300076#WRZ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Charities and Voluntary Organisations","counter":665,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300076#WRZ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":666,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[3419\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014012300076#WRZ01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has the power to ensure that CRC directors refund moneys received from taxpayers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":667,"content":"<p>I was disturbed by the information which has come to light in regard to unauthorised allowances paid to senior managers in the Central Remedial Clinic.<\/p><p>  An Interim Administrator was appointed by the HSE before Christmas in response to the resignation of the CEO and Board of Governors.
