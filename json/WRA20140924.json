This demands a robust response, and this is precisely what is happening.  Garda&iacute; tackle this type of crime through a range of targeted and intelligence based operations, often disrupting and preventing incidents, as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved.  Shortly after taking up office I discussed the challenges presented by this type of crime with the Acting Garda Commissioner, who outlined the substantial efforts being made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify and target those involved.<\/p><p>  A range of operations are in place to target and confront armed and organised criminals, including Operation Domino and Operation Hybrid in the Dublin area.  In addition to these enforcement measures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also engages extensively with communities in a range of fora to address local concerns relating to crime and community safety, including the impact that organised crime can have at a community level.<\/p><p>  Heavy penalties are provided for weapons offences in our criminal law and mandatory minimum penalties have been introduced for certain firearms offences.  The considerable powers already available to Garda&iacute; have been supplemented further by the recent DNA Database legislation which provides for the establishment of a Database which will have the capacity to link suspects to unsolved crimes using forensic evidence, and will greatly assist Garda&iacute; in investigating a whole range serious offences. <\/p><p>  I am not convinced at this stage that some form of firearms amnesty would make a useful contribution to the reduction of gun crime.  There was such an arrangement for a two month period in late 2006 but that was in the context of new licensing arrangements being introduced and represented an opportunity for people to regularise their situation before the heavier penalties provided for in the legislation came into force.  It is doubtful that such an amnesty would result in hardened criminals handing up weapons.  Equally, I am not sure it is desirable to allow people who hold firearms illegally to evade the legal consequences for that.  Nevertheless, I will keep this matter under review.<\/p><p>  What I believe is very important is that we have robust legislation in place in relation to firearms.  In that context, in view of public safety concerns raised by the Garda Commissioner, a joint Review of operational, legislative and administrative issues governing firearms licensing is being conducted by my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Rule 59 allowed for the granting of greater remission to certain classes of prisoner by virtue of good conduct whilst imprisoned. The most important aspect of the Rule however, is outlined in Rule 59 (2) which specifies that - <\/p><p>  &quot;The Minister may grant such greater remission of sentence in excess of one quarter, but not exceeding one third thereof where a prisoner has shown further good conduct by engaging in authorised structured activity and the Minister is satisfied that, as a result, the prisoner is less likely to reoffend and will be better able to reintegrate into the community&quot;.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will therefore appreciate that the central thrust of the Rule and the central consideration that I must take into account when deciding whether or not to grant individual prisoner's a rate of remission greater than the standard, is whether or not, through his\/her (i) conduct in prison and (ii) the extent to which authorised structured activity has been engaged in, the prisoner has demonstrated that he or she is less-likely to reoffend if released at a time earlier than the normal remission date.<\/p><p>  Arising from a number of judicial challenges to decisions made by me in respect of applications by prisoners for greater remission, and in consideration of comments by members of the judiciary hearing those challenges, on the advice of the Attorney General, I amended the Rule by introducing Statutory Instrument SI 335 of 2014 in August of this year. The purpose of this amendment was to bring greater clarity to the Prison Rules by outlining to prisoners the precise factors to be taken into account by me when considering whether or not to grant a prisoner a greater rate of remission.<\/p><p>  I will not read into the record of the House the full provisions of the amended Rule, as the full Rule is available in the Library and elsewhere. However, I will outline that the main considerations include the nature and gravity of the offence, the period of the sentence served, the potential threat to public safety, the views (where relevant) of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and of course the prisoner's conduct as well as his or her engagement with authorised structured activities.<\/p><p>  Finally, with regard to the number of court challenges arising, it is of course inevitable that some prisoners will feel aggrieved by negative decisions and will seek recourse through the Courts. I cannot, and would not, interfere in their right to do so.

Many of the frontiers are unguarded and porous.<\/p><p>  The number of Irish citizens who are believed to have travelled to the conflict zones since 2010 is estimated at between 25 and 30, 3 of whom are known to have died.<\/p><p>  Within that number are individuals who would have travelled to Libya and other Arab States to take part in the popular uprisings known as the Arab Spring which began in December 2010. Some of these are known to have returned.<\/p><p>  As previously stated, the phenomenon of individuals travelling to the conflict zones has affected the majority of European States and it is one to which Ireland gave priority during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013. In that connection Ireland was successful in gaining the agreement of the Member States to carry out a review of the EU Strategy for Countering Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism.<\/p><p>  A primary point of focus in this review is the foreign fighter issue. A number of initiatives at EU level have been developed to combat this phenomenon including community relations initiatives, media campaigns, enhanced tracking of movements, engagement with third countries (notably Turkey) and engagement with internet service providers to curb radical online content.<\/p><p>  In Ireland An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na monitors the movements of those suspected of involvement in extremist behaviour and in line with best practice internationally has engaged with returnees from the conflict areas. In tandem with that the Garda&iacute; operate a progressive community relations programme through its Racial Inter-Cultural and Diversity Office. That office is in regular contact with our minority communities and recently received favourable comment on its operation from the UN Counter Terrorism Committee.  It is of course essential that at times like this entire communities do not get stigmatised because of the actions of a few. It has to be recognised that the vast majority of our citizens wish only to go about their daily lives in peace.<\/p><p>  I am also fully committed to safeguarding the security of the Common Travel Area. This is given the highest priority by our Immigration Service. Operational and data sharing cooperation with the UK immigration authorities is at an all time high.  Across all aspects of immigration, including visas, asylum, citizenship and border control, there is unprecedented day to day cooperation between the two countries. This includes the sharing on a daily basis of large amounts of information on visa applicants to detect persons who are trying to enter either country by evading immigration controls and checks. At ports of entry there is close operational cooperation involving constant liaison between Irish and British immigration officers on individuals arriving at our borders.<\/p><p>  The enhanced cooperation has stemmed from quarterly meetings of senior Irish and British immigration officials over a number of years and has been discussed between myself and my UK counterpart and at Taoiseach \/ Prime Minister level.<\/p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that I recently published new legislation in the form of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014.  The Bill will transpose into Irish law an EU Council Framework Decision on combating terrorism (2008\/919\/JHA).  In particular, the Bill, when enacted will amend the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 to create the three new offences of, public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.

Revenue has made great progress in tackling the problem of diesel laundering over the past three years and now media reports indicate the emergence of another form of fuel fraud, commonly referred to as petrol-stretching.\u00a0 This involves the illegal addition of kerosene or some other low tax commodity to petrol to defraud the Exchequer and the motorist.<\/p><p>  Petrol stretching is an offence under S102 (1A) Finance Act 1999 and carries a penalty on summary conviction of &euro;5,000 or, at the discretion of the court to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both. If convicted on indictment the fine is to a maximum of &euro;126,970 and the prison term is to a maximum of 5 years or both.<\/p><p>  I am advised by Revenue that they are investigating the recent reports concerning petrol stretching and have been in contact with the motor trade in this regard. I am also advised that they\u00a0have taken samples from a number of filling stations that it has claimed may have been the source of adulterated fuel. These enquiries will seek to establish if there is evidence that kerosene has been added to the petrol being sold by the retailers in question and whether there is evidence to support a prosecution.<\/p><p>  Revenue and the oil sector have cooperated very successfully to tackle diesel laundering and I am confident that with this cooperation, and with the supply chain information available to Revenue, \u00a0the problem of petrol stretching can also be tackled successfully. In this regard it is essential that petrol distributors report on any reduction in the pattern of legitimate supplies of fuel to the retail trade which may indicate that specific retailers are shifting some of their sourcing to laundered or 'stretched' fuel.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Motorists themselves should take care about where they source their petrol from, and report any suspicions concerning the source of adulterated petrol that may have damaged their engines to Revenue. Revenue will investigate such reports and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible. In that regard, Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website specifically on the shadow economy and this includes an electronic reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices such as petrol stretching.<\/p><p>  A key part of the mineral oil tax regulatory system to protect the Exchequer and consumers is the licensing system that ensures that dealers in mineral oil, including forecourt operators, keep proper records and only source and supply legitimate fuel. At Revenue's request, I have strengthened the legislative framework to refuse and \/or revoke mineral oil licences. Revenue has been very pro-active in this sector over the last three years and from mid-2011 to the end of August 2014, 132 filling stations were closed, mainly for breaches of licensing conditions. <\/p><p>  I will carefully consider any new proposals by Revenue to ensure that the licensing system is robust and acts to protect consumers, the legitimate trade and Exchequer receipts.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  I would also like to advise the Deputies that the first point of contact for motorists whose vehicles have been affected should be the insurance companies they hold their policies with.\u00a0\u00a0 Further to that, those affected should also contact the point of purchase and seek redress through them.\u00a0 If they remain unsatisfied they may have recourse to civil remedies and as such could seek legal advice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400075#WRG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Application","counter":137,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400075#WRG01150"},{"type":"question","counter":138,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[36133\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400075#WRG01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views to keep the VAT rate at 9% to ensure that Ireland continues to maintain a strong, vibrant and competitive tourism industry; if he will maintain this reduced VAT rate for the hospitality sector following on the very positive implications this reduction has had on the industry in creating and maintaining employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":139,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[36134\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400075#WRG01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration will be given to extending the 9% tourism VAT rate beyond 2014 so as to ensure that Ireland continues to maintain a strong, vibrant and competitive tourism industry; if he will maintain this reduced VAT rate for the hospitality sector following on the very positive implications this reduction has had on the industry in creating and maintaining employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":140,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 69 together.<br\/><br\/>The 9% reduced VAT rate for tourism related services was introduced in July 2011 as part of the Government Jobs Initiative.

A claim for relief may be made in respect of a number of students.<br\/><br\/>In making a claim for relief for the tax year 2014, the maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per student, but an amount set out in the legislation must be disregarded from each claim (whether in respect of one or more students).\u00a0 Where a claim for relief includes fees paid on behalf of at least one full-time student, the disregard is &euro;2,750. \u00a0Where a claim for relief includes fees solely paid on behalf of a part-time student or part-time students, the amount disregarded is &euro;1,375. \u00a0Thus, for example, an individual undertaking a graduate entry medical course\u00a0on a full-time basis, where tuition fees of &euro;15,000 per student apply, would attract relief of &euro;850 made up as follows:<table><tr><th>Fees<\/th><th>&euro;<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Tuition fees<\/td><td>&euro;15,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Capped at <\/td><td>&euro;7,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Less<\/td><td>&euro;2,750<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>&euro;4,250 @ 20% = &euro;850<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>It is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.

A frame of reference to guide specific structured consultations being undertaken in the context of a new strategy will be developed at the appropriate time in the process. <br\/><br\/>The focus at the moment is identifying, through dialogue with existing consultation groups including the Prioritisation Action Group, Technology Ireland, Horizon 2020 Implementation Group, Knowledge Transfer Ireland Industry Advisory Group etc., the key issues that should be included in any new strategy on Science Technology and Innovation.<br\/><br\/>My Department is also identifying key issues arising through participation in a number of groups with broad stakeholder representation in relevant sectoral areas including Health (through the Healthy Ireland Council and the Health Innovation Hub National Project Team), Smart Aging (through a group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach) and Marine (through the Marine Coordination Group).  Moreover, officials in my Department are also involved in groups with representation from academic, industry and government bodies, including special initiative groups on &quot;big data&quot; and &quot;manufacturing&quot;. <br\/><br\/>Furthermore, a support network of National Contact Points coordinated by Enterprise Ireland comprising knowledgeable and experienced practitioners from relevant Departments and agencies interacts with companies and academics in relation to funding opportunities presented by Horizon 2020.<br\/><br\/>In addition, a number of key reports are being or have recently been prepared in my Department &ndash; all of which had structured consultation with stakeholders built in, and all of which will inform the new strategy.  These include, inter alia: <br\/><br\/>- Research Prioritisation Action Plans;<br\/><br\/>- Identification of fine-grained enterprise research needs for the 14 Research Prioritisation Priority Areas;<br\/><br\/>- Medium Term Development of the Irish Market Focussed Element of the Irish Research Centre Landscape Ecosystem; <br\/><br\/>- Optimising Policy Intervention to Strengthen the Impacts of Enterprise RD&amp;amp;I in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>In addition, I am aware of further work being undertaken in the Department of Education and Skills to which I am also assigned, which also has an important consultative dimension and which will very usefully inform the development of a new strategy.  These include a review of funding of the Higher Education sector, a review of STEM education and target-setting by Higher Education Institutions for Horizon 2020. <br\/><br\/>My view is that there are substantial and diverse channels of ongoing consultation which are being used to inform the developmental stage of the new strategy and these can be supplemented as necessary, as I have said, with an appropriate frame of reference to guide further focused consultations as necessary and at the appropriate time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400078#WRK01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":198,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400079#WRL00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Vessel Licences","counter":197,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400079#WRL00150"},{"type":"question","counter":198,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[35970\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400079#WRL00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will raise the issue of the m\/v Mary Kate with his EU counterparts, in both Germany and Holland and with the European Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, in view of the fact that the owner of the fishing boat, purchased the vessel in Holland, which was certified as being seaworthy by German maritime experts, which subsequently failed stability tests here and is currently in dry dock here and unable to put to sea and for which the owner, who has lost &euro;1.2 million, is under increasing pressure from financial institutions to settle his debt; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I am committed to working with farmers and industry to both deal with the current difficulties, and ensure we have the right measures in place to aid producers achieve better margins on their farms.  While of course I cannot influence prices or commercial interactions between buyers and sellers, I have been actively engaging with the sector with the aim of mitigating the impact of the drop in prices from the highs experienced last year.<\/p><p>  This year alone, I have brought forward a number of initiatives to help the sector, including the creation of the Beef Genomics Scheme with a budget of &euro;23 million in 2014. I have also ensured that the budgets of the Beef Data Programme and the Beef Technology Adoption Programme are retained at &euro;10 million and &euro;5 million which , when added to residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme , amounts to an investment of &euro;40m in 2014.<\/p><p>  I also plan to build on these schemes through the provision for a Beef Data and Genomics Programme in the Rural Development Plan submitted to the EU Commission in July of this year.The Bovine Data and Genomics Programme is intended to deliver an accelerated improvement in the quality and environmental sustainability of the beef herd through the application of genomics technology. This will help farmers to maximise productivity in a sustainable way, while supporting improved quality and traceability in the national suckler herd. It will provide &euro;295 million to suckler beef farmers over its 6 year duration, adding &euro;80 for every animal for which the required actions are undertaken. I must emphasise of course that this scheme remains a proposal pending discussions with the European Commission on the finalisation of the RDP.<\/p><p>  This is just one of a series of measures in the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme which are focussed on the beef sector. It will also benefit from large scale State and EU investment in a substantial new agri-environment\/climate scheme (GLAS), some &euro;195 million per year for disadvantaged areas (now known as Areas of Natural Constraint) and a progressive new Knowledge Transfer measure. It should also be remembered that this is in addition to the &euro;1.2 billion secured for direct payments each year.   <\/p><p>  My role in relation to the beef sector is to create a policy and support environment that will allow it to flourish in line with normal market principles. As I have stated before, I do not believe a Beef Regulator is appropriate. As the Deputy will appreciate, questions of price are ultimately matters to be determined between the purchasers and the sellers of cattle. It is neither appropriate nor possible for me or any other Minister for Agriculture in the EU, to intervene directly on these issues. Cattle prices are determined by supply \/ demand dynamics which are in turn influenced by the seasonality of production, the length of the production lifecycle and market conditions such as retail promotions, consumer confidence, competition with other meats and the overall macroeconomic situation.<\/p><p>  It is, of course, important that farmers are sufficiently remunerated for producing quality animals. Beef producers must be provided with appropriate production incentives that are reflective of market demands and are communicated to producers in a clear and timely manner. I will continue to engage with both farmers and processors to ensure that the market operates in a fair and transparent manner. As the Deputy is aware, I established a Beef Roundtable earlier this year to facilitate such discussions between the parties. One of the key outcomes arising from this Roundtable involves better and more timely communication between processors and producers aimed at transmitting early and clearer market signals which bring about more strategically planned sectoral responses. Another key outcome has been my announcement of a public consultation regarding possible establishment of producer organisations in the beef sector. This public consultation has now closed and my Department are currently assessing the responses before deciding on next steps. Producer organisations can play\u00a0a key role in conveying contractual negotiation powers on groups of farmers which can help to address imbalances in the supply chain.<\/p><p>  I should also point out that there is an array of information already available on the prices paid in Ireland and elsewhere. My Department collates the prices paid for domestic cattle on a weekly basis and reports this data to the European Commission in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1249\/2008 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 148\/2014. To ensure price transparency, results for Members States are published on the DG Agriculture &amp;amp; Rural Development website.

I understand that no court venue has been singled out for or indeed exempted from the review.<br\/><br\/>In this context the Courts Service has established a general framework within which such venues are being assessed taking into account a range of criteria such as caseload, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of cells etc.  The likely impact on other Justice agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service, is also taken into account.  The review identified a range of venues nationwide which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue. In this regard, the identification of venues as part of the review process does not necessarily mean that the identified venues will close.<b><font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font><\/b>For example, the Deputy may wish to note the outcome of the recent extensive consultations process in the Dublin region which has resulted in the Courts Service deciding not to proceed with its proposals to close a number of suburban courthouses.

Among other things, this plan must include any proposals the Commissioner has for the re-organisation of the Divisional or Regional network together with any plans for the closure of an existing Garda station or the opening of a new Garda station.\r\n\r\nIn 2012 the Garda Commissioner, with the approval of the Minister, closed 39 Garda stations, some of which had not been opened for several years and most of which were closed for the most part of the day. In 2013, a further 100 Garda stations were closed. These closures resulted in 61,000 patrolling hours being made available to the Garda Commissioner for frontline operational policing. No stations were closed in 2014 and while the Policing Plan for 2015 has not yet been completed, I do not expect that it will contain any proposals for further closures. The Deputy should be aware that there are still 564 Garda stations in the State and that a major review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is being carried out under the Haddington Road Agreement. The outcome of that review will assist the Garda Commissioner in determining the best distribution model for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that the best possible service continues to be provided across the country and that the links with local communities is maintained to the maximum extent possible.

These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.  <br\/><br\/>As the Deputy can appreciate it is not practical from an operational, available resources or a security perspective to provide education and\/or vocational training exclusively for the use of first time offenders.  On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and are informed of the services available in the prison.  At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date.  Where Governors consider, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention they will initiate a referral.<br\/><br\/>The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015.  There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning through  Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes.  <br\/><br\/>As well as seeking to draw on best practice in adult and further education in the community, there has been a lot of curriculum development over the years that is specific to prison circumstances, such as courses on addiction, health issues and offending behaviour. <br\/><br\/>The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole time teacher equivalents to the Prison Service through the Education and Training Boards (ETB). Education in prisons is delivered in partnership between the ETBs and the Irish Prison Service with a focus on providing education which is quality assured, student centred and which facilitates lifelong learning.  The partnership endeavours to meet the needs of students through helping them cope with their sentence, achieve personal development and prepare for life after release.  A broad and flexible curriculum is provided which ranges from basic literacy classes and peer led tutoring to Open University. There is an increasing focus on FETAC accreditation as the modular structure best meets the needs of students in prison. <br\/><br\/>Other areas where there has been significant progress in prison education are in physical education, in the provision for higher education, in the arts and in preparing prisoners for release and supporting their transition to life, and often to education, on the outside.  A top priority for the Irish Prison Service is ensuring help for those with reading and writing problems and peer mentoring programmes are currently active in all of our prisons.<br\/><br\/>The guiding principles which underpin the prisons' work and training service are to make available, work, work-training and other purposeful activities to all those in custody.  Training activities are chosen to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to acquire practical skills which will help them secure employment on release.  110 Work Training Officers have recently been appointed and assigned to areas such as catering, laundry, industrial cleaning, industrial skills and gym.<br\/><br\/>The Irish Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), and the Guild of Launders and Cleaners and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled us to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification. <br\/><br\/>The manner in which records are collated does not allow us to differentiate between first-time offenders and repeat offenders.<br\/><br\/>However, from the records that are available I can inform the Deputy that figures  are compiled retrospectively and the latest available figures (09\/06\/2014 to 13\/06\/2014) show that an overall total of 1,490 offenders participated in Education activities which represents almost 37% of the prisoner population at that time.  <br\/><br\/>Similarly an average of 1,052 prisoners engaged in vocational training activities each day in June and this represents 27% of the average prison population in that month.  It should be noted that a prisoner may participate in more than one activity.<br\/><br\/>The above figure are a mix of first time offenders and those that have been in custody previously.<table><tr><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400082#WRO01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Releases","counter":280,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400082#WRO01250"},{"type":"question","counter":281,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[36062\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400082#WRO01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of prisoners granted early release in each of the past five years to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":282,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[36063\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400082#WRO01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of long-term prisoners to receive early release-compassionate leave in each of the past five years to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

This information is being collated and will be provided directly to the Deputy.<br\/><br\/>The Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 provides that sentenced prisoners may be approved temporary release whether it be for a few hours or a more extended period.  The Act sets out the circumstances when temporary release may be provided and what matters must be taken into account.<br\/><br\/>Candidates for temporary release are identified by a number of different means but primarily on the recommendation of the Prison Governor or the therapeutic services in the prisons. The prisoner, their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession. Recommendations are also made to me in relation to long term sentence prisoners by the Parole Board. It is very important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive temporary release even if the recommendation is to that effect. Before a final determination a number of factors may be taken into account including: -<br\/><br\/>- the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the person relates<br\/><br\/>- the sentence concerned and any recommendation made by the Court in relation to the sentence imposed<br\/><br\/>- the period of the sentence served by the person<br\/><br\/>- the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released<br\/><br\/>- the person's previous criminal record<br\/><br\/>- the risk of the person failing to return to prison at the expiration of the period of temporary release<br\/><br\/>- the conduct of the person while in custody or while previously on temporary release<br\/><br\/>- any report or recommendation made by the Governor, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a Probation &amp;amp; Welfare Officer, or any other person whom the Minister considers may be of assistance in coming to a decision as to whether to grant temporary release<br\/><br\/>- the risk that the person might commit an offence during any period of temporary release<br\/><br\/>- the risk of the person failing to comply with any of the conditions of temporary release<br\/><br\/>- the likelihood that a period of temporary release might accelerate the person's reintegration into society or improve his prospects of obtaining employment<br\/><br\/>Temporary release assists in gradually preparing suitable offenders for release and in administering short sentences, and is an incentive to prisoners. It is an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way. The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence.  Each application for temporary release for whatever reason, including those referred to in your question, is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made.  <br\/><br\/>In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a daily basis to the offender's Garda Station.  Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Garda&iacute; or maybe refused another period of reviewable temporary release.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400082#WRO01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Data","counter":285,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400083#WRP00250"},{"type":"question","counter":286,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[36064\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400083#WRP00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of prisoners currently serving sentences for drug related offences; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":287,"content":"<p>I can advise the Deputy that on the 31 August 2014 there were 3,792 prisoners in custody across the prison system.

Membership\/allegiance to criminal gangs fluctuates on a continuous basis with some persons breaking links and others becoming affiliated. <br\/><br\/>The emergence in recent years of criminal gangs has had significant implications for the management of Irish prisons.  Rivalries and feuds which develop on the outside continue inside of prison.  Prison management must ensure that the various factions are kept apart and, as far as possible, that gang members do not have influence over other inmates in the prisons or criminal activities on the outside.<br\/><br\/>Gang members are managed on a daily basis through segregation and separation throughout the prison system.  Membership\/allegiance of these criminal gangs fluctuates on a continuous basis with some persons breaking links and others becoming affiliated.<br\/><br\/>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that a number of initiatives have been introduced with a view to preventing identified gang leaders from conducting criminal activities while in custody and also to prevent them exerting inappropriate influence over other persons.  For example, the security initiatives undertaken by the Operational Security Group (OSG)  have made it more difficult for prisoners to engage in illegal activities while in prison.  These initiatives include the introduction of passive and active drug detection dogs and the installation of airport style security including scanners and x-ray machines.  Core functions of this group include gathering and collating intelligence information on criminal gang members in custody , carrying out  intelligence led searches and preventing the flow of contraband (including mobile phones) into the prisons. <br\/><br\/>In addition, there is regular contact between the Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to discuss security issues including the operation of criminal gangs.

These include the deployment of a secure national digital radio system (NDRS), the deployment and support of Garda and Community CCTV systems, an automated number plate recognition (ANPR) system, and the addition of many new functions to the modernised PULSE system, a class-leader in terms of incident recording which itself is further supported by a dedicated Garda data entry service in Castlebar.<\/p><p>  In the area of forensics the situation is that the Garda authorities currently employ state-of-the-art automated fingerprint and ballistics identification systems which I am informed are at least on a par with those used by police forces in other EU jurisdictions.  The Deputy will also be aware that the forensic capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be further enhanced by a new national DNA database, expected to become operational later this year, which was established on foot of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act, 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400083#WRP01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Data","counter":300,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400083#WRP01250"},{"type":"question","counter":301,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[36069\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400083#WRP01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which prisoners have absconded from the prison service in each of the past five years to date; the number recaptured; the number currently still at large; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":302,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that the number of prisoners deemed to have absconded from the custody of the Irish Prison Service in each of the past five years to date is set out in the table below:<table><tr><th><div>Year<\/div><\/th><th><div>Number of Absconders<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>2009<\/div><\/td><td><div>133<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2010<\/div><\/td><td><div>112<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2011<\/div><\/td><td><div>86<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2012<\/div><\/td><td><div>63<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2013<\/div><\/td><td><div>18<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2014  <\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><table><tr><td>As on 22 September 2014, Irish Prison Service records indicate that of the 419 persons who absconded during this time period, 32  remain unlawfully at large. <br \/><br \/>Garda&iacute;  are informed when prisoners abscond and they have the power to detain, arrest, and return such persons to prison.

The Presidents monitor waiting times across all court lists and seek to ensure the optimum use of court time. The Deputy may wish to refer to Section 6 of the recently published Courts Service Annual Report which contains information on Waiting Times across the various court jurisdictions.<br\/><br\/>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the primary objective for the Courts Service and the judiciary is to maintain the delivery of front line court sittings and services.  The Courts Service continuously works to support the judiciary and assist in so far as is possible and appropriate, within the terms of its mandate, in ensuring that cases are dealt with as effectively and as speedily as possible.  Available resources and operational and organisational structures are under ongoing review to ensure that resources are targeted and focussed on keeping waiting times in the provision of services to a minimum.<br\/><br\/>The Presidents of the various courts are determined to achieve improvements in waiting times and they are working with the Courts Service to target judicial resources at the areas of greatest need.  The Presidents continue to arrange additional sittings where possible within the resources available to them to deal with any delays in the hearing of cases. The Courts Service is also working with the judiciary on the implementation of a number of initiatives in relation to court procedures and  initiatives arising from the report of the cross agency Working Group established to identify and implement efficiency measures with a specific focus on the high volume Circuit and District Courts.  These include the centralisation of custody cases and the use of alternative courts venues in the District Court; a new practice direction in the Circuit Court in relation to sending forward for trial; a pre-trial procedure which is operating in the Dublin and the Midland Circuits on a pilot basis from 1 December 2012; increased use of video links between courts and prisons; and the provision of same-day probation reports.<br\/><br\/>I am informed that waiting times in the Circuit and District Courts vary from venue to venue based on the number and complexity of cases. In relation to the High Court, waiting times are generally in the range of 1 to 5 months except in relation to Asylum cases where the delay is currently over 2 years.  I am informed that delays in the Asylum list are due to several factors including the high volume of cases. Delays in lists also occur where parties who have certified the case as ready to proceed and\/or applied for a hearing date inform the court that they are not ready to proceed on the allocated date and apply for adjournment.<br\/><br\/>The President of the High Court keeps waiting times under continuous and additional sittings were held during August and September with a view to maintaining the improvements made in waiting times in recent years. The High Court has, as is usual, dealt with bail lists on one or two days each week during the court vacation and sat each day and during several weekends to hear matters arising of an urgent nature. These sittings will continue until the commencement of the next legal term.<br\/><br\/>The ongoing delegation to court officials of administrative functions previously dealt with by the High Court judges has also yielded significant savings in judicial times resulting in increased judicial availability for trial work.  The re-organisation of sittings of the High Court outside Dublin by the President of the High Court also continues to achieve efficiencies in the use of judicial time.<br\/><br\/>The Courts Service has indicated that<font color=\"#2020A0\"> <\/font>the waiting times in the Central Criminal Court are 16 months. Waiting times in the Supreme Court for certified cases are on average 11 months for the priority list and 48 months for the general list. In the Supreme Court remedial actions have been taken to reduce the number of uncertified cases.  A total of 255 appeals have been disposed of by the Supreme Court to date this year in its continuing programme of managing uncertified appeals.  A further 115 uncertified appeals are proposed to be listed on 29September 2014 for this purpose.<br\/><br\/>In the first and second quarters of 2014 there was a 13% increase in new appeals lodged and an 81% increase in the number of appeals disposed of when compared with the same period in 2013.While some immediate improvement has been achieved in reducing the backlog that has accumulated in the Supreme Court over the past number of years, the issue of capacity in the Supreme Court will only be fully resolved through the introduction of the Court of Appeal which is due to be established in October 2014.<br\/><br\/>It should also be noted that delays in the hearing of cases can occur for a number of reasons which can be outside the control of the courts and the Courts Service, e.g. the unavailability of a witness or where the parties or the legal practitioners may not be ready to proceed. This can give rise to adjournments which can have an impact on the time taken to complete the hearing of a case and on the number of cases which can be disposed of in a court sitting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400084#WRQ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Investigations","counter":313,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400084#WRQ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":314,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[36073\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400084#WRQ00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which various cold cases continue to receive attention; if she remains satisfied regarding the adequacy of resources available in respect of such cases; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":315,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the function of the Serious Crime Review Team (SCRT) is to assist Senior Investigating Officers assigned to the case in question in bringing investigations to a successful conclusion by identifying further investigative opportunities and ensuring that investigations conform to approved best practice guidelines.<\/p><p>  At the conclusion of each review a substantive report is provided to the Senior Investigating Officer who considers the opportunities for further investigation for dissemination back into the investigative and operational units.

Articles 15, 16 and 17 of the Convention outline how the Convention shall operate and states what agencies or bodies shall be responsible for the transmission of various documents between the two Contracting States. Initially the transmission of these documents is the responsibility of the National Central Authorities, but under Article 22 of the Convention, these functions can be delegated to approved Accredited Bodies.  The involvement of accredited bodies in inter-country adoption is the norm, and accreditation of adoption agencies is accepted as one of the important safeguards introduced by the 1993 Hague Convention. It is an essential step to improve the quality and safety of inter-country adoptions now and in the future. Any private agency wishing to undertake inter-country adoptions in Convention States must be licensed by and accountable to a supervising or accrediting authority (the Adoption Authority in Ireland).<\/p><p>  Currently, there are two Accredited Bodies registered by the Adoption Authority of Ireland to facilitate inter-country adoptions. Both have approval from the Adoption Authority to charge a Common Programme Fee of &euro;6,500 per application. This fee applies to all applications and all countries. The fee covers the costs incurred by the agencies in respect of the overheads and costs incurred by them in Ireland. These costs include &ndash; staffing, accommodation, insurance, office supplies, staff training and maintenance of the client&rsquo;s application. Activities covered include the transmission of the Adoption Authority&rsquo;s Article 15 Assessments Report, the Article 16 Child Referral, the Article 17 Placement Agreement and the Article 23 Conformity Certificate, as well as client support during these activities. The Adoption Authority has advised that it is satisfied that based on figures supplied via the Hague Convention Permanent Bureau in The Hague, the approved Common Programme Fee is within the international norm.<\/p><p>  With regard to inter-country adoptions from the U.S., the functions outlined in Articles 15, 16 and 17 have been delegated by the US Central Authority to a number of Adoption Service Providers and on the Irish side, those functions were delegated to Arc Adoption Limited. This delegation of functions was carried out pursuant to Section 66(2) of the Adoption Act 2010. <\/p><p>  In addition to the Common Programme Fee referred to above, there are in-country costs. In the case of the United States of America, these costs are &euro;1,600 for Arc Adoption Ltd., (to cover direct expenses - couriers, medical advisor and post-adoption reports coordination) and a figure of between &euro;35,403 and &euro;44,204 charged by the US Adoption Service Providers. These in-country costs to US Adoption Service Providers have previously been paid by prospective adopters directly to the Service Provider.<\/p><p>  While the Adoption Authority publishes notices of the approved fee programmes on its website, comprehensive details and breakdowns are available from the accredited bodies themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400085#WRR01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Funding","counter":338,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400085#WRR01350"},{"type":"question","counter":339,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[36135\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400085#WRR01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his views on concerns raised recently (details supplied) regarding funding to the Child and Family Agency; if he will confirm the statistic that has emerged suggesting that there are currently 9,000 cases waiting to be allocated a social worker and that of these, 3,000 are classified as high priority; if he will provide, with a timeline, his plans to deal with this waiting list; the way this will be achieved and if he will confirm his commitment to deal with the crisis within the Child and Family Agency.","asker":"1093","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":340,"content":"<p>A report prepared by the Child and Family Agency &ndash; \"Measuring the Pressure\" - indicates that at the end of June 2014, the Agency was providing 19,766 children with a social work service.

Under the arrangements effected by the Act, a revised system of assessment for eligibility was introduced for those 70 years of age and over, based on the significantly higher gross income limits rather than the standard net income thresholds. This advantageous arrangement for persons aged over 70 years has facilitated a much greater share of this cohort qualifying for a medical card compared to the general population as a whole.<br\/><br\/>The gross income limit for an over 70s medical card was set at in law at &euro;500 per week for a single person and at &euro;900 per week for a couple from 1 January 2014. The Government recognises that the living costs of an individual living alone are more than half the living costs of a couple living together and <font color=\"#212100\">that expenditure does not necessarily diminish relative to the number of people in the household<\/font>. This is recognised, inter alia, through the provision of the Living Alone Increase and differential income limits for medical cards for persons aged under 70 years between individuals and couples. In that context, the over 70s income limit for a single person was reduced proportionately less than the income limit for a couple under this Budget change. There are no proposals to change this assessment process. <br\/><br\/>Persons aged 70 or over, who have lost their eligibility for a medical card due to the 2014 budgetary change will continue to have access to free GP services. In addition, as you will be aware, the Government committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service for the entire population and the aim is to have the over 70's phase implemented this year or early next year. Furthermore, any person over 70 that does not qualify for a medical card is able to use the DPS (Drugs Payment Scheme) which caps spending on prescription drugs. <br\/><br\/>It should also be noted that persons aged 70 or older, who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds, may also have their eligibility assessed under the standard means test, where they face particularly high expenses.  This assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses and the qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over 70s gross income thresholds.  <br\/><br\/>Furthermore, persons aged over 70 years may still be eligible for a medical card on a discretionary basis where they face undue hardship in arranging medical services as a result of medical or social circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400088#WRU00500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Screening Programmes","counter":383,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400088#WRU00550"},{"type":"question","counter":384,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[36028\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400088#WRU00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to his recent Parliamentary Question responses on his intention to extend the BreastCheck screening programme to 66 - 69 year olds that he will lobby his Cabinet colleagues and get funding for the extension as part of Budget 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":385,"content":"<p>As indicated in the previous reply to the Deputy, I fully support the proposed extension of the BreastCheck screening programme to the 65 - 69 year age cohort.

Many pupils with special educational needs will be able to attend a local mainstream school, whereas for pupils who have needs which require more specialist interventions, special class and special school placements are provided for. <br\/><br\/>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.<br\/><br\/>In primary schools, additional teaching supports for pupils with special education needs are provided through two channels. <br\/><br\/>Under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, schools are resourced to cater for pupils whose educational psychological assessment places them in the high incidence, or less complex, disability category. All mainstream Primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources under the GAM to cater for children with high incidence special educational needs. <br\/><br\/>Separately, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02\/05. The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.<br\/><br\/>Details of the NCSE application criteria are available at www.ncse.ie.<br\/><br\/>It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with my Department's guidance.<br\/><br\/>In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. <br\/><br\/>This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. <br\/><br\/>I would advise, in the first instance, that if the parents of the child have specific concerns about his educational progress or are dissatisfied with the manner in which the resources or facilities which have been provided to support their child's education are being applied in school, they should raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school,with a view to raising these concerns with the assigned NEPS psychologist and\/or their local SENO.<br\/><br\/>Parents may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.<br\/><br\/>The availability of Health related services are a matter for the HSE and questions relating to such services can be addressed to my colleague the Minister for Health. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400093#WRZ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Eligibility","counter":480,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400093#WRZ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":481,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[36083\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400093#WRZ00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will review a school transport issue affecting persons (details supplied) in County Tipperary; if she will also review the decision made by Bus &Eacute;ireann in view of the information provided; the steps she will take to facilitate the child in question; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"962","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":482,"content":"<p>Under the terms of my Department's Post Primary School Transport Scheme children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest education centre as determined by my Department\/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. <br\/><br\/>The Deputy is aware that the child in question is not eligible for school transport but is however availing of transport on a concessionary basis.<br\/><br\/>Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the second service proposed to be availed of by the child is in fact operating to capacity and it is therefore not possible to provide a second seat on a concessionary basis for the child on this service.<br\/><br\/>The terms of the School Transport Schemes are applied equitably on a national basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400093#WRZ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1078"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":483,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400093#WRZ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":484,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[36114\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400093#WRZ01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason for the potential shortfall of 200 school places in the Lucan area for second level education for September 2015 in view of the fact that a number of parents have conducted an exercise which indicates that 200 places plus will not be accommodated at second level in September 2015 in view of the numbers that are currently in sixth class in national school; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1012","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":485,"content":"<p>My Department is currently analysing the latest demographic data on a nationwide basis to determine where additional school accommodation might be needed from 2015 onwards.

The current Programme officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years with funding of &euro;281m over that period. It is being implemented on a transitional basis for 2014 with a budget of &euro;47m pending the roll out of the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) in April 2015. Some 17 Women&rsquo;s Projects under the remit of the National Collective of Community Based Women's Networks (NCCWN) currently receive annual funding of &euro;1.3 million under the LCDP. In addition, <b>my Department also supports a number of Women&rsquo;s projects under the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO). This funding scheme, which supports national organisations in the community and voluntary sector, aims to provide multi-annual funding towards core costs associated with the provision of services. A new round of funding under this scheme commenced on 1 July 2014, under which the NCCWN  <\/b>was allocated some &euro;160,122 for the two year period of 1July 2014 &ndash; 30 June 2016.<br\/><br\/><b>The S<\/b>ICAP is one of my key priorities and its budget for next year will be decided in the 2015 Estimates process. The Programme&rsquo;s target groups are:<br\/><br\/>-Children and Families from Disadvantaged Areas<br\/><br\/>-  Lone Parents<br\/><br\/>-  New Communities (including Refugees\/Asylum Seekers)<br\/><br\/>-  People living in Disadvantaged Communities<br\/><br\/>-  People with Disabilities<br\/><br\/>-  Roma<br\/><br\/>-  The Unemployed (including those not on the Live Register)<br\/><br\/>-  Travellers <br\/><br\/>-  Young Unemployed People from Disadvantaged areas<br\/><br\/>In accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of the services to clients, the Programme is subject to a public procurement process, which is currently underway. Stage one (Expression of Interest) has been completed. Stage two (Invitation to Tender), will get underway in October and will involve the successful applicants from Stage one being invited to apply to one or more Local Community Development Committees, in Local Authority areas, to deliver the programme. Contracts for SICAP will be determined following the outcome of the procurement process.<br\/><br\/>The public procurement process is a competitive process that is open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new Programme. In Stage one, joint applications were encouraged and organisations of varying sizes (for example smaller organisations working in consortia with larger organisations) were invited to submit joint applications. That said, I understand that some small groups, such as the groups under the remit of the NCCWN, faced a number of challenges in competing in the Stage one process. As soon as the outcome of Stage one is made known, I will be considering the implications of that for NCCWN in the context of the relevant SICAP target groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400095#WRBB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Supply","counter":532,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400096#WRCC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":533,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[36057\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400096#WRCC00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide details of the first fix scheme in respect of leaking pipes on private homeowners' property; when this scheme comes into effect; if he will clarify what the homeowners with leaking pipes will do in the meantime; if these homeowners will be reimbursed for work that needs to be carried out as a matter of urgency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":534,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[36085\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400096#WRCC00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when Irish Water will have completed the first free fix to customers' homes; if he will confirm that this will be completed before customer metering begins; the provisions that are in place in cases where there is a leakage that has not been fixed yet metering is under way; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Once the Bill is approved by Government, my objective is to introduce it and progress its passage through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible, with a view to enactment by the end of 2014, as set out in the <i>Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>With particular regard to greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, the <i>National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development<\/i>, published in April 2014, commits Ireland to a long-term vision of low-carbon transition based on, inter alia, an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400098#WREE00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","counter":548,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400099#WRFF00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":547,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400099#WRFF00050"},{"type":"question","counter":548,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[36002\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400099#WRFF00200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to make broadband available in an area (details supplied) in County Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":549,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s Statement of Priorities for the period 2014 to 2016 reaffirms our commitment to delivering a State-led broadband intervention in rural areas.  Through the National Broadband Plan (NBP) the Government aims to ensure that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses in Ireland.  This is being achieved through measures designed to accelerate commercial investment and the development of a State-led intervention for non-commercial areas.<\/p><p>  Under EU State Aid Guidelines Member States cannot intervene where commercial investors have plans to roll out services.  A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department to identify those areas that require a State intervention.  An initial list of areas has already identified and includes 82 areas in County Galway.  I am also aware of extensive rollout of high speed broadband services in Galway by at least one commercial operator. <\/p><p>  As part of the mapping process, an initial stakeholder consultation on certain technical aspects of the proposed Plan was launched in June with a deadline of 15th September.  31 submissions were received as part of this process and non-commercially sensitive versions of these responses will be published over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  I expect to publish the maps for public consultation later this year.  These will include details of the areas requiring State intervention.  It is important to note that these maps will be dynamic and will be subject to change if new commercial investments are announced in the future. <\/p><p>  A further public consultation on a proposed comprehensive intervention strategy will be launched in mid-2015. <\/p><p>  EU State Aid clearance will be required for the proposed State intervention.  My Department will be working closely with the European Commission on this important aspect of the programme.<\/p><p>  Finally, a detailed procurement process will have to be undertaken in order to select a potential preferred bidder(s) prior to commencing the roll out of high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>  This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government and for my Department.  It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in a sustainable and meaningful way.  Our goal is to ensure that quality broadband services are available to all citizens regardless of where they are located. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400099#WRFF00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadcasting Sector Regulation","counter":550,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400099#WRFF00400"},{"type":"question","counter":551,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[36036\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092400099#WRFF00500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will publish the NewERA report into RTE; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1011","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":552,"content":"<p>On foot of the Five Year Review of the Funding of Public Service Broadcasters under Section 124 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, NewERA was tasked by Government with conducting an independent assessment of the scope for further efficiencies within RT&Eacute;.<\/p><p>  NewERA&rsquo;s Report has been received and I am currently considering its recommendations, prior to bringing the Report to Government.
