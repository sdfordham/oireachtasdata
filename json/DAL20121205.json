One might be suspicious on the eve of budget day to get such a large selection of documents because it is a classic way to bury material that the Government might not want people to see but, on a quick read through the documents, they clearly reveal a story of the selection of those sites which is much different to the one that was revealed by the Taoiseach and the T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, over repeated questions in this House, not to mention the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.<\/p><p><br \/>  The freedom of information documents show the list of 33 locations was signed off by the Taoiseach and Deputy Gilmore on Friday, 13 July and, significantly, that list does not include Balbriggin and Swords.  However, on Monday, 16 July, there was a flurry of e-mails between the office of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Department of Health and others.  At 6.02 p.m. on the night before the Cabinet meeting, Swords and Balbriggin were still not on the list.  By 6.22 p.m., 20 minutes later, they are on the list.  Then written on a significant e-mail, at approximately half past seven that Monday evening, by officials is the following:<blockquote>Monday evening ... discussed with Maureen Windle [who is the Minister's adviser].  Bairbre advised M Windle in relation to Swords - article in ... [the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>].  I advised M Windle in relation [to] Balbriggin - recent response to rep signed by Minister for Town Clerk in Balbriggin re leased PCC site location decided - latest is that price is agreed.<\/blockquote>Ten minutes later, the adviser, Ms Windle, consults the Minister and gets the response from the Minister that &quot;both Swords &amp; Balbriggin will stay&quot;.<\/p><p><br \/>  The key point here is that these are commercial decisions.  A public private partnership, PPP, is a different model to a lease model.  A lease model had been agreed.  Is it right that a Minister should interfere in such a manner in the commercial arrangement which confers benefit on private sector stakeholders because the PPP model is a much more bankable proposition than the lease model?  That is the key.  Unfortunately, this is much more than mere political strokes.<\/p><p><br \/>  The key question here is this.  Does the Taoiseach accept that it is wrong for a Minister to get so involved in the detailed selection of public private partnerships and in the modality of the commercial relationship between the State and private sector consortia?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500003#A00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1354703400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>Deputy Martin has returned to this on a number of occasions.

As has been outlined by the Minister for Finance, the next payment is due in March 2013 and the Government does not wish to be obliged to pay that.  At the other end of this issue, I note the European finance Ministers yesterday did not reach agreement on putting in place the legal framework for the banking union and its supervisory capacity and that a further meeting has been scheduled for next week.  Deputy Ross is well aware that one cannot have these discussions unless one has a legal framework in which they take place.  I hope this can be achieved before the end of the year at the meeting to be held next week.  As I outlined yesterday, the Greek situation is different than that of Ireland.  We will exit our programme in 2013 and the Government is in discussions with the troika about what might be appropriate in respect of the nature of that exit.  Greece will still be attempting to get its debt-to-GDP ratio down to 124% by 2024, whereas Ireland will exit its programme next year.  In itself, this will add an attractiveness to this country as a location for continued investment and job creation.  However, what the Government would regard as being fundamentally helpful to Ireland, and what it is in discussions on and pursuing with the European Central Bank, as well as at European Council level, is the question of sustainability arising from the bank debts that were put on the backs of the taxpayers.  The Government continues to deal with that in a serious manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500005#C07100","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1354704600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>The point I was trying to make is that middle Ireland now sees that on one side are the Government, the Department of Finance and others in positions of great power here, allied with Mrs. Merkel and other powerful European nations and European banks, while on the other side are the people of Ireland, who will be obliged to suffer this austerity budget today.  I acknowledge the sums will add up at the end of the day but people are not going to be able to pay some of the taxes the Government intends to impose.  A new situation is being entered into, in that the property tax will not be paid by some people because they will not be able to pay it.

The T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, and leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, is strongly identified with this issue, having described it as his priority in government.  He has reneged on the commitments the Government gave on disability funding.  I propose to share with the House details of a case in point, which is outrageous.  On 22 October 2012, one of my constituents received a letter from the Health Service Executive indicating that, following a review of the person's care needs, services continued to be approved through the home care package scheme and there would be no change in the services provided through the scheme.  Only one month later, on 28 November, the same individual was again informed that, following a review of care needs, services continued to be approved through the home care package.  However, the home help aspect of the package was decreased by five hours per week or one hour per day between Monday and Friday.  The individual in question is wheelchair bound, cannot stand unaided, does not have any use of one hand, has limited use of the other hand and is unable to cook, get into or out of bed or attend to personal and toilet needs.  It is an outrage that an individual in this position has been deprived of hours under the home help scheme.  The decision is an indication of the extent to which the Government has debased the health service and demonstrates the dishonesty of the promises made during the general election campaign.<\/p><p>  In recent days, I have also been contacted by a 94 year old gentleman whose home help hours have been reduced from five to three hours, a lady of 93 years whose home help hours have been reduced from five to one and one quarter hours and a gentleman of 75 years who recently suffered a bad fall and whose hours have been reduced from five to one and a half hours.  These three cases give an indication of the disgraceful manner in which disabled people are being treated by the Government.  I support the motion. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500007#E00600","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speech","time":1354705800,"counter":191,"content":"<p>It is widely accepted that marginal increases in funding to disability services during the so-called boom were offset against an historically low starting point.  Budgets since 2009 have brought about a major reduction in health expenditure and, subsequently, cuts in funding to disability services.  The impacts of these cuts range from the postponement of the development of existing services and reductions in expenditure on capital items to the non-replacement of staff and reductions in new service development.  People with disabilities are now two and a half times less likely to be employed and more than twice as likely to be at risk of poverty.  These figures refer to the official measures of poverty.  If the Government continues with its current measures, the impact on the quality of life of the 13% of the population who have disabilities will be nothing short of catastrophic.<\/p><p>  While the programme for Government contains a promise to ensure the quality of life of people with disability will be enhanced, budgetary measures introduced since the Government came to power have worsened the position for a sector that has experienced cuts in funding of approximately 20% in recent years.  In addition to experiencing a deterioration in the services and supports they need, those who require disability and mental health services are also living under the weight of general cutbacks and restrictions implemented as a result of the recession.  They and their families are, if one likes, experiencing a twofold recession. <\/p><p>  Unfortunately, I only have time to refer to a small number of statistics relating to disability services.  For example, 14% of all pensioners with disabilities do not receive any support services thanks largely to cuts in home help hours.  The Irish Wheelchair Association reports the astonishing statistic that the unmet annual need for personal assistant services for people with physical and sensory disabilities alone is in excess of 520,000 hours.  Further, one in four young adults with intellectual disabilities or autism who left secondary school this year did not have any further education, training or day service replacement in September.  In addition, the waiting list for residential care among people with intellectual disabilities currently stands at approximately 4,000.  Decisions made this week will have devastating effects on the quality of life of people with disabilities long past the lifetime of this Government. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500007#E00700","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1354705800,"counter":192,"content":"<p>With the budget only a couple of hours away, this motion provides a good opportunity for Deputies to highlight the issue of services for people with disabilities.  The Fianna F\u00e1il Party has taken a politically cynical and disingenuous approach to this matter given that it was responsible for many of the cuts of recent years.  For example, the previous Fianna F\u00e1il led Government reduced expenditure on disability services by 10% in its final two budgets.<\/p><p>  The Government amendment &quot;acknowledges that some reductions in disability services have been unavoidable in 2012&quot; and states the &quot;Minister for Health is doing all possible to ensure that as much protection as possible is afforded to the disability sector and the social care area as a whole&quot;.  This will not give confidence to people with disabilities that it will protect their services.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Halligan noted, earlier funding increases for disability services must be viewed in the context of the very low base from which they started.  The personal assistant service was first introduced 25 years ago and has been developed in recent years.  Between 600,000 and 700,000 people with disabilities rely on disability services to help them get up in the morning, eat, dress, go to work and play a role in society.  They need to hear from the Government that funding for their services will be protected in this and future budgets.  Without such an assurance, they will experience stress and anxiety as they worry every day about where the next cut will come from and whether their personal assistant hours will be reduced.  Cuts in funding for people with disability and other vulnerable persons should be stopped.  This funding must be ring-fenced and guaranteed. <\/p><p>  The Government must ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Ratification is part and parcel of the disability strategy.  I learned with sadness today that the US Senate decided not to ratify the convention yesterday, which was a bad day for people with disability in the United States.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500007#E00800","speaker":"1032"},{"type":"speech","time":1354705800,"counter":193,"content":"<p>One of the features of this Government has been its habit of redefining language.  As words no longer have their intended meaning, people must listen and reinterpret them.  Nowhere can this be seen better than in the areas of disability and mental health.  The most common phrase the Government uses to describe its ultimate objective is that it will \"protect the vulnerable\", yet domiciliary care payments have been severely cut.<\/p><p>Home help hours have been cut to the point at which the service has become robotic.  How is a vulnerable person who cannot even get out of bed supposed to go to the shops?  Ambulance services, the carer's allowance and the chaos around the processing of same are all features of this.<\/p><p> Often, the cut to home help hours does not make sense in a cost-benefit analysis.  According to the Centre for Independent Living, CIL, which protested outside Leinster House's gates in August due to cuts in hours, if services were provided directly, they would cost multiples of what is spent on home help.<\/p><p> The cuts to domiciliary care payments started in 2009, predating this Government.  However, they have continued.  Even children with conditions that will not improve are subject to reviews, which is cynical.<\/p><p> I know of a couple of cases.  For example, I have been following a case of a parent who is seeking occupational therapy for a child with autism.  The parent was told that the child could not receive it because another support service was providing it.  The child has been discharged from the service and will only be provided with it if he or she is an inpatient case.  This means that the parent is running around in circles seeking a service that should be available.  There should be safeguards to ensure that these services are provided.  It is being delivered in a dishonest way.<\/p><p> The ambulance service has been scaled back considerably.  I have seen this happen in my area.  Transport may only be provided if, in the clinician's view, the patient would be unable to make the journey without clinical assistance or where the patient must be transported on a stretcher.  In the past two weeks, I have dealt with a case about which the doctor involved was tearing his hair out.  A man aged more than 90 years suffered complications after an operation, but it took a week to get an ambulance to bring him to hospital.  If this is the type of service that we are providing to vulnerable people, we need to question what we mean by &quot;vulnerable&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500007#E00900","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354706400,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Jerry Buttimer, who is sharing time with Deputies Gerald Nash, Simon Harris, \u00c1ine Collins, Jack Wall and Eamonn Maloney.

This debate is about people with disabilities and their families.  It is not always about money, but it is about how we allocate resources while respecting the rights and needs of service users and people with disabilities, which is what this motion should be about.  It is cynical of Fianna F\u00e1il to table this motion, given its record in government for 14 years.<\/p><p>  The programme for Government in its content and delivery is strong in its commitment to people with disabilities.  I commend the Minister of State with responsibility for disability services, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  Due to her knowledge, experience and leadership of the Department in this regard, we will see reform, a continuum of change and an evolution of policy that will have at its core people with disabilities.  In everything we try to do in politics and in government, it is important to keep service users at the core.  It is a question of their needs.  It is also important that we listen to and engage with people with disabilities.  I welcome the fact that, in the delivery of the value for money report and the policy review of disability services, the Minister of State will engage with people.<\/p><p>  With many of my colleagues, I spoke with members of the COPE Foundation about its pre-budget submission.  To give the Minister of State, Deputy White, a flavour, the COPE Foundation is a service provider in Cork that deals with 2,150 people.  The quality and quantity of its services, the evolution of its facilities and the continuum of care provided by it are extraordinary.  In a five-year period, it has seen a reduction in its budget and an increase in the number of people availing of its service from 1,700 to 2,150.  Despite having \u20ac4.5 million less and a reduction in staff numbers, the COPE Foundation continues to provide an excellent service to people who need it.  This shows that we can make a change.<\/p><p>  In supporting what the COPE Foundation has done and is doing, we must consider value for money.  If our assertion is that more must be done with less, the COPE Foundation has done that.  The main issue is that, as 85% of its budget relates to pay and cannot be touched because of the Croke Park deal, it must find savings from the 15% of its budget that involves transport, energy, food, medicines and maintenance.  This will impact on those who require its services and their families.  If one views the COPE Foundation as an example of what is occurring across the country, one must recognise that significant challenges are being met.<\/p><p>  In the value for money report on and policy review of disability services, we must protect and support organisations such as the COPE Foundation that live within budget, provide extra services and, as the COPE Foundation does, facilitate and cater for people with disabilities, be they early school leavers or people involved in crisis situations.  The COPE Foundation is an example of an organisation that has seen no closures, no changes, no charges and no deficits.  It must be looked after, as it is the benchmark for value for money, good management and providing for families and service users.<\/p><p>  In the minute that is left to me, I will refer to Our Lady of Good Counsel School in Ballincollig where families are concerned about changes to therapy interventions and the impact of same on the children who need them.  The people with whom I have spoken would like to know whether there will be a service and whether the changes will impact on their children severely.<\/p><p>  In this debate on disability, parents need to know that there will be a service, that access will not be a problem and that provision will be made to have their opinions listened to.  They must plan.  Disability is from the cradle to the grave and affects people who need all of our care.<\/p><p>  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on her work.  I also commend the programme for Government.  This issue is about people and delivering a continuum of care like the COPE Foundation's model, which has the person with a disability at the core.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500008#F00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1354706400,"counter":197,"content":"<p>None of the Deputies present would disagree on what our main objectives should be in terms of people with disabilities.  We all recall when Ireland hosted the Special Olympics in the mid-2000s.  It was an extraordinary time for our country.  Our then President, Mary McAleese, regularly refers to it as \"Ireland at its superb best\".  What made it particularly special was how communities opened up and took in athletes, their coaches and their families from across the world.  Some people viewed this as a great act of generosity on Ireland's part.  In many ways, it was, but we as a country were the ones who gained.  For the first time, the scales fell from our eyes and the event helped to challenge some widely held misconceptions about disability.  Importantly, it challenged prejudice.  It asked questions of the sort of paternalistic way that we as a society viewed people with disabilities.  We realised that there was nothing special about people with disabilities playing a full part in our community and that, far from being extraordinary, it should be considered to be the norm in any republic worth the name.  We came to focus on possibility, not disability, and on potential, not problems.<\/p><p>  However, do we as a State show true solidarity with all of our citizens, treat everyone as equals and view everyone as a valuable resource who can contribute to society or do we treat such people as an issue to be addressed?  As I stated initially, there will be little division over what we should be doing - we must do all in our power to assist, where required, with independent living for people with intellectual or physical disabilities.  Despite the awful economic circumstances, some progress has been made and continues to be made in this respect.<\/p><p>  That said, it would be remiss of me not to put on record my disgust at the way in which some people who have access to personal assistants were treated by the State just a few short months ago.  Clearly, this issue has been resolved, but I was horrified at the time, and not just at the attempt to cut off a lifeline that enabled people to play a full and active role in society and the economy.<\/p><p>A lack of understanding was expressed by some who should know better of the function of personal assistants.  It is not a variant of the home help service; it is much more than that.  While there will always be a requirement for institutional or group services, we have begun the journey of moving towards a more individualised and person-centred model which will avoid the inevitable pitfalls of the one-size-fits-all approach that has been endemic for a long time.  However, in cases where residential care is required, it must be of the highest standard and the standards should be monitored and maintained.  The HIQA, which has already proven its merit and shown its teeth on the monitoring of nursing homes, will have primary responsibility in this area.  It has already provided draft national standards to be finalised in the new year and backed up with legislation to which we all look forward.<\/p><p> When we came into government we pledged to consult with all interested parties to publish a plan for the national disability strategy.  That process is already under way.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, has already formed a strategy implementation group and convened a disability forum under the aegis of the National Disability Authority, NDA.  Ireland has made progress in how we treat our citizens with disabilities.  In fairness to my colleagues opposite, much of the progress was made on their watch and they must be commended for it.  It is our task now to continue that work and improve upon it.  We cannot allow any slippage at this juncture.  We must continue to move forward.  I believe that under the leadership of the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, we will do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500008#F00400","speaker":"1067","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354707000,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, for being present for the debate.  I commend Fianna F\u00e1il for tabling the motion because it affords Members on all sides of the House who are united in our desire to improve disability services with an opportunity to have an honest debate, which is important.  It greatly angers people with disabilities when the debate is reduced to one about social welfare cheques.  There is no doubt that social welfare payments such as domiciliary care allowance, disability allowance and carer&#8217;s allowance are vital to many people.  All too often the culture and viewpoint in this House and often in broader society is that the State writes the cheque, hands it to the person with a disability and it is a case of job done, social conscience eased; we have done our bit.  We must stop talking about people with disabilities as charity cases.  I accept the payments are vital as financial assistance is needed but it is a rights agenda and a programme of reform on which we must focus.<\/p><p><br \/>  I have a relative with special educational needs who was born and grew up in this country at a time of economic boom.  When Fianna F\u00e1il was in government disability services were well funded.  We also have that aim.  However, my relative could not access many of the services he needed.  People with disabilities will explain that even when the country was flush with money - when it was thrown around like confetti - there was still an issue with disability services.  The point is that we do not have the luxury of throwing more money at services, nor do people with disabilities want that to be done; they want us to listen and to pursue and progress a rights-based agenda that recognises that the needs of people with disabilities go above and beyond a weekly or monthly social welfare payment.<\/p><p><br \/>  On the need for a more joined-up approach, I welcome the fact that we have a Minister of State with responsibility for disability but I find it astonishing that the Minister of State is not assigned to some Departments that are relevant to the area of disability.  It is a whole-of-government issue that concerns the Departments of Education and Skills, Justice and Equality, Health, Children and Youth Affairs, Social Protection, Transport, Tourism and Sport, and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, yet the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, whoever he or she is &#8211; it is not a personal comment - all too often is not linked into the Departments as well as he or she should be.  That is a matter we must examine.  We could have all the strategies we want but when political decisions are made in particular in the area of access to education, jobs and enterprise, the Minister of State with responsibility for disability must be heard.<\/p><p><br \/>  Deputy Nash alluded to the disgraceful incident of people with disabilities feeling they had to camp overnight outside Government Buildings on the proposed changes to personal assistance.  That should never have arisen.  The matter was handled very badly.  There is no doubt that it was wrong, but what was interesting and the potential good that emerged is that when I was on my local radio talking to a man who had camped outside he said that he knew the <i>status quo<\/i> could not continue and that there would have to be changes and reform.  He said that the Government should talk to them and that they could show where the savings could be made.  That is the problem; there have been blunt cuts by all parties in government in recent years rather than an examination of how to reform the services.<\/p><p><br \/>  I welcome the policy review on the domiciliary care allowance, which at present is not fit-for-purpose.  Families with children on the autistic spectrum cannot access it.  That is not due to some inherent cruelty in the Department but because the application form does not work.  The criteria must be examined.  We must look at the transition from domiciliary care allowance, DCA, to disability allowance, DA.  For example, should a 16-year old with high functioning autism in full-time education have to sign off the DCA and go onto the DA or should they stay on the DCA until they leave the school system?  Is our SNA scheme fit-for-purpose?  It is about care needs.  One of the criteria in the job description for an SNA is cleaning the classroom and photocopying.  We must examine whether we need a teaching assistant and if we could learn from other countries in Europe.  I spoke to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, about that at the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection.<\/p><p><br \/>  We must also examine capacity legislation.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is working on the mental capacity legislation.  We must plan better for school leavers with intellectual disabilities.  The big rush that has been happening every summer in recent years &#8211; the funding situation has made it worse &#8211; to find places is unacceptable.  We must move to a system of personalised budgets and examine the type of place a person wants and give him or her the dignity to choose the place rather than assigning the money to a service provider and having people with disabilities and their family running around trying to find a place for the sake of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500009#G00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1354707000,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Michael Creed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500009#G00300","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speech","time":1354707000,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It is imperative that funding for the disability sector is on the basis of efficiency and transparency.  The 61 voluntary bodies delivering services for people with disabilities are represented by an umbrella organisation, the National Federation of Disability Bodies.  We have both efficient and inefficient bodies.  The Department has the information in-house as to who runs an efficient operation.  Some organisations have taken significant cuts in funding in recent years and are delivering services for more people, doing more for less, which is the mantra by which we must all abide today.  However, there are other organisations within the federation that are doing less with more than other organisations.  It is time that we got tough with the organisations that are inefficient and that do not tell us the salary levels that apply.  We must have such transparency in terms of funding and the unit cost in order that we can compare like with like for residential placements or day care.  The Department and the HSE have the information.<\/p><p>  I implore the Minister of State not to proceed further with the percentage across-the-board cut in funding which discriminates unfairly against certain organisations.  Deputies Moynihan and Collins know St. Joseph\u2019s Foundation in Charleville and the Cope Foundation in Cork are among the most efficient.  It would be unfair to cut their budgets when other organisations are hopelessly inefficient.

We must ensure that the best services, in the most cost-effective manner, are available to meet their needs.  Many communities through local fund-raising and Government help have built facilities within their communities ensuring that people with disabilities can, where possible, work and live among their own communities.  The Government must continue to encourage that approach, as it is the best, most inclusive and cost-effective option.<\/p><p>  Voluntary organisations, as Deputy Creed outlined, such as St Joseph's Foundation in Charleville and others throughout Cork, provide the best possible services.  We must ensure that the service providers manage their operations in a way that provides full transparency and in the most efficient and effective manner.  It must be our objective to ensure that the maximum amount of net funds go to the front line.  We live in very difficult economic times and there is no doubt that in the past many inefficiencies that are still embedded in the HSE sector were caused by a system that threw money at the problem rather than solving the problem and looking seriously at long-term sustainability.  The value for money and policy review of disability services which was published in July 2012 identified fundamental issues that must be addressed.  They focus on the way in which HSE-funded disability services are managed and operated.<\/p><p> The changes the Minister wishes to introduce are consistent with his overall approach to health policy.  This will be achieved by shifting choice and control from professionals and administrators to where it rightfully belongs, namely, the individual with a disability.  To achieve that there must be a co-ordinated approach from many Departments.  The Department of Education and Skills already spends 15% of its budget in support of children with special educational needs.  The new training agency, SOLAS, must pay special attention to encouraging people with disabilities to participate in its mainstream training options while continuing to offer specially tailored courses for people with disabilities.<\/p><p> The Department of Social Protection plays a necessary part in providing support services.  In addition to basic payment supports it provides an extensive range of income and work related supports for people with disabilities.  More work must be done with employers to encourage them to participate in these schemes, and the wage subsidy must be significant enough to ensure their participation.<\/p><p> Community employment schemes offer many people with disabilities an opportunity to work and partake in local community activities. Local authorities must be more proactive in providing suitable housing that would allow people with disabilities the dignity of independent living.  All these approaches from different providers must be overseen and co-ordinated to produce the most inclusive and efficient results at local level.<\/p><p> Some service providers such as St. Joseph's in Charleville are lean, efficient and deliver services far beyond the amount of funding they receive.  Those organisations cannot be subjected to across the board cuts such as those affecting State run facilities.<\/p><p> We must examine also the new approach to the way we deliver multidisciplinary services to special needs children between the ages of five and 18.  That greatly worries me.  We have a duty to evaluate and ensure that there will not be a negative impact on these children.  The value of the relationship between a therapist and an intellectually challenged child or young adult is essential and we must ensure that is not diluted.<\/p><p> I wish to refer briefly to cystic fibrosis and what happened in St. Vincent's Hospital last week and this week which was a perfect example of the intention being good but the delivery not happening on the ground.  It is a subject very close to my heart as Members will know I have a daughter with cystic fibrosis.  Thirty-four beds were built for isolation for cystic fibrosis patients.  Twenty of those beds were dedicated full-time to cystic fibrosis patients and 14 were to be prioritised.  I do not understand the reason the special delivery unit in the Health Service Executive when we know that people with cystic fibrosis suffer greatly at this time of the year when infection is at its highest, could not have allocated the beds to be isolated for this time of year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500009#G00700","speaker":"988","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354707600,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kelleher for bringing forward the motion.  I wish to be associated with the statement by Deputy Collins on cystic fibrosis.  This has been a problem for a long time yet we do appear to be able to address it to facilitate those who suffer from that disease.  Many years ago I saw the problems faced by a next door neighbour of mine who had the disease.  At that time we appeared to be on the point of dealing with it but it did not happen, and we are in the same place now in that regard.  Something must be done because we cannot have patients going into hospitals unless they are put in isolation units etc.  I am not an expert on the disease but I am aware of the suffering of families because of the problems not being addressed.  I ask the Minister to outline the position on that in his reply because it must be addressed.<\/p><p>  Regarding the national issue, we have had numerous representations from the various organisations on cuts to services.  Those organisations are at the coalface in terms of trying to keep the services going but it is not feasible to keep going back to them in respect of cuts because they cannot continue to offer the services if we continue to cut their funding.  Deputy Creed spoke about the possibility of some not pulling their weight in that regard but everyone I know is pulling their weight.  I refer to KARE, in my constituency.  I have spoken to the chief executive officer of KARE, Christy Lynch, on many occasions.  I visited Moore Abbey in recent weeks also.  The services those people provide on a daily basis are unbelievable.  They go above and beyond the call of duty in many instances and work continuously to try to meet the challenges they face.  We have groups that are supportive of those associations which try to raise funding day in, day out to maintain the services.  We must realise that we cannot put any more pressure upon that system.<\/p><p>  I ask the Minister of State to outline the position in regard to thalidomide.  From minutes and documentation I have seen I am aware that is an issue on which decisions are awaited but as is the case with cystic fibrosis we cannot continue to wait for decisions to be made because the unfortunate people who suffered that tragedy many years ago are getting old.  They are unable to provide for themselves.  No one is providing for them because of the need for special facilities in their homes.  I visited a house in which the person requires special facilities but there is no one to give that to them.  There is no mechanism available to them yet we are waiting on decisions to be made.  We must move on these issues and work with the two organisations to try to bring the issue to a conclusion and give direction in that regard.  There is little use in waiting on the results of court cases because unfortunately many of these people could die in that period.  We must face up to the challenge of working with these people to try to get a positive and a sympathetic solution for them.<\/p><p>  The value for money and policy review states that choice and control will be transferred from professionals and administrators to individuals with a disability and their families.  That is a dangerous move.  I can envisage people with a disability being isolated because when the red tape starts to come in it will be said that they are now in control of their own destiny.  That is not a positive move in regard to respecting the rights of those with disabilities to have equality in the way they live their lives.  I ask that this aspect of the value for money and policy review be revisited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500010#H00200","speaker":"950"},{"type":"speech","time":1354707600,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I listened to the debate this morning and yesterday and I would be right in saying that in principle all Members elected to this House would support the view that disability services should be adequately funded.

It is important also that the 3.7% reduction indicated in the report is offset by savings.

As Deputy Kelleher said last night, it is about holding the line and the line is in the programme for Government.  It is very important.<\/p><p>  We propose that disability services be ring-fenced from any cut.  It is a good starting point.  As a Deputy from the west of Ireland, I met with organisations such as the Brothers of Charity, Western Care Mayo, which looks after Mayo particularly, and Ability West.  The Brothers of Charity have been to the fore in helping families affected by the cuts to disability services.  There is great benefit to people in the care of the Brothers of Charity.  I received a letter from a mother who talked about her son, who is making a constructive contribution to society and will only improve with continued support.  She praises what the Brothers of Charity are doing but she also makes the point that, if there is a withdrawal of funding, it could result in her son regressing.  In the past, this has led to the intervention of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, the courts and other State agencies because there is no focus or outlet for him and others in this situation.  That mother and many who avail of the services of the Brothers of Charity are concerned at the proposed reduction in budgets.<\/p><p>  Ability West is an organisation that has provided services for 50 years to children and adults with intellectual disabilities in the west.  It was previously known as the Galway County Association for Mentally Handicapped Children.  It told me that this year there was a cutback of \u20ac836,454 in its budget.  It tried to do everything possible to minimise costs and maximise efficiencies but the CEO of the organisation said in a letter to parents that the organisation has now reached the point where the scope for savings from efficiencies that would not have an impact on services no longer exists.<\/p><p>  Other Deputies referred to the question of people leaving school.  Ability West responded to 33 people leaving school this year.  There were only 14 rehabilitative training places and the remaining 19 people had to be accommodated without any new additional funding being provided to the organisation.  In 2012, Ability West responded to several emergencies.  The organisation feels another cut in the 2013 budget would be a cut too far and would result in a reduction in essential services, such as respite, residential support, day services and transport.<\/p><p>  We are concerned at cutbacks to the budgets for personal assistants and special needs provision.  Children have lost special needs assistants and there is a major issue in respect of students leaving school.  I understand 700 people came out of school last year.  There is great concern about their future.  The same issue exists in terms of domiciliary care allowance, where 63% of applications were refused in the first half of the year.  Up to half of the applications for children with autism were refused.  Autism, in particular, has been highlighted by many parents, one of whom wrote to me about her son with autism and an intellectual disability.  In that case, the Brothers of Charity was a one-stop shop for the family.  I hope the Brothers of Charity and other organisations are not forgotten by the Government.  People are asking why the Government is taking funding from the Brothers of Charity and such organisations when it should be helping these organisations with their financial situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500011#J00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1354708200,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate and compliment Deputy Kelleher for tabling the motion at an appropriate time so that Members can speak in favour of citizens who suffer from a disability.  The well-worded motion recognises that over 600,000 people in Ireland live with a disability and recognises their deep concern that services they so eagerly need may be cut and further reduced.  The motion says it is unfair and unjust to cut the services and that we note the pledges in the programme for Government, which was signed over 18 months ago with full knowledge of the financial constraints of the economy.  The programme for Government promises to ensure the quality of life of people with disabilities is enhanced and that the resources allocated reach the people who need them.  It also refers to facilitating people with disabilities in achieving a greater level of participation in employment, training and education.  We call on the Government to honour its commitments, made a relatively short time ago, in the programme for Government in advance of budget 2013.  The choices the Government makes will help to define us as a country and say much about us as a society.  It will say a lot about this society if Government backbenchers stand up to the mark and protect the most vulnerable in society.  Last week, on Molesworth Street, thousands of people who suffer from disabilities and their family members came out to show their grave anxiety and concern about the potential for cuts to the service.<\/p><p>  Last year, this area had a reduction of 3.7%.  Of that, 1.7% was to be made in frontline spending and 2% was to be targeted at the administration side.  That is not the case and it is disingenuous of the Minister to say the 2% out of 3.7% was administrative.  One size does not fit all and while many service providers could achieve greater efficiencies and could be leaner, that is not always the case.  After last year's budget, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, met a deputation from an example of such an organisation in my constituency, St. Christopher's Services.<\/p><p>If there had been a 3.7% reduction, as the Minister intended, the 1.7% reduction in front-line services would have been \u20ac135,000 and the 2% cut in administration costs would have been \u20ac13,000.  This would have meant an overall reduction of \u20ac148,000.  In fact, the reduction to St. Christopher's last year was \u20ac380,000.  St. Christopher's, like many other service providers, has an extremely efficient and lean administrative function.  One cannot simply say a cut of 2% off everything will achieve a specified target.  A 2% reduction in this area would have meant a reduction of \u20ac13,000.  The deputation from St. Christopher's told the Minister they could have lived with that but they have not been able to live with the reduction of \u20ac380,000.  Since 1 July, respite care has seen a reduction of 28%.  Respite of seven days has been reduced to five nights.  Staff are sent home for three additional days of unpaid leave in the year.  All community homes serviced by St. Christopher's now close down on every bank holiday and patients are discharged. This is because of the reductions of last year.<\/p><p> Representatives of St. Christopher's say they could have lived with the previous cuts.  I acknowledge Fianna F\u00e1il's part in the previous Government that inflicted cuts, but a time must come when we say enough is enough.  This sector of society cannot take further cuts.  St. Christopher's is a real-life example of a service that has provided invaluable service to the community of Longford-Westmeath for decades.<\/p><p> Severe pressure has been put on people with disabilities who are living independently and away from residential care or community housing.  Cuts to home help hours in recent weeks and months are having a huge negative effect.  The HSE is playing on people's good nature.  If it takes 45 minutes or an hour to get a person out of bed, see to their personal hygiene and do whatever needs to be done, no home help will walk away when the allocated 30 minutes are up.  If the allocated time has been reduced from one hour to 30 minutes, a home help will not walk away and leave the person to fend for his or herself.  The HSE is playing on the good nature of thousands of home helps.  Apart from being morally wrong, it does not make economic sense to cut home help hours.  Everyone knows it makes more economic sense to keep people living independently in their homes than to relocate them to community facilities or nursing homes.<\/p><p> Where exactly does the Government stand on its commitment to mental health?  Last year, the Government committed \u20ac35 million annually for the three years from 2012 to 2014.  A number of weeks ago, I raised this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, during the Topical Issue debate.  I asked her about the additional personnel to be employed in community health and I was told they would be employed in December.  The additional staff will be employed in December so that the cost will come out of the 2013 and not the 2012 budget.  Does the commitment made last year in the House stand today?  Will \u20ac35 million of the HSE budget be ring-fenced for mental health this year, next year and in 2014?<\/p><p> I raise the issue of carers, although they are not the direct responsibility of the Department of Health.  Carers are the only people who work for their social welfare payment.  The manner and length of the delays they experience when they apply for the carer's allowance is unacceptable.  A carer can wait for up to six or eight months to have an application processed.  Many of them are refused the allowance and it can take a further ten months for an appeal hearing.  That is not fair to people who are working for the income they receive.  No one would be expected to work for eight months in a job before being paid.  This is unfair.<\/p><p> Deputy Maloney said, rightly, we will all have an opportunity later today to speak out for the most vulnerable in society.  Fianna F\u00e1il produced its alternative budget, A Fairer Way to Recovery, two weeks ago.  Our aim is to protect the most vulnerable in society.  The Government will receive support from all sides of the House if today's budget protects the disability sector and the most vulnerable in society and is progressive, unlike last year's budget which was one of the most regressive of recent times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500011#J00300","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354708800,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Like previous speakers from my party, I welcome Deputy Kelleher's initiative in this regard.  It is pertinent that it be debated on this day when the Government is charged with the responsibility of charting the financial course of the Government for the forthcoming year.  As Deputy Troy has said, our party and organisation was adamant, in framing alternative proposals, to ring-fence the two areas of health and disability and education.  Those are the two sectors that have been most let down in recent times.<\/p><p>  A significant percentage of people with disabilities incur additional costs for heating, clothing and day-to-day living expenses above and beyond those experienced by people without a disability.  This has been estimated to be as much as one third of average weekly income.  The extra cost of disability can affect a person's ability to participate in life-enhancing opportunities and reduce their standard of living, sometimes below the socially acceptable minimum standard.  If people with disability are to be equal, the extra cost generated by their disability should not be borne by them alone but by society at large which should act to level the playing field by covering those extraordinary costs.<\/p><p>  To date, disability payments and the secondary benefits associated with them have evolved over time to respond to the specific needs of people with disabilities.  These form a wide range of packages and measures to redress the costs of disability as well as poverty and unemployment traps caused by particular disabilities.  We in Fianna F\u00e1il are proud of our record over the past ten to 15 years in this regard and we apologise to no one for the advances we made, particularly in the provision of a budget specifically designated for the disability sector.  We acknowledge that people with disabilities are worried about being able to live independently.<\/p><p>  How the Government sees fit to treat people with disabilities was exemplified in the proposal to cut the personal assistance budget.  That would have caused real hardship and, thankfully, the Government was forced to do a U-turn in this regard.  Disability is a social justice priority for my party, and we believe the disability strategy should be sustained and implemented.<\/p><p>Fine Gael and the Labour Party made specific pre-election promises on the retention and improvement of services for the disability sector.  They made these pledges when the nature and scale of the required fiscal adjustments were already clear.  We will do our utmost to ensure the Government parties adhere in some way to those promises, although if what they have been doing in the recent past is anything to go by, we cannot have much hope.  It is clear to us that there is a need to bring forward a motion like this one.<\/p><p><br \/> The Government parties' deliberations have been taking place at Cabinet over the last week.  I listened to Deputy Keaveney this morning on radio saying he could not give an absolute commitment to any budget brought forward by his Government until he saw it in its entirety.  I argue that it would have been more beneficial to him and his party colleagues and those in Fine Gael to seek a commitment from the Cabinet that it would ring-fence, as we have done in our proposals, spending on the health and disability sector and education.  The <i>Sunday Independent <\/i>had a verbatim account of discussions at the Labour Party meeting last week.  That article quoted the Minister for Education and Skills as looking for heads, as he has done in the past.  Based on the apologies he has made in this House since entering office, the first thing he should check every morning is that his own head is still on his shoulders.<\/p><p><br \/> The Government in preparing last year's budget, particularly for the Department of Health, had a false budget that had to be corrected to the tune of &#8364;400 million here last night.  That brought about severe hardship for home helps.  Some weeks ago when the Taoiseach was questioned about this, he said no one would be left without home help based upon need, and that Members should submit to him details of specific instances in their constituencies.  I have informed the Taoiseach in writing of several cases in that regard and I am awaiting his response.<\/p><p><br \/> Can the Taoiseach live up to the commitment he gave, not only in that instance but on the preparation of today's budget?  Can he look after the least well off in our society, those who do not have the backing of ICTU and the ITGWU, the INO and the large unions that represent other sectors in society?  They are represented by their families, as we saw during their protest last week.  They are the ones who have been left to carry the can and they are the ones who deserve the support because they are the only ones getting the message to us to give to the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500012#K00200","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354709400,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kelleher for tabling this motion.  It is a vital motion on one of the most important days of the year, as we face the budget.  We want to highlight the issue of disability and ensure no further cuts are inflicted on the sector.  Everyone who has spoken has mentioned their care for and concern about people with disabilities.  As we talk about the person with the disability, often the language we use forgets those people are individuals.  We want to make sure there are no cuts in respite care for them, and that no services are cut.<\/p><p>  Every Deputy has been visited by families who have told how respite has been withdrawn, particularly during the summer and during the holiday period we face now.  Families of people with disabilities are at breaking point, trying to cope as best they can.<\/p><p>  Funding was increased dramatically over recent years, particularly going back to 1997, when the first envelop of money was provided under Brian Cowen when he was Minister for Health.  There was a sense we were streamlining a mechanism to ensure funding went straight to the people with disabilities.  Services, however, have grown and the services that have grown up are legitimately required; there are no frills here, they are genuinely necessary.<\/p><p>  Families are still coming to me because of the cuts in the last budget.  Some of the service providers took those cuts on the chin and absorbed them into their systems but they will not be able to do that again.  There is a constant line that there are inefficiencies in the system but if the Minister has evidence from the review published this year that there are inefficiencies in some of the systems, he should go after those and pinpoint them so savings can be made.  There are service providers, however, who are working on a very tight budget and there is a huge amount of voluntary fund raising done to provide those services on an ongoing basis.  Those involved have pared back their activities to provide the most efficient services possible.<\/p><p>  We must all accept this is one of the most important sectors of society, made up of the most vulnerable.  Those with disabilities and their families are hugely constrained but there have been huge advances in therapies that have had a positive impact on people.

This Fianna Fail Private Members' motion gives the opportunity to all Members in this House to give a clear commitment to provide the necessary support and services to enable people with disabilities to fulfil their potential.<\/p><p>  Over the past few months in particular, many people with disabilities and their families have expressed real concerns about the supports that will be available to them.  There is a deep concern among those people that services affecting them may be cut or reduced further.  To reduce services to people with disabilities will be totally unfair and unjust.  Not alone did Fine Gael and the Labour Party make pre-election promises but they made commitments in the programme for Government that are not being honoured.  In this motion we call on the Government to provide the appropriate funding and services necessary to honour its commitments to people with disabilities.<\/p><p>It is very clear that there has been a real impact on the quality of life for so many individuals owing to cuts already implemented and people with disabilities are very concerned about not being able to live independently.  The decision by the Government last August to announce a reduction in the personal assistant budget caused untold anxiety to many individuals and its partial reversal was necessary.<\/p><p> Recently on Leaders' Questions, Deputy Martin raised the very important issue of young people with disabilities leaving school and having no guarantee of a placement at the end of the year.  We must ensure that young adults with an intellectual disability or autism leaving school, who need further support from the disability services, have ready access to a suitable education or training centre.  The only children leaving school who are not guaranteed a further education placement are young people with a disability, which is unacceptable.<\/p><p> Over the years I have had the great privilege of attending the graduation ceremonies at training centres such as Drumlin House in Cootehill, and the value of the programmes and training provided in such centres is clearly evident.  Not alone do those young people get very valuable training but in most instances they also get work experience, which often opens up a whole new world for them.  The employers enabling such placements deserve our commendation.  The value of such training at a very modest cost is clearly evident from the participation of the trainees and that sense of achievement is also shared by their family members.  We all know many such young people who continue to pursue further studies or go into full-time gainful employment.  Despite the budgetary challenges critical services such as these must be maintained and no child or young adult should be denied the appropriate education and training.<\/p><p> As we know, home help is provided mainly for older members of society but a large number of people of all ages who have a disability depend on home support.  Over the past 12 to 15 years home help support has become an integral and important part of our overall health and social services provision.  There has been a recent unwelcome trend towards privatising those services.  Individuals delivering those services have done an excellent job over the years and in many instances the carers gave extra and help and time to the person under their care.  When speaking to people availing of home help they will inevitably refer to the bond built up with their carer.  That care, commitment and additional unremunerated help cannot be quantified in monetary terms or in terms of reducing attendance in nursing homes and less reliance on the health services.<\/p><p> Home support workers provide an excellent service but in many instances they are being allocated particularly short time periods to care for their patients.  The increasing trend to have services provided through care companies will result in their workers spending more time travelling rather than caring.  The system of delivering home help through the appointment of an individual, who was generally from the local community, worked well.  I am not convinced of the merits of total provision through large-scale providers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500013#L00300","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354710000,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the amendment to the motion and to confirm to the House the extent of the Government's commitment to people with disabilities.  It is a pillar of Government policy that people with disabilities should be empowered by policy and programmes to participate meaningfully as citizens in Irish society.  The national disability strategy is driven by this basic, but fundamental, objective.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, outlined in her speech last night the extent to which the strategy is being revitalised, with a new implementation group which she is personally chairing, to draw up implementable actions across a range of Departments.  These actions will, when finalised, range across all areas of concern to people with disabilities in their daily lives, not just the extensive supports and services which are provided by the health sector to which so many Members made reference, but also in the areas of access and housing, transport, training and employment opportunities and other areas.<\/p><p>  The disability forum, convened under the national disability strategy, was vital in informing the implementation group of the needs and preferences of people with disabilities, their carers and family members.  The first meeting of the forum on 19 June this year was attended by more than 300 people and a report on the views expressed will be published shortly, and considered for actions in the implementation plan for the national disability strategy.  I am confident that the strategy will be significantly re-energised and re-focussed under the guidance of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.<\/p><p>  The Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, published by the Department of Health in July, has also confirmed what people with disabilities have been telling us for some time.  Public consultation processes were carried out by the expert reference group which reviewed disability policy under the review.  In response, people with disabilities and their families told us what they thought of the services currently provided under the HSE disability service programme, and what they wanted for the future.  Not surprisingly, they told us they did not want more of the same and they told us they want to do normal things in normal places, in other words to participate in society on the same basis as every other citizen.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has stated this on many occasions.  It is clear that our services, as currently configured, are not yet fully geared to meet the everyday needs of people with disabilities themselves as articulated by them.  As a first step, my Department and the Health Service Executive will be working closely to ensure that the value for money review is implemented, with these aims in mind.<\/p><p>  I commend the major commitment of the many people in the Health Service Executive, and in the HSE-funded agencies, who are delivering services to people with disabilities every day and are doing so in a very challenging financial environment.  However, I know they also share the Government's view that we need to change our approach to one that is geared towards the needs of people with disabilities in the first instance.  This is not always the case at present and the value for money review points out that more efficient and effective ways can be found to deliver services which will be more accountable and more directly relevant, and which can make better use of the available resources as mentioned by many Members during the course of this debate.  In particular, the individualised model of supports recommended in the review will, as it is developed further in the coming years, contribute to the greater participation of people with disabilities in the social, economic and cultural lives of their communities, and provide them with access to a range of personal social supports and services to enhance their quality of life and well-being.<\/p><p>  I again point to the many areas across Government where services are provided to people with disabilities, not just in the health sector but also through extensive education and training supports.  New developments in the area of housing and employment activation show that the Government is pushing out the boundaries even further to enable people to participate more fully in society.  The funding provided to programmes outside of the health budget, in addition to the annual \u20ac1.4 billion investment by the HSE, enables people with disabilities to avail of an extensive range of financial supports and services.  The challenge for all of us will be to ensure that this funding is used to better effect in the future and that it is directed to the needs of the individual in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500014#M00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1354710000,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kelleher for affording us the opportunity over the past two days to discuss this important issue.  Disability is not just on budget day, but it is all year round.  It is a topic that we should discuss on a more regular basis, particularly in order to pursue some of the initiatives the Minister of State just mentioned.<\/p><p>  Many of my colleagues have spoken about cuts to services and I also have similar stories.  I wish to focus in particular on the delays in the domiciliary care allowance, the hurdles people need to overcome in applying for that allowance, the 63% refusal rate in the first six months of this year and the fact that people who are in very distressing situations with their children are being forced to provide information which in many cases is already available to those making the decisions.  There seems to be no recognition that of all the social welfare allowances this is one provided to people in a very difficult situation in dealing with their children.  We have spoken to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, on numerous occasions but our requests seem to be falling on deaf ears.  Perhaps the Minister of State might bring to her attention that new arrangements need to be put in place for dealing with domiciliary care in order to speed up the decision time, considering the very difficult home situations of those applying for it.<\/p><p>The very reason the allowance was introduced in the first place should also be considered in the way decisions are dealt with.<\/p><p> I will raise a number of local issues.  I have the privilege of coming from County Mayo which has been served by the Western Care Association for over 40 years.  This is a voluntary organisation established by parents in Castlebar that now has a county-wide remit to provide education and enterprise services.  It does an excellent job alongside the HSE but has suffered significant cuts in recent years.  It managed to maintain very strong service provision and an excellent range of enterprise supports until this year.  This was the first year when it was not in a position to give training opportunities to those coming through the education process by means of its excellent education centre because the places and funding were not there.<\/p><p> We agree with the Minister of State when he talks about the wish of families that disabled people be treated equally, but when they are not given the opportunities to proceed from second level to third level education, the wheels come off that ambition.  In respect of funding, let us start ring-fencing training places that may prepare people for work and funding for organisations like the Irish Association of Supported Employment which provide enterprise, job shadowing and other work initiatives for people with disabilities.  If they have that training, many of them will be able to play their full part.  Some cannot but those who can will be able to play a full and independent part in society.  It is all very well to talk about independent living and dealing with the housing and home care requirement but a job requirement is part of the process and seems to be lost.<\/p><p> The Minister of State referred to a cross-Government approach and different Departments being involved.  The difficulty is that this is still happening on a silo-by-silo basis.  There is very little co-ordination in this approach.  The housing policies of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government do not necessarily relate to policies of the Department of Education and Science, while the latter Department's policies on ABA and autism education are often not what the Department of Health think they should be.  We need somebody to bring all of Government together to have one approach that assists people to live independently where they can and gives support to those who cannot.  We need a cross-Government approach to fast track this instead of forcing people to jump through so many hoops to get basic requirements and entitlements.<\/p><p> I do not doubt the commitment of the Minister of State nor that of the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, equality and mental health.  The difficulty in the Department is at the top - a difficulty pointed out by the Minister for Education and Science and by many of the Minister of State's colleagues.  The commitment of both Ministers of State is getting lost and both of them, especially the Minister of State with responsibility for this area, need to stand up and be very strong for the rights of those they serve in their areas of responsibility.<\/p><p> The Department of Social Protection last year reduced the additional weekly payment that people on disability benefit received for participating in the community employment scheme.  This scheme allows them to play a part in the community and gain skills that it is hoped will allow them to move into employment.  The additional payment is just \u20ac20 per week on top of the disability benefit compared with JobBridge which pays around an additional \u20ac50 per week.  Why can we not bring it up to the JobBridge level and treat them equally as if they were in JobBridge?  There are extra expenses and difficulties involved for those with disabilities.  That is a very solid and practical initiative the Government can undertake at minimal expense to send a signal that we are serious about giving an independent future to people who are looking for it.  Enterprise Ireland recently launched a range of schemes to encourage different sectors to start up businesses and move into different sectors.  An initiative targeting women in business is one example.  We should look at an offering something similar to disabled people who want to set up their own businesses.  Many organisations have excellent enterprises.  The Western Care Association runs Abbey Enterprises which provides services to local multinationals.  Many other disabled people have a vision of setting up a business, have the skills to do so and could do so with financial and practical support from Enterprise Ireland or the new local enterprise offices.  This would also facilitate independent living.<\/p><p> On a non-budget basis, the Government introduced the heads of the mental capacity Bill to the Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  The committee considered the heads of the Bill and its first recommendation, which was agreed on an all-party basis, was that it should be called the capacity Bill.  The committee dealt with the heads of the Bill last April and I have not seen it in the House since.  That Bill would bring legislation in the area of disability into the 21st century, and bringing it before the House early next year should be a priority.  That would spark the debate about whether we should opt for fully rights-based legislation and the advantages and disadvantages of doing so.  People do not fully understand that.  If we can use the mental capacity Bill to kick off that discussion, it will do some service not just to the country but ourselves as legislators.  I hope we would get the commitment to introduce the Bill early in the next session.<\/p><p> The difficulty for the Government does not lie in manifesto commitments.  It made these commitments in full knowledge of the difficulties this country faced.  The difficulty lies in the commitments it made in the programme for Government, which were made with full briefing from the Central Bank and the European Central Bank.  The Government made various commitments in this area in the programme for Government on which it has attempted to row back this year.  It forced people to sleep on the streets to prevent their personal assistant service being cut.  Non-budget issues such the mental capacity Bill are being long-fingered.  We need a sense of urgency within the Government on the disability issue.  If it does that, it has the capacity to deliver much in a relatively short period.  The Government's approach could encompass all of Government instead of the disparity and silo-by-silo basis it uses.  If it could do that, it would begin to make a difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500014#M00300","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354710600,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I welcome the contributions from everybody in the House regarding the motion I placed before the D\u00e1il.  I have only five minutes in which to sum up and there is no point in thinking that if I make a very fine and elegant speech, I will convince Members opposite to come over to our side and support our motion.  I will dwell on a few important issues that have been emphasised by all sides of the House.<\/p><p>  I am fully aware of the constraints under which the Government is working.  I understand the pressures it is under in terms of budgets, but the key issue with regard to funding for people with intellectual and physical disabilities is the arbitrary value for money review that has been carried out.  This root and branch review of services and supports for people in either mainstream education, specialist schools or independent living is too arbitrary.  While the Government is trying to extract as many efficiencies as possible, which is the obvious and correct thing to do, those who are most efficient are being penalised to the detriment of the service providers.  That is clearly what is happening.<\/p><p>  The point I am making in a non-partisan and non-political way is that the Government needs to look at the individual service providers providing care in the community, in specialist schools or for independent living.  Those providers who have reached the efficiency levels the Government assumes are acceptable should no longer be penalised and should be allowed to get on with what they are doing, namely, providing care and facilities for people who need and want them.  We should focus on this issue over the next few minutes.  Everybody has consistently pointed out that there are problems with the Department of Social Protection assessing the domiciliary care allowance, carer's allowance and other social welfare payments.  The problem is that the rhetoric does not fit with what is happening on the ground.  It is not a criticism of the Minister of State or anybody else but a criticism of the system, which we must address.<\/p><p>  The same issue arose with home helps.  We were told that everybody would be independently assessed and that there would be no cuts in services.  Despite this, there was not a Deputy in the House who did not find people who had been badly treated in terms of the system withdrawing supports.  This is beginning to happen in the area of disability.  The Government has carried out the value for money review, has the figures in the Departments and knows the service providers who are carrying out a very efficient system and delivering an excellent service.  They are all over the country.  I agree that some could do more but there are many who can do no more because they are not being given the resources.<\/p><p>These service providers have wonderful facilities and in some cases they are almost family to the users, particularly those with disabilities whose parents are very elderly.  They are moving on.  Individuals see these service providers as their home and family.  This arbitrary cut is forcing the service providers to make very difficult decisions.  A key issue is that they are being obligated to absorb the incremental increases agreed under the Croke Park agreement.  A very efficient organisation which has cut itself to the bone is being asked to fund increments from its own savings.  There is only one place this will come from, and that is the service itself.  It will come from diminishing the quality of life for people with physical and intellectual disabilities.<\/p><p> I do not expect the Minister to run in the door to announce extra funding will be provided, but in the name of God will the Government do something about removing the arbitrary assessment and examine the individual organisations doing a wonderful job day in day out throughout the country?  If an organisation is inefficient then deal with it, but do not make everybody pay.<\/p><p> To quote Samuel Johnson, &quot;Sir, I have found you an argument; but I am not obliged to find you an understanding&quot;, and to paraphrase him, I have found the Government an argument and I am providing it with a solution.  I urge the Minister of State to come up with a mechanism to address all of these issues.  It would certainly satisfy the service providers and, more importantly, the people who need and use the services on a daily basis.  I commend the motion and I urge the Minister of State to take on board this suggestion alone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500015#N00200","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1354711200,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 87; N\u00edl, 43.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Emmet Stagg and Paul Kehoe; N\u00edl, Deputies Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh and Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Feargha\u00edl.<\/p><p>Amendment declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500016#O00200","aye":["1062","980","974","1079","989","1029","1030","1042","975","1092","988","1031","972","1041","1093","1087","1099","986","1036","994","1091","968","1075","1007","1011","1103","957","1078","1014","1085","1068","1055","1019","1051","1076","995","1106","958","1089","949","973","1033","1012","1043","1098","1088","1021","1110","1053","990","982","1023","996","1064","1000","997","1082","977","1038","1027","1026","1004","1070","985","1034","1067","1056","1045","1018","1060","1058","1073","971","964","966","1074","1013","979","1048","961","978","1104","1010","1095","950","1109","1024"],"nay":["1003","1020","1096","1071","1032","1083","1101","1037","1015","959","1022","1047","1108","960","1049","983","1040","998","999","1008","1017","1090","981","992","987","1052","1177","1175","969","1044","1054","1028","984","1059","1005","1001","953","1178","970","1102","1080","1065","956"]},{"type":"vote","time":1354711800,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the motion, as amended, be agreed to.\"<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 86; N\u00edl, 41.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Emmet Stagg and Joe Carey; N\u00edl, Deputies Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh and Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Feargha\u00edl.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500017#P00050","aye":["1062","980","974","1079","989","1029","1030","1042","975","1092","988","1031","972","1041","1093","1087","1099","986","1036","994","1091","968","1075","1007","1011","1103","957","1078","1014","1068","1055","1019","1051","1076","995","1106","958","1089","949","973","1033","1012","1043","1088","1021","1110","1053","990","982","1023","996","1064","997","1082","977","1038","1027","1026","1004","1070","985","1034","1067","1056","1045","1018","1060","1058","1069","1073","971","1081","964","966","1074","1013","979","1048","961","978","1104","1010","1095","950","1109","1024"],"nay":["1003","1020","1096","1071","1032","1083","1101","1037","1015","959","1022","1047","1108","960","1049","983","1040","998","999","1008","1017","1090","981","992","987","1052","1175","969","1044","1054","1005","1028","984","1001","953","1178","970","1102","1080","1065","956"]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2012: Message from Select Sub-Committee","time":1354712100,"counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500018#Q00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1354712100,"counter":225,"content":"<p>The Select Sub-Committee on Social Protection has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimate for Public Services for the year ending 31 December 2012 - Vote 37.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500018#Q00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354712100,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 2.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Financial Resolutions 2013 - Budget Statement 2013","time":1354712400,"counter":228,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500019#R00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1354712400,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Before calling on the Minister, I understand there is a slight delay in the book being circulated but the speech is available.

In the second half of this year, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, has raised more than \u20ac7 billion in the markets.  The Bank of Ireland, ESB, Bord G\u00e1is and AIB all have raised funds for the first time in years.  This year, the IDA has announced 84 projects set to create 8,650 jobs.  The economy grew last year and will grow again this year and next year.  There are manifest signs that the country is emerging from the worst of the crisis and that the efforts of the Irish people, despite the hardship, are leading to success.<\/p><p>  There are different measures of success, however, and in taking stock of where we are, I would like to examine them.  The first measure of success is whether the bailout programme is being fulfilled.  It is, as Ireland has fulfilled 160 separate conditions of the programme and has now drawn down more than 80% of the low-cost money available under the programme.  We also have made the fiscal, structural and legislative changes that provide the basis for a renewed economy that will lead to job creation.  If fulfilling the programme was the only measure of success, then we are successful, but, of course, that is not the only measure.  We must go back to the markets at sustainable interest rates.  The NTMA has secured access for some of our funding this year but we must be certain of market access as needed.  If a return to the markets is the measure of success, I am confident we will achieve this objective but as yet it is work in progress.<\/p><p>  For the Government, however, and for the Deputies and Senators who support it, the real measure of success is a growing and developing economy, which provides a fulfilling life and decent standard of living for all our people and a country in which everyone who wants to work has a job and where our public services are unsurpassed in their quality.  On the basis of this measure of success, despite the progress made, the country still has a long way to go but the Government is prepared to travel that distance.  Today, on budget day, the Government recommits itself to this task and political friends and foes alike should be under no illusion; the Government will not resile from the task in hand.  It will not dither or procrastinate but will drive forward to lead this country out of the despair and despondency and lack of self worth in which we found ourselves in March 2011.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500019#R00500","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354712400,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500019#R00600","nonspeaker":"Deputies"},{"type":"speech","time":1354712400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>The Government will continue to fulfil the conditions of the bailout programme, it will carefully plan full market return, it will build on the strong sectors of the economy and repair the weak sectors until they are strong again, it will grow the economy and create the jobs for which so many out of work and so many young people yearn.<\/p><p><br \/>  Last year, in the budget, despite the lack of resources I took a series of initiatives to grow different sectors of the economy in farming and agrifood, in foreign direct investment, in the export trade, in the tourism industry, in financial services and in the property market and these initiatives have helped to grow and create jobs in these sectors.<\/p><p><i>SMEs<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  This year I will follow a similar strategy but my emphasis will be on small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  Our large exporting sector, which includes both multinationals and growing indigenous companies, is forging ahead and delivering solid export growth and a strong balance of payments surplus.  I am aware, however, that the operating environment in the domestic economy remains difficult, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.  To give this critical sector a helping hand, I am bringing forward a ten-point tax reform plan.  This plan includes measures that will make a real difference for the SME sectors such as reforming the three-year corporation tax relief for start-up companies to allow unused credits to be carried forward.  This will help SMEs and start-ups navigate their early years.  It also includes increasing the cash receipts basis threshold for VAT from &#8364;1 million to &#8364;1.25 million and amending the close company surcharge <i>de minimis<\/i> level.  Both of these measures will improve cash flow for SMEs.  The plan also includes amending the research and development tax credit by doubling the initial spend eligible for the credit from &#8364;100,000 to &#8364;200,000 to encourage innovation and business expansion and extending the foreign earnings deduction for work-related travel to certain countries beyond the BRICS, which will support exports.  These measures will make a real difference to SMEs by assisting their cash position and supporting their creation of jobs.  I also will publish a public consultation paper on a micro-business tax today.<\/p><p><br \/>  Given the fragile state of the public finances, the individual measures are modest.  However I believe the combination of the measures will have a significant beneficial impact.  I also am pleased to announce an additional initiative that will support small businesses in all sectors of the economy.  Virtually all businesses in Ireland rely on cost-effective transport for their inputs and outputs.  This transport is provided by hauliers, the majority of whom own small businesses.  In order to assist the competitiveness of this key industry, I am introducing a rebate on diesel with effect from 1 July 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500019#R00700","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354712400,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500019#R00750","nonspeaker":"Deputies"},{"type":"speech","time":1354712400,"counter":235,"content":"<p>This initiative will be strictly policed so as to ensure that the beneficiaries are fully tax compliant.<\/p><p>  Work is being undertaken by senior officials in a number of Departments to finalise the PlusOne initiative, which is intended to encourage employers to hire individuals who are long-term unemployed.

New initiatives from the Government, such as the microfinance scheme and the loan guarantee scheme are now in place.  These schemes are complemented by additional credit funds such as those supported by the European Investment Bank, the Silicon Valley Bank and the European Investment Fund, which are targeted at the innovation sector.  To further assist SMEs in this area, I am announcing today a number of credit specific initiatives, including approval to the Credit Review Office to extend the team of available reviewers in order that SMEs seeking assistance from the Credit Review Office receive a considered and timely response to their application and the publication by the Credit Review Office of specific guidance for SMEs on accessing credit from banks.  Moreover, the National Pensions Reserve Fund also is developing a range of support funds to provide equity, finance and restructuring and recovery investment to the SME sector.  The funds are expected to range in size from \u20ac100 million to \u20ac400 million.<\/p><p>  SMEs are the lifeblood of the economy and will play a vital role in the recovery of employment growth in our country.<\/p><p>The newly constituted local enterprise offices will serve as an important first stop for small business<font color=\"#000080\">es<\/font>looking for advice and information on all available State supports.

Farming and the agrifood sector are critically important to our economy and both continue to perform strongly despite the difficult summer weather.  Following on from last year&#8217;s budget, which supported farm expansion and the transfer of land, I have included measures in the ten-point tax reform plan that will assist the farming sector.

Furthermore, as small businesses, many of the other reforms in the ten-point tax reform plan will benefit farming and the agrifood sectors.<\/p><p><br \/>  In order to improve farm efficiency and help achieve the targets in Food Harvest 2020, I am introducing a relief from capital gains tax arising on disposals of farm land for farm restructuring purposes.  This is a once-off relief which will apply in respect of transactions initiated in the period from the start of January 2013 to end-December 2015, subject to obtaining EU state aid approval.  These measures are designed to create additional jobs in farming and the agrifood sectors.<\/p><p><i>Film Industry <\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  This year, my Department carried out an economic impact assessment of the current film tax relief scheme, widely known as section 481.  In light of the report&#8217;s findings, which I have published today, and after consultation with the relevant Minister, Deputy Deenihan, and representatives of the film and TV industry in Ireland, I propose to extend the film tax relief scheme to 2020; reform the operation of the scheme by moving to a tax credit model in 2016 so as to ensure better value for taxpayers' money and eliminate the need for high income investors to provide the funding for the scheme; and enhance the scheme so as to make Ireland even more attractive for foreign film and TV productions.  These changes will rectify the anomaly by which investors received a disproportionate amount of the tax relief as opposed to the funds going to production.  These measures are designed to create additional jobs in the film industry.<\/p><p><i>Tourism Industry<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  The year 2013 is very important for the tourism industry.  Promotion of The Gathering has been under way for some time and reports indicate that it is striking a chord both at home and abroad.  It is an initiative that we should all support.  Due to the nature of the tourism sector, the supports I have announced already to assist the small and medium enterprise sector will apply to most of the businesses in the tourism industry.  In addition, the tourism industry is already benefitting from the second reduced rate of VAT of 9% that I introduced in the jobs initiative in May 2011.  I confirm that the VAT rate of the tourism industry will continue at 9% in 2013.<\/p><p><i>Property<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  In last year&#8217;s budget, I introduced certain measures to help stabilise the property market, which was one of the major constraints on economic growth.  This year has seen the first signs of stability in both the residential and commercial property markets in six years.  The residential market is showing increased activity due to the return of economic growth and the impact of the enhanced mortgage interest relief I introduced last year.  This measure will end on 31 December this year as I have set out on numerous occasions.  However, in order to maintain momentum in the domestic property market, I am providing an exemption from the new local property tax up to the end of 2016 for any new or previously unoccupied homes bought in that period and, in addition, purchases of any homes in 2013 by first-time buyers will also be exempt for the same period.  This exemption for three years from the local property tax will also apply to residences in unfinished estates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500020#S00400","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1354713000,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Big Phil is not even here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500020#S00500","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1354713000,"counter":253,"content":"<p>In the commercial market, the capital gains tax incentive that I announced in last year&#8217;s budget means that any property bought between now and the end of 2013 will be relieved from capital gains tax if held for at least seven years.  I am fully aware that regeneration is necessary in a number of our cities in order to ensure a balanced economic recovery.  To date regeneration schemes have failed to encourage private sector investment in the areas most in need so I will examine proposals for a targeted incentive in already identified regeneration areas.<\/p><p><i>Commercial Property and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS)<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  Initial indications are that the reduction last year of stamp duty from 6% to 2% for commercial property transactions has also helped bring stability to the commercial property sector.  Demand for high-quality large office spaces has strengthened in 2012.  In order to attract new investment, I will provide for the establishment of real estate investment trusts, REITs, which allow for investors to finance property investment in a risk diversified manner.<\/p><p><i>NAMA<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  The introduction of REITs may also assist NAMA in deleveraging its portfolio and allow it to bring more sustainable activity to both the commercial and residential property markets.  NAMA is already making &#8364;2 billion of funding available over the next four years to complete residential and commercial projects in Ireland.  This investment, which is already under way, with some &#8364;650 million of advances already approved, is expected to create significant employment in the region of 25,000 jobs in the construction sector and additional jobs in the wider economy.  NAMA is also making &#8364;2 billion of vendor finance available to prospective purchasers of commercial properties over the same period.  These property measures are also designed to create additional jobs in the property and construction sectors.<\/p><p><i>International Aviation Services <\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  The task forces established to consider what was needed to effect independence for Shannon Airport concluded that there is potential for significant job creation in the aviation sector in Ireland.  To facilitate the sector, I will be putting in place measures to facilitate the construction of hangers and ancillary facilities that will be key to attracting additional aviation sector organisations to the country.  My Department will also examine, together with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the feasibility of new funding sources for airlines and aircraft financing and leasing companies.  Further details should become available shortly.  Whereas these measures were proposed by the task forces for the new International Services Centre in Shannon, I am making the measures available to all other airports who wish also to avail of these measures.<\/p><p><i>Public Finances<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  Based on the latest information, including the November tax receipts, my Department now projects that the general Government deficit for this year will be 8.2%, comfortably inside the required target of 8.6% under the excessive deficit procedure.  The projected deficits for 2013 to 2015 are 7.5%, 5.1% and 2.9%, respectively, all in line with the targets we have to achieve.  These deficit projections are based on projected economic growth for GDP in 2013 of 1.5%, rising to 2.5% in 2014 and 2.9% in 2015, as published in the medium term fiscal statement three weeks ago.  Total voted and non-voted expenditure will be &#8364;69 billion in 2013 and &#8364;54.5 billion of this consists of voted public expenditure, as well as expenditure funded by the social insurance fund and the national training fund.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, will present his expenditure report immediately after my statement.  The budget and expenditure report includes the &#8364;3.5 billion budgetary consolidation required in 2013 to achieve the deficit target.  Projected consolidation for 2014 and 2015 of &#8364;3.1 billion and &#8364;2 billion respectively is unchanged from the figures specified in the medium term fiscal statement, both regarding volume and the split between revenue and expenditure.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Irish financial crisis could be summarised in the word &quot;debt&quot;, consisting of both national debt and personal debt.  The Government is committed to dealing with both.  Continuing to borrow large amounts to fund our day to day services is simply not sustainable.  The reality is that stable public finances are an essential prerequisite to long-term economic growth and job creation.  We will only be able to successfully access the markets in the long term if the markets believe we have a credible fiscal strategy and agree that our debt is sustainable.<\/p><p> Dealing with personal debt is also vital.  The Central Bank is overseeing the roll-out of a range of options to deal with unsustainable personal and commercial debt.  I stress that these measures are focused on unsustainable debt as taxpayers cannot afford to fund blanket debt forgiveness.  I welcome that Allied Irish Banks is committed to contacting 1,500 customers per month to work with them to restructure their mortgages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500020#S00600","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354713600,"counter":255,"content":"<p>It had better get on with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500021#T00200","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1354713600,"counter":256,"content":"<p>This is the level of ambition the Government expects from all banks, whether State-owned or not.

I will now deal with the tax proposals in the budget.<\/p><p><i>Pensions<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  I will begin with the area of Government policy on pensions.  The pensions sector is a very important part of the financial services industry in Ireland and provides a service to enable people to make provision for their retirement and old age.  As it is in everyone&#8217;s best interest, the Government wishes to encourage as many citizens as possible to continue to invest in pension schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500021#T00300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1354713600,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Only two copies of the Minister's speech have been distributed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500021#T00400","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1354713600,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Please proceed, Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500021#T00500","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1354713600,"counter":259,"content":"<p>Perhaps there have been some late changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500021#T00600","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1354713600,"counter":260,"content":"<p>However, some people have been allowed by previous Governments to benefit from hugely generous pension arrangements subsidised by the taxpayer.  While the Government wants to encourage those on lower and middle incomes to save for pensions, it will not allow pensions of the scale previously allowed to be accumulated at the expense of taxpayers whose actual earnings are, in many cases, a fraction of those large pensions.<\/p><p><br \/>  I want to clarify the Government&#8217;s policy on a number of important issues.  First, tax relief on pension contributions will only serve to subsidise pension schemes that deliver income of up to &#8364;60,000 per annum.  This will take effect from 1 January 2014.  Second, tax relief on pension contributions will continue at the marginal rate of tax.  Third, the pension levy announced as part of the jobs initiative will not be renewed after 2014.<\/p><p><br \/>  The current arrangements governing the maximum allowable pension fund at retirement for tax purposes of &#8364;2.3 million still allow for very generous pensions for higher earners through tax subsidised sources, particularly by way of defined benefit schemes in both the public and private sectors.  Therefore, the necessary arrangements to give effect to the programme for Government commitment to effectively cap taxpayers&#8217; subsidies for pension schemes that deliver income of more than &#8364;60,000 per annum will be put in place in 2014.  Consultation on the specific changes required to the existing regime will continue with, among others, the pensions sector and Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Social Protection.  The retention of marginal rate relief on pension contributions coupled with the proposed changes in maximum tax relieved pension pots will preserve and target tax relief to those providing for pensions up to &#8364;60,000 per annum.<\/p><p><br \/>  Constitutional and legal constraints severely limit what steps the Government can take in relation to pensions already in payment.  However, to ensure equity between all citizens based on their level of income, the reduced rate of the universal social charge introduced by the previous Government for those aged over 70 years with an income in excess of &#8364;60,000 will be discontinued from 1 January 2013 and the standard rate of the universal social charge will apply.  In addition, in the interest of fairness, top slicing relief will no longer be available from 1 January 2013 on <i>ex gratia<\/i> lump sums in respect of termination and severance payments where the non-statutory payment is &#8364;200,000 or more.  At present, the individual&#8217;s average tax rate for the previous three years applies to such lump sums rather than the marginal rate of 41%.<\/p><p><br \/>  I have been advised in numerous submissions of the value of allowing limited early withdrawal from additional voluntary contribution, AVC, pensions.  Therefore, in the Finance Bill I will make provision for persons with AVCs to withdraw up to 30% of their value.  Any amounts withdrawn will be subject to tax at the individual&#8217;s marginal rate since marginal rate relief was provided on the contributions.  The option will be available for a three-year period from the passing of the Finance Bill in 2013.<\/p><p><i>PRSI<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  The contributory State pension is one of the key benefits funded by PRSI contributions and it represents, together with other PRSI benefit payments, excellent value for money.  This is especially so for those on the lower part of the income distribution, those with shorter contribution histories and the self-employed.  PRSI contributions are progressive and redistributive because people at the higher end of the income distribution generally get back less than they pay in.<\/p><p><br \/>  To ensure the stability of the Social Insurance Fund in order that it can continue to pay the pensions and benefits on which those earning the least are so reliant, there is a need to broaden the income base for PRSI.  My colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, will increase the minimum level of annual contribution from the self-employed from &#8364;253 to &#8364;500 and abolish the weekly allowance for employees.  Both these measures will make a fairer link between the amount of contributions and the significant benefits received.  The Minister will also bring forward legislation to change PRSI contributions as follows.  Where modified PRSI rate payers have income from a trade or profession, such income and any unearned income they have will be made subject to PRSI with effect from 1 January 2013.  Unearned income for everyone else will become subject to PRSI in 2014.  This means PRSI will be payable on income generated from wealth such as rental income, investment income, dividends and interest on deposits and savings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500021#T00700","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1354713600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>That is robbery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500021#T00800","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1354713600,"counter":262,"content":"<p>These changes in PRSI are progressive-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500021#T00900","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1354713600,"counter":263,"content":"<p>They are regressive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500021#T01000","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1354713600,"counter":264,"content":"<p>-----as they will ensure that all sources of income are subject to PRSI.<\/p><p><i>Local Property Tax<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  I will now turn to the local property tax, which the Government is introducing as a better alternative to increased taxes on income.  Property taxes are used across the world as they are better for the protection and creation of jobs than taxes that increase the cost of employment.  The local property tax will commence with effect from 1 July 2013 for the second half of the year.  To design a tax that is equitable, the Government has accepted most of the recommendations made in the report of the expert group chaired by Dr. Don Thornhill.  The report is being published this week.<\/p><p><br \/>  The main features of the tax are as follows.  It will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  Owners of residential properties, including rental properties, will be responsible for payment of the tax.  The tax will be payable on the basis of the market value of the property, as assessed by the owner.  To aid owners the Revenue Commissioners will provide valuation guidance to which owners can refer.  Alternatively, owners will be free to use a competent valuer.  The initial valuation will be valid up to and including 2016, which will provide three and a half years of certainty for property owners.<\/p><p><br \/>  The rate of the tax will be 0.18% of market value up to &#8364;1 million and 0.25% on values above that level.  These central national rates will not be varied during the lifetime of this Government.  Properties with a value of more than &#8364;100,000 and less than &#8364;1 million will be assessed at the mid-point of a valuation band of &#8364;50,000 width.  For example, properties valued at between &#8364;150,001 and &#8364;200,000 will be assessed at 0.18% of &#8364;175,000, while properties with a value below &#8364;100,000 will be assessed at 0.18% of &#8364;50,000.  Properties valued at more than &#8364;1 million will be liable at 0.18% on the first &#8364;1 million and 0.25% on the balance, without banding being applied.<\/p><p><br \/>  Property owners will be able to choose from a wide range of payment options, including payment by direct debit, credit or debit cards, cash payments or deduction at source from salary, occupational pension or certain State payments.  Certain properties will be exempt from assessment and these exemptions will largely correspond to exemptions from the household charge.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government is committed to real local government democracy and accountability.<\/p><p>Therefore, from 2015, local authorities will have the power to vary the rates by 15% above and below the central national rates to better match their funding needs.  In this way, the property tax will strongly reinforce local democratic decision making and encourage greater efficiency by authorities on behalf of their electorates.<\/p><p> As I stated earlier, there will be a half year's property tax charge in 2013.  Using the example of properties in the \u20ac150,000 to \u20ac200,000 band, the charge in 2013 will be a half year charge of \u20ac157.  It is important to note that this represents an increase for the year of no more than \u20ac57 on the household charge payable in 2012.<\/p><p> I have already set out certain exemptions from the local property tax that will apply to first-time purchasers of homes in 2013 and to purchasers of new or previously unoccupied homes up to the end of 2016.<\/p><p> A voluntary deferral will be available to liable persons whose gross income limits do not exceed \u20ac15,000 for a single person and \u20ac25,000 for a couple.  A deferral option will also be available up to the end of 2017 where gross income less 80% of mortgage interest falls below \u20ac15,000 for single people and \u20ac25,000 for a couple.  Marginal relief will apply where the income or adjusted income is \u20ac10,000 above the income limit, to permit deferrals of up to 50% of liability.  Interest will be charged on deferred amounts at 4% simple interest per annum, which is half the rate charged in default cases.  Deferred property taxes and interest will have to be discharged on the sale or transfer of the property.<\/p><p> The household charge will cease with effect from 1 January 2013 and the NPPR charge or &quot;second homes charge&quot; will cease with effect from 1 January 2014.<\/p><p> Full details of the local property tax will be set out in the finance (local property tax) Bill 2012, which will be published this week and commence Second Stage in the D\u00e1il next week.  Extensive information is available on the budget and Revenue Commissioners website and from the Revenue Commissioners helpline.<\/p><p> I view tax compliance as a core principle of our democracy.  Public services can only be provided to citizens because people pay their taxes.  I want to reassure the vast majority of tax compliant citizens that the Revenue Commissioners will strictly enforce the local property tax and they will collect any unpaid household charge for 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500021#T01100","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354714200,"counter":266,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500022#U00200","nonspeaker":"Deputies"},{"type":"speech","time":1354714200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Any arrears that are not discharged before 1 July 2013 will be increased to \u20ac200 and will be collected through the local property tax system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500022#U00300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1354714200,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Go on Big Phil.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500022#U00400","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1354714200,"counter":269,"content":"<p>The local property tax is fair and progressive, as all property owners make a contribution-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500022#U00500","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1354714200,"counter":270,"content":"<p>Regardless of income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500022#U00600","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1354714200,"counter":271,"content":"<p>-----but those who own the most valuable properties will pay the most.<\/p><p><i>Income Tax<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  The Government continues to implement the programme for Government commitments of maintaining the current rates of income tax together with bands and credits and not increasing the top marginal rates of taxes on income.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland's income tax system is one of the most progressive income tax systems in the world and is the most progressive in the EU.

This level of progressivity in the tax system and the record levels of foreign direct investment show that we are striking the right balance between our income tax levels and incentivising investment and job creation in Ireland.  The more jobs that are created, the wider our tax base will be for the provision of public services.<\/p><p><br \/>  I see greater fairness of the tax system as reducing the number and amount of reliefs that can be availed of by income earners to shelter their income from tax.  Already, the ability of certain wealthy people to reduce their income tax liability to very low levels through judicious use of tax incentives has been restricted.  The introduction of the high earners restriction has been successful in generating additional tax revenue.

The new rate will be a blended rate of 31%, which will apply to all donations.<\/p><p><br \/>  I have, since taking office, received proposals that suggest there may be a significant number of philanthropists worldwide, many of them Irish citizens or with Irish family backgrounds, who would be interested in making significant donations to initiatives that would aid Ireland's economic recovery if our tax system were changed to ensure suitable recognition of such donations.

Our policies in respect of tax co-operation and international exchange of tax information have always earned international respect.<\/p><p>  It is in this context that I am very pleased to announce today that Ireland has become one of the first countries in the world to agree a new intergovernmental agreement with the United States in respect of the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, commonly known as FATCA.<\/p><p>Reaching such an early agreement with the United States will be of great benefit to Irish business.<\/p><p><i>Conclusion<\/i><\/p><p><br \/> When I stood before the House last year on 6 December, the Government was locked out of bond markets.  Our two-year bond yields were almost 10%; now they are less than 2%.  We have seen a total transformation in only 12 months.  Today, markets and foreign lenders are lending once more to Ireland and are willing to lend to Irish businesses.  That is essential for our businesses and our economy to continue on the path to recovery.<\/p><p><br \/> Confidence is returning to Ireland.  Unemployment fell by 3,600 on an annual basis in the third quarter of this year - the first year-on-year fall recorded since 2005.  The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index shows that Ireland is the only country in the euro area to record an expansion &#8211; the ninth consecutive month of expansion.  Retail sales have recorded strong growth in recent months.  Services exports are running at double-digit growth.  In five of the past six months, consumer sentiment has risen.<\/p><p><br \/> When this budget is implemented, most of the tax consolidation committed to by the Government will have been completed and even though the revenue target for 2014 is &#8364;1.1 billion the carry-over effect of today&#8217;s measures reduces that to approximately &#8364;500 million.  In 2015 the carry-over effects will reduce the programme target of &#8364;700 million to a similar level.  People have asked me to point the way forward.  They have asked whether harsh budgets will ever end.  When we are here next year, please God, the tax take will be approximately &#8364;500 million, not over &#8364;1 billion as in previous years and the tax take the following year will be a similar amount.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500022#U02000","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354714800,"counter":286,"content":"<p>The Minister is some man.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500023#V00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1354714800,"counter":287,"content":"<p>We are making progress and in doing this I am setting out the likely levels of future revenue consolidation to reassure people and to boost their confidence.

This Government continues to face a daunting challenge in repairing the economy and the public finances.  Difficult decisions are still required.  We are committed to meeting that challenge, and are confident that through good government we can lead Ireland back to independent funding and back to sustainable growth in living standards and in employment.  The expenditure adjustments I am announcing amount to just under &#8364;2 billion out of an overall adjustment of &#8364;3.5 billion.  As a result, current expenditure will be reduced to &#8364;51.1 billion in 2013, and capital spending to &#8364;3.4 billion in 2013.  I am very conscious that adjustments of this scale, of necessity, affect everyone.  However, we have sought to be fair, protecting the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible.<\/p><p><i>Political Reform<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  The crisis that we are enduring is a result of a series of related failings.  Ours is a banking, fiscal and political crisis.  It will not be resolved unless all three issues are addressed.  That is why the Government established a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, not merely a Department of public expenditure.

For the first time, this year Oireachtas committees debated the annual Estimates in advance of decisions taken.  Changing budgetary processes for all eurozone member states may make this the last December budget in this country.<\/p><p><br \/>  Oireachtas committees are also scrutinising legislation in advance of finalisation by Government and feeding constructively into the decision-making process.  I intend to bring proposals to Government shortly for Ireland to participate in the global Open Government Partnership, reinforcing our commitment to progress in this area.  These are crucial reform measures which stand as this Government&#8217;s response to our governance crisis.  I believe they will not only help bolster confidence in our political system but will help to enhance openness and transparency around policy formation in the State.<\/p><p><i>Spending Pressures<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  Today though, is primarily about our fiscal crisis.  We must cut spending while the pressure on our public services remains greater than ever.  Last year&#8217;s census revealed that there were almost 350,000 more people living in Ireland than in 2006.  Compared to 2008, there are over 565,000 more medical card holders today.  There are over 50,000 more students in our schools and almost 30,000 more third level students.  There are almost 80,000 more people in receipt of the State pension and nearly 200,000 more people receiving jobseeker's payments each week.  It is against that backdrop that we must continue to meet our fiscal targets and to reach a deficit of below 3% by 2015.<\/p><p><i>Public Service Reform\/Croke Park Agreement<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  Reducing public expenditure and numbers while continuing to provide key public services and social supports is not easy.  That is why we are undertaking the most comprehensive reform of the public service since the State was founded.  The Croke Park agreement has been essential in supporting this reform.  The value of a stable industrial relations environment in achieving a fiscal consolidation of this scale should not be underestimated.  Public service staff numbers will be reduced to approximately 287,000 in 2013, a reduction of some 33,000 from the 2008 peak of 320,000.  We plan to go further to reduce this number to 282,500 by the end of 2014.<\/p><p><br \/>  Public servants have already had two pay reductions, totalling an average of 14%.  Top salaries have been reduced by up to 30% and capped at &#8364;200,000.  We have also reduced the salaries for new entrants to the public service by a further 10%.  Public service pensions have been reduced, saving more than &#8364;100 million annually.  Legislation for a new single public service pension scheme has been enacted to reduce future pension costs.<\/p><p><br \/>  We are implementing a radical reform of the way in which public procurement is organised, to yield significant savings.  We are reducing duplication and waste through greater use of shared services for a range of back-office functions.  For example, a new human resources shared service centre for the Civil Service will reduce human resource headcount by 17% and costs by 26%, with annual net savings of &#8364;12.5 million.<\/p><p><br \/>  We are taking a focused and integrated approach to external service delivery of non-core activities, where appropriate.  In April, we published a new e-Government strategy, which builds on Ireland&#8217;s strong recent performance in this area.  The most recent European Commission e-Government benchmarking exercise shows that Ireland is now ranked first in Europe for the provision and sophistication of online services to businesses and citizens.  We have agreed the standardisation of annual leave and paid sick leave across the public service, which will yield both productivity increases and cost savings.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the progress made to date, the public service pay bill, at 36% of public spending, will need to make an additional and substantial contribution to meeting our fiscal challenge next year and beyond.  Additional productivity and cost extraction measures not envisaged under the current Croke Park deal will be required to ensure that the Government meets these commitments.<\/p><p> Following my invitation, the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions recently agreed to enter into discussions to establish if we can reach agreement on such measures.  The aim of these discussions is to achieve an additional reduction in the cost of delivery of public services of the order of \u20ac1 billion from the public service pay and pensions bill over the period 2013 to 2015.<\/p><p> Public servants are delivering on our vision for a new public service and their contribution should be and is recognised by this Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500023#V02800","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1354715400,"counter":314,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500024#W00200","nonspeaker":"Deputies"},{"type":"speech","time":1354715400,"counter":315,"content":"<p>This is a real opportunity for us to build on the achievements of the current agreement and drive a range of workforce reforms which will support our public services into the future.

The Government&#8217;s national energy efficiency action plan sets out the measures necessary to deliver the national 20% energy saving target.  One of the key measures is the retrofitting of existing buildings to achieve energy savings.  The targets in this area imply upgrading the energy performance of 100,000 houses per annum and reducing the energy consumption in the public sector by 33%.  These are challenging targets, but they are also great opportunities.

Education and training will continue to be a priority of this Government and this is evidenced by the level of investment in this area at a time of such severe resource constraints.  In particular, we will prioritise and protect, as far as practicable, the programmes that deliver the best results and meet the requirements of children, parents, the disadvantaged, the unemployed and the labour force.  However, we cannot exclude the education sector from making the savings we have to make.  Difficult choices have been made in areas like health and social protection.  While bearing in mind demographic pressures in the coming years, we have had to take decisions to meet the budgetary parameters in education.  We focused the savings measures on those areas where expenditure can be reduced without a significant impact on core education services.<\/p><p><br \/>  We will increase the staffing schedule for fee paying schools next year by two points.

Behind the property tax, it is the second largest revenue generating item in this budget.<\/p><p>  Today the Government has targeted families with children, who need their car to go to work and who have made sacrifices to provide a home.  A family on low to middle income, with three children, living in a modest house with a mortgage and valued at \u20ac220,000 in a full year will pay \u20ac405 in property tax, an increase of \u20ac305 on the household charge, and will lose \u20ac10 per month for the first and second child and \u20ac18 per month for the third child, a loss of \u20ac456 in a year.  Assuming it is a one income household, it will lose \u20ac264 in PRSI and will pay at least another \u20ac50 in motor tax, amounting to just under \u20ac1,100.  That does not count the additional money for the drugs payment scheme and the additional charges Ministers will announce later this week, such as school transport costs.  We have yet to find out the impact of the Minister for Health's proposals for health insurance premiums.<\/p><p>  That impact is irrespective of income: it is not income sensitive.  The example I gave is the same for a couple on \u20ac20,000 as for a couple on \u20ac200,000.  It does not matter.  The property tax, the child benefit cut and the PRSI increase are not income-related.  How can the Minister stand over a situation where people on low and middle incomes will lose as much in nominal terms and far more proportionately than people who earn multiples of their incomes?  It is inequitable by anyone's standards.<\/p><p>  Before last year's election, the Labour Party said it would not agree to cuts in child benefit, that it was a red line issue for the party.  Families were told child benefit would be safe under Labour.  It was a commendable stance to take during a general election and the party was so exercised by the issue that during the election it took out newspaper adverts and erected posters warning people about the dangers of voting for Fine Gael.  In the first budget, the Labour Party broke that promise.  It cannot blame Fianna F\u00e1il, the troika or the memorandum of understanding for that because it says nothing about child benefit.  Just like the pledge on student fees during the election, the pledge on child benefit was made with the full knowledge about the state of the country's finances.  The party made that promise to secure votes.  It got the votes, is now in power and has broken that promise twice.  That is the Labour Party's record on child benefit and it will not be forgotten by families around the country.<\/p><p>  There will be an attempt to say this budget was dictated by the troika, that the cuts and tax increases were decided in Brussels and Berlin.  This budget, like last year's budget, was decided in Dublin after the four wise men let the Cabinet see it on Wednesday.  I acknowledge the Minister is working within tight constraints and must introduce a budget with an adjustment of \u20ac3.5 billion and there is no easy way to do that.  The decisions announced today are the decisions of this Government and as the Minister said up to 14 months ago, the troika made clear it has no difficulty substituting one fiscal measure for another with equal value.<\/p><p>  Let us look at the record of this Government.  It has cut home help services from elderly citizens while protecting bankers' pay and pensions.  It has cut special needs assistants from special schools while paying its advisors above the agreed pay cap.  It shamefully forced the most severely disabled people in the country to stay outside the gates of this House overnight in the cold to embarrass it into a U-turn when it proposed to cut their personal assistants.  We must question the Government's priorities when we hear the parents of children in a school in Dublin must be told to make sure their children have a coat on in class because it cannot afford to fix the boiler.  We must question its priorities when HSE social workers are writing to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul asking for public donations to be used to paper over the gaping cracks in the public health service, even before the health cuts that will be introduced by the Minister today.  There is something perverse about continuing to pay increments to senior civil servants while the elderly, who have lived through the toughest of times and kept the State afloat, are now being asked to pay the price.<\/p><p>  The centrepiece of the tax package is a new tax on the family home.  Thousands of families and individuals will simply be unable to pay the property tax.  The Government did not raise the possibility with the troika of the property tax being replaced with other taxation measures.  The Minister knows that the memorandum of understanding we signed up to in 2010 provided for a site value tax, an altogether different animal to the market value family home tax he is introducing in this budget.<\/p><p>The Minister should have told the troika there is no question of introducing a family home tax against a backdrop of a mortgage arrears crisis that is out of control.  The Minister has the perfect reason for doing it but instead he is proceeding with a punitive tax on the family home at a time when most people can ill afford to pay it.  This will be a divisive tax, which will hit all home owners but especially penalises home owners in Dublin, Cork and other major urban centres.<\/p><p>  Where is the legislation underpinning this property tax?  We were promised we would have the legislation for this debate but we do not have it.  Where is the Thornhill report?  It has been knocking around Government Buildings since June but the Government did not have the courtesy to publish it in advance of today's budget so we could have a proper debate.  This is the Government that talked about reform of the budgetary process.<\/p><p>  This tax will be hardest felt by families in low to middle income brackets and by those dependent on welfare.  We believe this is the wrong tax at the wrong time.  According to the last official figures from the Central Bank, almost 170,000 mortgages are in arrears or have been restructured, more than 20% of family home mortgages.  That is likely to rise to one in four when the next official figures are released.  The mortgage arrears problem has got dramatically worse in the 21 months the Government has been in place.  These people cannot pay their mortgages, they are not choosing not to pay, they do not have the money to pay, and now the Minister is imposing a property tax on them.  How many people sitting at the Cabinet table have any understanding of what it is like for a family which is struggling to make the monthly mortgage repayment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500027#Z00250","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1354717200,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Where is the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500027#Z00400","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1354717200,"counter":408,"content":"<p>He is in Doha.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500027#Z00500","speaker":"1049"},{"type":"speech","time":1354717200,"counter":409,"content":"<p>How many Ministers even have a mortgage on the family home?<\/p><p>  The Minister said the exemptions are largely based on the exemptions to the household charge, which are exceptionally narrow in nature.

Around 16,000 of the lowest income families in the country, who cannot pay their mortgage without the assistance of the State, are now being required to pay this property tax.  It makes a mockery of the lip service paid by the Government to addressing the mortgage arrears crisis.<\/p><p>  All of that is without even mentioning the buy to let mortgage book, which is in a complete mess, as the Minister well knows.<\/p><p>We know that three out of ten of them are in arrears of 90 days or more.

That is at least 400,000 family home mortgages where the value of the mortgage is greater than the value of the property.  How is it fair to impose a tax on a net liability, which is what these families have?  It is wrong to suggest that negative equity is not a problem so long as the family can continue to service the mortgage.  It is a real trap for people and is deeply unfair to impose a property tax without taking any account of the value of the mortgage <i>vis-\u00e0-vis<\/i>the value of the house.

That is a cruel cut and there is no need for it to be implemented.  My God, the bar has been set so high to qualify for a respite care grant now that many people with a family member, who has a serious disability, either use that grant to get a break - use it for respite - or they use it to provide essential intervention services for their loved one to fill the gaps where the HSE is not providing those services.  There is no need for that cruel cut and I ask the Minister to reverse that cut which hits the most vulnerable people.  Given the choices the Government has made in respect of taxation, it is impossible to justify that people with special needs should suffer a cut affecting their standard of living, which will add extra anguish and pain to the family members who care for them and save the State billions of euro every year in the process.<\/p><p>  At the conclusion of my budget speech last year, I made the point that I have repeated since that the fairest way to measure the Government's performance on the economy is by measuring how successful it is at tackling the jobs crisis.  I welcome some of the initiatives outlined in the Budget Statement, which hopefully will help the SME sector to create additional jobs here.  Since the Government came to office in March 2011, using the official CSO figures, the quarterly national household survey seasonally adjusted, there are 30,000 fewer people at work.  The unemployment rate increased from 14.3% to 14.8%.<\/p><p>We all accept that it would have gone up far more but for the safety valve of emigration.  A total of 87,000 people, mainly young people, left our shores in the 12 months to April 2012.  When the Minister took office, he said employment levels would grow by 0.5% in 2012.  He now says they will fall by 1.2%.  He said unemployment would be 13.7% by the end of this year.  He now admits it will be just under 15%.  He is now predicting no increase in employment levels throughout next year.  All the fanciful talk of 100,000 jobs under NewERA and the five point plan has been long forgotten.  The five point plan has not been seen since February 2011.<\/p><p> The most alarming aspect of this is the dramatic increase in the number of people who are long-term unemployed.  A total of 60% of people out of work are now long-term unemployed.  What are we doing for them and where are the jobs?  Can we really say we are putting enterprise at the heart of everything we do?  Can we say we are doing everything to support the 200,000 small businesses in this country who provide almost 700,000 jobs?  We know these businesses will lead the economic recovery if we give them the capacity to do so.  These businesses are starved of credit.  The Minister knows that banks are not meeting the lending needs of this economy.  Even when AIB came before the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, it confirmed that the new lending it has extended so far this year is \u20ac600 million, not the \u20ac3.5 billion the Minister says it is providing.  They are loans that are repackaged and approvals that never get drawn down because the conditions and interest rates are so onerous that the borrower would never have the capacity to draw down that money.<\/p><p> The Minister said the economy would grow by 2.5% in real terms in 2012.  He now says it will grow by 0.9%.  He said it would grow by 3% next year but has now halved that and says it will grow by 1.5%.  He said private consumption, which is the driver of the domestic economy, would grow by 1% in 2013.  He now says it will fall by 0.5%.  He said exports would grow by 6%.  We are now told they will potentially grow by 3%.  The warning signs were there in respect of the public finances and Exchequer returns yesterday, particularly in respect of the self-employed.  The \u20ac300 million deficit in income tax last month should have set the alarm bells ringing and the Minister should be giving that sector every support he can in its time of need.<\/p><p> I had hoped and half-expected that the Minister would pull a rabbit out of the hat today in respect of the promissory note and bank debt.  I am, sadly, disappointed.  I wish him well in his ongoing negotiations.  The technical talks on the promissory note have been ongoing for about 14 months.  They must be extremely technical.  We have not seen any paper so far and would love to see one and have an input into it.  I wish the Minister well in that because it is important for the country and we will do everything we can to support the Government to get a deal on bank debt.  The Minister also needs to be honest with people in respect of the use of the European Stability Mechanism.  It will be at least a year before there is any relief in that aspect of bank debt and he might as well call it as it is and tell people what the position is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500028#AA02000","speaker":"993","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354718400,"counter":431,"content":"<p>The previous Government agreed to all those things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500029#BB00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1354718400,"counter":432,"content":"<p>The Government could have changed it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500029#BB00300","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354718400,"counter":433,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1354718400,"counter":434,"content":"<p>Deputy Michael McGrath, without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500029#BB00500","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1354718400,"counter":435,"content":"<p>This budget day is one which many ordinary families have been dreading.  They are looking to this House and Government for reassurance about their future.  They want a Government that will lead them through this economic crisis in a fair and compassionate way.  The harsh reality is that today's budget will put an unbearable financial burden on many families.  This budget reaffirms the approach of a Government that has broken almost every promise it made to the people at the beginning of last year.  People were looking to this budget for a sense of hope and for some sense that the Government understood what their lives are like.  This Government has the numbers to put through whatever budgetary measures it wishes, but on the basis of what has been presented today, getting public acceptance of these measures will be a far greater challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500029#BB00600","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1354718400,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I look forward to making a contribution on detailed aspects of the budget.  I want to highlight issues that will affect the majority of ordinary families and people.  This budget effectively tightens and squeezes the majority of families.  Despite promises that this would be a fair budget, it is anything but.  It follows the pattern of last year.  Fine Gael defended its constituency of high earners while Labour capitulated on its so-called core values.  Contrary to grandiose claims, this is not a radical or reforming Government, rather it is a complacent one.  The Minister for Social Protection presides over a \u20ac685 million overspend, while the Minister for Health must look for another \u20ac360 million this week.  Everything this Government does is dictated by political expediency, as demonstrated by the unseemly row and horse trading between Fine Gael and Labour Ministers in the run up to the announcement today.<\/p><p>  Over the past two years and during the previous election, commitments were given to the people which today are being broken.  Put simply, this is a U-turn budget from a U-turn Government.  In every area from third level fees to child benefit to class sizes to carers' payments to employees' PRSI to property tax, Government parties have shown they are willing to say anything to get elected until they are safely ensconced in their offices when they cast those promises aside.  We are witnessing a Government that is obsessed with style over substance.  Last month, the people voted in a referendum to enshrine children's rights in the Constitution.  Today, the Government is cutting child benefit.  That is its answer to the people who voted in the referendum.  It is also cutting the overall budget for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs by an additional \u20ac16 million.  That is happening a few weeks after the people at the Government's request enshrined the rights of children in the Constitution.  The response of this Government is to cut child benefit and funding for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p><p>  Labour has spoken out against the bank guarantee on many occasions in the past.  Despite this, last week, every Labour Deputy voted to renew that for a further 12 months.  The Government claims it wants to protect the most vulnerable, but last year, it introduced a budget that was unfair and this budget is the same.  The test of fairness is how one goes about achieving the adjustment of \u20ac3.5 billion.  This side of the House accepts this figure must be achieved, but the test of fairness is how one goes about it.  The Government has discretion as to how to apportion the split between additional taxation and expenditure cuts.  We believe fairness dictates a 50-50 split between tax increases and expenditure reductions.  Once the decision was made by the Government to load the burden of the \u20ac3.5 billion on expenditure cuts, it was inevitable that this budget would hit the poorest and most vulnerable the hardest.  Fairness went out the window in the interests of political expediency.<\/p><p>  I will address specific measures in the budget and will inevitably concentrate on issues that affect families, children and parents.  The cut in child benefit can only be described as an anti-family measure.  Today's \u20ac10 reduction in child benefit, taken in conjunction with last year's reduction, will take \u20ac200 million out of families' incomes.  The reduction makes a mockery of Labour's red line approach on child benefit about which we have heard before.  Child benefit is a core payment to 600,000 families that helps sustain the health, wealth and well-being of 1.5 million children.  Child benefit is a universal payment that provides vital income support for families in meeting the costs of rearing children, especially during a time of unemployment and economic hardship.  In October, the Minister for Social Protection told us she would only consider cutting child benefit when we were able to offer Scandinavian levels of child care.<\/p><p>There was no mention of it in the statement today.  Throughout the country ordinary families are struggling to make ends meet and meet their basic child care costs.  This crude attack will cause significant hardship for families.  The Minister will also impose additional expenses on working low income families.<\/p><p> I wish to explain the changes made to child benefit because they will have escaped many people.  The Minister had already announced cuts to child benefit to be introduced on 1 January, which were not repeated today but which will affect every family claiming child benefit.  At present the rate is \u20ac140 for the first and second child and this will be cut by \u20ac10 per week to \u20ac130.  The current rate for the third child of \u20ac148 will also be reduced to \u20ac130, according to the previous announcement and the announcement made today.  For the fourth and subsequent child the current rate of \u20ac160 will also be reduced.  Families will wish to know how it will affect them.  Families with one child will see a reduction of \u20ac10 per month.  A family with three children will see a cut of \u20ac38 per month, or \u20ac436 being taken from the mother's hand per annum.  For a household with four children the cut will be \u20ac696 per annum.  This is a very severe cut and it is important that people understand what is going on.<\/p><p> It is not only in this area the Minister will make cuts.  He will also make it more difficult for people to obtain mortgage interest supplement.  This scheme had worked well over a number of years and helped people avoid falling into arrears with their bank repayments.  It costs approximately \u20ac3,500 per recipient, which is good value compared to what would be paid in rental supplements if the recipients were in private rented accommodation.  The measures introduced by the Minister are coming into effect as time goes on and they will have a substantial impact in 2013.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, stated that rather than it being a preventative measure she wants a person to be in arrears for at least two years.  This means a person must struggle for a year and then deal with his or her bank or financial institution, meet the conditions of the deal reached for an additional 12 months after which he or she will qualify for mortgage interest supplement.  If people can meet the deal offered by the bank the Minister will then tell them they do not need mortgage interest supplement, so she is on the way to phasing it out.<\/p><p> Another issue which needs to be mentioned is the one parent family payment.  The age limit for this payment has been 14 years, but legislation was passed earlier this year which means from 1 January 2013 the age limit will be reduced to ten years for new applicants.  This must be taken into account.  In the first week of January the Minister will also reduce by approximately \u20ac20 the income disregard which can be earned without the one parent family payment being affected.  This measure was announced on a previous occasion but will come into effect next year.<\/p><p> The measures announced by the Minister will hit families where it hurts most by removing another \u20ac50 from the pocket of those who qualify for the back to school allowance.  One must be on a very low income to qualify for this allowance.  The Minister stated this will save \u20ac17 million, but this saving is on the back of the poorest people of Ireland, because by and large one must be in receipt of a welfare payment to qualify for the back to school allowance.  At present the payment is \u20ac250 for children over 12 years of age and this will be reduced by \u20ac50.  The payment for children under 12 years of age will be cut from \u20ac150 to \u20ac100.<\/p><p> With regard to older people, the household benefits package is valued throughout the country.  Our senior citizens and people with disabilities depend on it.  We know it is a significant cost to the State and we know it must be considered carefully.  Approximately 400,000 people depend on the household benefits package.  The main areas it covers are gas, electricity, telephone costs and the television licence.  Many utility companies make excessive profits through what they charge the State for the package.  The Minister for Social Protection should drive them harder and get better bargains for the State rather than making cuts.  The \u20ac61 million saving should be shared between the companies providing the services, which have a monopoly, and none of it should be brought to bear on elderly people or those with disabilities.<\/p><p> Was the budget poverty-proofed?  The answer is that it could not have been because the Ministers only saw it a few days ago.  Was it gender-proofed?  It could not have been because only four Ministers, all men, were in possession of it until a few days ago.  They could not have gender-proofed it.  Was it equality-proofed?  It was not.  It was rushed to the printers in the past day or two without detailed discussion.  If it had been gender-proofed and the Minister had thought about it carefully he would not have done much of what he did.  Many of the measures announced in the past hour and a half are anti-women and anti-mother.  I am shocked the Minister announced he wants to tax maternity benefit.  He will tax mothers who give birth to children.  As I outlined earlier, child benefit payments to a woman - and most child benefit payments go to women - with three or four children will be reduced by more than \u20ac600.<\/p><p> The measures announced by the Minister will hit women who have children.  They will also hit new applicants for the one parent family payment as the age limit will be reduced to ten years of age and families with children over this age will not be eligible to apply.  The Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, has the view they should not all be out working and somebody should mind the children when they come home from school.  As I also outlined earlier, the amount which can be earned before the reduction in the one parent family payment takes effect will also be reduced.  We know the overwhelming majority of those in receipt of the one parent family payment are women.<\/p><p> The Minister has done a very nasty thing by cutting the carer's respite grant.  This is a grant for carers who look after elderly or disabled people, including disabled children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance, in their home.  I cannot believe for an amount of \u20ac26 million the Minister has decided to cut the respite care grant and will reduce it by \u20ac325 from \u20ac1,700 per annum to \u20ac1,375 per annum.  This grant is what allows people to keep their sanity.  They need the respite care grant so they can have a break for a week or two at some stage during the 52 weeks of the year.  They provide 24-hour cover 365 days a year and need to be able to pay someone to come and look after their dependent relative.  They need a break.  However, the Minister will cut the respite care grant payable to the carer.  This is nasty and unnecessary.  The Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Howlin, are two decent men and I ask them to reconsider this.  Two categories of people receive the respite care grant, namely, those in receipt of carer's allowance and those who do not qualify for it because of the means test but still provide 24-hour cover 365 days a year.  The only payment the latter group receives for providing full-time cover for an elderly or sick relative is the respite care grant of \u20ac1,700 a year.  I cannot believe the Minister is cutting it.  The majority of carers in Ireland are women.  This is another anti-woman move.  This is also the case with regard to the changes to the household benefits package because the majority of elderly people are women as they tend to live longer.  The reduction in the household benefits package will affect elderly widows.<\/p><p>I cannot believe the Minister has done this to the women and the mothers of Ireland - taxing maternity benefit, cutting child benefit, cutting the eligibility for one-parent family payment, cutting the carer's respite care grant, cutting the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, and hitting the household benefits package that will affect more women than men.  I am shocked that he has done this.  Had he taken a few days extra, he would have seen that.  The mistake was made when the Minister decided to achieve the majority of the \u20ac3.5 billion by way of expenditure cuts.  Had he done it the way we suggested, he would still have achieved his targets.  Our document is on the public record.  Some of what the Minister has done is in our document published two or three weeks ago, but had he followed our approach, we would have had an equal split between the taxation and expenditure cuts.  Instead, the Minister chose to load it on the lowest paid who most need the support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500029#BB00700","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354719600,"counter":439,"content":"<p>It is the consequence of Fianna F\u00e1il's approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500031#DD00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1354719600,"counter":440,"content":"<p>In respect of the Department of Social Protection benefits, the Minister has cut the period in which people can avail of jobseeker's benefit, from 12 to nine months for people who were working for three, four or five years and who, through no fault of their own, have lost their jobs, and from nine months to six for those who have worked ten, 20 or 30 years and who never missed a day's work or a week's contribution.  The Minister is cutting their benefit from nine months to six months to save \u20ac82 million.  The Minister might say that will encourage them to get back to work.  That would be fine if there were jobs available, but the only option he is giving jobseekers, who are at their weakest and most vulnerable, having lost a job after working for decades and who know nothing else, is to cut their jobseeker's benefit.  The Minister is essentially saying that new Labour's way is for these people to go to Frankfurt, Quebec or Queensland or wherever to get a job.<\/p><p>  The Minister has also made it more difficult for employers to employ people.  He has cut the employers' redundancy rebate at a saving of \u20ac30 million.  We all would agree that the future success of the economy lies in small local businesses which employ between two and five people.  If a downturn in business occurs through no fault of their own, the small business operator must lay off workers.  If the employer cannot get that redundancy payment rebate, he or she will think twice about employing a person.  That is a disincentive to employment.<\/p><p>  The Minister has also cut the back to education allowance.  He has discontinued the \u20ac300 payment per annum at a saving of \u20ac24 million.  He has also cut the respite care grant.<\/p><p>  This brings me on to a bigger issue directly affecting the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.  He should bear this point in mind because I have not made it previously.  There was an application in the D\u00e1il this week for Supplementary Estimates for the Department of Social Protection and the Health Service Executive to the tune of \u20ac685 million and \u20ac360 million, respectively.  As the Minister knows only too well, there were a number of Supplementary Estimates last week totalling \u20ac73 million across a range of Departments.  These Supplementary Estimates were voted by the D\u00e1il because of the Government's flawed budget last year.  The Minister's figures were wrong, we told him his growth projections were wrong and we told him the health budget was wrong as well.  The Minister has had to come back in recent days with Supplementary Estimates to the tune of \u20ac1.118 billion for all those Departments.

There was no mention of retired council workers or any retirees in other State agencies who do not have the same access to the Minister.<\/p><p> The issue of public sector pay and reform was not sufficiently dealt with here today.  We have had some reform and the Minister has spoken a lot about abolishing quangos.  In 2011, he said that 48 agencies would be abolished or merged by the end of 2013 but we can see that will not happen.  One third of the 48 State agencies earmarked for abolition or merger in 2012 will have completed the process by the end of the year, but the others will not.  In addition, of the 46 planned for 2013 it appears that only half of them will be on time.  Part of this is down to the failure to pass legislation in this Chamber by the respective line Ministers who are obviously putting up a resistance.<\/p><p> The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform makes great play about efficiencies, shared services and public sector reform.  I support the principle of shared services whether it operates across the HSE, local authorities, the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na or Government Departments, including the Department of Education and Skills.

The Minister, Deputy Quinn, apologised for the delays but I think he was also apologising for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform because this is a reform issue.  Some 66,000 people applied for third-level grants but, as of today, half of them have not yet been approved.  Most TDs are now coming across a new phenomenon in their constituencies.  I have had numerous examples of where people were informed in writing that they qualified for a 100% grant, only to be told later that the grant had been reduced by 50% or not approved at all.  When I followed that up by tabling parliamentary questions I was told that due to the volume of cases, errors inevitably occur.  People are having to leave third-level institutions due to those administrative errors.  They took up college places on the basis of letters they received - I have copies of those letters - yet subsequently letters were issued which stated something different.  It affects students from low-income families who should be eligible for such grants.<\/p><p>  I wish to comment on the Department of Children and Youth Affairs because we have had the children's referendum.  Apart from cutting child benefit, the Government is also cutting funding to various youth programmes to save \u20ac5 million.  In addition, the subvention rates towards child care costs and places are also being cut by \u20ac3.7 million.  Expenditure for the schools completion programme is being cut, as is money for the national children's strategy and the early intervention programme.  I am shocked that a few weeks after the children's referendum the Government is cutting the Department of Children and Youth Affairs budget for 2013 and child benefit on top of that.<\/p><p>  The Minister could have assisted job growth in the economy by ensuring that money earmarked and passed by this House for capital expenditure on publicly funded projects was used for that purpose in 2012.  We now see a massive underspend of \u20ac400 million, however.  At the end of October, he told us that would not happen when the underspend was \u20ac336 million.  A month later, the figure had reached \u20ac405 million.  Every one of the jobs that is not proceeding represents a loss of employment.  We estimate that there are 4,000 fewer people at work today because the Minister did not spend the \u20ac405 million on projects for which he received funding.  Those 4,000 people are suffering due to the ineptitude of various Government Departments in not getting the jobs done.<\/p><p>  I appeal to the Minister concerning the \u20ac3 billion worth of publicly funded contracts that are due to happen next year.  We on this side of the House will do everything to assist him, but will he please ensure the Construction Contracts Bill goes ahead as a matter of priority?  So many subcontractors and their direct employees are not being paid for their labour, and every TD is experiencing this in constituency work.  The main contractor is being paid by the line Department or the contracting agency on behalf of the State, yet subcontractors and their direct employees have not been paid.  That is because of the tendering process and the lack of proper mechanisms to ensure that competent and financially strong contractors would get these jobs in the first place.  It is a scandal that people who work cannot get paid.  This House is unanimous on that issue.  I want to get this legislation over the line because it has been months since we debated it on Second Stage.<\/p><p>  The budget contains a number of taxation measures, including the property tax which my colleague Deputy Michael McGrath has outlined in detail, that are not necessary at this time.  They should not proceed now.  There are a number of very unfair cuts right across the areas of health, social welfare, education and others, that should not happen.  They are falling disproportionately on the poor because the Government has decided to make most of the adjustments in expenditure cuts, rather than on people who could pay more.  Many of the cuts are unfair and we oppose them.  We will be trenchantly opposing this budget due to its unfairness concerning families and the ordinary people of Ireland generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500032#EE00500","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1354720200,"counter":485,"content":"<p>Deputies Pearse Doherty and Mary Lou McDonald who are sharing time.

They were hoping that the budget the Minister announced today would have made things better, that it would bring jobs and help rebuild our broken economy.  They also hoped that it would improve the health and education systems, and that it would ease the burden they have been carrying since 2008.<\/p><p>  They are also fearful, however, that the Minister would do what he did last year, that he will continue to repeat the mistakes of Fianna F\u00e1il, and that he will continue to make ordinary people pay for the bad decisions of bankers and politicians.<\/p><p>  People want this Government to succeed.  Even those who voted against it and did not want it in office, want it to succeed.  Like hundreds of thousands of ordinary people, I have shared their hope that this budget would be different, would break with the failures of the past, would chart a new course and would make things better.  Today, however, the Minister has dashed all our hopes and has confirmed all our fears.  Despite his best attempts to spin what has been announced today, one thing is crystal clear.  If I had closed my eyes during either of the Government Ministers' speeches, I could have been listening to Brian Cowen, the late Brian Lenihan or anyone else from Fianna F\u00e1il delivering the same speech.  They proposed and implemented many of the decisions that have been announced today.  Fine Gael and Labour have swallowed the failed economic policies of Fianna F\u00e1il, hook, line and sinker, and are now implementing them with gusto.<\/p><p>  As I listened to the Minister, I wondered if he was living in a different reality to the rest of us.  His failure truly to grasp what ordinary people across this State are going through is shocking.  I have met these people across the country in towns and villages.  They tell me that they are living from week to week; they are finding it tough and are barely able to get by.  They are the mothers who go without dinner so their children can eat.  They are the fathers who stand in the dole queue, trying to keep some of their pride and wondering if they will be able to meet the bills that are coming in.  They are the elderly who gave their lives and taxes to this State and are now living in poverty.  Their help is being stripped away from them in every single budget, yet they still hold themselves with dignity.<\/p><p>  I am embarrassed to stand in this Chamber, where we are so proud to have been elected to serve, and hear the Minister and the Government let these people down so badly.  The Minister pretends that their suffering is not real.  What has been delivered in this House today is a bill for the ordinary families of Ireland.  It is a bill that picks up the tab for the failed policies of Labour, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il \u2013 three parties that have caused, deepened and lengthened the recession.<\/p><p>  In December 2010, Fine Gael and Labour stood on this side of the House and rightly lambasted Fianna F\u00e1il for introducing its fourth consecutive austerity budget.  When in opposition, Deputy Eamon Gilmore said Fianna F\u00e1il had introduced cuts that broke new ground in political stupidity.  He then crossed to the Government benches and did exactly the same thing, not once but twice.<\/p><p>The position is the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government has implemented \u20ac7 billion in taxes and cuts after riding into office on a wave of popular support to end austerity.  So much for the brand new dawn or the democratic revolution for which people hoped and the Government promised.  Few families have been untouched by this crisis, whether by emigration, unmanageable mortgages, bills they cannot meet or job losses.  However, the Minister clearly thinks these families have more to give and so he has hit them with a family home tax, child benefit cuts, increased motor charges and hikes in the price of cigarettes and alcohol.  As someone tweeted earlier while the Minister was on his feet, because of the Minister's work in the budget today it will now cost people more to get to work where they will be paid less to take back to the home in which it now costs more to live.<\/p><p> T\u00e1 an Nollaig buailte linn, agus i gceann cupla seachtaine beimid ag ceili\u00faradh na Nollag.

It is clear he is removed from the suffering of the ordinary people.  It is clear he does not understand what they are going through and what their lives are like.  However, there is no forgiveness for not bothering to read or choosing to ignore the many reports that are put on his table explaining to him what such people are going through.  A few months ago, the Irish League of Credit Unions published a survey that demonstrated clearly that 1.8 million people now are left with less than \u20ac100 of disposable income at the end of each month.  It reported that half of all adults are struggling to pay their bills on time and that eight out of ten people are concerned about their ability to cope with increasing energy costs this winter.  What has the Government done?  It has cut child benefit, the back to school allowance and the household benefits package.  Moreover, it has reduced the length of time for jobseeker's benefit, thereby once again punishing people for losing jobs and not being able to find others because the Government will not create them.  It has reduced the redundancy rebate, which will affect employers and has increased the accident and emergency admission charge and the cost of prescription medicine.  Medical cardholders will now be obliged to pay treble, that is, \u20ac1.50, for prescription charges and the Government has lowered the medical card threshold for the over-70s.  It has cut the carer's respite grant and has increased the pupil-teacher ratio for small schools in a measure that will have a particular impact on rural areas.  In addition, it has announced, albeit not today and not as part of the book, that later on, 100 Garda stations will be consolidated.  The closure of Garda stations in rural areas will affect those communities in a terrible way.  Moreover, the Government has increased third level fees.  Not once, twice or thrice but four times has the T\u00e1naiste, Deputy Gilmore, broken his pledge.  How can he sit there on the Government benches?  While it is fair that he does not wish to make eye contact, he has broken his pledge on this issue four times because the Government increased it last year, will increase it this year and intends to increase it by \u20ac250 for the next two years.  Shame on Deputy Gilmore.  However, the Labour Party is good at making pledges and then breaking them when in office.<\/p><p> There are parents who will feel the impact of the Minister's budget in the pit of their stomachs.  I refer to parents who know their children intend to emigrate next year or who have been obliged to borrow to pay for Christmas or who will be despairing about how to feed or clothe their children on foot of the impact of the cuts to child benefit.  Child benefit is the payment that is keeping many families just above the water line and for many working families, it is the only contribution they receive from the State.  Many of them will take the blow quietly because so many feel utterly defeated.  After shouting so loudly at the ballot boxes a mere 22 months ago, a quiet despair now has crept into and settled into homes across the State.  The three members of the Government on the bench opposite are responsible for that despair.  They no doubt will try to dismiss what I am saying here as mere Opposition rhetoric, just as the Government dismisses the many calls from external groups and organisations that represent the vulnerable and the struggling.  The Government members will say there is no alternative but there is an alternative.  While they may not have bothered to read Sinn F\u00e9in's alternative budget, it set out a full list of measures, encompassing \u20ac2.7 billion in additional taxes and more than \u20ac1 billion in savings, which would have allowed the Government to make a \u20ac3.5 billion deficit adjustment this year.  As the Minister for Finance is aware, these detailed measures were costed through parliamentary questions to him and put on the public record in this House.  I believe 45 of them were costed by the Department of Finance and one, which the Government refused to cost, was costed independently by Sinn F\u00e9in.  The big difference between Sinn F\u00e9in's approach and that of the Government is we know the budget adjustment is necessary but can be made without hurting vulnerable low and middle-income families.  I recall that Colm McCarthy once noted the Government had not run out of compassion, it had run out of money.  I believe he was wrong, as the present Administration has run out of compassion, ideas and principles.<\/p><p> Today, the Government announced it will raise more than \u20ac1 billion through a family home tax, motor tax and excise duty increases.  Its family home tax will be the straw that breaks the backs of many families.  Moreover, the so-called mansion tax is nothing more than a gimmick.  If I am struggling to feed my children or to keep the roof over my head, it does not matter to me that someone down the road is paying a bit extra if I cannot afford to pay it myself.  This is what the Minister has failed to realise.  He could have introduced a wealth tax that asked for a contribution from the very wealthiest in our society.  I refer to a tax at 1% on net wealth over \u20ac1 million, which would be made up of all property.  The Minister should outline how precisely he can claim to be broadening the tax base when he goes back repeatedly to the same people to pick their pockets for a few extra euro.  It simply is not the case.  He again is hurting the most vulnerable low and middle-income earners in society.  He could have introduced a new PRSI rate for employers on income above \u20ac100,000.  Instead he decided to abolish the PRSI weekly threshold of \u20ac127, meaning all workers in the State who earn more than \u20ac127 per week will be obliged to pay an additional \u20ac264 in tax per year.  While the Minister has increased PRSI from the self-employed, what will they get for it?  Many people who are self-employed and who worked in the construction trade and other trades have been left high and dry as they are unable to avail of social welfare benefits when they find themselves to be without employment.<\/p><p> The Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach have made much of the Government's pledge to protect people\u2019s incomes.  They claimed that under the present Government, people could be sure the wage packets they take home would be secure.  Sinn F\u00e9in called on the Government to change that policy of protecting all tax earners but only to protect those earning under \u20ac100,000 per annum.  Sinn F\u00e9in asked the Government to increase the tax rates for those earning more than \u20ac100,000 per annum.  Sinn F\u00e9in also asked the Government to remove all those earning the minimum wage from the universal service charge, USC, tax net.  People who earn less than \u20ac17,000 per year spend every cent in the local economy.  Consequently, by taxing such people and failing to remove them from the USC, the Government has hurt both their quality of life and their local economy.  Sinn F\u00e9in's proposal would have put \u20ac10 a week or more than \u20ac500 a year back in the pockets of 296,000 people.  Instead, the Minister has gone after these people and has asked them to pay an additional \u20ac264 per year.  The person with a salary of \u20ac200,000 will not feel the impact of \u20ac264 a year but the person earning \u20ac18,000 per year will feel it more than the Minister could ever imagine.  This measure will bring in \u20ac289 million in a full year but a new 48% tax rate on income over \u20ac100,000 would have brought in \u20ac365 million.  That is what would have been progressive.<\/p><p> The Minister could have called for changes to the tax treatment of private pensions.  The changes to the private pension tax reliefs do not go far enough and do not even apply until 2014.  It is clear the Government has been successfully lobbied by an industry and once again, the Labour Party has made a spectacular U-turn on its own policy.<\/p><p>We called on it to standardise pension and other tax reliefs because it has been revealed time and again that the top 20% of income earners avail of 80% of those reliefs.  Instead, it allows people to continue to claim tax reliefs of up to 41% for private pensions.<\/p><p> What a short memory has the Labour Party and Deputy Gilmore.  He was not long in here before his chant went from &quot;Tax the wealthy&quot; to &quot;Tax everybody but the wealthy&quot;.  Today, it was announced that even maternity benefit will be taxed, so the Government wants to tax children before they are even born.  Shame on the Government, as this is only a couple of weeks after the children's referendum.<\/p><p> People in the middle have been asked to give again and again with nothing in return.  We can consider how today's budget will affect two people, Miche\u00e1l and Gr\u00e1inne.  They are lucky enough to each have a job paying just under the average industrial wage and they both need a car to get to work.  They have four children and the eldest is in university.  We can see how much they are being squeezed by being sent a bill of \u20ac1,759.<\/p><p> By applying PRSI to the first \u20ac127 of Miche\u00e1l\u2019s and Gr\u00e1inne\u2019s salary, the Government is charging them an extra \u20ac528 per year.  On top of that, the family home is worth \u20ac200,000 and has a large mortgage, but it will now be taxed at \u20ac405.  The child benefit they rely on to make ends meet will be slashed by \u20ac456 next year.  The band C cars they drive will be taxed at an additional \u20ac120 per year.  The eldest son in college will now have to pay an extra \u20ac250 in student contribution fees.  Miche\u00e1l and Gr\u00e1inne, with their four kids, are being charged \u20ac1,759.  If that family does not have the eldest in university but is in receipt of the back to school allowance, the bill would be \u20ac1,900.  The Government should tell that family that the budget is fair and a measure of success.<\/p><p> One of the more cynical things done by the Government is trying to spin the notion that this budget is fair, and I am sure the backbenchers will be spinning this idea.  It is not fair.  The Government has claimed it is fair because it has implemented some measures affecting high earners.  I welcome the fact the Government has introduced some of policies articulated by Sinn F\u00e9in over many years but the action does not go far enough.  We welcome the increase in capital taxes, the higher universal social charge on pensions, PRSI being extended to other forms of income, the lowering of the capital acquisitions tax threshold and the increasing of the rates of capital acquisitions and capital gains tax.  These are fair measures and I only wish the Government had implemented them before.<\/p><p> Some of these measures are blindingly obvious and we have advocated them for many years.  I cannot see why they were not implemented previously but better late than never.  The Taoiseach is smirking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500032#EE00700","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354721400,"counter":489,"content":"<p>The Deputy's leader is nodding off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500034#GG00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1354721400,"counter":490,"content":"<p>It is important not to kid ourselves.

That pain has been inflicted on a certain group of low and middle income earners; they have been deliberately targeted.<\/p><p>  A fair budget is not just about tackling high earners but instead it is about protecting people who cannot give any more.

In Sinn F\u00e9in we know this State is spending more than it takes in, and that has created a bill that must be reduced.

Those in the Government are hypocrites.  Hundreds of thousands of families will be unable to pay this tax.  Many more who will be forced to pay it will be pushed further into financial stress or poverty.  The proposal will also hurt the economy because it will take money from people's pockets which they would otherwise spend in the local economy every day.  Taking this from the pockets and cash tills in the local shop, grocer or barber, there will be a resulting cost in jobs.

For those who bought in the last decade, they are essentially paying dead money in payments on a house that is worth half of what they borrowed.  So many young families bought houses because they were encouraged, cajoled and bribed into doing so by politicians, the Government and banks.  Many of these families paid stamp duty when buying their homes, with amounts of many thousands of euro in many cases.<\/p><p>  The family home tax will not take into account what people earn.  There is a threshold of \u20ac15,000 for a single person where payment can be deferred but there will be 4% interest for that luxury.  The person who is absolutely skint will have to pay more in home taxes as not only must the tax be paid eventually but there will be interest on top.  The person who is well off can pay this charge without a blind bit of notice because his or her income has not been touched by Labour or Fine Gael.<\/p><p>  The Government faced massive resistance on the household charge of \u20ac100.  People said they could not and would not pay it.  Nevertheless, the Government has sent out threatening letters to families, building up the stress for people who could not pay.  The exemptions for the property tax are pitiful and we all know that social housing will be included.<\/p><p>The Minister stated the property tax will be levied on local authorities.  In such circumstances, local authorities will be forced to increase rents for their tenants, which is disgraceful.  The idea that people will be chased into the grave for this unjust tax is unjust and repulsive.  As I indicated, the proposed deferral is a sham.  Asking people to pay more because they do not have the money to pay the property tax in the first place is a disgrace.<\/p><p> Nobody who will struggle to pay the family home tax cares if other countries have family home taxes.  The countries in question did not have a property boom or crash, as we did, nor do they have huge household debts, as is the case across this State.  Taxes in other countries pay for free health and education and decent public services, whereas our taxes pay for the mistakes of Fianna F\u00e1il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  The family home tax will pay for bankers\u2019 salaries and bondholder bailouts.  That is the difference and the Minister should be ashamed to bring such a measure to the House. <\/p><p> A comprehensive wealth tax is the way of the future.  The Minister should look abroad to find out what his ministerial counterparts are doing in France, Spain and Iceland.  The T\u00e1naiste should note that his party's sister party in Germany, the Social Democratic Party, SPD, proposes to introduce a wealth tax, as do the Liberal Democrats in Britain. <\/p><p> Sinn F\u00e9in twice produced legislation that would have reduced the salaries of Ministers, Deputies, Senators and the Taoiseach.  Not one cent has been cut from politicians' salaries today.  We asked the Government to cut the incomes of politicians and high ranking civil servants rather than cut child benefit but despite tinkering with allowances, the basic salary of a Deputy continues to be \u20ac92,000 a year, a Minister still earns \u20ac169,000 per annum and the Taoiseach earns \u20ac200,000.  Not only does the Minister for Finance, who introduced the taxation measures that will bear down heavily on ordinary families, earn \u20ac169,000 but he still receives a ministerial pension from his previous time in office.

Today, the Minister increased motor tax, introduced changes to vehicle registration tax and blankly refused to reduce excise duty on motor fuels.  The Automobile Association calculated that between January 2009 and January 2012 the average family\u2019s monthly fuel bill more than doubled from \u20ac142 to \u20ac300.  Motorists have been squeezed at every opportunity and from every angle by successive budgets introduced by Fianna F\u00e1il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party when they ramped up excise duty on petrol and diesel.  Now they want to squeeze motorists some more. <\/p><p>  Just last week, the cost of public transport increased.  These price increases are biting at people who must pay more to get around or travel to work.  Many people in rural areas do not even have the choice of taking a Luas tram, DART, train or public bus because successive Governments have failed to invest in public transport.  Between the increases in fuel prices introduced this year and last year, motor tax hikes to be introduced next year and VRT changes, the Government is implementing a policy that makes it too costly for many families to leave their homes.  People in rural areas know the Minister has abandoned them and they will not stand for it. <\/p><p>  I am pleased the Minister announced a rebate on fuel tax for the haulage industry.  Sinn F\u00e9in proposed such a measure in our jobs plan in October and it is one I hope will provide some relief to the struggling transport sector.<\/p><p>  Sinn F\u00e9in asked the Minister to increase the taxable amounts from the super-pension pots to cover the cost of restoring more than 1 million home help hours cut by the Government last year.  Thousands of people scattered across every county do a job without any help or acknowledgement from the State.  They spend every waking hour and many an hour when the rest of us are sleeping taking care of elderly, infirm parents or severely disabled children.  They do not have nights out or holidays and their ability to work in full-time paid employment is stripped from them.  The small carer\u2019s allowance they receive is under constant threat.  These are the unrecognised heroes.  The only respite available to them is the few hours of home help they receive each week which enables them to visit the post office, chemist or grocery store and run other little errands they must attend to.   The Minister has removed from many of them the ability to live an independent life.  Home help was their chance to stay in their own homes.  Those of them with whom I have spoken say they do not want to be a burden on the State.   Again, however, the Government has taken Fianna F\u00e1il's lead on this issue and adopted its policy of placing the heaviest burden on the shoulders of those who can manage it least. <\/p><p>  The Taoiseach and T\u00e1naiste had choices but the only choice they made was to ignore all the other choices available to them.  The Government couches its budget measures in lectures on deficits, numbers and targets and claims we are getting there.  Where are we getting?  Meeting a 3% deficit in 2015 will not fill a child\u2019s belly, put clothes on children going to school or warm the house of an elderly couple who face the choice every day between heating or eating.  Where does the Government want this country of ours to be in the coming years?<\/p><p>  N\u00ed chrutha\u00edonn preas r\u00e1itis poist.

We showed how a \u20ac13 billion investment could be funded through the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, the European Investment Bank, EIB, and the private pension industry and by not cutting the capital budget.  Instead, the Government has reduced the capital budget by \u20ac500 million.  The Taoiseach would be as well taking the T\u00e1naiste, packing the bags of 5,000 young Irish people and bidding them farewell for Canada and Australia.  These young people should and could work in the construction sector if the Government did not cut the capital budget.<\/p><p>  Fianna F\u00e1il in office turned on the emigration tap, but this Government has refused to turn it off.  The people who leave our shores every year are not just numbers.  A young woman contacted me recently having just emigrated to Canada with her husband and two young girls.  She told me how her parents had described their leaving as being like a death in the family.  They mourned her leaving that night like they had mourned her brother's death several years prior.  She spoke of her distress at inflicting that on them and at taking their grandchildren away from a close-knit family and of her frustration at feeling like she had no choice.<\/p><p>  Her story is familiar but no less shocking - the mortgage that became unaffordable when the jobs were lost, the reality of a dole queue for the first time, the desperation as reminder letters came through the door, the strained meetings with banks and the realisation that the figures did not add up.  The members of that young family have uprooted their whole lives and moved to the other side of the world.  They will spend Christmas alone this year.  Her Facebook page, like many others, is full of best wishes and messages telling her how much she and her children are missed.<\/p><p>  Her message of goodbye from this State was a letter from the Department of Social Protection looking for confirmation of her flight details so that it would not overpay her child benefit.  If ever proof was needed that the Government lacked compassion, this story is it, yet it has an abundance of compassion for bankers and bondholders.  Despite the hype, the 27 bankers who receive more than \u20ac500,000 in basic salaries have not suffered a pay cut in this budget.  The rest of us must suck it up but, by God, the bankers who caused the problem will be protected at all costs by the Government.<\/p><p>  By making an adjustment of \u20ac3.5 billion today, the Government will be bringing the total in taxes and cuts to this economy in the past five years to \u20ac28 billion.  This is its second austerity budget after Fianna F\u00e1il introduced four, but the Government does not plan to stop here.  It plans to wrench a further \u20ac5 billion out of the economy in the next two budgets to 2015.<\/p><p>  As the Taoiseach knows, 2016 marks the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising.  It is fair that Deputies and people across the country ask what type of republic will we have 100 years on and what type of state will Labour, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il leave to us.  They have decimated public services, taxed families beyond the coping point and forced another generation of young Irish people abroad with little hope of return.<\/p><p>  The men and women of 1916 did not risk their lives for those three parties to tear the fabric of society.  They did not declare the Republic on the steps of the GPO so that this or the previous Government could hand the keys of Government Buildings over to the troika.  They stood up for Irish citizens, but the three parties only stand up for bankers, bondholders and vested interests.  They have sullied the vision that inspired the women and men of 1916.  In doing so, they have failed and continue to fail the people of the State.  Their arrogance and lack of compassion knows no bounds.  Their claim that there are no alternatives is pathetic.<\/p><p>  While listening to the radio last week, I was reminded of the power of ordinary people to bring about change.  In 1955, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama.  As a woman and an African American, she had been taught to accept her lot in life, to accept second class citizenship and to accept that there were no alternatives.  However, one day she decided that enough was enough and she refused to give up her seat to a white passenger.  When she was interviewed a few days later, she stated, &quot;The time had just come when I had been pushed as far as I could stand to be pushed&quot;.  Rosa Parks's act of defiance that day inspired an entire generation of civil rights campaigners to struggle for a better life.  Tired of being pushed around, she decided that she would be pushed around no longer.  She stood up for herself and all those like her who were being treated as second class citizens.<\/p><p>  In today's budget, the Government has pushed the people of this State as far as they can be pushed.  It is time for ordinary people to realise that they do not need to take this anymore.  It is time for people to take a stand.  Whether it is with Sinn F\u00e9in, behind their union banners or in their communities, they can organise and fight back.  Citizens have rights.  They elected us and can replace us.  It is time for ordinary people to draw a line in the sand and to say &quot;No&quot; to the Government's family home tax, its cuts to child benefit and its policies of emigration and unemployment.<\/p><p>  When Rosa Parks decided to say enough is enough, she gave people hope that a better future was possible.  When she decided to take a stand, she gave people the confidence to follow her lead.  Like Rosa Parks, I believe that a better future is possible, that our broken economy can be fixed, that jobs can be created and that our children can have a future in their home country.  I believe that there is an alternative to the failed policies of Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna F\u00e1il.

This is the sixth successive austerity budget, the sixth time that Ministers have announced a vicious attack on the living standards of low and middle income people and their families.  This Labour-Fine Gael Government shares the same perverse instincts as the last Fianna F\u00e1il-led Administration and the same unshakable belief that punishing struggling families is somehow fair.  It is not.  Neither is it acceptable.<\/p><p>  It is deeply insulting to the wellbeing, not to mention the intelligence, of citizens to parrot the rhetoric of fairness constantly while delivering policies that devastate their standard of living and their morale.  It is a bad joke to speak the language of economic growth and jobs while introducing another contractionary budget that will further damage the domestic economy, lengthen the dole queues and send more of our people onto the emigration trail.<\/p><p>  Despite the media hype and the supposed haggling at Cabinet, it turns out that, once again, Fine Gael has it largely its own way.  Inequality on Fine Gael's watch comes as no surprise.  It does not &quot;do&quot; social solidarity.  That is not in its DNA.  Fine Gael takes the view that the working poor or people struggling on welfare can be offered up to protect wealth and the wealthy.<\/p><p>  Today, the surrender of the Labour Party to this agenda is final and complete.  The party of James Connolly is now led by the nose, following a course that brings devastation to low and middle income workers and their families.  The Labour Party now defends the very policies that so angered it when in opposition.  It stands shoulder to shoulder with a party that it vowed to rein in as partners in government.  If Labour's plan on entering government was, as it claimed, to contain and put manners on Fine Gael, its plan has failed spectacularly.<\/p><p>  Labour has surely hit rock bottom when the only comfort that its Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, can offer to pensioners who cannot afford the new tax on the family home is that they can defer payment until after they die.<\/p><p>How gross is that?  Just like Fianna F\u00e1il before it, the Government runs a twin-track strategy of austerity, cutbacks and charges on workers alongside a craven appeasement of bondholders, bankers and international financial institutions.  When one adds to that the truly warped sense of entitlement of senior politicians and the upper echelons of the public service on bumper salaries and pensions, then the full-scale madness at play becomes evident.<\/p><p> Let us be clear; none of that is lost on the general public.  The budget is very bad news for everyone who counts the cent at the end of each week, who are put to the pin of their collar just to survive.  There is no comfort in this budget for families saddled with negative equity - who are in mortgage default or muddling by on interest-only arrangements.   There is no comfort for them but there is a tax on their home as they struggle to keep a roof over their heads.  For the average working family this budget means a tax of between \u20ac300 and \u20ac500 in a full year on their home, a cut to child benefit, a reduction in health and education services and a decrease in their take home pay.<\/p><p> The decision to set aside the PRSI exemption is truly disgraceful.  It will mean reduction of \u20ac261 per annum regardless of income.  That will be the cut, regardless of income, whether one is on \u20ac18,000 per annum or \u20ac180,000.  Not alone that, the Government also decided to tax maternity benefit.  Those who wish to start a family are to be penalised for the choice.  That is a regressive measure that is anti-family and anti-woman.  For those out of work the prospects are even grimmer, mainly because the Government has failed to deliver any job creation plan despite all of the talk.  It cynically relies on emigration \u2013 the loss of our brightest and best \u2013 to reduce the numbers on the live register.<\/p><p> The Government is to reduce the social protection spend by \u20ac452 million.  The pretence by Government that it has protected welfare payments is downright dishonest.  It is a lie.  The Government is cutting the jobseeker\u2019s benefit entitlement by three months.  That will hurt people.  People who try to get back to education are being penalised by the reduction in the back-to-education grant.  For those out of work who need additional assistance who must often wait for their welfare application to be processed, the budget for exceptional needs payments has been cut by \u20ac6 million.<\/p><p> The Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party claimed that they would protect social welfare.  We see today that they have done nothing of the sort.  The treatment of children in the budget is shocking.  It runs against all the fine words and concern for child welfare expressed in the course of the children\u2019s referendum only some weeks ago.  The Government is cutting the back-to-school allowance, which is intended to allow parents purchase clothing and footwear in order to get children back to school.  The Government thinks it is morally or politically justifiable to cut the allowance by \u20ac50.  The Minister indicated that an additional \u20ac14 million would be awarded to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  That is tokenism at its cheapest and most cynical.  No doubt the manoeuvre was cobbled together to save the blushes of the backbenchers who surely must have some strand and sense of decency left.  The Government has cut child benefit again.  I aim the point in particular at the T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gilmore, and the Labour Party.  That will hurt families.  A family with two children will be down \u20ac240 per annum, while a family with four children will lose approximately \u20ac700.<\/p><p> Perhaps Members of this House do not understand what the child benefit payment is used for.  Let me acquaint them with reality.  It pays for such things as electricity bills.  It buys a warm winter coat or a pair of shoes for children.  A cut of that nature will mean that families will not be in a position to do those ordinary and necessary things.  The Government has form in terms of child benefit.  When the cut was made last year and lone parents were targeted, the Government promised a world-class Scandinavian model of child care to compensate.  What a joke.  If one were to ask the parents of this country, in particular mothers, about this world-class service, I am pretty sure of the answer one would get.  It does not exist.  This is a bad day for children and a bad budget for parents.<\/p><p> The Government has failed the first real test of its commitment to children and their welfare since the referendum.  In direct contrast, the Government treats those on high incomes and those who are very wealthy with kid gloves.  There is no additional tax on individual incomes of more than \u20ac100,000.  There is no proposal to broaden the tax base.  One could do it by levying a wealth tax.  That would be a real property tax.  Those at the upper echelons of the civil and public service are still protected \u2013 not by the Croke Park agreement \u2013 but by the Government.  There is no tough medicine for them.  The Government has flatly refused to address the runaway pay and has tinkered around the edges of dealing with excessive pension pots of a small number in the public service.  The same Government will now go back looking for more from rank and file civil and public servants who exist on very modest incomes.  So much for fairness, reform and political change.<\/p><p> Our country is in crisis with nearly 15% of the working population on the live register.  The working class is hurting.  The middle class - middle Ireland \u2013 is hurting too.  Families who never thought they would see the inside of a community welfare office are now hard pressed to put food on the table and keep the lights on.  We have said that to the Government time out of number, yet the Government sneers at our proposal to introduce an emergency pay cap of \u20ac100,000 in the public sector.  That is a fine income but the Government sneers at the idea because it is not a choice it wishes to make.  Were the Government to make such a choice, it would have allowed it to provide free school books for every child in the State; an additional incentive for one-parent families to remain in work; it could have doubled the budget for school meals; increased the fuel season allowance by six weeks; it could have reinstated 950,000 home help hours; and it could have restored the training and materials allowance for community employment schemes.  The Government could have done all of that but it does not have the bottle to make such a choice.  While it would be a hard choice, it would also be a fair one.<\/p><p> The Government\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m alright Jack\u201d attitude is perhaps most clear in its failure today to deal with politicians\u2019 pay or to deal conclusively with allowances.  The Government has tinkered around the edges.  Bully for the Government.  Let me highlight some of the measures the Government has left intact.  It will still give committee chairpersons an additional \u20ac9,000 for the glory of chairing a committee.  It will still give so-called super-junior Ministers an additional \u20ac17,000 just for showing up at Cabinet meetings.  The Government will still shell out huge salaries in breach of its own cap to its special advisers.<\/p><p>It is a cruel irony that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, pays her special adviser \u20ac127,000 per annum.  Fancy that.  The Minister for welfare cutbacks awards her adviser \u20ac127,000.  The Government should have ended that situation today.  It should have capped the pay of special advisers.  It should have abolished the special payments for committee chairpersons.  It should have gone much further and placed a cap on politicians' pay.  If this Government was serious, worth its salt and committed to fairness that is what it would have done but the truth is that under Fine Gael and Labour, a great deal was promised but in reality the same old boys club culture remains.<\/p><p> I can see in my mind\u2019s eye the Economic Management Council, a very grandiose title.  I can see the Taoiseach, the T\u00e1naiste and the Minister for financial misery - four men in a huddle - reassuring each other, to borrow the words of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, earlier, that they would get through these difficult times.  Good for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500036#JJ00700","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354723800,"counter":511,"content":"<p>It is a bit different from the army council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500038#LL00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1354723800,"counter":512,"content":"<p>It is a pity they did not consider how others - citizens, families, mothers and women - will make it through these times.  So enamoured of themselves are they that they still pay themselves way over the odds by European standards.  I will give the Taoiseach an example.  The French President earns \u20ac20,000 a year less than the Taoiseach.  French Ministers are paid \u20ac40,000 less a year than their Irish counterparts.  I will spell that out for him.  France is not in a bailout, and its population is 13 times that of our own.  Are the Ministers opposite really worth it?  Are they for real?<\/p><p>  The health service is under unbearable strain; it is just not working.  The Minister, Deputy James Reilly, is not up to the job of management or reform.  Under his watch 870 hospital beds have closed, 1,200 nursing home beds have closed, 950,000 home help hours have been cut from the system, and there have been cuts to disability services.<\/p><p>  We know also that last year's budget was a work of fiction.  It is ironic that the very Department that requires a supplementary budget of \u20ac360 million, is now to be cut by \u20ac1.1 billion in a full year.  How on earth will the Minister do that without damaging the most basic of care?<\/p><p>  The increase in prescription fees and the cut in the drug refund scheme will add to the distress of patients of all ages but in particular it will add to the distress of parents with sick children.<\/p><p>  The Minister gives no credible detail in his budget in terms of the savings he proposes from generic medicines or private income from beds in public hospitals.  We do not have the detail on this but it is fascinating that the Minister will make a cut of \u20ac44 million to primary schemes.  He has hit the electricity and gas package for the elderly by \u20ac23 million and their telephone allocation by \u20ac61 million.<\/p><p>  The Minister has targeted education again.  Once again he will ask third level students for an additional \u20ac250.  I do not know if the Minister sees the contradiction between his stated position for educational excellence for a knowledge economy and pricing students out of education but students can now see his two-faced approach.  He sold them a pup at the last election.  He will not do that again because the students are not fools.<\/p><p>  It is less than three weeks to Christmas and families have scrimped and saved to provide for the holiday period.  People do not have very much now, but they still have pride in themselves and in their families.  They still have a sense of what is right, fair and just.<\/p><p>  The need to take tough decisions is a constant refrain of this Government but tough for who?  It confuses hard decisions with bad decisions.  It looks for soft options and soft targets.  The spectacle of a Government that talks tough when punishing its own people and yet time and again returns home from European Council meetings with its tail between its legs is truly pitiful.  It is unworthy of those it represents.<\/p><p>  Has the Taoiseach had the tough talk with Angela Merkel or the lads from the troika?  Has he told them that we cannot and should not be expected to pay the debts of others?  He has not.  He disguises his lily livered, gutless interaction with our European Union partners with guff about repairing our international reputation.  Give us a break.<\/p><p>  If the Taoiseach is unable to secure a deal on the debt burden, on the promissory note, and if he is incapable of deficit reduction that does not crush low and middle income families then he is not up to the job of government.  It is that simple.<\/p><p>  This Government is now 20 months in office and this is its second budget.  There is nowhere for it to hide.  It chose the well-worn path of the Fianna F\u00e1il gang that went before it.  Fianna F\u00e1il brought this State to its knees and now Labour and Fine Gael are keeping it there.  Fianna F\u00e1il sheltered the rich, protected wealth and insulated privilege.  Now this Government follows suit.  Its choice is to protect those at the top and punish the rest.  It should not come into this D\u00e1il ever again and waffle about fairness.  This Government is not fair.  It could not handle fairness, and its budget today is testament to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500038#LL00300","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1354723800,"counter":513,"content":"<p>We now move on to time allocated to the Technical Group.

It is not a day of hard choices, as it kept repeating.  It is a day of cruel choices inflicted by those who are protecting the privileged and the powerful on those who are struggling and in despair.  It is a day when it has driven tens of thousands of families who were teetering on the edge of poverty into poverty.  It is a day when it has hammered a few more nails into the coffin of the battered Irish economy.<\/p><p>  I say to the T\u00e1naiste that this Government had a choice.  A few simple measures could have done away with the need for all the suffering it has inflicted on ordinary families today.  If it had simply enforced, as we suggested, the 12.5% corporation tax rate and increased in a significant way the taxes on those earning in excess of \u20ac100,000 a year, as 88% of the population now want it to do, it could have done away with the need for all this suffering and despair and all those families being driven into poverty.<\/p><p>  If the Government had done that not only could it have prevented these vicious cuts but it would have had the resources to reverse some of the most vicious cuts imposed in recent years.  It could have abolished the universal social charge for those on average incomes.  It could have lifted the special needs assistant, SNA, caps that have caused such suffering to some of the most vulnerable families.  It could have reinstated the Christmas bonus for social welfare recipients and for pensioners.  It could have reinstated the home help hours for the elderly and the disabled.  It could have reversed the increases in registration fees and the cuts in grants for students and many more of the nasty cuts that have been imposed in the past two years.  To do all of that would have cost approximately \u20ac3 billion.  Those measures alone would have been covered just by making the corporations that made \u20ac70 billion in pre-tax profits last year pay a little more tax, and all that suffering could have been avoided.<\/p><p>Instead, the Government made a coldhearted decision to attack those who have nothing or next to nothing yet again.  The property tax will cost ordinary families hundreds of euro, \u20ac300 or \u20ac400 extra per year.  How will the 1.3 million people in this country who have less than \u20ac50 a month left over pay the charge?  They simply do not have it.  How will they pay for the cuts to child benefit?  If they have three children, they will lose \u20ac38 per month.  How will they deal with the \u20ac20 per month loss in earnings if they are working, as a result of the abolition of the weekly PRSI allowance?  The 1.3 million people with less than \u20ac50 a month after they pay their bills will have that \u20ac50 and more taken from them as a result of these measures.  This will drive them into poverty.<\/p><p> Then there are some of the really nasty cuts.  The decision to cut the respite care grant for families with children with disabilities is obnoxious.  Some \u20ac356 has been taken from families with disabled children or family members when it could give them some respite once a year.  It is an outrage to cut the back-to-school allowance by \u20ac50 for some of the poorest families in the country.  The Government had choices to avoid this suffering and make those who have the money and the profits pay a little more so the poor and the struggling do not have to struggle more than they do.  The Government could have marshalled funds by imposing taxes to fund a stimulus and jobs programme to put people in this country back to work so they can contribute to the economic recovery we so badly need.  None of that will happen and, shamefully, the Government restated its commitment to selling off our forests and other State assets and enterprises that could be the vehicles for job creation and economic recovery.  Shame on the T\u00e1naiste and shame on this Government.  This is a recipe for long-term economic depression and suffering for hundreds of thousands of families.  The Government had a choice; why did it not take it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500038#LL00500","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354724400,"counter":516,"content":"<p>The entire approach to this budget is flawed.  The Government is taking \u20ac3.5 billion from the Irish people and handing it to Anglo Irish Bank as payment on a debt we never owed.  The Government is taking \u20ac3.5 billion from the Irish people but the deficit will fall by less than \u20ac1 billion.  Why is that?  It is because of the payment of almost \u20ac2 billion of interest to Anglo Irish Bank on a debt we never owed.  The Government will allow AIB to retain a \u20ac1.1 billion top-up to its pension fund.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated that tax compliance is a core principle of our democracy.  He lectures the people on their obligation to pay a property tax, the entire benefit of which he will hand to Anglo Irish Bank.<\/p><p>  The Government brought forward virtually no meaningful investment measures.  Instead, it announces a cut to funding in our third level sector.  This is madness.  What is the result?  Yes, GDP is rising very slightly but it is rising because of exports by our multinationals.  The profits all get expatriated.  GNP, the measure of Irish companies, will rise by less than 1%.  The Government makes much play of the fall in unemployment but it is due to emigration.  The number of people at work has fallen by 35,000 in the past year.  The austerity only approach, which feeds tens of billions of euro to two dead casinos, is doomed to failure.  This budget is the latest chapter in that sad approach.<\/p><p>  The Government spoke earlier about fairness.  Let us examine the numbers.  Between 2012 and 2013, if one earns \u20ac20,000, income tax will increase by 1.3%.  If one earns \u20ac120,000, it will increase by 0.2%.  There is an increase in tax on a person earning \u20ac20,000, which is 32 times bigger than the increase in tax for someone earning \u20ac120,000.  The property tax, the change to PRSI, cuts to child benefit and the increases to duty, motor tax and carbon tax are regressive.  I do not know how the Government can use the word fairness with a straight face.  The budget is a massacre of those in the negative equity generation.  The Government is cutting their child benefit, increasing their income tax and charging them for homes they despise, which are debt around their necks.  If they are renting out their house and renting another house to live in because they cannot afford to buy a bigger house to live in with their children, the Government will charge 7.5% PRSI on the rental income from the house they do not want, which is in negative equity and on which they are now being charged a property tax.  It is a joke.<\/p><p>  The austerity only approach does not work, a point on which history is unambiguous.  Further payments to the banks cannot be justified when this is being asked of the people.  The Government makes great play of being 85% of the way there.  This is rubbish.  One payment of \u20ac31 billion was made to Anglo Irish Bank, which is a nominal accounting measure.  The deficit peaked in 2009 at \u20ac22 billion.  Next year, the deficit will be \u20ac13 billion so we are less than halfway through correcting the deficit.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, stated future generations will be proud of the work done today.  They will not.  They will ask why their country was decimated in the name of anonymous bondholders and why their schools and colleges were stripped of teachers and investment.  They will ask why they are still paying for the debts of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  No Government should ask its people what is being asked by the Government.<\/p><p>  I accept the deficit must be closed if the Government stops the \u20ac5 billion payment to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide and takes back the \u20ac1.1 billion pension top-up from AIB and directs it towards education, job stimulus, investment and protecting vulnerable groups and reversing the most egregious cuts and reducing inequality.  Then we can start to a genuine recovery in the economy.  Vote after vote in the House tonight will push us further down the failed path failed of austerity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500039#MM00200","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1354724400,"counter":517,"content":"<p>The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin said, \"What the Irish people have endured has been tough and almost without precedent in the developed world\".  He says this as if we should be proud of it.  Is he proud that children, pensioners, medical card holders, the unemployed, low earners and the self-employed will carry the can?  How can people look to the future with confidence, as Deputy Noonan exhorted them to do today?  This is a most regressive budget that will make people who are already struggling go below the water line.<\/p><p>  The introduction of the property tax ensures it will be resisted by many people.  The 0.18% rate is deliberately set low so that when local authorities take over the levying of the tax the real increases will kick in.  Coincidently, this will only happen after the local elections in 2014.  Does the Government think people will be fooled by this?  There are very few exemptions from the property tax.  Allowing people on low incomes to defer the tax and slapping an interest rate of 4% on them for doing it will be no comfort to them.  Forcing people to build up future debts on the back of the property tax is only building further resentment at the targeting of the weakest in society yet again.  The opposition to this tax will be fierce and rightly so.  The people of Ireland will, through their opposition, force fairness on the Government.  Opposition to the tax is not for the sake of it but is opposition to the strategy that the Government is pursuing of making the weakest sectors in society liable for the debts of the European banking system.<\/p><p>Removing the \u20ac127 PRSI exemption is also hard to stomach.  A person earning \u20ac18,000 a year will pay the same PRSI increase as we Deputies, who earn \u20ac92,000.  How can a Labour Party Minister justify that?  The Fine Gael Party guaranteed no increases in income tax but for low income workers PRSI is a tax on income.  How can the Minister say he has not increased taxation?<\/p><p> The Labour Party made much of wanting to increase the universal social charge for those earning over \u20ac100,000 per year.  They lost that battle to their masters in coalition yet they are happy to take away the PRSI threshold.  The Labour Party does not protect the vulnerable; it targets them more and more.<\/p><p> The increase of the self-employed PRSI annual contribution to \u20ac500 is a sickening blow for self-employed.  They get very little in return for their contribution.  I have pushed the Minister for the last two years to allow access to benefits for the self-employed that would offer them support if they need it and would justify increased contributions, but it falls on deaf ears.  The Government makes much of the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund as a reason not to provide self-employed people with benefits and these measures are being dressed up as a way to close the deficit.  The fact is that the Social Insurance Fund should be in deficit when we are in a recession and built up when we are in recovery.  The Government does not see that. <\/p><p> Taxing maternity benefit is hard to believe.  It seems like a mean spirited measure.  It is targeted to raise \u20ac40 million in a full year and makes the children of the country pay once again.<\/p><p> Again and again, we see the vulnerable being hit.  The back-to-school clothing allowance, the respite care grant and household packages for the elderly and disabled are being cut.  Reducing the respite care grant by \u20ac320 will hit families who use this to get some relief for a disabled or elderly family member.  We can add to this the cut in child benefit of \u20ac10 per month, which is simply lazy.  This is another across the board cut.  A family on social welfare with three children will lose \u20ac30 a month.  A family with three children on \u20ac100,000 a year will lose \u20ac30 a month.  Where is the equity in that?<\/p><p> If the Labour Party had the will, a system could have been put in place to have a fairer targeting of cuts in child benefit.  I put proposals to the Minister that would have saved \u20ac120 million on child benefit but would only target those earning over \u20ac80,000 a year. This could have been achieved without a heavy administrative burden on the Department.  There are almost 700,000 children in families on low incomes either dependent on social welfare, getting family income supplement or earning under \u20ac80,000 per year in this country.  The Minister could have protected those children but chose not to. <\/p><p> The 200% increase in the medical card prescription charge once again targets the vulnerable.  It is the only part of the health budget that people can be sure will be delivered on.  Once again, \u20ac51 million is to be taken from the most vulnerable.  I have no faith, like the rest of the country, that the Minister will deliver the savings he says he will from the reduction in the costs of prescription drugs.  Does anyone in the House really believe that he will achieve \u20ac330 million in savings?<\/p><p> The Minister said the budget protects the vulnerable.  The budget measures are a litany of attacks on the most vulnerable. There is nothing in the budget that will protect those who need it.<\/p><p> The Fine Gael Party is only interested in balancing the books and does not care what the impact of the changes are, but the Labour Party should care, or should not have told everyone it will protect the vulnerable.  The Labour Party has rolled over and has no credibility left.  No one will think that Labour are looking after anyone except themselves.  That is the sad reality.<\/p><p> Hope for people died when the Government took on the policies of the Fianna F\u00e1il Party in 2011 and ditched its election promises.  In the last two budgets the Government has taken ownership of those policies and built on them.  It is clear that this is no country for the poor, the vulnerable and those who need to be protected the most.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500039#MM00300","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354725000,"counter":519,"content":"<p>There is a huge element of the annual Christmas pantomime about this debate.  There are the usual set pieces and routines.  We have heard it all before.  There is mock indignation from the people who started the austerity and robust defence of the measures from the other side of the House.  For the people outside the gates and in their homes, however, this is not a pantomime and there will not be a happy ending.  People are terrified and angry.  We can say what we like in here and the Government can dress it up, but everything has got worse for people.  Any leeway they had is gone.  There are people who were in work and are no longer in work.  There are people who are in work who are working harder for considerably less.<\/p><p>  The only solutions to these problems being put forward by the Government is to dish up more of the same.  This is the economics of lunacy.  No matter how one dresses it up, this is Robin Hood in reverse.  The Government is robbing the poor to continue to allow those at the top to get away scot free.  One would expect that of Fine Gael.  They are playing to their constituency and doing what they said they would do.  <\/p><p>  For the Labour Party, on the hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the party to stand over this and for Labour Deputies to have more interest in their mobile telephones than in the budget debate is a disgusting indication of how far the party has fallen.  It has chosen to wage war on ordinary people.  The budget contains not a single measure to tackle the wealthy.  If the actual rate of corporation tax were imposed and corporations were forced to pay what they owe, it would negate any other measure in the budget.  I do not even speak about tackling the high earners or going after them with a wealth tax.  Instead, the Government has chosen to target the vulnerable. <\/p><p>  Thirty years ago, the Labour Party's predecessors brought down a Government on the issue of VAT on children's shoes.  Labour Party Deputies now vote for a home tax.  Let us call it what it is.  This home tax is the equivalent of VAT on 40 pairs of children's shoes, yet they sit there with not a bother on them.  It is a disgrace.    <\/p><p>  We have dealt with the issue of targeting mothers by taxing maternity benefit and stripping electricity payments and telephone allowances from pensioners.  People who have worked all their lives see their entitlement to jobseeker's benefit reduced, respite care is slashed, hospital charges are increased and so on.  <\/p><p>  The big one is the home tax.  A basic roof over one's head is a massive whopping liability for so many people, and the Government is asking them to pay a tax on it.  Council tenants are included in the net because local authorities will be levied for all the houses in their stock.  They have no money so they will pass the tax on to tenants.  Poor people are allowed the luxury of deferring the payment and paying a higher rate of interest.  This is lunacy.  Thankfully, I do not think people will pay the tax because they do not have the means to do so.    <\/p><p>  There are about 200 garda\u00ed outside the gate of Leinster House today.  I thought they were here to stop the daylight robbery that is going on in here, but it became apparent that they are here to protect the members of the Government.  They need protection because the people are not going to stand idly by and allow them drive the country into the depths of despair.  They will not tolerate it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500040#NN00200","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1354725000,"counter":520,"content":"<p>Whenever a budget appears a critical question must be asked.  Does the budget seriously address the massive levels of inequality in our society?  Does it make a genuine effort to close the gap between the top 10% and the bottom 10%?  Sadly, the answer today, as with previous austerity budgets, is &quot;No&quot;.<\/p><p><br \/>  A few days ago, I found a page from <i>The Guardian <\/i>which I had kept from 8 December 2010, the day after the last budget of the Fianna Fail-Green Party Government.  The headline was, &quot;Poor Pay Price of Saving Ireland's Economy&quot;.  The article went on to say:<blockquote>During the budget debate in the D\u00e1il, Fine Gael spokesman on Finance, Michael Noonan, accused the Fianna F\u00e1il-Green Party Government of being socially blind and said the budget was soft on the rich and hard on the poor.  Michael Noonan added, &quot;This is the budget of a puppet government doing what it is told by the IMF, the EU and the ECB&quot;.  <\/blockquote>He was right.<blockquote>Irish Labour Finance spokeswoman, Joan Burton, said the winners in the budget were the bankers, both foreign and Irish, who were hoovering our money.  She said responsibility was not being borne by reckless lenders or those who lent to them.  She said the budget would leave Irish society more divided than ever.<\/blockquote>She was right.<\/p><p><br \/>  That same month, as they prepared for an election, Fine Gael said a recurring residential property tax on people's homes would be unfair for a number of reasons. <\/p><p>The party said it would be difficult for asset rich but income poor households to pay, particularly the elderly and the unemployed, and that it would be deeply unfair for a young generation who paid exorbitant amounts of stamp duty and VAT on the purchases of over-valued houses, many of whom are now in negative equity.  Once again, Fine Gael was right.  Within three months, Fine Gael and the Labour Party were in power and how power changed everything.  The people of Ireland voted for change, but they did not get it.  They got lots more of the same.  The gap between what politicians say they will do and what they do in reality has been well exposed.<\/p><p> The injustice of how the pain has been shared is breathtaking.  The Government's decision to allow a neoliberal philosophy from Europe to shape policy has seen the most vulnerable suffer most.  We are also witnessing the development of a new poor from the ranks of the middle class.  We have reached a stage in Ireland where the majority of people are struggling to pay their household bills - over 50%.  Only the best off have been spared.  Offering support for families that need it should be seen as a function of society and of Government.  For too long politics has capitulated to the idea of evaluating outcomes when often the parts that work cannot be counted and the parts that can be counted do not work.<\/p><p> Today, unemployment haunts Ireland as massive emigration helps to keep the figure below the 500,000 mark.  The people of Ireland care more about the jobs deficit than about the budget deficit.  Austerity has failed and fiscal consolidation has failed to spur growth or tackle unemployment.  Growth requires financial investment, investment that does not suit the political thinking of our masters in Europe or our own Fine Gael-Labour Party Government at home.  Basic economics teaches us the best way to cut borrowing levels in the long term is to get people back to work.  As John Maynard Keynes put it, look after unemployment and the budget will look after itself.  Europe's crisis, however, is not just about economics.  Unlike GDP or inflation, unemployment is the only major economic indicator that measures real human beings.  Unemployment is not a price worth paying.  Sadly, at the moment Europe has a different idea, and Ireland has a different idea.<\/p><p> What has been happening in the past few years is nothing short of a complete rewriting of the social contracts that have existed since the Second World War.  In these contracts, renewed legitimacy was restored in the capitalist system after it had been discredited by the Great Depression.  In return, they provided a welfare state that guaranteed minimum provisions for all those burdens most citizens must contend with throughout their lives, such as child care, education, health, unemployment, disability or old age.  The path we are now taking does not put the interests of people first.  We are looking at a system with deep structural inequalities and a rigid adherence to a failed economic ideology that protects neither democracy or human rights.<\/p><p> Our domestic economy is struggling to breathe and the Government says there is only one way to deal with it, but there is always an alternative.  Another world is possible.  Cutting the deficit is vital but it must be done at the right time and in the right way or it will make things worse.  Austerity is squeezing the life from the economy at the very time it needs more oxygen.  It is squeezing the life out of the people.  There is nothing inevitable about high and growing inequality.  Different paths chosen by others bear this out.  Nations can choose to be high tax with good social services, like the Nordic countries, or follow the American model of the survival of the fittest.  Austerity economics pretends there is no alternative.<\/p><p> A recent OECD report, Divided We Stand, noted that in the western world, the gap between the incomes of the top 10% and the bottom 10% has multiplied by a factor of 14 in the past 25 years.  The experience in the West has shown that social mobility happens least where incomes are most unequal.  When the fate of young people is fixed by their parents' fortunes, it reinforces the vicious cycle of poverty.  The widening wages gap, and the emergence of a winner takes all culture, has been worsened by cuts to benefits as low incomes fail to keep pace with the rise in earnings.  Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, hardly a left wing thinker, recently said that the principal problem facing the developed world is the strong shift in the market reward for a small minority of citizens relative to the rewards available for most other citizens.  In Ireland, much progress was made on taking children out of poverty but the austerity budgets of the past few years are undermining that progress.  They are forcing children back into poverty.  It is not possible to reduce child poverty at the same time as cutting child benefit.  How do we measure the savings against the long-term costs?  What is the cost of child poverty?  This is false economics.  It fails the economy, it fails society and it fails the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500040#NN00300","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354725600,"counter":522,"content":"<p>This budget is a grave attack on children, families, the disabled and our senior citizens.  It is a budget steeped in unfairness and full of broken promises, especially from the Labour Party.  It is also a budget of the wrong choices for our citizens and it is steeped in inequality.  Let the lesson be today that this Government has broken many promises, especially as it knows full well the economic reality for many families on the ground.  It will go down in history as a budget that pushed many people over the edge, with a lack of vision, compassion and economic reality.  People are hurting but the Government put the boot in even harder to families, carers, the disabled, the unemployed, small businesses and our senior citizens.<\/p><p>  The facts in today's budget speak for themselves.  Child benefit will be reduced by \u20ac10 per month, another broken promise.  The respite care grant is being reduced by \u20ac325.  The changes in the household benefits package will see cuts of up to \u20ac20 million.  There are increases in the drugs payment scheme threshold and charges for medical card holders.  In education, there are increases in the student contribution by \u20ac250 in 2013, 2014 and 2015.  That is the reality of this budget, the reality of what happened today in the D\u00e1il.  The VECs will be cut by another \u20ac13 million in 2013.  These schools serve many disadvantaged pupils.<\/p><p>  The prescription charge for medical card holders is being increased from 50 cent to \u20ac1.50 per item, with the monthly cap for a family rising from \u20ac10 to \u20ac19.50.  The drug payment scheme threshold is being increased from \u20ac132 to \u20ac144, a cut of up to \u20ac10 million.  People who are over 70 will have their medical cards replaced with a GP only card.  This is all part of today's budget.  Health and disabilities have been slashed once again. <\/p><p>  I notice the Minister mentioned the Croke Park agreement in his speech, which I support.  For many people the reality of the Croke Park agreement is very difficult.  For St. Michael's House, which provides disability services, the most significant challenge it faces is the waiting list for residential care, which is the longest in the country.  There are 317 people on the priority list for residential services.  Some 45 of these families are in serious difficulties and significant pressure is being exerted on the organisation to provide residential services for this group.  Currently, there are 283 adults with an intellectual disability living with one or more parent who is over 70.  That is the reality - adults with intellectual disability in their 40s and 50s whose parents are dead or too elderly to cope, and there are 45 such families on the emergency waiting list.<\/p><p>That issue could be resolved tomorrow morning if there was the political will.  It is not a huge number.<\/p><p><br \/> St Michael's House has lost &#8364;11.2 million in cuts.  Under the Croke Park agreement it has reduced its staff by 160, reduced absenteeism from 6.5 % to 3.5% and has reduced administration staff by 34%.  There is an example of productivity, but what will the Government do?  It will cut again.  A 1% cut for these families means &#8364;700,000 from their service.  A 3% cut means a reduction of &#8364;2.1 million.  That should be compared with the billions of euro being pumped into the banks.  St Michael's House will have intermittent closures in day services, residential services and respite services.  It will have a reduction in transport services, support services and clinical services.  This is the reality for many families and people with disabilities.<\/p><p><br \/> In 1941 US President Franklin D. Roosevelt said:<blockquote>There is nothing mysterious about the foundations of a healthy and strong democracy.  The basic things expected by our people of their political and economic systems are simple.  They are: equality of opportunity for youth and for others; jobs for those who can work; security for those who need it; the ending of special privilege for the few; the preservation of civil liberties for all; and the enjoyment of the fruits of scientific progress in a wider and constantly rising standard of living.<\/blockquote>Sadly these are missing from today's budget.<\/p><p><br \/> Some &#8364;3 million is being spent on special advisers, which equates to 300,000 home help hours.  It is a disgraceful situation.  We also have the home tax which is an attack on the family, on young couples in negative equity and on senior citizen couples under financial pressure.  At one time the Taoiseach was opposed to the home tax and now he supports it.  The budget should have been about fairness and sorting out our public finances.  However, all we get are more cuts and attacks on families, the family home, children, the disabled, the carers, the unemployed and low-paid workers.  It is a budget steeped in injustice.  I will be voting against it and I urge all Deputies to reject it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500041#OO00200","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354726200,"counter":524,"content":"<p>This is a deeply unfair and shameful budget that attacks the most vulnerable in society.

Central Statistics Office figures indicate that 200,000 children live in poverty and 500 children are homeless.  However, the Minister for Social Protection - an odd title - has cut \u20ac10 from the first and second child, \u20ac18 from the third child and, from 1 January 2014, \u20ac30 from the fourth child.

This is a disgraceful and shameful attack on families.  It shows that the Labour Party has absolutely nothing in common with the Labour Party of James Connolly, Jim Larkin or any of the founders of the party.  The budget hits almost every other section in society.  Carers, who look after those with disabilities, are having their respite care grant cut.  There are attacks on the elderly in the electricity, gas and telephone allowance household package schemes.  There is a shameful attack on low income families - the working poor - with the abolition of the \u20ac127 PRSI allowance.  There is the property tax, or family home tax as it should be called, which is a major attack on families, on the 160,000 mortgage holders who are in distress, on the half of mortgage holders who are in negative equity and on local authority tenants who are being hit for the first time under this tax.  Of course, it bears no relationship to ability to pay.  The increases in prescription charges and for the drug payment scheme are also an attack on the elderly.<\/p><p>  The approach in the budget is wrong.  It is more austerity, more cuts and more taxes.  That approach has patently failed.  The budget should be about job creation.  Since it came to power the Government has actually destroyed jobs.  In the year to 30 June, the Government's figures show that 33,400 net jobs were lost to the economy.  In the quarter to 30 September, 5,800 net jobs were lost.  Built into the budget is a loss of jobs this year, no increase in jobs next year and a very modest increase in jobs in 2015, which is only a target.<\/p><p>  We need a complete change of approach.  We need to stop the austerity.  We need to tax the wealthy; there is huge wealth in society.  We need to stop paying the debt.  Some \u20ac9 billion will leave the country next year in the payment of debt.  We were told that would stop.  Remember the promises to burn the bondholders and not a single cent for the banks.  We need direct creation of jobs by the State because there is a major job strike and investment strike by people in this country.<\/p><p>  The trade union movement has a responsibility with regard to the budget.  Can Labour-affiliated trade unions stand over this shameful budget which attacks the working poor and the most vulnerable in society?

However, to understand why cuts and increased taxes are being imposed we need to consider the big picture.  The big picture is the astronomical cost of servicing the debt.  Some of that debt was legitimately built up but other elements were imposed on us as a result of the bailout.  We are paying slightly over \u20ac8 billion in interest.  A bailout gives the impression that we are getting something and it will be something positive, but in fact it is a very expensive loan to pay for dead banks and to pay back bondholders.  It pays for things we should never have incurred in the first place.  For that our EU partners call us \"special\".<\/p><p>  Both Government parties promised to renegotiate the debt and free up money for a stimulus.  We were going to get a strategic investment that was to create tens of thousands of jobs.<\/p><p>If I remember rightly, the target was 100,000 jobs.  There are jobs initiatives in this budget which are welcome but they will have a tiny impact on the level of unemployment.  The reduction of three months in respect of jobseekers' payments makes me wonder what people are paying PRSI for, yet lower income workers are being drawn into that system.  We are getting more TUS schemes when what we want is more jobs.  <\/p><p> In its manifesto, Fine Gael told us that it was not going to impose a property tax because it would impose a tax on people who are income poor and asset rich, mainly elderly people.  It spoke about people in negative equity who are most affected by this budget and this tax.  A property tax takes little account of ability to pay.  The value of the home may be considered without any consideration of the level of debt attached to it.  People who have paid stamp duty and development contributions now see a facility in the budget for someone to buy the house next door for half the price being exempted because he or she is a first-time buyer.  That will create significant resentment.  I do not believe it is about first-time buyers.  Rather, it is about the property market first and foremost.<\/p><p> There is a trend here that we saw before.  It seems that this will be a slush fund for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to shore up a dysfunctional local government system that delivers a tiny range of services.  If we look at some European systems, we can see that everything from child care to policing to leisure facilities is paid for by property or poll taxes or rates.  The inequitable distribution of the fund has been a feature for decades and I have no confidence that this will change in centralised environment.  Other charges will be imposed, such as those for water and waste water.  People are paying for the maintenance of roads through their motor tax and paying bin charges.  What will they get for paying this property tax?  It is a valid question for people to ask.  We must remember that the reason for this is an decrease of just over 40% in the income of local authorities since 2009.  This has been taken from the local authorities to pay back this significant debt.  <\/p><p> The silo-by-silo based approach to the budget ignores the cumulative effect of its impact.  This includes the imposition of a property tax, cuts to child benefit, increases in the cost of solid fuel, the fact that people will no longer be exempt from paying PRSI on the first \u20ac127 of their weekly income, the now annual increase in third level registration fees and the increase in the monthly threshold for the drug repayments scheme from \u20ac132 to \u20ac144 per month.  Some families pay this every month.  If one pays this every month, that comes to \u20ac1,700 per year, which is a very sizeable amount.  The cumulative effect is affecting possibly the same households with all those measures having a major impact on them.  People are already struggling and the cumulative effect of this will in some cases take the food off people's tables.  Some are just about keeping the roof over their heads.  I am very concerned that the level of personal debt has not been considered in this context.  <\/p><p> I welcome the vouching system for political expenses which should have gone further.  Had the leader's allowance provided to Independents been at the level it is now and the other allowances reduced to that level, it would have generated savings to the Exchequer of \u20ac1.197 million.  The travel and accommodation allowance should have been tackled.  I do not believe the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is the appropriate body to oversee any kind of review.  It should be an independent review as the commission is not representative and the process is not transparent and not good enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500042#PP00500","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354726800,"counter":529,"content":"<p>Today is the beginning and the end of the budget debate.  It is the beginning and the end of the discussion of how we finance vital public services.  I say it is the beginning and the end because regardless of what the Opposition say, the Government will still plough ahead with what is obvious economic suicide.  We were told by the Government that we could make a submission if we wished.  If that process was one of serious engagement, it would be great but it is not.  It is a process that demands that we show the Government what we have but we do not get to see what the alternative is - that is, until today when it is too late.<\/p><p>  The most striking part of the two Ministers' speeches was the use of the slippery language of deceit.  Yeats and Wilde must be turning in their graves at how the English language was abused here today in order to justify the unjustifiable.  The Minister for Finance says with a totally straight face that unemployment is down.  There is no mention of the fact that people are leaving this country in droves.  If a tsunami came to our shores and one half of our population was wiped out, would the Minister come in here the next day and tell us how he solved the unemployment crisis?  If he did this, it would be no more farcical than what he said today.  The Government can try to ignore and forget the people who left this country but we will not forget them.  Unemployment is only down because of what the Government has done, namely, driven them out of the country.  <\/p><p>  The unemployment crisis will remain the same unless some fundamental reforms are made, many of which were promised when the two Government parties were looking for votes.  Upward only rent reviews is one example.  This is crippling businesses but the Government now claims that it would not be possible to tackle it.  How convenient but for whom?  It is not convenient for the ordinary people.<\/p><p>  Local government reform was promised.  Meaningful reform would mean huge savings which could be passed on in the form of rates reductions.  Current rate levels are unsustainable and are crippling existing businesses and preventing new entries into business.  One example is a hotel in Roscommon which remains closed because anyone interested in opening it would face a rates bill of almost \u20ac50,000 per annum.  I predict the hotel will fall into a state of disrepair and become derelict because of unsustainably high rates.  At the same time, the manager of Roscommon County Council earns more than the Prime Minister of Spain.  There is a suite of directors of services costing the guts of \u20ac750,000 per year.  We also have more chief and assistant fire officers - a total of four costing \u20ac400,000 per year - than New York city.  The Government is standing by this.  The result of this madness is that businesses are crippled with high rate bills and the Government is doing nothing about it.  <\/p><p>  Healthy competition between businesses is the lifeblood of a successful economy.  When this Government came to power, we were promised a robust Competition Authority.  We have had no luck there.  The former head of the Competition Authority, John Fingleton, estimated that lax enforcement was costing the Irish economy \u20ac4 billion per year.  The Government would get many home helps out of that.  What did the Government do to help business?  It introduced the Competition (Amendment) Act which was not worth the paper it was written on.  It contained no provision for civil fines and no rewards for whistleblowers although we know what the Government thinks about them because we heard it in the D\u00e1il yesterday.  It contained no effective private enforcement even though it is part of European law.  The Government is great at telling me about European law but not very good at sticking to it.  There was a failure to prevent regulatory capture.  Finally, to show that this Government does not believe in real competition, the Competition Authority is underfunded to the point where there are only two garda\u00ed taking care of it.  We have more garda\u00ed in a small part of west Roscommon than that.  <\/p><p>  Put all this together and it is clear that the Government is crippling business.  We often hear about governments that are pro-business and pro-people.  This Government is neither and is the enemy of both business and people.  Does the Government believe the Irish League of Credit Unions when it states that 1.8 million people are left with only \u20ac100 at the end of every month?  If it did, it would not have done what it did with PRSI today, would not have imposed a further property tax and would not have cut the suckler cow premium scheme for farmers.  If the Government gave a damn, it would not have cut child benefit.  I know some members of the Government might use it for holidays but when I was growing up, it was used to pay the electricity bill.<\/p><p>The Government might not call electricity a core need of a family but I do.  I believe families have a right to it.  If the Government cared about ordinary people it would have done something about household and mortgage debt.  Instead it has left the whip hand with the people who destroyed the country, namely, the bankers.  They decide whether to cut one's debt and will they do so?  No, they will not.<\/p><p> What would I have done?  That is why I am here.  What would my alternative have been?  I would have approached the multinational companies and told them the Government of the past two years had made a mess of running the country.  I would have told them we are on the brink of collapsing as a society, something which is neither of benefit to them nor the ordinary people of Ireland.  I would have informed them that Ireland was embarking on reform which would make the country more competitive and leaner than ever before.  I would also have informed them that this process would take two years and to achieve it during this time a levy of 2.5% would be put on corporation tax.  At the end of two years of real reform the levy would be lifted and their companies would do even better in an economy where price competition for services existed.  This levy would raise \u20ac750 million.<\/p><p> I would also refuse to pay the promissory notes, which according to a research paper I had prepared by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service would save us \u20ac1.3 billion.  Standardising tax breaks for pension contributions to 20% would increase the tax take by \u20ac700 million.  Eliminating tax free status on lump sum pensions would save \u20ac170 million.

I must question the people who protested at the event and the cost of this to the State.  We must be able to cherish our heritage and history.  We have differences of opinion here but I meant to drop in to say hello but I did not have time.  I am glad the T\u00e1naiste had a f\u00edor f\u00e1ilte and that he enjoyed it.  I hope his work was successful.<\/p><p>  However, I completely differ with the T\u00e1naiste on the budget.  He made many promises prior to the election and made many attacks from this side of the House.  I am disappointed because it is a horrible budget.  It was divided into two little booklets and presented by two Ministers.  It was well massaged and the nuances are hidden.  I will refer to page 15 of the document produced by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Why can an assessment not be done on child benefit?  Why can it not be means tested instead of cut across the board?  I do not accept it would cost too much and that the officials could not do it.  That is ridiculous in this day and age.  There is no fairness.<\/p><p>  The back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance is a necessary scheme and can be the difference between people going to school and staying at home.  Our young people have a right to education.  The changes to the farm assist scheme will be a big blow to rural Ireland.  I am appalled by what is being done to jobseeker's benefit.  With regard to the redundancy payments scheme, why would any self-employed person want to employ people?  If for some reason he or she must let them go, the full redundancy scheme must be paid.  The employer rebate element was previously 65% and this had been reduced to 15% but will be discontinued.  This is a major blow to self-employed people.  The supplementary welfare allowance for exceptional needs payments will be reduced.  It is used sparingly, meaningfully and well in the main to support those with exceptional needs.  The respite care grant is used by families who care for their loved ones and keep them out of hospitals, which provides significant savings to the State.  It was \u20ac1,700 and has been cut to \u20ac1,375.  This is sad.<\/p><p>  The back-to-education allowance has been cut.  We want people to return to education.  Education now goes from the cr\u00e8che to fourth level and I champion lifelong learning.  The people in receipt of this allowance are struggling and want to better themselves and prepare for new jobs in new markets to support the economy.  With regard to the household benefits package, this and previous Governments have had an inertia with regard to tackling the big guns, namely, the suppliers such as the ESB, Eircom and telecommunications suppliers.  The savings should be made by doing this and not by hitting with cuts the elderly people who cherish a telephone call and use 1890 services such as the Good Morning South Tipperary listening service.  They need ESB units.  We are in for a shockingly cold winter and we must be down to earth and realise these are the weakest people in society.<\/p><p>  Administrative savings have been promised due to the reduced costs for medical certificates and I hope we get them.  I welcome increased funding for activation programmes and school meal provision.  There are certainly cherries in the budget but overall we have bowed down to the troika.  We must learn that austerity does not work and has not worked.  I had never before been involved in a sit-in but yesterday I sat in at a banking institution for 12 or 13 hours - the Ceann Comhairle missed me from the House - on behalf of a family from County Wexford which was traumatised by the activities of agents of Friends First.  We are bailing out the banks and paying the troika but we are stifling initiative and causing inertia and fear.<\/p><p>  I was down town earlier and I saw the protest outside.  Those of us who choose to go out and get up on platforms must be careful.  The protest was ending as I was coming in but it had been hijacked like the protest last Wednesday.  People must take responsibility for what they say.  I saw garda\u00ed being attacked by a group well known to them who were spoiling the protest.  We must be careful when calling people out on the streets because it has dangerous consequences.  The ordinary quiet people, namely, lower income earners, self-employed people, small business people, small farmers and middle-class people, do not protest because they do not have the time, energy or money to do so.  We must be careful with regard to the type of people we bring out.  Last Wednesday was unbelievable and I never saw the like of it.  We were almost lynched because we dared to differ from people who are supposed to be pro-choice.  Where is the country going?  We must be careful.  We must support the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  We must have the right to come to the House and make speeches and vote as we want.  Let the electorate decide.  We cannot be bullied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500044#RR00600","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354727400,"counter":536,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 6.50 p.m. and resumed at 7.20 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Allocation of Time: Motion","time":1354728000,"counter":537,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500045#TT00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1354728000,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I call on the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Paul Kehoe, to move a motion in respect of the arrangements for dealing with the financial resolutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500045#TT00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1354728000,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>   That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the financial motions by the Minister for Finance shall, for the purpose of debate, be grouped, moved and decided together in accordance with the following schedule and the proceedings thereon, and on any amendments thereto, shall, in the case of each resolution or group, as appropriate, be brought to a conclusion by one question which shall be put from the Chair not later than the times indicated as follows: Resolutions Nos. 1 and 2, to conclude after 20 minutes;

The expected yield from these increases is approximately &#8364;180 million in 2013 and a full year.  The measures will increase the consumer price index by approximately 0.325%.\r\n\r\n  Financial Resolution No. 2 provides for excise duty increases on tobacco products with effect from midnight tonight.  The increase amounts to 10 cent, inclusive of VAT, on a pack of 20 cigarettes together with pro rata increases for other tobacco products.  An additional 50 cent increase will apply to 25 g of roll-your-own, RYO, tobacco.  The price of a pack of 20 cigarettes in the most popular price category will increase to &#8364;9.30.  The excise duty component of this price will be &#8364;5.57 and the total tax, inclusive of VAT, will be &#8364;7.31.  The increase on RYO amounts to an increase in total tax, inclusive of VAT, of approximately 60 cent per 25 g pack.  The excise duty component of this increase will be 49 cent.\r\n\r\n  The price and tax component of cigarettes in Ireland are among the highest in the EU.  The high tax here reflects the long-standing commitment by successive governments to use taxation as an instrument to discourage smoking.  While consumption of RYO tobacco is relatively small by comparison, there has been something of a movement towards this product in recent years.  The additional increase in the tax on RYO will bring the tax on that product more in line with that on cigarettes.  These latest increases will ensure that tobacco tax continues to play an important role in discouraging consumption of tobacco products.\r\n\r\n  Unfortunately, high prices and taxes also make Ireland an attractive location for cigarette smugglers.  The Revenue Commissioners, who have responsibility for tobacco products tax, are very conscious of the threat that this poses to legitimate business and to the Exchequer and they continue to make tackling the problem a priority.  Revenue has achieved notable successes in seizing illegal products and in bringing people involved in this criminality before the courts.

I do not want to rehearse the arguments that were made last year.  The motivation of Government in this regard is not the public health interest of its citizens but to ask people to pay more because they either enjoy a pint at the weekend or because they are addicted to nicotine, and that is the reality of it.  We need to call it as it is.<\/p><p>  If the Government was motivated by the public health of these individuals, Sinn F\u00e9in might look at this in a different light, but that is not the case.  The Government is not ring-fencing this money for addiction treatment or to help these individuals access health care that they need.  Indeed, in the budget the Government has increased the charges for access to emergency care.  On accessing medication, it has increased the drug payment scheme threshold for families who must pay a substantial amount for medication each month.  For those who have a medical card, the Government has tripled the prescription charge.  If the Government was genuine in this regard then one could look at these measures in a different light, but it is not.<\/p><p>  If the Government was serious about tackling public health issues arising from alcohol and tobacco then it would not be stalling the implementation of the recommendations of the national task force.  In light of what I have said, this is merely a money grab from citizens without any additional investment to benefit these individuals, either to wean themselves off their addiction to nicotine or to address the alcohol addiction issues in the State.  In saying this I am not referring to everybody who goes out at the weekend to enjoy a pint as I myself enjoy a pint from time to time.  If the Taoiseach was to come before me today stating that the increased yield of \u20ac180 million in excise duty on alcohol products was to be ring-fenced for addiction treatment centres right across the State, then we could be having a very different debate, but that is not what he is planning to do because that is not what is being proposed.  This is merely about dipping into the pockets of ordinary people again.  In that light, given that the Government is looking not at the health concerns of citizens but at another way of shaking a few extra euro from them, Sinn F\u00e9in will not support either of these resolutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500045#TT02000","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1354728600,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter and I wish to deal specifically with Financial Resolution No. 1 concerning the tax on alcohol products.  A detailed proposal was put to the Department of Finance to introduce a lid levy which would bring in about \u20ac240 million.  The proposal before us will bring in about \u20ac180 million.  The difficulty is that, while a detailed report was published earlier this year by my colleague, Deputy Shortall, on the national substance misuse strategy, there is nothing in the proposal before us to deal with the demand aspect of alcohol.<\/p><p>  There is a precedent for this.  A few years ago, there was a proposal to increase excise duty on alcopops because of the health issues involved.  At present, over half of Irish 16-years-olds have been drunk and one in five is a weekly drinker.  According to the latest available statistics, from 2008, there were 88 alcohol-related deaths per month.  It is also a significant contributing factor in suicide.  Every night, about 2,000 bednights are tied up by alcohol-related conditions.  It is, therefore, having a major impact on the economy and is costing about \u20ac3.7 billion, half of which is taking money directly away from the health budget.  There was an opportunity to nuance the proposal before us.  The steering group report refers to increasing excise across the board thus making alcohol more expensive, but it also highlights below-cost sales of alcohol and suggest proposals in that regard.  <\/p><p>  The strategy examined minimum pricing and suggested that it should be introduced.  It has already been introduced in Scotland.  All it is doing here, however, is increasing the profits of the drinks industry.  The proposed lid levy on the other hand would increase revenue coming in to the Exchequer that could be put into other diversionary tactics on alcohol and substance abuse.  It would have helped to implement the strategy as set out in the substance misuse report.  I am disappointed that it has not been addressed here today.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500046#UU00100","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1354728600,"counter":554,"content":"<p>As regards the alcohol proposal, I concur with our finance spokesperson, Deputy Michael McGrath, that the emphasis is the wrong way around.  There is a fundamental problem with how alcohol is sold in this country.  It is having a major impact on our young people.  There is not a Deputy in the House who would not agree with me when I say that something has to be done about it.  It means our taxation structure must be reorientated in a way that disincentivises the purchase of alcohol in the off-trade sector, particular in large multiples.<\/p><p>  The safest place to have a drink now is in a pub.  We must re-examine this matter again but the problem is that the public house has been outbid on pricing by other centres.  We have youngsters buying big slabs and ending up on the greens.  At home, there is no proper measure of what one is drinking, be it wine or spirits.  One of the safest places to have a drink, therefore, is in a pub.  I am talking about quantity and the public health perspective.  The emphasis in the Government's approach is wrong.  We had a different approach by putting the emphasis on the off-trade, and particularly trying to counteract the situation where large multiples have become significant players in the sale of alcohol, which was never intended.  The taxation proposal before us misses a fundamental opportunity to redress that situation in addition to other proposals. <\/p><p>  Our document contained an interesting proposal on tobacco which we received from the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Heart Foundation.  They made the point that the tobacco sector's revenue from a packet of cigarettes has increased from \u20ac1 to \u20ac1.84 in the decade to 2010.  Therefore, despite all the increases in tobacco taxes, the industry itself has increased its take from the consumer over that decade.  Essentially, the industry has used the opportunity offered by tax increases on tobacco to increase its own profits.<\/p><p>  We have endorsed the proposals of the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society that tobacco prices should be controlled in the same way as energy prices and taxi fares.  With such a change, the proportion of the retail price of tobacco going to the Exchequer would increase.  Without imposing hardship on individual smokers, the Exchequer could get a far greater yield if the proposal of the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society was to be adopted.  It could raise in the order of \u20ac100 million in the first year and \u20ac150 million in subsequent years.  The measure that is being proposed today is completely inadequate from a public health perspective.  It lacks innovation and a targeted approach which would target the industry and the profit share it garners annually, to such an extent that it has gone from \u20ac1 to \u20ac1.80 per packet over the past ten years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500046#UU00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1354728600,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I remind Deputies that there are only five minutes left in this slot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500046#UU00300","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1354728600,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I wish to raise my concerns about the increase in and excess of off-trade drink consumption.  Everyone is concerned by the increase in alcohol consumption in recent years but the Government is tackling the wrong section on this matter.  Over the last five years, turnover is down by 34% and we are losing licensed premises at the rate of one pub per day.  The on-trade sector is far more labour intensive than the off-trade one and supports 50,000 jobs.<\/p><p>  There seems to be no regulation of the quantity that people are drinking, and young people in particular.  Young people are getting drink for as little as, or less than, \u20ac1 a bottle, yet nothing is being done to tackle this problem.  We were led to believe that the Government was bringing forward proposals on below-cost selling.  Young adults can buy alcohol for as little as 70 cent a bottle, yet nothing is being done to tackle this.  At the same time, we have pubs closing day by day and there is no support from the Government.  <\/p><p>  The pub was always the lifeblood of rural communities where people could socialise.  It was a way in which older people could deal with the problem of isolation.  However, nothing is being done to tackle the real problem of alcohol consumption, which is that multiples are using alcohol to attract customers.  They do not care who drinks it or what happens to them as a result.  The wrong emphasis is being placed on this matter.  What will the Government do about the number of jobs this measure will cause to be lost in the on-trade sector?  Nothing is being done to support rural pubs.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500046#UU00400","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1354728600,"counter":557,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Boyd Barrett.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500046#UU00500","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1354728600,"counter":558,"content":"<p>A Cheann Comhairle-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500046#UU00600","speaker":"1178"},{"type":"speech","time":1354728600,"counter":559,"content":"<p>There are three minutes left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500046#UU00700","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1354728600,"counter":560,"content":"<p>A Cheann Comhairle-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500046#UU00800","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1354728600,"counter":561,"content":"<p>Do not blame me now.

The Minister is also taking the opportunity, following the consultation process undertaken earlier in the year, to restructure some of the bands.  As indicated in last year\u2019s budget speech, the process was to review bands and rates structures in line with technological advances in motor vehicles.  In essence, the existing system, which has contributed to the large shift to smaller and cleaner low emission cars, has been maintained.  The consequence of this shift, however, is that there has been a corresponding fall-off in revenue from VRT.  It is intended that this revision to the structure will address this matter.  It is important to note that the revised structure retains a positive incentive to purchase low CO2 cars.<\/p><p>It is anticipated that the proposed increases will raise some \u20ac50 million for the Exchequer over a full year.  This is an immediate and necessary measure towards deficit reduction.  The inclusion of the amendment of section 132(3)(d)(ii) is a technical amendment to ensure the correct classification of certain light commercial vehicles for VRT purposes.<\/p><p>Financial Resolution No. 4 provides for a reduction in the farmers' VAT flat rate addition for unregistered farmers from 5.2% to 4.8% with effect from 1 January 2013.  The flat rate scheme is a simplified and practical method of applying value added tax to farming.  It compensates unregistered farmers on an overall basis for the VAT charged to them on their purchases of goods and services.  The scheme in general reduces administrative burdens, as it provides that small farmers can remain outside the normal VAT system, thereby avoiding the obligations in respect of registration, record keeping and returns.<\/p><p>The flat rate scheme is governed by European Union VAT law and is reviewed annually by reference to macroeconomic data for the preceding three years on agricultural production and agricultural inputs and the deductible VAT content of such inputs.  The reduction in the flat rate addition to 4.8% for 2013 is a result of calculations on the basis of macroeconomic data received from the Central Statistics Office for 2010, 2011 and 2012.  The new 4.8% rate for 2013 continues to achieve full compensation under the scheme.<\/p><p>Financial Resolution No. 5 provides for the amendment of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952 and Finance (No. 2) Act 1992 in relation to rates of motor tax and fees for trade licence plates.  It is proposed to raise motor tax rates across all vehicle categories.  The proposal is to apply an increase of 7.5% for most vehicle categories with flat rate increases of between \u20ac10 and \u20ac92 for vehicles taxed on the basis of CO2, with the level of increases graduating upwards from the most environmentally efficient A bands to the least environmentally friendly G band.  The average increase for vehicles taxed on the basis of CO2 is 19.8%.  Trade plate licences will increase by 7.5%.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1354730400,"counter":613,"content":"<p>The new rates will apply to motor tax discs and trade licences taken out from tonight for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.<\/p><p>  The House will note that I have just referred to A bands in the plural.  Deputies will be aware that, in budget 2012, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, announced a review of the carbon banding applying to vehicle registration tax, VRT, and motor tax with a view to having a revised taxation structure in place for this budget.  The Government's twin priorities have been to ensure the continuation of the positive environmental impact on vehicle emissions and the protection of the tax base.<\/p><p>  Under the new structure for both VRT and motor tax, the CO2 band A has been broken into four separate bands and the B band has been split into two.  For motor tax only, a new zero band is also introduced for electric vehicles with a lower annual tax of \u20ac120 applying.  The revised banding recognises that ever more fuel efficient cars are becoming available and allows for the differentiation of the environmental incentive in favour of the most environmentally friendly vehicles now and into the future.  Indeed, the reduction in tax for electric vehicles recognises that there are no emissions at the point of use of these vehicles.  These changes ensure a strong environmental incentive remains in place.<\/p><p>  While the combined levels of increases in the lower CO2 bands in this budget and the last are higher than the rest of the fleet, the increases must be viewed against a structure that has left the bottom rates very low.  The reality is that there has been a significant loss of motor tax income over the past number of years, as the number of vehicles taxed on the basis of CO2 emissions has increased by about 5% year on year.  At the end of October, the CO2 fleet of nearly 429,000 cars comprised just under 23% of all cars on the road.  Of these, over 385,000 are taxed at the three lowest bands.  This year, for the first time, over half of all new cars purchased are in the A band, the lowest rate of tax.  This erosion of the tax base presents a challenge on the taxation side of the budget and needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>  While the move to lower emission cars is welcome from an environmental perspective, it represented an increasing loss of income to fund local services.  Receipts have reduced from \u20ac1.06 billion in 2008 to \u20ac1.01 billion in 2011.  It is estimated that income for this year would have been in the region of \u20ac954 million had no increases in rates taken place in the last budget, a further reduction of 5.5%.<\/p><p>  This budget restructures the bands in such a way that there remains a positive incentive to purchase low CO2 cars in recognition of the need to maintain correct environmental signals in the transport sector as an important part of our national effort to reduce emissions and achieve our climate obligations.  The restructuring also goes towards responding to the challenge of maintaining the motor tax base.<\/p><p>  The A band is split into five bands corresponding to the four bands for VRT purposes, but with an additional zero emissions category to provide an additional incentive for electric cars.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500050#YY00100","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1354730400,"counter":614,"content":"<p>What about the bicycle?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500050#YY00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1354730400,"counter":615,"content":"<p>Introducing banding between 80 g and 120 g of CO2 per kilometre allows us to strengthen the environmental incentive to lower emissions cars while addressing the fiscal gap.  The increase for the lowest band, the new band A1 below 80 g, is the lowest of any increase in motor tax, and the rates of increase up to band A3 at 110 g are below the average applied to the CO2 tax structure.  This continues the message, in place since 2008, that lower emissions vehicles will attract the lower rates of motor tax.<\/p><p>  Splitting the B band into two 10 g bands allows us to differentiate the tax increase to favour lower emission vehicles within this band also.  While the percentage increases for the higher bands are lower, the monetary increases for bands D to G are greater than the monetary increases applying to bands A to C.<\/p><p>  The restructuring of motor tax represents a continuing commitment to incentivise vehicles with lower emissions.  The new bands below 120 g will allow this process to continue into the future.  It is anticipated that the proposed increases this year will raise some \u20ac86.5 million for the Exchequer over a full year.<\/p><p>  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will shortly bring forward a Bill to close off the arrangement whereby a vehicle owner can declare retrospectively that his or her vehicle was off the road.

Now the Government is saying that it is not taking in enough money and it wants people to pay more anyway, despite the fact that people might have sold a pre-2008 car that would have had a high CO2 output and invested in a new car in order to avail of low car tax.  For many people who could afford to buy a new car, a driving issue was for them to be on band A or band B, yet the Government is coming back to sting them.<\/p><p> It is clear that the budget in its totality has been anti-family and anti-children.  As the Taoiseach indicated, VRT goes up to approximately \u20ac90 for different classes of car.  Parents with more than three children aged younger than 12 do not have the option of having a normal five-seater car.  They must buy a seven-seater to comply with Irish law and safety standards.  It is important that they do so.  I do not oppose that.  However, the reality is that families with more than three children are being hit hardest because they are forced to buy a larger car which means that they pay additional VRT because the car is more expensive in the first place, but also because those cars do not fall into the lower taxation A or B categories.  The proposed increases will affect cars required by parents with larger families.  It is another example of how the Government is affecting children and families in the budget.<\/p><p> There is no doubt that it is also a shake-down of motorists.  It is another grab for money aimed at motorists.  As someone from west Donegal, if I had the option of coming to Dublin by train or on Bus \u00c9ireann I would take it.  People do not have the option in rural areas.  Coming from a rural county the Taoiseach is aware of that.  Dependency on cars is not something ingrained in the Irish psyche; it is a necessity.  The increase will again come from the limited pot of money available to people.  VRT is an unfair tax and we should aim to introduce a fairer system.  With the free transport of goods and people in the European Union the Government introduced a tax for people to have a licence plate.  People are paying thousands of euro to have their car registered.  It is a way of circumventing European law.<\/p><p> VRT is a big issue in Border counties.  I refer, for example, to people in Lifford who might work in Strabane and buy a car there but they have to pay an astronomical level of VRT just because they live across a bridge.  They are in the same country but they live across a bridge and the Government stings them for that.  Sinn F\u00e9in most definitely opposes both of those measures on motor taxation.<\/p><p> The Government wants to bring in \u20ac21 million from the changes to VAT affecting farmers in a full year.  As the Taoiseach mentioned in his contribution, that affects non-registered farmers, who for VAT purposes are smaller farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500050#YY02600","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354731000,"counter":640,"content":"<p>That is not true.

Let us be clear.  The Government is bringing forward this resolution without hiding the fact that it will yield \u20ac21 million.  Therefore, the question is where the \u20ac21 million will come from.  It will come from the farming sector.  I do not know what else will be included when we see the finer details on the various cuts in the agriculture sector but we know from the latest report on agricultural incomes that they have dropped.  Such issues are important to farmers, in particular in areas such as the west and in Donegal which I represent and which has huge levels of disadvantaged land.  A grab of \u20ac21 million is not something the Government should consider at this point.  Many farmers will be keen to see what measures will be in place to help them in order that we can ensure food security throughout the world and that small farmers remain in business in the future.

As with many of the measures that are being introduced in the budget, and in the previous budget, the Taoiseach will try to provide a specific justification or rationale for particular tax increases.  He will try to make them sound more palatable when in reality they are just further overwhelmingly regressive austerity measures that are being imposed on ordinary families.  Families do not have different pots of money which are somehow separate and unconnected: one for cars, one for farm vehicles, another one for property taxes or cigarettes and a pint of beer at the weekend.  They all come out of the same pot.  All of the increases will disproportionately and regressively affect those who have the least.  That is the reality of all such measures.  Their combined effect will be to impoverish people who already have very little.<\/p><p>  Those particular measures will disproportionately affect families, as so many others have.  The more children one has, the harder one will be hit in a range of ways.  The motor taxation measures are no exception in that regard.  One will be punished just because one has more children and have to have a larger car to transport them.  Just in case it would encourage people to use alternative forms of transport such as public transport, let us not forget that a significant number of people do not have public transport.  Cuts have been made to existing public transport and there have been increases in bus and rail fares of between 14% and 19%.<\/p><p>  People are being hit from the left, the right and the centre but all of the extra money must come out of the same pot.  The increases are a slap in the face for people who bought vehicles with low emissions not just this year, but last year.  The attempt to say the increases are stepped and that there are still incentives is all mar dhea.  The Government has slapped in the face those who made an investment to try to comply with measures to encourage reduced CO2 emissions.

The motor tax increase will be a serious imposition on many ordinary families, particularly those with older cars who cannot change the size of the car to reduce the amount of motor tax they will pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500052#AAA04200","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1354731600,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I want to speak on Financial Resolution No. 4 and the changes to agricultural relief.<\/p><p>Farm families have suffered a 22% drop in income this year.  Taking into account the changes to tax and PRSI that affect everyone in the economy, it will put major pressure on families throughout the country and, in particular, farm families.  On top of that, there were further announcements on the suckler cow welfare scheme, the sheep grassland payment and the disadvantaged area scheme.  These announcements affect farmers in the west disproportionately.  The farm assist scheme will have an affect on household income.  The resolution before us will take \u20ac21 million out of the pockets of farmers.  There is an EU calculation on how VAT is paid to farmers but my understanding is that the rate is based not on the value of VAT that has been paid in the previous three years but on the rate of VAT over the previous three years.  There is a significant difference because farmers do not receive a refund of the VAT they have paid, only in respect of the average rate over the previous three years.<\/p><p> A further difficulty is that agricultural inflation is increasing.  As a result, farmers are being short changed.  Preliminary estimates for agricultural price indices for 2012 show energy costs have increased by 8.6% and feedstuffs by 5.5%, well in excess of the rate of refund proposed of 4.8%.  The resolution before us means that if a farmer goes to the mart and sells an animal after 1 January for \u20ac1,000, he will receive \u20ac4 less per head as a result.  While the basis of this is to ensure it is not intended as an aid or assistance to the farming sector, it is supposed to be fair compensation for VAT incurred by farmers.  The way the system is structured, it is not based on the value of VAT paid over the previous three years by the agricultural community.  It does not take into account the difficulties caused by the increase in agricultural inputs and the fact that the returns farmers receive for produce has decreased this year.  The rate of return to the farmers, as a percentage of VAT, has also decreased.<\/p><p> We have an unregulated supermarket sector putting further pressure on farm gate prices and farmers are losing out on the double.  I ask the Government to look at this again because farmers are being short changed.  The structure of the system means farmers are not getting a true and accurate return with regard to the amount of VAT they pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500052#AAA04300","speaker":"1177","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354732200,"counter":691,"content":"<p>It is very disappointing to see increases in VRT, motor tax and the trade licence plates.

In this way, while the taxable element of the lump sum payment is added to increase the individual&#8217;s overall income for the year of assessment, the rate of tax applied to that taxable element of the payment will be the average effective rate rather than the marginal rate of tax in force for that year.  The claim for top-slicing relief is made at the end of the year of assessment and is allowed as an additional credit in the computation of final liability. \r\n\r\n  The resolution makes a change in Schedule 3 to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by inserting a new paragraph 12A into the Schedule.  The new subparagraph (a) provides that, with effect from 1 January 2013, any payment of an ex gratia amount to which section 123 applies which is of an amount of &#8364;200,000 or greater will not qualify for top-slicing relief.  The calculation of this relief is set out in paragraph 10 of the Schedule. \r\n\r\n  The subparagraph (b) provides that where two or more payments are made in respect of the same person, or in respect of the same office or employment, or where two or more payments are made in respect of different offices or employments, the amounts will be aggregated for the purposes of determining whether the limit of &#8364;200,000 has been breached.\r\n\r\n  This restriction is a separate and distinct provision from the lifetime limit of maximum amounts of exemptions and reliefs that a taxpayer can claim in respect of ex gratia payments made to him or her which was introduced in Finance Act 2011.  For example, an individual can receive a severance payment which is in excess of &#8364;200,000 and his or her reliefs in respect of exemptions provided for in section 201 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 will be allowed up to the maximum lifetime entitlement.

I cannot see why anybody would oppose it.  It deals with people getting what we would all call massive redundancy payments on a voluntary basis excluding the statutory payment.  So where somebody, having been in an organisation for 20 or 30 years, gets \u20ac30,000 or \u20ac40,000 statutory redundancy, if he or she gets in excess of \u20ac200,000 on top of that there was an arrangement in place called top-slicing relief - I thank the officials for clarifying it to me.  In the normal course of events if one got that amount of income in a year, one would have paid tax at one's top marginal rate.  A special provision was introduced allowing the person to pay the average of his or her effective rate for the previous three years.  So if people had extra allowances and were not quite at the top rate, they brought it down to their effective rate which was always going to be lower than the top marginal rate.  They might end up only paying tax on the excess over \u20ac200,000 at considerably less than the 41% - they might be getting it at 30% or somewhere in that region.<\/p><p>  It is only right that this little provision should be changed and those people who get non-statutory lump sums above that amount should pay tax at the top rate.  I believe everybody would agree with that and I urge all sides to support it because I do not believe anybody could countenance in this day and age that we would continue to have a provision giving special tax concessions to those who are walking out with non-statutory lump sums of more than \u20ac200,000.<\/p><p>  I will make one small political point to the T\u00e1naiste.  This sounds like something the Labour Party might have been keen to have included as it is seen as getting somebody at the top.  However, the projected yield for 2013 is nil.  It is a fig leaf to give the impression we are doing something.  There is no money in this and I do not know of anybody who is getting payments of \u20ac200,000 over and above statutory redundancy.  Those days are long gone.  There is a projection that it might raise some money in future years.  The officials may be taking the prudent view because they could not estimate accurately.  By inserting &quot;nil&quot; if we end up getting something, it will be a bonus.

I agree with Deputy Fleming that there is, if not a universal view, certainly a growing consensus in this Chamber that issues of fair and equitable taxation for high earners must be addressed.  The Government has not done so in this budget but it is starting to take baby steps in that direction.  The same applies in respect of pension pots and lump sum payments to people.<\/p><p>  Why is the figure set at \u20ac200,000, which seems very high?  While I agree with ending the top-slicing practice, why pitch it so high?  The T\u00e1naiste, according to himself, is all about fairness and a fair sharing of the burden.  Therefore, I would have expected the Government to have pitched it substantially lower at approximately \u20ac100,000, which I understand is the figure Labour Party backbenchers regard as high earnings and a very significant sum.  I do not know if the T\u00e1naiste will have the capacity to answer that this evening.<\/p><p>  It would be remiss of me not to mention other lump sum payments, including public sector pensions which are funded from the public purse.  A new pension regime has been introduced for new entrants into the public service but a small number of people are still on the most extraordinary pension arrangements.  The TLAC terms, as they are called, still apply to a large number of senior civil servants - Secretaries General of Departments, including some who started on this Government's watch.  It is staggering that a Government that makes any pretence at fairness and equity within the public sector has not moved very swiftly to stop those practices, stop the additional years and stop the big lump-sum payouts.  There is a huge contradiction in the Government's approach.  From this resolution, I take it the Government is conceding that things need to be done about large lump sums, although I believe it has pitched the level too high.

The pension tax relief in this country is unbelievably generous and makes no sense from an economic or social point of view.<\/p><p>The regime costs the Exchequer and us all about \u20ac2.5 billion.  We know that about 80% of that tax relief goes to 20% of top earners.  It is an extremely regressive regime.  Given the regressive and anti-family nature of this budget, it is not surprising that the Government flunked this issue as well.  We have had all the talk about child benefit and the fairly savage cuts implemented across the board for people on all incomes.  People in receipt of child benefit, be they very poor or very rich, are still suffering the same cut in child benefit.  <\/p><p> That is very regressive but the Government chose to target child benefit, which at least is given to every child, while completely ignoring pension tax relief.  The cost to the Exchequer is about the same at approximately \u20ac2.5 billion.  On what basis does the T\u00e1naiste believe it is in any way fair that a person should be able to receive a lump sum of \u20ac200,000 tax free?  What is the basis for continuing with that regime given that many thousands of taxpayers and others who cannot afford to make pension provision for themselves are in effect paying for the significant tax-free pension lump sums of some of the wealthiest people in the country?  There is no justification for that.  The Government inherited that regime and last year it indicated that it would do something about it this year.  This year, it has failed yet again to tackle this gross inequality.  <\/p><p> The Government promised that it might do it next year.  What is the excuse for leaving that very generous and inequitable regime in place this year and failing to tackle pension tax relief for the rich?  Not only is it not doing anything about significant lump sums, it also continues to allow the current level of tax relief on pension contributions.  Again, that means that the poorest people and those on very modest incomes pay for the pensions of the very well-off.  Has this something to do with the fact that those responsible for crafting this budget - the four senior Ministers in Cabinet, their four Secretaries General and their four advisers - are all in the bracket that can benefit substantially from the largesse of the existing ridiculously generous pension relief regime?  <\/p><p> It is extremely disappointing that this is all the Government could come up with in respect of an area where there was potential to make savings of at least \u20ac400 million if it had delivered on the commitments in the programme for Government and introduced the cap on pension tax relief to allow a still very generous pension regime to continue where people on incomes of \u20ac120,000 could retain an entitlement to tax relief on pensions up to \u20ac60,000.  That is still very generous and yet the Government was not prepared to take that decision to bring some element of fairness into the tax relief regime.  <\/p><p> The T\u00e1naiste has flunked it in a very serious way.  Instead of tackling this area which was a stand out in terms of unfairness in our tax system, he chose to hit families and ensure that every family where there are two incomes of over a mere \u20ac18,000 will be caught for about \u20ac1,000 per year.  There is no recognition of ability to pay in the burden imposed by the budget on working families.  There was much talk about looking after working families.  This pension regime and the budget generally represent an assault on ordinary working families and are disgraceful.

They will take some time to work out how large the hit is but they will be counting the cost for a long time.  As has been said, there were potential savings and choices in respect of pension tax relief.  Hundreds of millions of euro could have been saved that are spent on reliefs that benefit the wealthiest in society.  It is fairly incomprehensible that the Government did not choose those options instead of the ones it did choose.  One would have to speculate that it is either because the people making the decisions benefit from the current regime or it is a capitulation by the Labour Party to the Fine Gael agenda.  Either way, it is deplorable, given what is being done to people who are hanging on by their fingernails.  <\/p><p>  We will support the measure.  There are one or two measures further down that one would support but they are so marginal and fail to deal with these inequalities.  It is unbelievable.

Every step further it could have gone would have given relief to the people it has hit.  That is not just a terrible wasted opportunity.  It will continue the suffering for many and the understandable bitterness, anger and frustration of ordinary people who are the victims at the bottom of society and have yet again been hammered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500056#FFF00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1354733700,"counter":721,"content":"<p>I support this measure for very obvious reasons.

At present, individuals aged 70 years or over pay a maximum rate of 4%, regardless of their level of income.  From 1 January 2013, any of these individuals who have income exceeding \u20ac60,000 will pay the full rate of universal social charge.  Individuals aged 70 years or over who have income that does not exceed \u20ac60,000 will continue to pay a maximum rate of 4% on their income.  Separately, individuals who have a medical card or an entitlement to a medical card under community regulations pay a maximum rate of 4%.  In framing this provision it was generally accepted that it would only apply to low income taxpayers.  It has since been established that a number of high income earners are able to avail of this provision as they have an entitlement to full eligibility for services under Part IV of the Health Act 1970 as a result of the community regulations.  To address this anomaly, the capping of the universal social charge at a maximum rate of 4% for medical card holders will apply only where the individual's total income does not exceed \u20ac60,000.  These changes will take effect from 1 January 2013.  I commend this Resolution to the House.<\/p><p>Resolution No. 8 relates to the specified rate used to calculate the taxable benefit to employees.  Where an employee receives a loan from his or her employer at a rate below the specified rate, the employee is chargeable to tax on the benefit-in-kind reflected by the difference.  The specified rate which differentiates between home loans and other loans is reviewed annually in the light of the average market rates provided for the Department of Finance by the Central Bank.  This resolution provides for a decrease from 5% to 4% in the specified rate used to calculate the taxable benefit to employees from home loans provided by their employers at preferential rates of interest.  The resolution provides also for an increase from 12.5% to 13.5% in the specified rate used to calculate the taxable benefit to employees from other non-home loans provided by their employers at preferential rates of interest.  The purpose of the resolution is to keep pace with the changes in interest rates in the market in the past 12 months.  The overall yield of \u20ac1 million cited in the budget book is tentative.  Revenue statistics do not provide a figure specifically for taxation yielded by this measure<\/p><p>Financial Resolution No. 9 confirms the level of health insurance premium that will qualify for tax relief under the tax relief at source scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners will be the amount of the premium paid by an individual after deducting the amount of any age-related tax credit under section 470B(4) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 under the current interim scheme or any credit to which the individual is entitled under the new risk equalisation scheme being provided for in section 15 of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012.  The permanent risk equalisation scheme is being introduced to replace the interim scheme under which an individual provided for by the age related tax credits in section 470B and, therefore, an individual should only have an entitlement to one or other credit at any time.  Section 470B only applied in respect of policies with an authorised insurer that were renewed or entered into after 1 January 2009 but before 1 January 2013.  Section 470B only applied in respect of policies with an authorised insurer which were renewed or entered into after 1 January 2009 but prior to 1 January 2013.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012 was considered on Committee Stage on 27 November and Report Stage on 4 December.  While it is likely to have passed all Stages by the time the Finance Bill is enacted, reference has been made to the risk equalisation scheme as it will be inserted into the Health Insurance Act 1994.  This is not a budgetary matter but a consequential measure arising from the Government's decision to replace the interim risk equalisation scheme with a permanent risk equalisation scheme and the age related income tax credits with risk equalisation credits from 1 January 2013.  The Finance Bill 2013 will give effect to the new rates of the health insurance levy under the new risk equalisation scheme.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1354734300,"counter":739,"content":"<p>Three Financial Resolutions are being discussed together.

I am satisfied with that and note the proposals are significant but quite straightforward.  I will speak to them in sequence.  Resolution No. 10, on which the Minister spoke in detail, in layman's English is about increasing the rate of deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, which currently is at 30%, by 3% to 33%.  Based on the Minister's statement today and the schedule on page A11 of the summary of the budget measures regarding deposit interest retention tax and exit tax on life assurance policies and investment funds recovered here, it proposes an increase in the rate of retention tax that applies to deposit interest, as the Minister already mentioned.  It also will apply to life assurance policies and investment funds and the rates are being increased by three percentage points from 30% to 33% for payments made annually or more frequently and 36%, as the Minister already has mentioned, for more complicated cases in which the rate is only calculable at different intervals.  Moreover, these increased rates will apply from 1 January 2013 and are expected to yield \u20ac50 million in the first year and \u20ac64 million in the second year.<\/p><p>  These changes are broadly in line with the budget proposals put forward by Fianna F\u00e1il.  Another reason I consider this measure to be a good idea is that in the first instance, it constitutes taxation on people with large amounts of money sitting in the bank.  It might actually encourage them to withdraw some of it and spend or invest it, thereby helping the economy.  While I acknowledge the interest rate is quite low at present, increasing the DIRT rate might encourage people to get better use from their funds by putting them to use in the economy.  This was one reason Fianna F\u00e1il proposed an increase in the rate of DIRT.  This point also essentially covers Financial Resolution No. 11 on the same basis.<\/p><p>  Financial Resolution No. 12 proposes a change in the rate of capital gains tax, whereby the current rate of 30% also is to be increased by 3% to 33% and this increase will apply in respect of disposals made after tonight.  If someone can get the documentation signed between now and midnight, the old rate will apply but otherwise, they will be caught with the new rate.  I may not be technically correct in saying that but I understand this measure will come in from midnight tonight.<\/p><p>This will produce approximately \u20ac50 million in any year and we broadly support it.  We recommended such a measure in our budget proposal because a gap of \u20ac3.5 billion cannot be closed without some additional taxes.  As I indicated earlier, we agree with the principle of closing the \u20ac3.5 billion gap, so it would be irresponsible to vote against every specific detail.  We will put our money where our mouth is by saying we support this increase in capital gains tax.<\/p><p> Some people may believe we should tax all capital out of existence but a capital gains tax of 33% is reasonable enough.

I have a concern but I am unsure what to do about it given that, broadly speaking, these are progressive measures.  Some of the increases do not distinguish between the small and big saver.  I know the vast majority of people who will be affected by these increases in tax will be people who have plenty of money to save, and the people we wish to protect or give relief to do not have much in the way of savings these days.  Broadly speaking, these resolutions are right.  There are ordinary people with relatively modest amounts of savings, and it is unfortunate that they will get caught in what is a broadly progressive measure.  The Government should think about it.<\/p><p>  There is a more marginal point.  We are a country with a high degree of home ownership, although in a way different from much of the rest of Europe.  There is a difference in the way property is passed to the next generation when it is not necessarily about passing on significant amounts of wealth.  Although it may not be done now, we should examine the process of imposing taxes on capital gains and acquisitions, as well as taxes on savings.<\/p><p>  I will not labour the point but the Government could have gone much further in going after the major inequalities.  It is fair to say everything could have been costed by the Department of Finance.  As the new people on the block, we thought the parliamentary question process was the way to get information from the Department of Finance.  That is how we got some of our information.  There was nothing amateur or half-hearted about our efforts in putting together our document.  Most of it stands up to scrutiny.  The income tax element has been taken directly from a spreadsheet provided by the Department; when the effective tax rate is adjusted, the relevant figures pop up on the screen.  It is very interesting and Deputies should look at it.  I thank the Department of Finance for that information.<\/p><p>  It would not have helped to have the issue of corporation tax costed because the Minister for Finance told us it was too complicated to calculate.  That is not much of an answer to our first question.  A second question asked for the bands of the different levels of profits of companies, and it was only then that we got the figures to show how much gross pre-tax income of companies was available, how much tax was paid and the various allowances that facilitated the taxable amount to be written down.  The response that the process was too complicated was not satisfactory.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500061#LLL01600","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1354736700,"counter":874,"content":"<p>Was that a reply to a parliamentary question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012120500061#LLL01700","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1354736700,"counter":875,"content":"<p>Yes.  The response from the Minister for Finance was that the process was too complicated.<\/p><p>On the issue of a wealth tax, the answer, as we stated explicitly, was that we need a comprehensive register of wealth and assets to identify how wealth is distributed.  All we have, however, are Central Bank figures which show the overall quantum of wealth, how much of it is financial and how much is household wealth and what are the liabilities.  We do not know the distribution of household assets that are valued at \u20ac447 billion.  We need to know how these assets are distributed in order that we can have a progressive taxation system that targets accumulated wealth.  There is by international standards a significant quantum of household wealth in this small country.  If one divides the figure by the population, as has been done, one finds that Ireland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world.  This position is not borne out by our levels of poverty, however, and for this reason it is necessary to carry out a serious study to identify how wealth is distributed.
