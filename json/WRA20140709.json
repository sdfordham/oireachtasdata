As the House will be aware, in June 2013 the Government decided, inter alia, that a fundamental restructuring of Coillte was required and that part of this process should involve a robust analysis of how to give effect to a beneficial merger of Coillte and\u00a0Bord na M&oacute;na, with a view to creating a streamlined and refocused commercial state company in the bio-energy and forestry sectors in accordance with commitments made in the Programme for Government.<\/p><p>  Since that decision, an Inter-Departmental Steering Group made up of representatives of my Department, the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, the Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources and the NewERA unit of the NTMA, and involving consultation with the companies as appropriate, has been considering how such a beneficial merger could be progressed.  This consideration has been informed by work undertaken for the Group by NewERA, which considered the potential merger from a financial perspective.<\/p><p>  NewERA's financial work found that while a full merger had the potential to achieve significant material financial benefits, it would involve very significant up-front implementation costs if implemented immediately.\u00a0 Such an approach would, in addition, pose a significant number of implementation risks that could negatively impact on the level of benefits realisable and the costs incurred.  Accordingly, a full merger in the short term could not be recommended.<\/p><p>  On the other hand, NewERA's work found that a partial merger of the two companies, focusing on the areas of overlap between the two businesses, had the potential to deliver substantial financial benefit to the shareholder but with lower implementation costs and risks, over a shorter timeline, and with a better benefit-to-cost ratio than an immediate full merger.\u00a0 It was on this basis, therefore, that the Government decided last month that Coillte and Bord na Mona should now work towards a partial merger of their businesses, focusing on the areas of overlap between the two companies.  This\u00a0partial merger will\u00a0involve the establishment of a joint ventures between the two companies to manage their common business activities in biomass, wind energy, shared services, and recreation and tourism with a view to maximising the levels of benefit to the State and the companies in the medium term, while minimising the implementation costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900070#WRA02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Process","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900070#WRA02650"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[29520\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900070#WRA02700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the date on which he will have the Valuation (Amendment) Bill 2012 enacted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Ireland works bilaterally and through the EU and UN to ensure that human rights are respected in Myanmar\/Burma. <\/p><p>  At the EU Foreign Affairs Council in May 2014, EU Foreign Ministers approved the establishment of a formal EU-Myanmar Human Rights Dialogue.  The first such Dialogue took place in Myanmar on 20th May.  It was co-chaired by the EU Special Representative for Human Rights and the Myanmar Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and covered major issues of concern with regard to human rights, including discrimination, hate speech and inter-communal violence against the Rohingya in Rakhine, and in other parts of Myanmar.  It also focused on political prisoners, land and labour rights, freedom of expression and cooperation with international human rights mechanisms and in multilateral fora.<\/p><p>  At the dialogue the EU stressed that continued efforts to achieve ethnic peace and end discrimination and violence in Rakhine State were key for the success of Myanmar's continued transition to democracy.  The EU encouraged the Myanmar government to address the underlying causes of inter-communal violence, including the status and welfare of the Rohingya and expressed regret that Rohingya could not self-identify during the recent census.  The EU also expressed readiness to cooperate with Myanmar on initiatives which promote inter-communal understanding.<\/p><p>  In April 2014, Ireland was involved in organising with several NGOs an event at UN Headquarters in New York that focused on sexual violence in Myanmar.  It featured interventions from a Burmese woman human rights activist, Naw K'nyaw Paw, and Ireland's Permanent Representative to the UN, David Donoghue.  In March 2014, the UN Human Rights Council, of which Ireland is currently a member, adopted an EU-led resolution on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, which urged the Government of Myanmar to step up its efforts to put an end to remaining human rights violations and abuses.  In particular, the Council reiterated its serious concern about the situation of the Rohingya and other minorities in Rakhine State, including repeated instances of violence and other reported abuses, requested that an independent investigation be undertaken into those events and that those responsible be held to account.  <\/p><p>  Officials from my Department met with Burma Action Ireland, the Chairman of the European Rohingya Council and a member of the Irish Rohingya Community earlier this month to listen to their concerns and to brief on the Irish Government's actions in relation to Myanmar.  Ireland's (non-resident) Ambassador to Myanmar met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Myanmar during  a visit to the country in May 2014.  The Ambassador raised Ireland's ongoing concerns about the situation in Rakhine State, including the poor conditions that the some 140,000 displaced Rohingya people are enduring in the IDP camps, and the lack of humanitarian access, given that many international NGOs have been forced to leave Rakhine State.<\/p><p>  The Ambassador also visited Rakhine State in September 2013.  The purpose of the visit was to assess the humanitarian situation on the ground, particularly for the displaced members of the Muslim Rohingya community and to assess whether there are any areas where Ireland could offer support to help alleviate their plight.  The Ambassador visited several IDP camps, called on the Chief Minister of Rakhine state, met with local Buddhist religious leaders, and had discussions with the heads of the main UN agencies working on the ground.<\/p><p>  Since 2007, Ireland has provided more than &euro;7.87 million to Myanmar through NGOs and Irish missionaries for both long term development work and emergency and recovery responses.  In July 2013, officials from my Department undertook a scoping visit to Myanmar\/Burma.  The purpose of the mission was to assess developments in the country, and examine how Irish Aid could develop an assistance programme for the country.  The visit encompassed a wide range of meetings with political, business, diplomatic and civil society contacts.  The range of meetings allowed a broad assessment of developments in the country and to identify key elements of a possible aid programme.

Acting as the independent regulator, the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank has applied lending restrictions to some credit unions.\u00a0\u00a0I have been informed that these restrictions are viewed as short term in the majority of cases and are imposed as a means of allowing a credit union to\u00a0address identified concerns as quickly as possible.  Where lending restrictions are imposed they tend to take the form of a restriction on individual loan size or on commercial lending activity and in some cases, a limit on the total lending permitted each month.<\/p><p>  At this time\u00a0fewer than 10% of all credit unions have a restriction in place which limits the total amount of lending within the month, while close to 40% of all credit unions have a restriction on commercial lending activity.  Currently, the average loan rate in the sector is just over &euro;6,000 and only about a dozen individual credit unions\u00a0have lending restrictions that limit the amount loaned to less than &euro;10,000.  This ensures that the vast majority of credit unions can continue to make loans significantly greater than the average loan for the sector.  The Registrar of Credit Unions has assured me that restrictions are reviewed\u00a0on a regular basis.<\/p><p>  Section 35(2) of the Credit Union Act\u00a01997 permits a credit union to have up to 30% of its\u00a0loan book outstanding for more than\u00a05 years and up to 10% of its loan book outstanding for more than 10 years.\u00a0 Based on the most recent\u00a0information provided\u00a0by credit unions \u00a0to the Central Bank in the December 2013 quarterly prudential returns,\u00a0average lending over 5 years as a percentage of gross loans was\u00a0some 11%, while average lending over 10 years as a percentage of gross loans was\u00a0about 2%.  These figures\u00a0indicate that, in general, credit unions are currently well\u00a0within the limits as set down in the 1997 Act.<\/p><p>  On foot of recommendations from the Commission on Credit Unions, section 11 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 substantially amends section 35 of the 1997 Act.

It is planning\u00a0further consultation with the sector and a regulatory impact assessment.<\/p><p>  I have, on a number of occasions, highlighted\u00a0the Governments' recognition of\u00a0the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in this country and also the importance of getting lending going in the economy.

The objective was to boost tourism and create additional jobs and the measure has proven successful in this regard.

These increases are expected to raise &euro;145 million in a full year.  Budget 2013 also saw increases in excise on alcohol products.

In December 2012, details of 50 major school building projects were announced to commence construction in 2013, the second year of the Plan. In November 2013, details of the 70 building projects to commence construction in 2014 were announced, the third year of the Plan. All three Plans are available on my Department's website.

together.<\/p><p>Overall Context<\/p><p>The Public Service Exchequer Pay Bill will have been reduced by 22% from &euro;17.5 billion gross in 2009 to an estimated &euro;13.6 billion net by the end of 2014. The Government agreed the Haddington Road Agreement with the objective of facilitating an underlying cost reduction by &euro;1 billion in the Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill by 2016, through the implementation of a number of central and sectoral measures provided for in the Agreement.  \u00a0<\/p><p>In 2013, the total amount of allocated savings arising from the implementation of measures under the Agreement was almost &euro;300m. Of this total, approximately &euro;251m was allocated to Exchequer pay savings with further savings of &euro;46m, arising from pensions and a number of other non-Exchequer sources (e.g. Local Authorities, Central Bank), being incorporated in advance in the context of the Estimates process.  \u00a0<\/p><p>In 2014, a further &euro;465m in savings arising from the implementation of measures under the Agreement was incorporated into the budgetary arithmetic. This reflects the full year impact of various measures implemented in 2013, as well as measures which are to be implemented in 2014, such as the deferral of incremental progression.\u00a0 This brings the total amount of savings allocated to date under the Agreement to &euro;762m.  \u00a0<\/p><p>While the savings allocated under the Agreement in 2013 helped to bring the Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill to a more sustainable level, it has also allowed the scope to recruit new staff to front-line services, particularly in the Education Sector and the Health Sector. This re-investment of some of the pay bill and efficiency savings is a key part of the Public Service Reform Agenda - a dividend from the reforms we are delivering - and will help sustain and improve key public services.  \u00a0<\/p><p>This is why at the time of the last Budget, the Government was able to adjust the target for Public Service numbers in 2014, to allow more scope for additional staff in classrooms and hospital wards. The underlying savings delivered by the Haddington Road Agreement are being used in part to fund additional posts in these areas as the Exchequer Pay Bill approaches a more sustainable level while still maintaining tight control of the overall Exchequer Pay Bill.  \u00a0<\/p><p>Central Measures<\/p><p>Of the &euro;1 billion target, the pay reduction to those earning over &euro;65,000 will deliver approximately &euro;210m in savings. Other central measures, including pension reductions and increment pauses will deliver in the order of &euro;130m, bringing the total amount of savings from central measures to over &euro;340m.<\/p><p><b>Summary of savings from Central measures (34%)<\/b><table><tr><th><b>-<\/b><\/th><th><b>Full year<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Reduction in higher pay<\/td><td>&euro;210m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Increment deferrals<\/td><td>&euro;60m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Other measures - including pensions<\/td><td>&euro;72m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Total<\/b><\/td><td><b>&euro;342m<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Productivity<\/p><p>The Agreement will deliver an unprecedented increase in productivity across the Public Service, through the provision of almost 15 million additional working hours annually, and a range of other efficiency and reform measures. While the application of the additional hours varies by sector depending on local patterns in the demand for services, the scale of ongoing reductions in staff numbers and the extent of overtime and agency payments, the overarching objectives of the additional hours are to reduce the requirement for paid overtime hours and agency costs; to allow management to maintain services against the backdrop of reduced staff numbers; and to facilitate amendments to the supervision and substitution allowance in the education sector.  \u00a0<\/p><p>These additional hours will facilitate the delivery of an estimated &euro;431m in savings as follows:<\/p><p><b>Summary of savings from productivity measures (43%)<\/b><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th><b>Full year<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Reduced requirement for overtime and agency working<\/td><td>&euro;131m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Elimination of supervision and substitution allowance<\/td><td>&euro;125m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Facilitating headcount reduction<\/td><td>&euro;175m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Total<\/b><\/td><td><b>&euro;431m<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Sector Specific Measures<\/p><p>There have been numerous specific measures agreed at the sectoral level.

It is clear that the Haddington Road Agreement has facilitated significant reductions in the Public Service Exchequer Pay Bill, and it is critical that public service management continue to pursue the maximum savings that are enabled by the Agreement.\u00a0 In this context, I would highlight the fact that the net Public Service Exchequer Pay Bill reduced by &euro;210m in 2013. This reduction was enabled, in part, by the implementation of various measures under the Haddington Road Agreement which helped to ensure that spending remained in line with profile and resulted in Ireland delivering on our fiscal target for 2013.\u00a0 The Public Service Exchequer Pay Bill will reduce by approximately &euro;500m in 2014 from &euro;14.1 billion net in 2013 to an estimated &euro;13.6 billion net by end 2014.  \u00a0<\/p><p>The Government has also been enabled to apply some of the Pay Bill resources saved under the Haddington Road Agreement into employment in key front-line public services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900078#WRJ03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":431,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 163 and 164 answered with Question No. 144.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Programme Expenditure","counter":433,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900079#WRK00150"},{"type":"question","counter":434,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[30257\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900079#WRK00200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the details of the budget allocated to capital expenditure; the amount spent; and the amount carried forward from 2012 to date in 2014 in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1008","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":435,"content":"<p>The table below outlines the aggregate of the budget allocated to capital expenditure, the amount spent and the quantum of carry-forward for the full years\u00a02012 and 2013.

Added to this, our reputation within the EU and the wider world was at an all-time low. Tax revenues had declined sharply, while public expenditure on the other hand had accelerated. <\/p><p>  Entering the programme and delivering on its targets, gave Ireland the time and opportunity to manage the crises it faced in a more measured and less severe manner than would otherwise have been possible.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The clear objective of this Government was to emerge from the programme with a leaner, fitter and stronger economy and with our banking system stabilised and no longer a source of instability. Now, more than three years on, we can honestly say that we have made meaningful progress in this regard.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>  Had we failed to attain the targets set down by the Troika we the debt and deficit levels would have continued to increase to unsustainable levels and we would have no access to the financial markets. Stability has been returned to the public finances through the sustained efforts of all Departments and their agencies to make\u00a0savings, pursue efficiencies and manage within constrained budgets often while meeting increasing demands for the public services they deliver.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The Government is committed to making fundamental changes to the way the public service operates to safeguard the delivery of essential services in a way that is in keeping with the needs of a modern society, and makes the best use of resources\u00a0while driving value for money for the citizen.\u00a0 Public Service Reform has been a key element of the Government's strategic response to the economic crisis and is a central theme in the Programme for Government. \u00a0The Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016, published in January this year, contains a detailed action plan with clear timelines. \u00a0Public procurement is a key area of reform\u00a0as is\u00a0the Haddington Road Agreement which is delivering important workplace efficiencies and enhanced productivity.<\/p><p>  In setting Budgetary allocations, the Government balances the requirements of bringing sustainability to the public finances, promoting and supporting economic recovery and protecting the most vulnerable in society. The second Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE) is underway and will be published alongside the Estimates in October.\u00a0 The CRE process will allow Government to evaluate how resources are being utilised,\u00a0prioritise key areas of spending and will set out current expenditure ceilings\u00a0for all Departments for the period\u00a02015   2017.<\/p><p>  Since July 2012 I have made a number of announcements in relation to additional capital investment which is primarily focused on projects with a high employment impact and which can benefit local economies throughout the State. It is also predicated on the use of non-traditional funding methods e.g. private financing through the PPP structure and additional Exchequer investment through reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of State assets and the new licencing arrangement for the National Lottery. <\/p><p>  A review of the public capital programme is currently underway which will culminate in the setting of the Government's capital investment framework for the period ahead. \u00a0The use of further proceeds arising from the sale of assets will be considered as part of the review.\u00a0 The review will also examine the scope for the utilisation of other non-traditional funding sources to augment investment in employment intensive projects that can promote economic growth and best meet our infrastructure needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900081#WRM00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Programme Expenditure","counter":483,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900081#WRM01000"},{"type":"question","counter":484,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[30360\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900081#WRM01100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent, if any to which any audit of deficits in vital infrastructure has been undertaken with a view to identifying major capital works which might have a substantial positive impact on the economy in the event of the availability of appropriate funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":485,"content":"<p>My Department is currently undertaking a review of the public capital programme with a view to setting the Government's investment strategy and capital budget for the five year period ahead. <\/p><p>  The last capital review, conducted in 2011, assessed the existing capacity of the country's infrastructure and identified remaining gaps to be addressed in order to aid economic recovery, social cohesion and environmental sustainability.

the Central Statistics Office (CSO). However, I understand that the CSO does not compile statistics on jobs created on a county basis.  As regards jobs created, the only figures available to my Department are those in respect of jobs created, on a county basis, in client companies of the Enterprise Development Agencies under the aegis of my Department.  Table 1, accompanying this reply, provides details of jobs created, since 2010 in companies in Co. Kerry that were supported by Enterprise Ireland (EI), IDA Ireland and Kerry County Enterprise Board. <\/p><p>The number of people signing on the live register in Kerry has fallen from 16,600 in June 2011 to 13,612 in June 2014. This means that the number of people signing on the live register in this period has fallen by 2,988 or 18%.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity through the Action Plan for Jobs 2014, which recognises the need for measures to support the unemployed and keep jobseekers close to the labour market. <\/p><p>The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs also recognises that regions that support strong and dynamic enterprises are crucial to Ireland's return to overall economic growth.  The Action Plan includes a number of measures to be taken in 2014 to support competitive regions.  One of the mechanisms by which we will support enterprise development at regional level in 2014 is by building new property capacity in regional locations to help cater for FDI projects.  <\/p><p>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Local Authorities will develop integrated local economic and community plans, to promote economic and community development in each local authority area. <\/p><p>The Action Plan includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.<\/p><p>The Regional Aid Guidelines enable the State to grant State Aid, at enhanced rates, to businesses in order to support new investment and new employment in productive projects in Ireland's most disadvantaged regions.  This helps the convergence of these regions with the more advantaged regions of the EU.  Regional Aid is also provided under schemes for tourism grants, marine tourism, urban and rural renewal and other tax-based development schemes.  <\/p><p>The 2014-2020 Regional Aid Guidelines came into force on 1 July 2014.  I welcome the inclusion of Kerry in the new national Regional Aid Map as this will enhance the prospects of attracting new investment and the expansion of existing enterprises both foreign and indigenous.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have always promoted Kerry as a location for investment as is evidenced by the number of companies located in the County.  At the end of 2013, there were 12 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Kerry with total employment of approximately 1,600 people, together with 126 Enterprise Ireland-supported companies employing approximately 4,000 people.  These agencies continue to engage with their client companies on an ongoing basis encouraging them to develop and embed their operations in the county.<\/p><p>As regards tackling unemployment, I should also point out that the major elements of the Government&rsquo;s response are set out in the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s strategy &ldquo;Pathways to Work&rdquo;, which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created as the economy recovers, are filled by people from the Live Register - with a particular focus on those who are long-term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment.<\/p><p><b>Table 1: Jobs created in companies based in Co.

As each of Ireland&rsquo;s 143 salmon rivers has its own unique stock of salmon IFI manages salmon stocks on an individual river basis. IFI is supported in its management of salmon stocks by a statutorily based Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) on Salmon comprising scientists from IFI, Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM), the Loughs Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI- Northern Ireland) other State bodies and third level institutions. IFI also carries out extensive monitoring of salmon stock status which feed into the scientific committee's assessments carried out every year. <\/p><p>  The salmon Conservation Limit (CL) is the number of spawning salmon required to maintain a sustainable population and is used to indicate the number of salmon in a river system above which a harvestable surplus can be considered. Salmon conservation limits are set similarly for all of Ireland&rsquo;s salmon rivers. The SSC revised the conservation limits for all rivers for the 2014 scientific advice. <\/p><p>  The Waterford Estuary has three main rivers entering the estuary; the Barrow, Nore and Suir. IFI advise me that Waterford estuary is currently below its conservation limit and therefore there is no permitted salmon \/sea trout fishery there. The SSC advice for the Nore for 2014 was that the river was meeting its CL and had a surplus of 2214 salmon. The SSC advice for the Suir for 2014 was that the river was not meeting its CL and had a deficit of 2449 salmon and therefore would remain closed for harvesting of salmon. The SSC advice for the Barrow for 2014 was that the river was also not meeting its CL and had a deficit of 8284 salmon and therefore would remain closed for harvesting of Salmon. The opening of a commercial salmon fishery can only be considered if there is a suitable surplus of salmon (in excess of conservation limit) available for harvest.<\/p><p>  Prior to any commercial salmon fishing being permitted in the Waterford Estuary it will be necessary for all the waters in the vicinity of the fishing location to be in surplus at the same time and for genetic analysis to have confirmed that no other stocks are mixed in the area. If genetic assessment proves that the stocks in the area are specific to local rivers only, and that analysis shows that these stocks are all above their conservation limit with a surplus available for exploitation, consideration could be given to a commercial fishery. It should be noted that where such a regime exists the overall quota for the area is not based on the sum of the individual quotas as this could result in over exploitation of the river with the lowest surplus. As a consequence any combined quota must ensure that all relevant rivers attain their conservation limit. Any future decision on a fishery can only be taken in the context of the estuary being above its conservation limit. Ireland must be particularly careful to ensure that all national and international legislation and other obligations are met in any future management regime. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900087#WRS01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1069"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":719,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900087#WRS01050"},{"type":"question","counter":720,"qnumday":297,"qnumall":"[29975\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900087#WRS01100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if an approach has been made to the National Roads Authority to construct the North-South interconnector underground in ducts as part of the A5\/N2 project; and if the NRA have commented on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":721,"content":"<p>While this is a matter for the company and not one in which I, as Minister, have any role or function, the Deputy may wish to contact EirGrid directly on the matter.

The SICAP <i>aim is to reduce poverty, promote social inclusion and equality through local, regional and national engagement and collaboration. <\/i>I am confident that supports for the most disadvantaged in our society, such as Travellers, will continue under SICAP.<\/p><p>My Department also supports a number of Traveller projects under the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO). This funding scheme, which supports national organisations in the community and voluntary sector, aims to provide multi-annual funding to national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services. A new round of funding was advertised for applications earlier this year. Following Pobal&rsquo;s assessment of applications on behalf of my Department, I approved 55 applications for funding under the scheme for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. A number of Traveller community groups were successful in applying for funding under the scheme, including Pavee Point, the National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum and the Irish Traveller Movement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900090#WRV01300","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Accommodation Funding","counter":842,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900090#WRV01350"},{"type":"question","counter":843,"qnumday":343,"qnumall":"[30364\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900090#WRV01400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the amount spent in 2013 on emergency accommodation; and the amount to date in 2014.","asker":"1022","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":844,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level.

In 2011 a review by the European Union Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risk (SCHER) concluded that there are no known negative health implications from fluoridating water at levels used in the EU.  The balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, i.e. the adjustment of the natural concentration of fluoride in drinking water to the optimal recommended level for the prevention of dental caries, does not cause any ill effects and protects the oral health of the population. <\/p><p>  Many countries have water fluoridation schemes, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, Australia and New Zealand.  Water fluoridation is less common in Europe. However, fluoride is an essential part of oral health policy in all countries in Europe.  In countries which do not fluoride water this can mean fluoridation of salt or provision of community fluoridation through other means. <\/p><p>  The Department of Health keeps this policy under constant review.  As part of this ongoing work, a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation at its current level on the health of the population and on the environment is being conducted by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department.  The Department is also collaborating in a University College Cork-led research project, &quot;Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth&quot; (FACCT).  The study will consider the impact of changes on the oral health of children, following policy decisions relating to toothpaste use by infants and young children made in 2002 and the reduction in the level of fluoridation in drinking water introduced in 2007.  In addition, the pilot phase of a study on general and oral health findings in adults linked to the duration of exposure to fluoridated water as part of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA) is under way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900096#WRBB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Appeals","counter":1060,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900096#WRBB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1061,"qnumday":423,"qnumall":"[30056\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900096#WRBB00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 202 of 8 May 2014, when a response will issue from the Health Service Executive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1062,"content":"<p>I understand that a letter  issued to the Deputy with the information requested.

On a comparative basis the OECD Report, Health at a Glance 2013, shows that recent reductions in public health expenditure <i>per capita<\/i>in Ireland are the highest experienced in any OECD country with the exception of Greece.  <\/p><p>2014 is proving to be a particularly challenging year for the health services.  Very difficult decisions were taken by Government in the context of the overall budgetary arithmetic.  It is however, important to note that a substantial part of the savings required related to pay and pay related savings under Haddington Road, reductions in pharmaceutical prices and expenditures (including the introduction of reference pricing of interchangeable medicines and ongoing drug price reductions and drugs delisting from the Reimbursement List) and reductions in general practitioner fees.  These adjustments, far from impacting negatively on the provision of services, can significantly enhance the capacity of the public health system to deliver quality, affordable care to the Irish public.  That being said, certain savings targets required of the HSE at the time of the Budget were considered so challenging that it was agreed that a separate validation exercise to assess their achievability would be undertaken by the Departments of Health, Public Expenditure and Reform and An Taoiseach.  While work continues in relation to the maximisation of the savings achievable under the Haddington Road Agreement, the initial savings targets under medical card probity were reduced by &euro;110m in the context of the REV.  Along with pay savings targets, and taking account of legislative issues around some of the savings measures identified, it is clear that the challenges facing the HSE in 2014 were hugely challenging from the outset.<\/p><p>There is ongoing and intensive engagement each month between officials of my Department, DPER and the HSE in the context of regular monitoring of expenditure.  The HSE is proactively engaged in internal efforts to maximise savings and cost containment plans and to ensure that additional measures are identified and safely implemented to mitigate projected deficits. <\/p><p>It would be premature for me at this stage to estimate what carryover savings may be available in relation to current expenditure, as work is ongoing to validate and assess their achievability in the context of 2014, and such matters will be considered in the context of the budget discussions.  It is not anticipated that there will be any carryover saving on capital expenditure in the current year, given the significant number of priority projects currently ongoing; should a small surplus emerge due to timing issues, it would be used to mitigate the emerging deficit on current expenditure. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900096#WRBB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Support Services","counter":1081,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900096#WRBB02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1082,"qnumday":432,"qnumall":"[30248\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070900096#WRBB02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on funding for respite services each year since 2008 indicating the size of the spend; the numbers benefiting and the breakdown across emergency, residential and in-home respite.

The reason for allowing this period to elapse was to ensure that the Scheme had bedded in and that established trends would be available in order to inform the work of the Review.  The Review is being carried out by my Department in collaboration with the HSE, with analysis and recommendations provided by an external service provider on specific issues which required specialised expertise.<\/p><p>A call for written submissions to inform the review was made on the 16th June 2012.

To examine the on-going sustainability of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme,<\/p><p>2. To examine the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating\/setting prices,<\/p><p>3. Having regard to 1. and 2. above, to consider the balance of funding between long-term residential care and community based services,<\/p><p>4. To consider the extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health),<\/p><p>5. To make recommendations for the future operation and management of the scheme.<\/p><p>The elements of the Review that relate to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme itself are well-defined, but an effective assessment of the Scheme for the future requires consideration of where it fits within the spectrum of services and supports for older people, and of how the make-up of and balances within this spectrum may change over time.
