I understand that Bord na gCon, which is responsible for the governance, regulation and development of the greyhound industry in the Republic of Ireland and the wellbeing of greyhounds, has developed a Code of Practice in relation to the welfare of greyhounds which sets out specific standards that all individuals engaged in the care and management of registered greyhounds are expected to meet.  The Code emphasises that owners and keepers must take full responsibility for the physical and social well-being of greyhounds in line with best welfare practice.  Oversight mechanisms in place regarding greyhound exports include inter-agency co-operation, co-operation with fellow members of International Greyhound Forums and intelligence\/information which is received from Welfare Officers during the course of investigations carried out under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.

I mentioned earlier that the UK is by far our largest trading partner, with CSO figures indicating that exports of agricultural products in 2015 were worth &euro;5.1 billion and imports &euro;3.8 billion. ESRI and Teagasc reports have highlighted the disproportionate impact that a Brexit is likely to have on the agrifood sector.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has therefore been giving careful consideration to the potential impact, looking at the areas in which the greatest risks are likely to arise and on which we will need to focus if exit negotiations are to commence in the coming months.  Although it is still too early to predict the outcome with any certainty, the main areas in which impacts are foreseen are in relation to tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification.  I would comment briefly again on these areas as follows:  <\/p>  <p>  -  On tariffs and trade arrangements, including the future direction of UK trade policy, it is clear that potential differences in tariffs could restrict trade in both directions and affect traditional supply practices, particularly for raw materials.  Preferential agreements already in place with third countries could require adjustment to take account of a UK withdrawal.  A further issue that could arise is the freedom of the UK to negotiate trade agreements with other third countries.  This could present a competitiveness challenge for third country suppliers, such as Ireland. However, negotiating such agreements could be a lengthy process.<\/p>  <p>  -  On the EU budget, a Brexit would result in the loss of the UK contribution to the EU budget, which currently accounts for some 5-10% of the budget.  This could have implications on future spending decisions within an already tight EU budgetary framework, which could place additional pressure on CAP funding in future years, given that it accounts for some 37% of the EU budget.  <\/p>  <p>  -  On regulations and standards, while this may not have an immediate impact in the event of a Brexit, potential differences could arise over time if the UK takes a different approach to the EU, for example in areas such as origin labelling.  This would be a significant issue in terms of additional costs, possible disruption of supply patterns and consumer preferences.<\/p>  <p>  -  On customs controls and certification, it is likely that difficulties and additional costs would emerge.  It would be expected, as a matter of course, that a UK exit from the EU could see the return of border controls, together with customs and administrative procedures.  This undoubtedly would lead to additional administrative costs.  Also of concern is that a UK exit would give rise to ongoing certification requirements, which would have significant resource requirements within my Department and significant cost implications for the agrifood industry.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the possibility of a Brexit also raises issues for the fisheries sector, particularly in the context of the management and sharing of a large number of different fish stocks that we currently share with the UK and other Member States under the Common Fisheries Policy Framework.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, it is in Ireland&rsquo;s interests for the UK to remain in the EU.  However, I and my Department are continuing to reflect on these matters so that we are prepared, if the UK decision is to exit, to establish our priorities for the negotiations in the agrifood and fisheries sectors, and to engage in these negotiations at an early date. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800051#WRA02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":22,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800051#WRA02100"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[14456\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800051#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"to amend the Animal Health and Welfare Acts to remove the exemption for fox hunting from the legislation.","asker":"1259","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":24,"content":"<p>Lawful hunting of an animal is permitted under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.

It is not within the gift of individual Member States to amend these rules. <\/p>  <p>  However at the request of Ireland and some other Member States, the EU Commission introduced a provision last year permitting payment of the levy in three annual instalments, without interest. This was on the understanding that the full amount of the levy was paid to the Commission by the Member State in 2015.  Ireland was one of the few Member States to implement this scheme and make it available to our farmers. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the discussions in the run-up to the March Council of Agriculture Ministers, Ireland proposed a further deferral of the payment to 2017 and 2018, to ease the financial burden on liable farmers in 2016. I also raised the matter with Commissioner Phil Hogan, in our recent bilateral meeting, as well as at the recent Council of Ministers meeting and encouraged him to reflect again on whether a legal basis could be found to facilitate a further deferral in super levy repayments for farmers. <\/p>  <p>  However the European Commission advised that the legal basis for the Regulations under-pinning the scheme are no longer in existence and therefore further amendments were not possible.

With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agrifood sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development.

My understanding is that this is a documentary about the use of different natural resources, including fish stocks, in three different Atlantic Communities in Ireland, Norway and Canada.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to fish stocks and their use as a natural resource I would make the point that in Ireland, fish quotas are a public resource and are managed directly by the Minister following regular detailed consultation with industry representatives. <\/p>  <p>  There has been pressure over the years to try and force a privatisation of fish quotas through the imposition of what is known as an Individual Transferable Quota or ITQ system. Ireland has successfully resisted this and I am determined that our fish resources will continue to be managed for the overall public good.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to reference the wider world in which we operate, namely the new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).  This policy provides a framework for the long term sustainability of fish stocks around our shores and the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processing industry while supporting our families and communities that depend on the sea for their livelihood.<\/p>  <p>  Among the key elements of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield). This should lead over time to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and result in more sustainable fishing patterns.  The CFP specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY.  I am committed to the ambitious objective of achieving MSY by 2020 at the latest. In line with the CFP, I consider that for some stocks we will need to phase in delivering MSY if its immediate application seriously jeopardises the social and economic sustainability of the fishing fleet. <\/p>  <p>  My overarching goal as Minister responsible for our fishing industry is to ensure a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector.  These objectives must however be balanced with the need to safeguard fish stocks for future generations. This will ensure that families dependent on fishing can look forward to being part of a vibrant, productive and resilient Irish fishing industry and can expect to continue to achieve a reasonable return for their efforts and investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800052#WRB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Genomics Scheme","counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800052#WRB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[14473\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800052#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he is satisfied with the participation rate of farmers and the programme spend to date under the beef genomics scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1357","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":49,"content":"<p>Firstly it is important to say that I am satisfied with the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) participation rates.

The reopening of Basic Payment Scheme applications at this stage would likely delay the processing of such applications for 2016, with the consequent potential for delay in payments.  Furthermore at this stage many young farmers may have entered arrangements to lease in entitlements in 2016 in order to avail of the Greening payment and Young Farmers&rsquo; Scheme payment.<\/p>  <p>  From 2017 onwards the National Reserve will be replenished from unused entitlements, as EU Regulations governing the scheme provide that entitlements that are unused for 2 consecutive years are surrendered to the National Reserve.  While I am very supportive of the provision of a National Reserve, decisions in relation to the Reserve for 2017 will be considered once the position on potential funding arising from unused entitlements and &lsquo;clawback&rsquo; has been established.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800052#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Eligibility","counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800052#WRB02900"},{"type":"question","counter":66,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[14489\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800052#WRB03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will amend the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme to allow farmers with privately owned hills to be designated under tier 1 and tier 2; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":67,"content":"<p>GLAS is an agri-environment measure under the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-2020 approved by the European Commission and aims to deliver overarching benefits in terms of the rural environment and address European Union issues of climate change mitigation, water quality and the preservation of habitats and species.

Irish agriculture is characterised by low levels of insecticide use.  In 2013 a partial ban on neonicotinoid insecticides was introduced in the EU due to concerns about possible impacts on pollinators.  My Department has fully implemented the Commission decision in relation to these compounds.<\/p>  <p>  Intensive research is ongoing worldwide to quantify impacts of field-level exposure to neonicotinoids and to determine and understand impacts on honeybees, bumblebees and solitary bee species.  The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is currently undertaking a new assessment of the risks posed by neonicotinoids to take account of all relevant information that has become available since 2013.  This assessment is expected to be completed by the end of January 2017 and will provide the scientific basis for a further Commission proposal expected next year.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to evaluate pesticides based on robust scientific evidence, ensuring the availability of products to support sustainable agricultural production and recognising the need to find a sustainable balance between the protection of pollinators and agricultural production. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to monitoring bee populations, it should be noted there are 98 different species of bees present in Ireland. These comprise of one managed species, the honeybee, and 97 wild species which include 20 species of bumblebees.  The best indicator of changes in the wild bee population is Ireland&rsquo;s Bumble Bee Monitoring Scheme.  Indeed Ireland was the first country in the world to develop a national bumble bee monitoring scheme and a number of other countries have since followed our lead. Since Ireland&rsquo;s Bumble Bee Monitoring Scheme commenced in 2012 the research has identified that there has been no significant decline in bumble bee numbers. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s National Apiculture Programme is a research programme co-funded by my Department and the European Commission. In recent years it has been lead by researchers based in University of Limerick working in conjunction with Teagasc and NUI Maynooth.  As part of the National Apiculture Programme the State has been monitoring over-winter honeybee colony losses each year since the winter of 2008-2009. Over this period annual Irish overwinter losses have ranged from 13% in some years to as high as 37% in 2012\/2013. The Irish weather has a strong influence on colony strength.  The exceptionally wet summer in 2012 followed by the prolonged cold weather in early 2013 which resulted in a very late Spring proved a detrimental combination for Irish bees.  Indeed the impact of the weather that year is supported by the fact that for the preceding and the following year&rsquo;s beekeepers only experienced 13% over-winter losses. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800052#WRB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800052#WRB03600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cross-Border Co-operation","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800052#WRB03500"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[14289\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800052#WRB03600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the State bodies under his remit which have developed memoranda of understanding with his counterpart in Northern Ireland with regard to the efficient delivery of services on the island of Ireland; if he has carried out a cost-benefit analysis of the development of further memoranda of understanding; the details of the cost-benefit analysis; and the new memoranda of understanding he will be creating between State bodies under their remits through the lifetime of this Government.","asker":"1235","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[14448\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800052#WRB03700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he is satisfied with the level of data that is collected on the issues which come under his remit; the steps he will take to work with the administration in Northern Ireland to collect data under his aegis on a North-South basis; and the budgets he will put in place to undertake this work (details supplied).","asker":"1235","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":74,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 79 together.<\/p><p>The Central Statistics Office and the National Economic and Social Development Office (NESDO) are State Bodies under the remit of my Department.

In addition I intend to bring forward proposals to enhance and update the legislative framework for the lawful interception of communications and for covert electronic surveillance, to combat the threats from serious and organised crime and terrorism.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner has also announced the establishment of a special crime Task Force, in cooperation with other agencies including the Revenue Commissioners and Department of Social Protection.  The purpose of the Task Force will be to focus relentlessly on persons involved in gangland activities.<\/p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach announced, a separate task force will be set up in close consultation with community groups in the north inner city to identify the best means of tackling the various long-term problems to which the Deputy refers, including social exclusion, drugs, education and employment.\"<\/p>  <p>  I have consistently made clear that we would fund whatever measures were needed for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to best tackle the critical and unprecedented challenges they currently face.  I was glad to secure substantial additional funding today of &euro;55 million for the remainder of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that statutory provision in relation to young offenders is set out in the Children Act 2001 (as amended).  Accordingly, where a young person under the age of 18 comes into conflict with the law, the principles of the Act apply.  A key principle in the Children Act relating to young offenders is that detention should be a last resort. In support of this principle, the legislation facilitates the incremental application of a series of measures, ranging from diversion in the first instance through community based sanctions, to detention.<\/p>  <p>  The operation of the above statutory framework is substantially supported by the significant investment by my Department in community based programmes which are directed at diverting young people from further involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour.  These youth justice community programmes proceed on the basis of evidence that diversion programmes in the form of high quality preventative intervention can do more to reduce crime than more costly custodial sanctions.  In 2016,  just under &euro;17 million has been allocated by my Department to the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) to administer Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs), Young Persons Probation Projects (YPPs) and a number of other youth diversion community-based projects.<\/p>  <p>  The evidence indicates that Diversion Projects are a sound investment.  The GYDPs tackle behaviours such as impulsiveness which are associated with the bulk of youth crime; for example public order offending and minor theft.  The GYDPs have a critical role to play in reducing youth crime.  Their role is to prevent or 'divert' young people from the onset of repeat or serious offending, including potential future involvement in gangland crime, and they do this very effectively and efficiently.  The Annual Reports of the Committee appointed to monitor the effectiveness of the Diversion Programme provide an overview of youth crime in the particular year in question.  As such, the reports include details of, inter alia, the number of incidents and individual children and young people referred to the Diversion Programme and the outcomes of such referrals.  The reports also include details in relation to the resources deployed by the Garda Commissioner to support the operation of the Programme.  Arrangements in relation to the publication of the 2014 Report of the Monitoring Committee are currently being finalised.  In its 2014 Report the Committee reports that 9,991 children and young people were referred to the Diversion Programme.  This compares with 10,420 children and young people referred in 2013 and continues the downward trend in the number of children and young people referred to the Programme in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  The officials from my Department assigned to the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS), in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are responsible for the management of the GYDPs and in partnership with the Probation Service in the case of YPPs.  Through quantitative and qualitative analysis each GYDP, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, develops a youth crime profile of the catchment area and of the young people who live there so that services are targeted effectively.  The focussed targeting of young people in this way is complemented by the application of a risk assessment to identify the needs of the young people referred to the projects.

Funding was approved for the establishment of a dedicated Armed Support Unit for the Dublin Metropolitan Region given the identified need to enhance armed support capability in Dublin and to free up the resources of the Emergency Response Unit.  The Dublin Armed Support Unit is, as a matter of priority, in the process of being set up and trained and I understand that it will have a complement of some fifty-five Garda members.

As the proposal\u00a0is aimed at targeting the affordability of homes from the position of the purchasers, I do not believe such a VAT amendment would be of assistance.\u00a0 As an alternative, and as I stated at the Oireachtas Committee on Housing recently, I have asked my Department to examine an approach through the income tax system, perhaps similar to the Home Renovation Incentive, in which\u00a0relief could be provided to home purchasers.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that section 266A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997\u00a0provides for refunds of deposit interest retention tax (DIRT) to first-time buyers who purchase or self-build a property for occupation as their home. The property must be purchased or self-built between 14 October 2014 and 31 December 2017. A first-time buyer who has either individually or jointly with any other person previously purchased or built a property is not eligible for a DIRT refund. The amount of the refund is capped at the DIRT paid on savings of up to a maximum of 20% of the purchase price or, in the case of a self-built property, up to 20% of the market value of the completed property. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800056#WRF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Liquidation","counter":247,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800056#WRF01450"},{"type":"question","counter":248,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[14529\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800056#WRF01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps he will take to ensure persons receive their agreed entitlements in respect of the non-payment of agreed redundancy pay to former IBRC staff; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1308","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":249,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Special Liquidators of IBRC that all of the preferential creditor payments to former employees of IBRC have been processed for payment.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the unsecured creditor claims of former employees of IBRC are in the process of being adjudicated on by the Special Liquidators.

However, the cost of the claims for tax relief on health expenses, which includes medical and dental expenses, in 2014 (the most recent tax year for which data are currently available), is estimated to be in the order of &euro;146 million.\u00a0Figures in relation to\u00a0previous tax years are available on the Revenue Commissioners' statistics webpage at\u00a0 www.revenue.ie\/en\/about\/statistics\/index.html. This information can be found under the heading Cost of Tax Expenditures (Credits, Allowances and Reliefs), at www.revenue.ie\/en\/about\/statistics\/costs-expenditures.html. Updates will be published on Commissioners' website in due course.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, routine dental treatment such as the extraction, scaling and filling of teeth and the provision and repairing of artificial teeth or dentures is currently excluded from the relief. As a result, information on expenses in relation to routine dental treatment is not required to be returned to Revenue. As Revenue have no data on the treatment cost or potential number of claims it is not possible to provide the estimated cost the Deputy requested.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may however be aware that the State already provides some support to those who require dental treatment through the schemes detailed below:<\/p>  <p>  (i) Treatment Benefits from the Department of Social Protection.\u00a0It is my understanding that this scheme is available to insured workers and retired people who have the required number of PRSI contributions. The\u00a0benefit under this scheme provides for an oral examination for a qualifying individual once per calendar year.<\/p>  <p>  (ii) The Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) provides access to dental treatment for adult medical card holders (over 16 years of age). A free oral examination every calendar year and free emergency dental treatment for relief of pain and sepsis are available to all eligible patients. This includes 2 fillings per annum and all extractions. <\/p>  <p>  The DTSS provides treatment for periodontal\/gum disease in cases where care is especially warranted. This includes clients who are pregnant, have diabetes or immuno-compromising conditions, or require relevant surgical procedures such as cardiac surgery and joint replacements. Approval for periodontal treatment may be given by the local Principal Dental Surgeon for these and other high risk or special needs groups.<\/p>  <p>  Further information in relation to these two schemes is available from my colleagues, the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Health respectively. <\/p>  <p>  The restriction of the Treatment Benefit scheme as it relates to dental treatment in 2010 was expected to lead to savings of &euro;37.5 million. To provide tax relief for routine dental treatment would serve to negate some of the savings achieved from that policy change. Given the existing supports available, particularly for those on low incomes through their access via the\u00a0medical card, I am not predisposed to expanding the tax relief available for\u00a0health expenses to include expenses associated with routine dental treatment.

These changes included an increase in the amount that can be raised\u00a0by a company in a 12 month period from &euro;2.5 million to &euro;5 million and an increase in the\u00a0lifetime limit per company from\u00a0&euro;10 million to &euro;15 million. The EII is generally available to all micro, small and medium-sized companies. The maximum relief available to an investor is 40% (the top rate of income tax) of the amount invested,\u00a0subject to a maximum investment amount of\u00a0&euro;150,000 per annum per investor.<\/p>  <p>  In contrast, the UK Seed Enterprise Scheme (SEIS) is\u00a0targeted specifically at Start-Ups and permits a company to raise a maximum of &pound;150,000 in total. While an investor can claim tax relief at a rate of 50% on their investment, the maximum investment permitted per annum is &pound;100,000. Relief from CGT on any increase in the\u00a0value of the shares is also provided in certain circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Recent statistics provided to me by the Revenue Commissioners\u00a0indicate that the level of investments made under EII has increased significantly in recent years. In 2015, companies raised over &euro;80 million through EII and more than three quarters of that funding was raised by micro-enterprises.\u00a0The overall level of funding raised increased by almost 30% in a single year. Therefore, I am not convinced that the provision of\u00a0additional incentives would be appropriate\u00a0at the current time.\u00a0My officials will however, analyse the level\u00a0of job creation among firms availing of EII in advance of Budget 2017.

This relief is not restricted to new businesses but to be eligible for the relief there is a requirement, among other conditions, that the person must have been working in the business as a director or employee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800056#WRF02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Relief Application","counter":265,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800056#WRF02650"},{"type":"question","counter":266,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[14713\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800056#WRF02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if it is possible to claim tax back under any scheme, such as the MED 1 scheme or otherwise, operated by his Department and the Revenue Commissioners, for counselling, psychiatric treatment or any other such forms of therapy; if not, if he will consider such an approach; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1287","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":267,"content":"<p>Tax relief in respect of health expenses is provided for in section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.

This resource was allocated in accordance with pupil enrolment. 42% of second-level schools at the time were allocated at least 22 hours per week in respect of guidance (22 hours being the equivalent of one teaching post) while the remainder of the schools were allocated between 8 and 17 hours of guidance per week.<\/p><p>Since September 2012 at post primary level guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. This operates at local school level.<\/p><p>The current budget provides an improved staffing allocation to second level schools for the purpose of enhancing guidance provision. This improvement takes effect from next September. It brings the basis of allocation from 19:1 to 18.7:1 for the 2016\/17 school year. This improvement of 0.3 in PTR allocation is a restoration of 50% of the teaching resources that were removed when the allocation of guidance posts was brought within quota.<\/p><p>Restoring the guidance counsellor allocation to 100% will require an additional 300 teaching posts at an estimated cost of &euro;19m per annum.<\/p><p>The delivery of the 50% restoration through a change in the staffing schedule will allow each school to determine how best to allocate the additional resources to meet the guidance needs of the school. The circular issued earlier this year by my Department outlining the allocation of teaching resources clearly stated that this additional resource is to complement existing resources in order to best meet the guidance needs of the school in line with the school's guidance plan.<\/p><p>It is important to note that in previous changes to guidance counselling allocations in 2012, as a consequence of the Budget adjustment which had to be made at the time, all 195 DEIS schools were effectively sheltered from these changes as a result of the more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This was a 0.75 point improvement compared to the current PTR of 19:1 that applies in non-fee-paying second-level schools.<\/p><p>That was a very important protection for the cohort of our schools in DEIS most in need of support. DEIS schools will also further benefit from the 0.3 improvement to the staffing schedule which will give them an enhanced allocation on the basis of 17.95:1 in respect of the 2016\/17 school year.<\/p><p>The new National Skills Strategy provides for a review of the full range of guidance services, tools and careers information available to students and adults. The review will map future priorities and make recommendations for improvements.<\/p><p>The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts (including guidance positions) is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012).

With this information, nationwide demographic exercises are carried out to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary levels.<\/p>  <p>  When it is decided that a new school is required to meet demographic needs in an area, the Department runs a separate patronage process to decide who will operate the school. It is open to all patrons and prospective patrons to apply for patronage of the school under this process and the level of parental preference for each patron is key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the decision on the patronage of the new school which will open this September to serve the Drumcondra\/Marino Dublin 1 area, my Department assessed the applications received from the prospective patrons, including examining the parental preferences received in the applications to ensure they represented children living within the school planning area which will be served by this school, and prepared a report for the consideration of the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG) who then submitted their report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision. The patronage assessment report which is published on my Department website, while indicating substantial support for an Irish medium school, reflects nearly twice as many valid preferences for an Educate Together school in this area.<\/p>  <p>  I accepted the recommendation of the NSEG and the patronage of the new school remains as announced.

Legal advice indicates that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.<\/p><p>  The NCSE has published a Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act.  This report, which was published in 2006, made recommendations which suggested that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235 million per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act.  The estimate of costs did not identify those costs which related only to the introduction of Individual Education Plans.<\/p><p>  My Department's opinion is that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report.  However, a total estimate of this amount has not been quantified.<\/p><p>  Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement remaining sectors of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted.  The level of additional expenditure required would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>  Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who might qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>  At present, all schools are encouraged to use Education Plans through training support and guidance.  Schools use a range of different education plans, such as Student Support files, Personal Pupil Plans, or Individual Education Plans.  As these education plans are prepared and retained in schools, my Department does not have details of who many such support plans are presently in place, or the number of different types of education plans used.  However, my Departments Inspectorate's advice is that the majority of schools are now using some form of individual education planning for children with special needs.<\/p><p>  While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>  It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.<\/p><p>  Under the Programme for a Partnership Government I have also committed to consulting with stakeholders to see how best to progress sections of the EPSEN Act that were introduced on a non-statutory basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800059#WRJ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Facilities","counter":411,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800059#WRJ03050"},{"type":"question","counter":412,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[14559\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800059#WRJ03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of buildings at third level which are rented or prefabricated; the annual cost of renting these; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":413,"content":"<p>Third Level Colleges and Institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for the day to day management of their affairs including the rental of accommodation.

NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.

However, I must point out that, under the Universities Act 1997, universities in Ireland are autonomous institutions and therefore have responsibility for the day to day management of their own affairs, including issues relating to admissions.  Accordingly, the entry requirements for third level education courses are determined by individual higher education institutions.  The Central Applications Office (CAO) administer the processing of applications on behalf of the higher education institutions and my Department does not have any role or function in relation to this.  However, I can provide you with the following information in relation to the matter raised.<\/p><p>The Irish Universities Association has developed a revised model for converting A-level grades to Leaving Certificate points for the purposes of entry to universities here from 2016.  This adjustment will favour A Level students, given the desire of Irish universities to attract more applications from Northern Ireland, and the UK generally, and given that only small numbers of Northern Irish students sit four A Level subjects.<\/p><p>Following a detailed statistical analysis, involving detailed analysis of GCE and A Level participation rates and performances across the UK and in Northern Ireland, and conducted in cooperation with the CCEA in Belfast, it has been agreed that the revised model will increase the points for an A* grade from 150 to 180, for an A from 135 to 150, and make further adjustments to other grades.  This will remove a significant disincentive for students who sit only 3 A Level exams, which meant they could not realistically compete for many of the more high-demand courses in Irish universities, and will apply from 2016.  The revised model resulting from this work can be found at:<\/p><p>.<\/p><p>Because the points for A* have been increased from 150 points to 180 points under the new model, it is necessary to cap the possible points achievable for a fourth subject at 60 points.  This is to ensure that the total points which it is possible to achieve is 600 points, which is the maximum which can be achieved by those sitting the Irish Leaving Certificate, or by students presenting with four A* A Levels under the previous model.  In developing this model, the universities have endeavoured to ensure equality of opportunity for all applicants, whether they apply with an Irish Leaving Certificate or with a school leaving qualification from the UK or any other EU country.<\/p><p>If you require any further information in relation to this matter you should address your query directly to the Irish Universities Association who will be able to assist you in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800061#WRL01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Admissions","counter":484,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800061#WRL01800"},{"type":"question","counter":485,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[14599\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800061#WRL01900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2015, including if and why he has removed it as a priority from the legislative programme, given the Stage to which it had advanced.","asker":"1311","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":486,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to publish new School Admissions legislation taking account of current draft proposals and addressing issues including publication of school enrolment policies, an end to waiting lists, introduction of annual enrolment structures, and transparency and fairness in admissions for pupils and their parents.<\/p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill which was published in April 2015 did not progress through the Houses of the Oireachtas and was not reinstated for the current D&aacute;il session.<\/p><p>I have commenced a process of consultation with opposition parties to discuss my proposals to introduce a new Admissions Bill to make the process of enrolling children in school easier for parents.<\/p><p>Following these consultations, it is my intention to publish a new Admissions Bill during the current D&aacute;il session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800061#WRL02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Site Acquisitions","counter":487,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800061#WRL02100"},{"type":"question","counter":488,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[14629\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800061#WRL02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to investigate the possibility of purchasing the Augustinian Novitiate building on Old Court Road, Killakee, Rathfarnham, Dublin 16 as a secondary school.","asker":"1311","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":489,"content":"<p>Officials from my Department are working closely with officials South Dublin County Council under the Memorandum of Understanding for the acquisition of school sites to procure a suitable site for a post-primary school to serve the Firhouse area.

In order to guide its review of programmes, the Teaching Council published Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers.<\/p>  <p>  The post graduate primary initial teacher education programme run by the HEI to which the Deputy refers was reconfigured in 2014 and the new Professional Masters of Education was accredited by the Teaching Council in July 2014.<\/p>  <p>  One of the recommendations made by the Teaching Council as part of the accreditation process was that the HEI should take steps, wherever possible, to improve staff\/student ratios.  The accreditation report further recommended that accreditation be granted for 3 years after which time a mid-term progress report would be submitted by the HEI.  This progress report is due in July 2017 and a decision will then be by the Teaching Council on granting a further period of accreditation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800061#WRL04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":508,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800061#WRL04200"},{"type":"question","counter":509,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[14690\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800061#WRL04300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when he will review the staffing thresholds for two, three and four-teacher schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":510,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government has a commitment to reduce class sizes at primary level and to commencing a review within three months of teacher appointment thresholds in small schools with four teachers or less.<\/p><p>The pupil teacher ratio in the current school year is 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils.<\/p><p>Budget 2016 provides for a one point adjustment to the staffing allocation to primary schools, which will be implemented for the 2016\/17 school year.

It requires that, in order to be eligible to receive the qualified rate of pay and allowances, a person on their first appointment to teaching must be registered with the Teaching Council and appropriately qualified for that position.  This was introduced for the purpose of ensuring quality and promoting professional standards in teaching and this goal has been strongly supported by the teacher unions.<\/p>  <p>  The second measure was taken as part of Budget 2011.  The last Government applied a reduction in the pay of new entrants to the public service.  In the case of new teachers, a reduction of 10% was applied to pay and certain allowances and all new teachers were required to start on the first point of the scale rather than the third point as had previously been the case for most teachers.  The new pay rates applied to all teachers who were new appointees or who became qualified on or after 1 January 2011.<\/p>  <p>  In 2012 a public service-wide review of allowances was also carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and, pending its outcome, the payment of qualification allowances was suspended with effect from 1 February 2012.  As a result of the review, the Government abolished qualification allowances with effect from that date and a new salary scale was created with a starting point equivalent to the fourth point of the previous scale for all entrants to teaching.  This reduced the impact of the ending of the qualification allowances and ensured a broad consistency across the public service.<\/p>  <p>  The effect of the above measures with regard to salary for teachers is explained below.<\/p>  <p>  1. A person first appointed to an Oireachtas funded teaching post before 1 January 2011 whose date of first qualified Oireachtas funded teaching service is&ndash;<\/p>  <p>  (a) before 5 December 2011, will be paid on the pre-2011 qualified pay scale and the qualification allowances applicable to that scale,<\/p>  <p>  (b) between 5 December 2011 and 28 April 2013, will be paid on pre-2011 pay scale and qualification allowances applicable to that scale subject to the maximum value of the honours primary degree allowance applicable to that scale, or<\/p>  <p>  (c) on or after 29 April 2013, will be paid on the 1 February 2012 pay scale with no qualification allowances.<\/p>  <p>  2. A person first appointed to an Oireachtas funded teaching post between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012, whose date of first qualified Oireachtas funded teaching service is&ndash;<\/p>  <p>  (a) before 5 December 2011, will be paid on the 1 January 2011 qualified pay scale and the qualification allowances applicable to that scale,<\/p>  <p>  (b) between 5 December 2011 and 28 April 2013, will be paid on the 1 January 2011 pay scale and qualification allowances applicable to that scale subject to the maximum value of the honours primary degree allowance applicable to that scale, or<\/p>  <p>  (c) on or after 29 April 2013, will be paid on the 1 February 2012 pay scale with no qualification allowances.<\/p>  <p>  3. A person first appointed to an Oireachtas funded teaching post on or after 1 February 2012 whose date of first qualified Oireachtas funded teaching service is on or after that date will be paid on the 1 February 2012 pay scale with no qualification allowances.<\/p>  <p>  According to the records available within my Department, the person referred to by the Deputy was first appointed to an Oireachtas funded post on the 16th April 2007 with Co. Louth VEC.  He was subsequently appointed to an Oireachtas funded post within a post primary school on my Department's post primary payroll on the 12th September 2007 and he was employed as an unqualified substitute teacher.  In order to be eligible to receive the qualified rate of pay in a post primary school on my Department's post primary payroll the employee must have the relevant qualifications which include a degree and a higher diploma in education.  The person referred to by the Deputy qualified as a post primary teacher in 2013 and he is registered with the Teaching Council since the 11th October 2013.  His first qualified appointment to an Oireachtas funded teaching post on the post primary sector is 07th March 2014.  As this date is later than 29th April 2013, and as set out at number 1(c) above, he is entitled to be placed on the 1st February 2012 pay scale with no qualification allowances.<\/p>  <p>  Unqualified service in the post primary sector, prior to completing the Higher Diploma in Education, is not eligible for consideration when assigning a teacher to the relevant pay scale.  In relation to his employment with the VEC \/ETB, if he was employed in a qualified capacity by the VEC\/ETB, his previous service may be considered when assessing the entry scale.  He should  apply to the appropriate ETB authority for a statement setting out the capacity in which he was employed, the period of time, the scale point he was placed on and submit the information to the Post Primary Payroll Section of my Department for review.<\/p>  <p>  The Single Public Service Pension Scheme (SPS) was introduced in January 2013 for all new teaching appointees and for staff re-entering service after a break of six months or greater.  The teacher in question was not paid on my Department's payrolls for a period in excess of 6 months in the 2012 \/2013 school year and he was placed in the new scheme on his appointment.  If he worked in any other public service body during that period and did not have a break of 6 months or more from public service employment, he should submit documentation to that effect to the Post Primary Payroll Section of my Department so that his pension scheme membership can be reviewed and amended if appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800062#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Staff","counter":515,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800062#WRM00500"},{"type":"question","counter":516,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[14726\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800062#WRM00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to employ a second special educational needs teacher or a special education assistant in a school (details supplied) in which there are four children with special educational needs but only one special educational needs teacher; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":517,"content":"<p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating special educational needs supports, including Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and Resource Teaching support to schools to support children with special educational needs.

The Department runs an open patronage determination process to decide who will operate the schools.  It is open to all patrons and prospective patrons to apply under this process and parental demand is key to this process.<\/p><p>The Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide.  The system uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and information from my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.<\/p><p>With regard to the decision on the patronage for the Drumcondra\/Marino area my Department assessed the applications received and prepared a report for the consideration of the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG) who then submitted their report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The patronage assessment report which is published on my Department website, while indicating substantial support for an Irish medium school, reflects nearly twice as many valid preferences for an Educate Together school in this area.  I accepted their recommendation and patronage will remain as announced.  The NSEG did note the strong level of demand for Irish medium education in the Drumcondra\/Marino area and recommended that this should be kept under review in the context of future demographic exercises.<\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places due to demographic pressures.

Legal advice indicates that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE has published a Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act.  This report, which was published in 2006, made recommendations which suggested that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act.  The estimate of costs did not desegregate costs which related only to the introduction of Individual Education Plans.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's opinion is that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report.  However, a total estimate of this amount has not been quantified.<\/p>  <p>  Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement remaining sectors of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted.  The level of additional expenditure required would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who might qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.<\/p>  <p>  While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.<\/p>  <p>  It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.  In such circumstances, I do not propose, at present, to carry out a full recosting exercise for the implementation of the statutory provision of the EPSEN Act.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Programme for a Partnership Government I have also committed to consulting with stakeholders to see how best to progress sections of the EPSEN Act that were introduced on a non-statutory basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800062#WRM03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Institutions","counter":547,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800062#WRM03700"},{"type":"question","counter":548,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[14994\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800062#WRM03800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the third level institutions that are running at a deficit; the amount of the deficit by institution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":549,"content":"<p>Details of the Institutes of Technology that are showing a deficit in their draft financial statements for 2014\/15 are set out in the attached table.<\/p><p>All of the institutes listed with the exception of two - Dundalk Institute of Technology (DKIT) and Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT) - have reserves which can be used to meet their deficit.

It is estimated that 2,100 jobs could be created directly through the complete domestic processing of recyclables and bio-waste alone. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800063#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Seniors Alert Scheme","counter":589,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800063#WRN01950"},{"type":"question","counter":590,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[14400\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800063#WRN02000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on a matter regarding alarms (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":591,"content":"<p>My Department is responsible for the Seniors Alert Scheme which encourages community support for vulnerable older people in our communities by providing grant assistance towards the purchase and installation of personal monitored alarms to enable older persons, of limited means, to continue to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind.

The first of these is a knowledge sharing agreement on issues such as asset standards, specifications and research etc.  The second MOU with NIW is on a joint INTERREG funding application which is targeting two cross-Border projects.  One of these is for wastewater infrastructure which will benefit shared waters &ndash; Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough.  The second is for a catchment management project on cross-Border catchments which should positively impact on quality of water abstracted for drinking water production.  Further inquiries are being made with other bodies under my Department&rsquo;s aegis and I will communicate directly with the Deputy, if further MOUs are identified. <\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to North-South co-operation arises mainly in relation to the operation of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC), established under the Good Friday Agreement.  Building on the good co-operation to date across a broad range of environmental areas, including air quality, cross-Border waste management and environmental protection, recent discussions have explored the potential for even greater collaboration on climate issues and water quality, including water and sewerage services.<\/p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Northern Ireland Environmental Agency (NIEA) both belong to a five-agencies group (EPA, NIEA, Scottish EPA, EA(UK) and Natural Resources Wales) that meet to discuss matters of mutual interest across the UK and Ireland.  This informal network fosters collaboration across a wide range of areas including waste management, water protection and management, environmental licensing and enforcement, radon, emergency preparedness, air quality monitoring and protection, environmental strategy, research, state of the environment reporting, IT systems development and geographic information systems.  There have been particularly close contacts between the EPA and NIEA in the areas of water management and waste management for many years, and these have helped ensure good collaboration and co-operation between the two jurisdictions, when having to deal with cross-Border issues of mutual interest. <\/p><p>My Department draws on all relevant data available to support cross-Border co-operation.  There are many sources of data concerning activity and needs on the island including the Central Statistics Office and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, and the EPA.  Furthermore, in order to inform the development and implementation of policy measures in both jurisdictions, a number of studies have been initiated under the auspices of the NSMC on, for example, Policy Options to Reduce Emissions from &lsquo;Smoky&rsquo; Coal and Other Residential Solid Fuels, and a study on the environmental impacts of Unconventional Gas Exploration and Extraction in Ireland, including fracking technology. <\/p><p>In addition to work under the NSMC, my Department co-operates with a range of bodies in Northern Ireland, including on marine and planning matters.  In relation to marine environment and planning issues, each jurisdiction is responsible for the collection of its own data.  However, there is both an obligation and a willingness to work together on a transboundary basis on these issues.  That co-operation includes the sharing of data and information with each other on an all-island and Celtic Seas basis to underpin better decision making.  Strategic planning in relation to territorial development is informed by strategies for Northern Ireland and Ireland through the Regional Development Strategy 2035 and the National Spatial Strategy 2002-2020, respectively.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.<\/p>  <p>  Work has commenced to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo; where the number of contributions recorded over a work life will more closely reflect the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legislative, administrative, and technical aspects to be addressed in its implementation.  When proposals are agreed, legislation will be brought forward to underpin the necessary changes.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that it is important that the changes be announced well in advance of introduction to enable those workers affected to include the new factors into their retirement planning.  This new method will provide greater benefit for some, but not all, future pensioners than they would have had under the current system.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the distributive nature of the Fund.  For example, those with a yearly average of only 20 contributions (38% of the maximum) may qualify for 85% of the maximum rate.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, where people cannot qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if a person&rsquo;s spouse has a contributory pension, that person may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800065#WRP02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Eligibility","counter":689,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800065#WRP02900"},{"type":"question","counter":690,"qnumday":290,"qnumall":"[14267\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800065#WRP03000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"why a person (details supplied) has lost entitlement to rent allowance upon being placed on a low paid temporary work scheme by a local Intreo office; why it is not possible for the person to receive support from the local community welfare officer, given that this loss has resulted in an accumulation of rent arrears; and why, if the person and the person's partner were 26 years of age plus, and both in receipt of social protection payments and rent allowance, they would have a greater income than what they have been left with, following the person's placement on this temporary work incentive scheme.","asker":"1367","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":691,"content":"<p>As advised in the reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s recent question in this matter, Question No. 45 of 14 April 2016, the person concerned is currently participating in the part-time job initiative (PTJI) scheme.  The PTJI scheme is intended as a stepping stone to full-time work. It allows certain long-term unemployed people to take up part-time work and get a special weekly allowance instead of their jobseeker's payment. A person is not placed on PTJI by the Department. They secure the part-time work themselves and then contact their local Intreo Centre in order to apply to participate in the PTJI scheme.<\/p>  <p>  On 6 January 2016, a rent supplement review was carried out which showed the combined weekly income of the person, less income disregards, less supplementary welfare rate for a couple and with the addition of the minimum rent supplement contribution yielded a weekly available contribution of &euro;197.25 per week towards the rent. The rent charged equated to &euro;115.30 per week and therefore their weekly available contribution exceeded that of the rent thus giving a nil entitlement to rent supplement.<\/p>  <p>  A further review carried out on 26 February 2016 confirmed that the person&rsquo;s available financial contribution still exceeded the weekly rent and that there was no entitlement to rent supplement. It remains open for the person concerned to submit an appeal against this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.<\/p>  <p>  A Designated Person administers supplementary welfare allowance including exceptional needs payments (ENP's).

These welfare payments through post offices are across all of the department&rsquo;s major schemes: state pension, jobseekers, one parent family payments, widow\/ers or survivors pensions, carers payments, disability payments and child benefit.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my department is not undertaking any measures which seek to actively influence customer choice in the manner of payment away from cash payments at the Post Office.<\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that for the vast majority of my department&rsquo;s schemes the department&rsquo;s customers are given the choice of what payment method they wish to receive their social welfare payment.  The vast majority of new customers choose to have payments made directly into their accounts in financial institutions which reflects a societal trend towards payment by electronic funds transfer.  For example, 83% of new Child Benefit customers and 70% of new State Pension customers chose this option in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Many of my department&rsquo;s customers are in employment. My department&rsquo;s focus must be on our customers and to this end my department&rsquo;s policy is to make payments to in-work customers directly to accounts rather than customers being inconvenienced by two separate payment methods.<\/p>  <p>  My department has a cohort of jobseeker customers who are classified as casual jobseekers.  These are in-work customers who can claim a jobseeker's payment for 2 to 3 days per week or who work week on\/week-off.  These customers were paid by cheque each week.<\/p>  <p>  Those customers were paid by cheque due to the changing nature of their  work\/claiming patterns and the short turn-around time to issue payments.  It is important to note that they were not paid via post offices under the department&rsquo;s existing cash payments contract with An Post.<\/p>  <p>  My department has developed its payment capacity in respect of changing work and claiming patterns and is offering payments direct to accounts in financial institutions for casual Jobseeker customers thereby increasing customer convenience.  This is in line with wider departmental policy where the focus is on ensuring that in-work customers are paid by the most convenient method possible.<\/p>  <p>  My department has written to all of these casual jobseekers offering the option of a payment to an account. The vast majority have responded and opted for payment to an account.<\/p>  <p>  If customers wish to continue to be paid by cheque they can make their preference known to their local social welfare office which handles their claim.<\/p>  <p>  The recent &ldquo;Kerr Report&rdquo; sets out the challenges that An Post and Postmasters face as they seek to ensure that the post office network remains relevant in the context of the inexorable shift towards electronic payments.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will support the introduction by An Post of a standard bank account through the provision of seed funding to help start the initiative.<\/p>  <p>  My department is engaging as appropriate with the Departments of Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources and Public, Expenditure and Reform in addressing the recommendations of the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800065#WRP05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exceptional Needs Payment Applications","counter":713,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800065#WRP05300"},{"type":"question","counter":714,"qnumday":297,"qnumall":"[14386\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800065#WRP05400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if an exceptional needs payment can be approved in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":715,"content":"<p>An application for an exceptional needs payment in the case of the person concerned is currently being processed.

This income has been for many years treated in the same manner as earnings from employment for PRSI purposes, and accordingly is subject to Class A PRSI.  Therefore participants on CE schemes, similar to other private sector employees who pay Class A, can establish entitlement to the full range of short term benefits including jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, illness benefit, and maternity benefit and to long term benefits including State pension (contributory).Budget 2016 introduced the tapered PRSI Credit to address a significant issue with the manner in which charging PRSI impacts those on lower weekly earnings.<\/p><p>Previously Class A employees became liable to pay PRSI on all earnings, once weekly earnings exceeded &euro;352.01.  This created a &ldquo;step effect&rdquo; as net income reduced immediately by the full 4% PRSI charge applied to all earnings.  This meant that a &euro;0.01 increase in weekly earnings of &euro;352 attracted a weekly PRSI charge of &euro;14.08.<\/p><p>The introduction of the PRSI Credit addressed the &ldquo;step effect&rdquo; by reducing the actual amount of PRSI charged, for those earning between &euro;352.01 and &euro;424 in a week.  At weekly earnings of &euro;352.01 the maximum PRSI Credit of &euro;12 reduces the PRSI charge payable from &euro;14.08 to &euro;2.08.<\/p><p>As gross earnings increase, the PRSI Credit is withdrawn on a tapered basis.

This will be the first Plenary meeting of the Council since the elections on both sides of the border.  I would expect that, in addition to providing an opportunity for the Government and the new Northern Ireland Executive to discuss North\/South co-operation in the months ahead, the agenda will include the usual discussions on economic and financial matters, co-operation on EU matters, review of existing NSMC work programmes and a range of other issues.<\/p><p>Considerable preparatory work is done in advance of NSMC meetings including preparation of meeting papers and following up on decisions of previous NSMC meetings.  Following the Plenary meeting which took place in Armagh on 11 December 2015, much work has been done in regard to the implementation of the commitments for targeted investment in cross-border economic infrastructure which are set out in Section E of the November 2015 Fresh Start Agreement.<\/p><p>As agreed under the Fresh Start Agreement, a report on those commitments including the A5, reviews of the Narrow Water Bridge and Ulster Canal projects, the North West Gateway Initiative and on opportunities to source further investment for all-island infrastructure projects for mutual benefit has been prepared for consideration at the next NSMC Plenary meeting.  Preparation of the report has involved Senior Officials from relevant Departments, North and South, meeting on a number of occasions since November 2015 to review and to maintain a strategic overview of economic and infrastructural investment, with particular regard to the projects and commitments set out in the Fresh Start Agreement  <i>.<\/i>This Agreement also contained a commitment to establish a North West Development Fund to support the North West Gateway Initiative work of Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council.  Through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Government has allocated &euro;2.5 million towards the establishment of the Fund.  The Northern Ireland Executive is working on the modalities of its matching funding.<\/p><p>At the NSMC meetings that I have attended the focus of Ministers has been on identifying  priorities for North South co-operation in their respective areas of responsibility, particularly as regards assisting economic recovery, job creation, the best use of public funds and the most effective delivery of services for citizens across the island.  The Government is committed in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government<\/i>to continue to advance North South cooperation, particularly through cross-border bodies and the North South Ministerial Council and to harness the potential of the Stormont House Agreement to develop new areas of cooperation in areas such as trade, health, and tourism.

This case is currently being investigated by the Brazilian authorities and, notwithstanding the appalling nature of the reported incident, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the specific circumstances of an ongoing investigation.<\/p>  <p>  As is the case in many other countries, violence against women remains a serious problem in Brazil.  In recent years, the Brazilian authorities have enacted a variety of legislative measures and social policies to tackle this problem and provide a structured response to assist female victims of violence. <\/p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Maria da Penha&rdquo; law, which was enacted in Brazil in 2006, is the principal legal instrument in relation to violence against women.  It establishes dedicated judicial and police supports to deal with violence against women, urgent protective legal measures for victims of domestic violence, and a reinforcement of the social services in this area.  The law also provides for educational measures such as the inclusion of gender equality in the school curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the legal framework, in 2013 the Brazilian government introduced the &lsquo;Mulher, Viver sem Viol&ecirc;ncia&rsquo; (Women, to Live without Violence) programme to streamline and target the public services available to female victims of violence.  The programme also aimed to reduce the trauma experienced by victims of engaging with the legal system.  Measures included the establishment of dedicated women&rsquo;s centres offering access to a range of integrated legal, police and psychosocial services, as well as childcare and assistance in establishing financial independence.  To date, ten such centres have been established throughout Brazil.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to government campaigns to raise awareness of the problem of gender-based violence, a &ldquo;180&rdquo; Freephone service has been made available throughout Brazil, which facilitates women to report crimes and provides information as to victims&rsquo; rights and legal procedures.<\/p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Brasilia will continue to monitor developments in relation to this specific case and on the wider issue of gender-based violence in Brazil.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800069#WRT03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":877,"content":"<p>Question No. 357 answered with Question No. 354.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":879,"qnumday":358,"qnumall":"[15038\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800069#WRT03300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of representations he has received from Members of the Oireachtas and the number of these to which he had not issued a substantive reply by 31 May 2016, by month of initial receipt from 1 January 2015 to 30 April 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":880,"content":"<p>In the time allowed to respond to this question, it was not possible to provide the information the Deputy requested. <\/p>  <p>  However, all correspondence received in my Office addressed to me is recorded and tracked to ensure it is dealt with correctly and promptly.

Where flood defences are constructed to provide protection to areas which have previously been subject to flooding, the insurance industry has made clear its position that the defences should be designed and constructed to protect against a flood event with an Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) of 1% (commonly referred to as a 100-year flood event).  OPW flood defence schemes are generally designed and constructed to protect against a 1% AEP flood event for fluvial flood events and 0.5% AEP flood event for tidal floods.  OPW provides detailed background and technical information on its completed flood defence schemes to Insurance Ireland (II), and II members have committed to take all this information into account when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas.  To date, OPW has provided data on 16 completed flood relief schemes to II.  II has stated, based on the results of a survey of its members, that flood cover is provided in approximately 98% of household policies nationally.  In areas protected by fixed flood defences provided by OPW (12 of the 16 schemes), 89% of policies include flood cover.  In the four schemes where demountable defences are used, 78% of policies include flood cover.  In total, 83% of policies in areas benefitting from OPW flood defences include cover against flood risk.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities may carry out flood mitigation works using their own resources.  The OPW operates a Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme whose purpose is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  This scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame.<\/p>  <p>  Flood mitigation works carried out by local authorities are not generally designed to protect against a 1% AEP flood event, the desired standard set out in the Memorandum of Understanding.  OPW generally would not have detailed technical and design information on projects carried out by the local authorities.  For these reasons, there are no plans to include local authority flood mitigation works in the scope of the Memorandum of Understanding.<\/p>  <p>  The subject of insurance against the risk of flooding is one of the matters which will be addressed in the forthcoming report to Government from the Inter-Departmental Flood Policy Co-Ordination Group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800069#WRT04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1260"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cross-Border Co-operation","counter":887,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800069#WRT04100"},{"type":"question","counter":888,"qnumday":361,"qnumall":"[14287\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800069#WRT04200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the State bodies under his remit that have developed memoranda of understanding with his counterpart in Northern Ireland with regard to the efficient delivery of services on the island of Ireland;

A review of each Member State's contribution to the special area of conservation network was carried out in stages by the European Commission from 2000, which involved experts contracted by the Commission, independent scientific experts and representatives of Member States. Where such reviews indicated particular habitats and species for which the Member State was considered insufficient in terms of designation, further survey work and designations were required. There have also been judgements made by the Court of Justice of the European Union requiring further designations or extensions to existing designations in Ireland. For example, Ireland's 148 raised and blanket bog natural heritage areas were designated as part of proceedings in relation to the implementation of the Environment Impact Assessment Directive in Ireland.<\/p><p>Legal protections, consistent with those set out in the relevant EU and national legislation, such as the requirement to obtain consent for certain activities, have applied to these sites since initially proposed for designation.

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health. The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  In 2009, NIAC recommended HPV vaccination for all 12 year old girls, and in September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in the first year of second level schools. The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults. It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school and over 200,000 girls have received the vaccine since its introduction.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland and is the appropriate authority to which possible adverse reactions to medicinal products should be reported. In November 2015, the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review which the HPRA participated in, specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase.  The outcome of the review which was carried out by the EMA Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined. The European Medicines Agency has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines as there are no new safety concerns regarding HPV vaccines. Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using the vaccines in accordance with the current product information. On 12 January 2016, the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of symptoms experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition. Anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.

This national plan needs to cover the use of antimicrobial medicines in animal health and agriculture, as well as for human health. WHO will work with countries to support the development and implementation of their national plans, and will report progress to the World Health Assembly in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the serious and increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance and the requirement for a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach to health issues, the Department of Health&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) established, with Ministerial approval, a high level National Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee to address this issue.

Under the scheme, insurers receive risk equalisation and hospital utilisation credits to compensate for the additional cost of insuring older and less healthy members, which are funded by stamp duty levies payable by insurers in respect of each insured life covered. <\/p>  <p>  Risk equalisation credits are paid on the basis of age, gender and type of cover. Since 1 March 2016 the hospital utilisation credits paid to insurers have been expanded to include all day case admissions to hospital, in addition to the existing utilisation credit payable for all overnight stays. This enhancement to the scheme increases the support provided for less healthy people of all ages. It also supports the provision of clinically appropriate treatment on a day case basis.<\/p>  <p>  I support in principle the introduction of a refined health status measure for risk equalisation based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). The introduction of a DRG-based health status measure will target support more accurately in respect of less healthy insured members of all ages and will facilitate a better understanding of the extent to which differences in claims costs between insurers are driven by differences in the underlying risk profile of their members. Both consumers and efficient insurers will benefit from a more robust system of risk equalisation. In 2014 the Health Insurance Authority prepared a report which set out the necessary steps, time frames and additional resource requirements for incorporating DRGs into the Risk Equalisation Scheme. My Department will publish a redacted version of the report on its website this week.<\/p>  <p>  A key requirement is collection of and access to the necessary data from both public and private hospitals.  A DRG system has been operational in Irish public hospitals for over 20 years which groups all inpatient and daycase activity for each hospital into DRGs which are clinically similar and require similar health resources. Using DRG data for risk equalisation will require the collection and coding of all hospital activity data for both public and private hospitals under the Hospital Inpatient Enquiry (HIPE) system overseen by the Healthcare Pricing Office (HPO) of the HSE. In April 2015 my Department asked insurers to submit proposals on how best to progress this matter and to encourage private hospitals to begin collecting this data.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Government&rsquo;s Health Reform Program one of the priorities for my Department and the HSE (including the HPO) is the roll out of Activity Based Funding (ABF) in line with the Government&rsquo;s policy and the ABF Implementation Plan 2015-2017.  This entails switching to ABF funding for inpatients and daycases for public patients in public hospitals and the development of a classification system for outpatients.  As indicated in the Plan, the roll out of ABF will take a number of years to implement.  The use of HIPE in relation to other policy developments will have to be considered in light of resources available and the priorities I have outlined in relation to the ABF Program.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800073#WRX02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Data","counter":1079,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800074#WRY00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1080,"qnumday":427,"qnumall":"[14421\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800074#WRY00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount the Health Service Executive spent on agency staff each month in 2016 to date and the equivalent figures for each month in 2015; the proportion of the HSE&rsquo;s anticipated agency staff expenditure for 2016 that has been incurred to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1081,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on this matter.

Currently, nine of the 14 designated professions have registration boards and registers have been established for seven of them.<\/p>  <p>  Psychotherapists and counsellors are not currently regulated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005. However, the Act provides that the Minister for Health may, by regulation, designate a health and social care profession not already designated if he or she considers that it is appropriate and in the public interest to do so and if specified criteria have been met.<\/p>  <p>  Grandfathering of existing practitioners with minimum qualifications to be specified by regulation is provided for under the Act.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Act, the Health and Social Care Professionals Council has been consulted on the question of regulating counsellors and psychotherapists. Its detailed report on the matter is being examined carefully in the Department of Health with a view to deciding the next steps in the coming months. These steps will, I envisage, include a wider round of consultation involving the various professional bodies and other interested parties.<\/p>  <p>  The regulation of a new profession under the Act involves a consultation process and the making of a number of statutory instruments by the Minister for Health and by the relevant registration board.  I envisage that, subject to the outcome of consultations, the statutory phase to regulate counsellors and psychotherapists under the Act will begin later this year or early next year with the submission of draft designation regulations to the Houses of the Oireachtas for their approval.  Thereafter, I expect that the registration board should be constituted and operating during 2017.  By the end of 2018, or early 2019, the board should be in a position to make the various bye-laws to allow it to accept applications for registration.  In parallel, the regulations to protect titles and to prescribe the qualifications to be required of existing practitioners would be drafted and enacted.<\/p>  <p>  While the profession or professions of counsellor and psychotherapist are not specifically designated under the 2005 Act, counsellors and psychotherapists are subject to legislation similar to other practitioners including consumer legislation, competition, contract and criminal law. There are also various regulatory controls on many counsellors and psychotherapists operating in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The profession of psychologist, for example, is a designated profession under the 2005 Act which means that those psychologists who are counsellors and\/or psychotherapists will begin to be regulated when the Psychologists Registration Board, which is due to be established later this year, opens its register. <\/p>  <p>  Psychiatrists, some of whom practice psychotherapy, are regulated under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007. Also, counsellors\/therapists working in the publicly funded health sector are required to have minimum qualifications set by the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800074#WRY02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1115,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800074#WRY02650"},{"type":"question","counter":1116,"qnumday":441,"qnumall":"[14609\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800074#WRY02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will be provided with a date for an appointment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1117,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

There has been a considerable increase in demand for care in our health system in recent years.  In order to effectively manage waiting lists, those patients waiting longest must be prioritised, once emergency and urgent cases have been dealt with.  The Programme for a Partnership Government (PfPG) emphasises the need for sustained commitment to improving waiting times for patients, with a particular focus on those patients waiting longest. <\/p>  <p>  No scheme currently exists to commission treatment at individual patient level within the Republic of Ireland for persons resident here. The Health Service Executive does, however, operate the EU Directive on Patients' Rights in Cross Border Healthcare in Ireland.  Under the Directive, patients are entitled to have costs of cross-border healthcare services reimbursed if the healthcare service in question is among the benefits to which they are entitled in their Member State of affiliation.  The HSE is proactive in advising potential users of the Scheme that reimbursement will be at the cost of the treatment availed of abroad or the cost of providing the healthcare in Ireland, whichever is the lesser. Information on the Scheme, and its administration, is available from the National Contact Point of the HSE, details of which are on the HSE website.  The NCP is happy to advise patients of the reimbursement rate that will apply to the assessment\/treatment being accessed.  The HSE endeavours to reimburse the cost of treatment incurred or the cost of providing such healthcare in the State, which ever is the lesser, to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of a claim for reimbursement, in line with Prompt Payment Legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The 2016 HSE Service Plan undertakes to maintain 2015 levels of service in respect of scheduled care and to continue to address waiting times as part of the regular performance and accountability process.  Currently, 94% of patients wait less than the maximum waiting time of 15 months for inpatient, daycase or outpatient procedures, with c. 60% of patients waiting less than 6 months for their required care.  With regard to the PfPG commitment to provide &euro;15 million in funding to the NTPF in 2017, the Department will engage with the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the HSE to deliver on this commitment.  As outlined in the Programme, this initiative will commence in 2017 and focus on those patients waiting longest. The PfPG also contains a commitment to continued investment of &euro;50 million per year to address waiting lists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800074#WRY03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drugs Payment Scheme","counter":1127,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800074#WRY03450"},{"type":"question","counter":1128,"qnumday":445,"qnumall":"[14623\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800074#WRY03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the drug Fampyra is not being prescribed for a person (details supplied); if the matter will be sorted as soon as possible as having to pay for the drug each week is causing family hardship and distress; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1248","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1129,"content":"<p>As the particular issue raised relates to an individual case, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to you.

In this context, I must advise you that the Health Service Executive is required to obtain value for money when disposing of surplus property assets.  These proceeds will be re-invested in delivering much needed health care infrastructure.  As there will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer facilities which support the delivery of core health services must be prioritised within the context of the overall capital envelope available to us.  Given the limited funding available and our health infrastructure needs, priority for funding must be based on verified service needs and all capital funding must be directed to supporting these core services. The HSE is concentrating on applying the limited funding available for capital works in the most effective way possible to meet health care needs now and in the future.<\/p>  <p>  In addition consideration must be given to the Government's Reform Plan which sets out commitments relating to property asset use and management.  These commitments include ensuring that optimal value for money is achieved in the management of the State's property portfolio.  The development and implementation of the Property Management Delivery Plan has been one of the outcomes of the reform process.

The following actions are outlined:  <\/p>  <p>  - The HSE will ensure that data from the Single Assessment Tool is factored into research to inform dementia care in Ireland;<\/p>  <p>  - The HSE will take measures to ensure appropriate recording and coding of dementia in primary care and the development of practice-based dementia registers; and<\/p>  <p>  - Hospitals will take measures to encourage better recording and coding of a primary or secondary diagnosis of dementia in hospital records and charts to ensure that admissions, re-admissions, lengths of stay and discharge for people with dementia are captured on HIPE (Hospital In-Patient Enquiry).<\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that actions in all of these areas together with the planned development of the Electronic Health Care Record will lead to better information on dementia patients in primary, secondary and long term care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800078#WRCC02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres Provision","counter":1314,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800078#WRCC02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1315,"qnumday":508,"qnumall":"[15017\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800078#WRCC02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he will establish a primary care centre in Fermoy, County Cork; and the timeline for such a centre to be established.","asker":"1276","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1316,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, this question has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.

Aquaculture enterprises that have not been licensed in compliance with EU law could not receive EU co-funded aid or other aid and the licensing decision in relation to those enterprises cannot be pre judged.  The EU Commission has confirmed this position to the industry at the EU Operational Programme Monitoring Committee.  The Operational Programme also specifies that supports for productive investments in aquaculture will be available only to sites that are fully licensed in compliance with the Habitats and Birds Directives.  This provision affects only aquaculture sites located in Natura 2000 areas.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2016, Minister Coveney announced the launch of two dedicated EMFF support schemes for the aquaculture sector.  A Knowledge Gateway Scheme is providing grants of up to &euro;200,000 to aquaculture enterprises for projects relating to innovation, animal welfare and disease management, training and advisory services.  A Sustainable Aquaculture Scheme is providing grants of up to &euro;500,000 to aquaculture enterprises for capital investments in their sites.  Last month, I was delighted to announce grants under these two schemes to 12 aquaculture enterprises and I expect to announce further grants as the year progresses.<\/p>  <p>  I fully realise that aquaculture sites located in Natura 2000 areas where licensing decisions have yet to be made in accordance with the EU Habitats and Birds Directives are not in a position to access supports for productive investments pending a determination of their aquaculture and foreshore licence applications and in particular pending completion of the required Habitats Directive Appropriate Assessments.  My Department is engaged in an extensive process with the Marine Institute and National Parks and Wildlife Service to complete those Appropriate Assessments.  The Appropriate Assessment process has now been completed in respect of sixteen bays and my Department is progressing licence determinations having regard to the conclusions of those assessments and other relevant factors as required under law.

While this is likely to mean some increase in dairy numbers, it is not expected that there will be a significant increase in overall cattle numbers.<\/p>  <p>  The Environmental Analysis has identified any potential significant environmental impacts associated with implementation of Food Wise, and a large number of recommendations in this regard are contained in Food Wise itself as well as in the Environmental Analysis.  Amongst these recommendations are:<\/p>  <p>  - the establishment of a sustainability sub-committee to monitor any environmental impacts during the implementation phase.  This committee, with membership from key Government Departments, the EPA, Teagasc, the Marine Institute and academia, will (inter alia) carefully monitor total livestock numbers and any implications for greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p>  <p>  - the commissioning of further work on the development of cost effective greenhouse gas mitigation measures.<\/p>  <p>  The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU commitments, is clearly understood by Government, as reflected in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to comply with the annual targets under the 2009 EU Effort Sharing Decision in the first half of the 2013-2020 compliance period.  However, there will be a significant compliance challenge in the years 2016-2020 which will be addressed in the National Mitigation Plan, currently being prepared by all relevant sectors including my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is engaged in intensive discussions, in a whole of Government approach, with the European Commission to highlight the importance of ensuring a coherent approach to the twin challenges of food security and increasing global demand for food with EU climate ambition.  An important step forward in this regard was taken at the October 2014 European Council.  The recent Paris agreement further recognises the fundamental priority of safeguarding food production.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800081#WRFF02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fisheries Protection","counter":1449,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800081#WRFF02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1450,"qnumday":552,"qnumall":"[14642\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800081#WRFF02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 561 of 24 May 2016, if there is a mechanism whereby his Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources could work together and liaise on the issue of compensation for eel fishers and the possibility of availing of such compensation from a European Union fund.","asker":"1250","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1451,"content":"<p>I understand that Minister Naughten advised the Deputy in his response to Parliamentary Question No. 561 of 24 May 2016 that there is no property right attaching to public eel licences and consequently the issue of compensation is not relevant or appropriate, given that the closure of the fishery was applied for conservation reasons under the Fisheries Acts.<\/p>  <p>  While my Department&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme provides for compensation for permanent cessation of fishing activities, that aid is permitted under article 34 of the EMFF Regulation (508\/2014) only in respect of fishing fleet segments that have been identified in Ireland&rsquo;s Fleet Annual Report as not being effectively balanced with available fishing opportunities and which are the subject of a related Action Plan under article 22 of the CFP (Regulation 1380\/2013).

The role of National Competent Agencies is to confirm compliance with this requirement.  This is done by inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b><\/b>Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that FBOs must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied.  As regards traceability, the regulations require that FBOs have systems in place to identify any person who supplies the business with a food, and a system to identify other businesses to which their product has been supplied forward.  This is known as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system.  There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Council Regulation EU No 1224\/2009 establishing a community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and Commission Implementing Regulation No 404\/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to the point of retail. <\/p><p>My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all slaughter plants it approves.  Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency determined by an annual risk assessment.

Labelling and documentary checks are routinely conducted by the Department.<\/p><p>The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formerly called FVO) to ensure compliance with all relevant food safety standards.  The legislation establishes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States.  Border Inspection Posts are also operated by my Department.  Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are extremely prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety to ensure compliance and inspection finding reports are available on that website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800082#WRGG02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Industry Data","counter":1505,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800082#WRGG02700"},{"type":"question","counter":1506,"qnumday":570,"qnumall":"[14887\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800082#WRGG02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent of employment currently given throughout the food industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1507,"content":"<p>The latest data from the CSO&rsquo;s Quarterly National Household Survey (Q1 2016) show that 53,000 people are employed in the Food and Beverage processing sector.

Last year alone, the value of Irish food and drink exports reached &euro;10.8 billion.  I am cognisant therefore of the need to continue to support the development of the industry, based on an international reputation for producing high-quality food to excellent safety standards.  Food Wise 2025 provides the framework for the development of the industry over the next decade, and I intend to work with all of the stakeholders and through the High Level Implementation Committee to ensure that the objectives we have set ourselves are achieved.  In relation to trade agreements, I think the imperative must at all times be to push hard to make progress in areas where Ireland has offensive interests, and to strongly defend those areas where threats may arise.  Taking TTIP as an example, Ireland has both offensive and defensive interests.  We see worthwhile opportunities in the US for cheese, powdered milks and sports products, and further opportunities for branded packaged butter, if we can remove some regulatory barriers.  Prepared consumer foods and fish could also benefit from trade liberalisation.   <\/p>  <p>  Beef is a unique sector in that we have both offensive and defensive interests.  In the long term, any significant increase in beef imports to the EU could have adverse effects on the Irish industry.  That was confirmed by a number of recent studies and is an issue we have raised strongly with the European Commission.  We therefore have legitimate concerns about the size, composition and administration of any beef quota offered to the US. <\/p>  <p>  We should also seek a significant EU quota for beef to the US as part of any TTIP agreement.  Following the re-opening of the market, Irish beef exports now fall under a 65,000-tonne quota for &lsquo;other countries&rsquo; on a first come, first served basis.  This is mainly filled by Latin American countries.  When we get access for manufacturing beef we would stand to benefit greatly from a specific EU import quota in the US, and this can only be achieved through TTIP. <\/p>  <p>  I have also been very active in recent months in highlighting the potentially very damaging impact of a MERCOSUR deal on the European agriculture sector, and on the beef sector in particular.  Ireland played a leading role in raising concerns with the Commission about the potentially very severe impact that a MERCOSUR deal would have on the Irish and EU agriculture sector, and in particular on the beef sector.  The Commission responded by excluding a beef TRQ from the offer made on 11 May.  While this is a welcome development, there is a need for continued vigilance in relation to the conduct of these trade negotiations.  I will continue to insist that further detailed analysis is undertaken in order to fully assess the cumulative impact of beef quota concessions granted under other free trade agreements. I will also ensure the timing and content of any beef TRQ offer is handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800082#WRGG03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":1511,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800082#WRGG03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1512,"qnumday":572,"qnumall":"[14889\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800082#WRGG03400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which animal health continues to be a priority here and throughout Europe; the degree to which other European countries co-operate in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1513,"content":"<p>Issues related to animal health continue to be a priority both for my Department and for the European Union.

These twin imperatives informed Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the negotiations in 2012 and 2013, and they continue to inform the process by which the various elements of CAP reform are now being delivered.  Taking the direct payments system as an example, the Deputy may recall that Ireland proposed an alternative approach to the redistribution of direct payments than that originally advocated by the European Commission, precisely because we wanted to ensure that the direct payments system could be made fairer and more equitable while at the same time ensuring that the level of transfer of payments between farmers was not of a scale that might jeopardise our objectives for the development of the sector. We now have a system which satisfies these two requirements. Last year&rsquo;s payments under the Basic Payment and other schemes represented the start of a process that, by 2019, will see a considerable shift in the balance of payments from those previously receiving very high rates per hectare to those previously receiving much lower rates of payment. I believe that this not only makes the direct payments system fairer, but also ensures that it continues to provide support and income stability that will allow farmers to respond to the demands of the market. As such, it also provides a vital tool to help us achieve the objectives outlined in the Food Wise 2025 strategy.   <\/p>  <p>  Significant steps have also been taken to encourage the participation of young farmers in agriculture, which is vital in terms of securing the critical role that farm families play in the development of the sector. In addition to receiving a top-up of direct payments, young farmers are prioritised in the allocation of payment entitlements from the national reserve. These direct payments measures are further complemented by supports under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme where, for example, enhanced support for capital investment by young farmers has been made available under the TAMS schemes. <\/p>  <p>  More generally under Pillar 2 of the CAP, I am focussed on the socio-economic development of our farms and of our rural areas so that all farm families have an opportunity to realise their potential. Schemes for improving sustainability (such as GLAS and the Beef Data and Genomics Programme) and competitiveness (such as TAMS) are complemented by continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now known as Areas of Natural Constraint). I believe this combination provides a vital range of supports that will allow farm families to continue to benefit from the CAP in an equitable manner while supporting their development over the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800083#WRHH00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Basic Payment Scheme Applications","counter":1537,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800083#WRHH01000"},{"type":"question","counter":1538,"qnumday":582,"qnumall":"[14956\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800083#WRHH01100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when he will issue a decision to a person (details supplied) with regard to a 2015 basic payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1539,"content":"<p>An application under the 2013 Single Farm Payment Scheme was received from the person named on 13 May 2013.

As one of the proposers of the Dairy Forum my goal is to ensure that it continues to work constructively as a vehicle for addressing issues of concern to farmers and others in the sector. The Forum has come forward with some good initiatives for farmers already, including an initiative on improving\u00a0cashflow planning at farm level, which\u00a0will be rolled out shortly.  The price of milk and dairy commodities is determined by a range of factors, including supply and demand at international level. Food commodity markets including dairy markets have been characterised by significant levels of volatility for a number of years and this trend has continued throughout 2015 and into 2016. Factors contributing to this global price volatility include the Russian Ban and the softening of Chinese demand on one side, coupled with increased production among key global producers, including the EU on the supply side. The longer term demographic and demand perspectives remain positive, but there is no doubt that 2016 will continue to be a challenging year.   <\/p>  <p>  Dealing with price volatility is a major challenge for the sector. The Single Farm Payment provides some measure of income stability, and EU market support measures will have a role to play. These measures are not enough on their own, however. The sector needs to look at measures to reduce costs on farms, and at the development of new tools, including fixed price contracts, futures markets and more flexible financing arrangements for farmers. I expect all of the stakeholders in the sector, including processors and banks, to play an active role in the development of such instruments.<\/p>  <p>  I very much welcome the EU Presidency conclusions on a package of support measures to address challenges in the dairy and pigmeat sectors agreed in Brussels at Council in March. This follows on from an earlier package of measures agreed in September of last year and takes account of the ongoing difficulties in the sector.   <\/p>  <p>  In relation to Direct Payments I have asked the Commission to make the maximum possible provision for advance payment of the &euro;1.2 billion in direct payments to Irish farmers. I believe that this would be a particularly useful measure to improve cash flow for farm families at this time.   <\/p>  <p>  I also believe that we should seek EU funding for further direct targeted aid for dairy farmers. I acknowledge that finding these funds within the EU budget will be a real challenge but in the very difficult circumstances in which our farm families now find themselves I am determined to exert the maximum pressure on this point.   <\/p>  <p>  The package previously announced includes a number of proposals by Ireland to the Commission in advance of Council, in particular the doubling of the intervention ceiling for skimmed milk powder and butter. This extra allocation has been utilised in the interim and recently Commissioner Hogan has indicated the Commission&rsquo;s willingness to further increase this threshold to 350,000 tonnes. SMP intervention is the key EU support tool for dairy markets and helps to put a floor under prices in this extended period of downward price volatility. This extension will be particularly welcomed by Irish producers in the context of Irish dairy production patterns in the dairy sector which peak during the current period.   <\/p>  <p>  In terms of input costs at farm level, Ireland has called on the Commission to consider temporarily suspending EU import tariffs on fertilisers. I understand that the Commission is examining this request at present. At national level, I will continue to support the work of Teagasc, the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation and Animal Health Ireland to increase on farm efficiency and reduce input costs. The EU Presidency conclusions also refer to the possibility of advance payments under CAP, as was done in 2015. In addition my Department recently paid &euro;26.4m in direct aid to dairy farmers, co-funded by the exchequer and the EU, to assist with liquidity and cash-flow issues on dairy farms.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the proposal for the European Investment Bank (EIB) and member states to work together with the Commission on the feasibility of an EU export credit tool. My Department will continue to engage with the Irish banking system to ensure there is a full appreciation of the temporary impact of downward price volatility on farm enterprises which are financially sound in the medium term. <\/p>  <p>  It remains clear that we need to deal urgently and effectively with this temporary problem. We must ensure that EU farmers are protected from the worst impacts of low commodity prices in an appropriate way, but remain well placed to avail of emerging opportunities when markets recover.  Ireland is strongly positioned as a competitive producer of dairy, and while conditions are extremely difficult at present, Irish dairy farmers will be well placed to avail of the opportunity presented by market recovery in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800083#WRHH02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Availability","counter":1552,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800083#WRHH02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1553,"qnumday":587,"qnumall":"[15072\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800083#WRHH02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the steps he will take to address the current access to credit crisis that some farmers are experiencing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1554,"content":"<p>Primary responsibility for banking policy lies with the Minister for Finance. However my Department liaises with the main banks on access to finance for the agri-food sector and, in cooperation with other State bodies, continues to explore new and more competitive sources of funding for the sector. For example, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland introduced an &lsquo;Agriculture Investment Loans&rsquo; product last year, which has been very well subscribed. Also, my Department is currently preparing to procure an ex-ante evaluation for the introduction of &lsquo;Financial Instruments&rsquo; under the Rural Development Programme.  All of the banks consider the sector to be vitally important and have specialised offerings to farmers and there continues to be a significant take-up of these funds. Data from the Central Bank shows that the &lsquo;primary industries&rsquo; sector (consisting of primary agriculture, forestry and fishing) continues to be a significant component of new Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) lending, accounting for &euro;734m or 21% of all new loans in 2015.

In collaboration with Teagasc, my Department has agreed a three part programme:<\/p>  <p>  - The publication of a booklet entitled &lsquo;Cash Flow &amp;amp; Financial Management on Dairy Farms&rsquo;, which will issue to all dairy farmers shortly.<\/p>  <p>  - Cash flow training to be incorporated in an upcoming programme of dairy farm walks in each of the Teagasc regions, where advisors will be on hand for one-to-one consultations and referrals.<\/p>  <p>  - The development of a standardised 15-20 minute cash flow training module that can be delivered to dairy farmers at any stakeholder meetings held by Dairy Forum participants.<\/p>  <p>  This programme will run in conjunction with the existing Teagasc &lsquo;Get Farm Financially Fit&rsquo; engagement. <\/p>  <p>In addition I have scheduled a programme of meetings with the CEOs of the main banks to discuss liquidity and access to credit issues later this month and intend to engage with them on their plans for dealing with the current difficulties over the short to medium term.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also discussing with various stakeholders, including the farm organisations, any other options there may be to assist liquidity problems. I also welcome other innovative initiatives in this regard such as those introduced by Glanbia recently.   <\/p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the pressures on farmers right now and I am committed to working with all players in the sector, both at national and EU level, to address these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800083#WRHH02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","counter":1557,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800084#WRJJ00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Functions","counter":1556,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800084#WRJJ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1557,"qnumday":588,"qnumall":"[14432\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800084#WRJJ00200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"which Department will have responsibility for the Environmental Protection Agency under the new structures.","asker":"1217","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1558,"content":"<p>Under the arrangements recently announced by the Taoiseach, my\u00a0Department, which will be renamed the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, will assume responsibility for the Environmental \u00a0Protection Agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800084#WRJJ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Environmental Policy","counter":1559,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800084#WRJJ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1560,"qnumday":589,"qnumall":"[14525\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800084#WRJJ00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his views that climate change is the single most pressing issue for humanity, which will impact on every single aspect of our society and economy; that it is a major mis-step at this time to have effectively abolished the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in the new Administration and that, notwithstanding recent reassurances, this suggests to the public that environmental issues will be downgraded; that if he is genuine about joined-up thinking he must reorganise Departments with a view to setting up a Department of environment, climate change and natural heritage, which would have a remit to deal effectively with pressing environmental issues, such as loss of biodiversity and with water quality and supply; and if he will give a commitment that the correct urgency will be attached to the priorities of his Ministers concerned with environmental matters, and that they will not be seen as an add on or be relegated in the pursuit of corporate or business interests.","asker":"1367","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1561,"content":"<p>A range of functions currently undertaken by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will transfer into my\u00a0Department in the coming weeks and the Department will be renamed the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment\u00a0to reflect this.\u00a0 In addition to its current functions, my Department will\u00a0assume responsibility for the following sections\u00a0from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government:<\/p><p>- Environment Policy &amp;amp; Awareness;<\/p><p>- Climate Policy;<\/p><p>- EU and International Environmental Policy;<\/p><p>- Waste Policy &amp;amp; Resource Efficiency;<\/p><p>- Air Quality\/Environmental Radiation Policy;<\/p><p>- Environment Advisory Unit.<\/p><p>There is no question of the environment\u00a0or climate action being deprioritised\u00a0by the\u00a0Government.

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies\u00a0and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.<\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map 2020, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area, which is the subject of procurement.  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention.  The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Limerick. <\/p><p>Based on information provided by commercial operators, significant parts of Marine Cove and\u00a0Foynes will be covered by commercial operators\u00a0with any\u00a0remaining premises being part of the State Intervention.  Members of the public can view whether their premises in\u00a0 Limerick are in the BLUE or AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.<\/p><p>My Department continues to actively monitor the deployment plans in the BLUE area where commercial operators have committed to providing services, to ensure those services are delivered.  I would encourage consumers\u00a0and business owners\u00a0 to contact my Department at broadband@dcenr.gov.ie where specific problems arise in relation to provision by commercial operators of High Speed Broadband services in the BLUE area.<\/p><p>Over 750,000 premises are the focus\u00a0of the\u00a0procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ( 'PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum.  Five responses were received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March 2016.  The five responses are being assessed in line with\u00a0the criteria set down by the Department with a view to shortlisting the\u00a0qualified bidders to proceed to the next stage of procurement.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The second stage in the procurement process will be a formal invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to short-listed bidders.  I expect that my Department will move to this stage in the next month.  The third stage of the procurement process involves the\u00a0issue of final tender documentation which follows the dialogue process.  Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots\u00a0as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal\u00a0contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s).  It is expected that contract(s) will be awarded by June 2017.<\/p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht.  A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.<\/p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits also to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys\u00a0will lead on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800085#WRKK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":1590,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800085#WRKK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1591,"qnumday":599,"qnumall":"[14730\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800085#WRKK00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"to confirm that the Digital Hub has no objection in extending the lease for the Br&uacute; Aimsir emergency accommodation on James Street, Dublin 8.","asker":"1306","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1592,"qnumday":600,"qnumall":"[14798\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016060800085#WRKK00700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if the Digital Hub has no objection or has an objection to extending the Br&uacute; Aimsir emergency bed facility beyond the 31 May 2016; and if there is no objection, for how long will it be extended.","asker":"1306","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1593,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 599 and 600 together. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for a\u00a0Partnership Government has committed to addressing\u00a0the housing shortage and homelessness, and is committed to publishing, within the first 100 days, a new Action Plan for Housing which will contain a specific section on preventing homelessness.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0accommodation referred to in the Questions is located\u00a0in a warehouse property owned by the Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA), which operates under the aegis of my Department.

UL made a recommendation as to how this might be addressed in the future, which is being considered in the context of the broader policy response to the UL study.<\/p><p>The Low Pay Commission in its report last July made reference to 'significant gaps in the data which would ideally be available to assist in coming to a recommendation on the level of the minimum wage'. In this context, the cessation by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) of the National Employment Survey a number of years ago has particularly constrained the data available and its timeliness with regard to earnings. The reintroduction of this survey by the CSO as soon as finances permit would be welcomed.  <\/p><p>Comprehensive data on Northern Ireland business and economic issues is compiled by bodies such as the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and their Department for the Economy, and such information is made openly available In addition, <i>Intertrade Ireland,<\/i>the cross border body which is co-funded by my Department, had published a wide range of data from various sources, which is of direct relevance to cross border business and economic issues. I do not consider it appropriate that my Department would get involved in collecting data relating specifically to Northern Ireland matters. <\/p><p>My Department, and the agencies under its aegis, share data with their Northern Ireland counterparts in instances where this can bring about mutual benefits.

A number of private childcare providers are now contracting with my Department and will be participating in the Community Childcare Subvention (Private) (CCSP) programme.

I condemn any and all incidents resulting in assault and injury to staff.  There is no acceptable level of violent behaviour in a children detention school.  I am advised that children are assessed daily for all forms of risk and in the light of such assessments the residential care plans for children are reviewed accordingly.  The Oberstown Campus has in place a published bespoke behaviour management policy which has been developed in conjunction with the Crisis Prevention Institute of Wisconsin, USA.  Policies and procedures are continually reviewed from a safety perspective.  Unfortunately, the risk of injury cannot be excluded completely given the nature of a children detention school.

If a person is unhappy with a care order then an appeal can be lodged with the Courts, which, normally, in the case of an order from the District Court is to be lodged within 14 days of the order being made.  Under the Act, it is possible for a child to be placed with Tusla in care on a voluntary basis but this is not a care order and can be rescinded by the parent or guardian at any time.<\/p><p>Information on admissions to care, and the legal reasons for being in care, is available on an annual basis and is reported in the Annual Review of Adequacy which is published by Tusla.  Such data for 2015 is currently going through extensive validation and is not yet ready for publication.  Table 1 shows the number of admissions to care both voluntarily and under a Court ordered care order for 2012, 2013 and 2014.  It should be noted that the number of admissions does not equate to the number of children admitted to care, as some children can be readmitted to care throughout the year.<\/p><p><b>Table 1: Legal Reasons for Admissions to Care<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Total Admitted into Care\u00a0<\/th><th>No. admitted under an Emergency Care Order<\/th><th>No. admitted under an Interim Care Order<\/th><th>No. admitted under a Care Order<\/th><th>No. admitted under a Detention Order of the High Court<\/th><th>No. admitted under Another Court Order<\/th><th>No. of Voluntary admissions into care\u00a0<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>1,632<\/td><td>163<\/td><td>198<\/td><td>280<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>62<\/td><td>928<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>1,896<\/td><td>255<\/td><td>280<\/td><td>98<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>42<\/td><td>1,219<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>2,070<\/td><td>261<\/td><td>281<\/td><td>123<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>94<\/td><td>1,311<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>I have also included Table 2 for the Deputy's information.

In particular the grant provides the means through which Tusla is able to provide intensive implementation of a nationwide programme to enhance area based approaches to PPFS and a national practice model for all agencies working with children, young people and families.  The AP grant is designed to enable Tusla to build better intra agency and inter agency capacity to implement key practice and process changes to ensure Tusla's prevention and early intervention system is operating effectively and delivering a high quality, standardised and nationally consistent service to children and families.<\/p>  <p>  The Galway University Foundation (NUIG) is the recipient of the Atlantic Philanthropies funding in the first instance which is then allocated to Tusla in instalments over the life of the grant (2015 - 2018) against an agreed national programme.

In 2015 the funding was also partly utilised by Tusla to commission work from EPIC (Development of Children's Fora ); IFCA ( Development of Peer Support groups ); Investing in Children (Quality Assurance in Participatory Practice) and Keenaghan Collaborative (Development of National Train the Trainers programme in Participatory Practice with Children and Young People).  In 2016 Tusla will continue to commission this work as outlined.  In addition in 2016 Tusla will commission work from Dr. Carmel Corrigan (Development of National Children's Charter) and Quality Matters (Development of the provision of support to carers).  Furthermore a small seed funding grant will be made available to each of the seventeen areas to support initiatives in Participation &amp;amp; Parenting.

It is also to contribute to State ceremonial events. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of RDF training units in rural areas, as the Deputy may be aware, the re-organisation of the RDF was a key element of the response to the findings of the Value for Money Review of the RDF published in late 2012.  The central recommendation provided for retention of the RDF with 4,000 personnel spread countrywide to be based in barracks and in 16 other locations.  As part of the subsequent re-organisation, all RDF units were disestablished and amalgamated with PDF units.  The retention of all previous locations was not a viable or sustainable option.  The re-organisation offered significant advantages in terms of training and development of RDF personnel with PDF units having Reserve components rather than the previous parallel Reserve organisation structure.  Reserve units are supported by their parent PDF unit and the 16 units outside of PDF installations are supported by dedicated full time PDF personnel.  At the time of the re-organisation, every effort was made to minimise the requirement for personnel to relocate and to facilitate members in their preferred or local areas. <\/p>  <p>  The RDF remains significantly under-strength and the ongoing challenge is to recruit and train sufficient personnel to meet the establishment figure.  This challenge affects all elements of the RDF and is not confined to rural areas.  Recruitment to the RDF is ongoing.  While recruitment remains a key challenge, the retention of members is also a key requirement in order to maintain strength levels.  The implementation of measures set out in the White Paper 2015 will provide opportunities for certain members of the RDF to undertake duties.
