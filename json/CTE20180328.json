The purpose of this meeting is to examine the Revised Estimates.  Although the committee has no role in approving these, there is an important ongoing opportunity to make the process more transparent and engage in a meaningful way on relevant performance matters.  The programme-based structure of the Estimates is intended to assist the committee in focusing on what the Department has committed to achieving in terms of outputs and outcomes, considering whether the performance targets included in the Estimate are a sufficiently complete description of the services provided by the Department and whether those targets strike the right balance in terms of the needs of society.  We also consider whether the information provided by the Department makes clear how the moneys available are allocated between services and whether those allocations are the most appropriate in the circumstances.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Department for preparing the briefing notes.  As the meeting started, we received some speaking notes from the Minister.  I thank him for those.  I also thank the committee secretariat, particularly Ms Brenda McCauley, for preparing a document for the committee that will help members debate the matters we need to and offer more detailed analysis.  I propose to proceed by programme and subhead.  I remind members and officials to ensure their mobile phones are switched off for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment, even when on silent mode.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Minister for his support so far.  I will refer to the briefing document that has been prepared by the Department to guide our consideration of the Revised Estimates.  We will commence with programme A, which is dealt with on pages seven to 18 in the Department's briefing and C4 to C7 of the committee secretariat briefing.  In posing questions, I ask each member to clearly indicate the subhead he or she refers to within the programme and to limit the questions to one subhead at a time, allowing other members with questions on the subhead to speak before moving to another subhead.

We are in a period where we are seeking to rebuild in education after a very difficult time, which we all acknowledge.  We are in a position to expand the number of teachers we are employing and in the past two years we have seen approximately 5,000 extra teachers deployed.  In particular we have looked at areas like special education, and we have a new system in place that is working well.  We are looking to the future to further enhance the provision for special education and we are focusing on the restoration of funding to further and higher education.  We have significant ambitions in areas like apprenticeship, which traditionally have been poorly developed in Ireland.  They fit with the new opportunities that are emerging.  We have a fresh plan in the disadvantage area.<\/p> <p>  This is a time when we are trying to address many areas of importance in order to achieve the goal we set that by 2026 we would have the best education and training service in Europe.  It is a realistic ambition.  We saw recently that our ten year olds are the best in Europe with regard to reading and mathematics.  We have a good quality of education and good teachers.  I know there are always matters that members will want to raise but we are in a period of rebuilding.  We are also in the fortunate position that we have an expanding young population.  It is stabilising at the primary level now but significant growth can be anticipated at second and third level in the coming years.  In a young and vibrant economy, education has a vital role to play in shaping economic and social progress in the coming years.<\/p><p>I thank the committee for its work in the field of education.

I do not want to delay the meeting but I do have some questions.  I acknowledge that contained within that are the commitments in the confidence and supply agreement in respect of the pupil-teacher ratio and guidance counsellors.  It is welcome that the pupil-teacher ratio will drop to 26:1 at primary level next September.  The commitments in respect of guidance counselling are being met under the confidence and supply agreement.  I acknowledge that.  That is important.  They are both crucial issues on which the Government is delivering on foot of the confidence and supply agreement with Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>  There are many other issues in education.  The first one the Minister is going to hear much about next week is the salaries of newly qualified teachers.  That comes under the subhead of salaries and allowances.  There may be an obvious answer to this question but I will ask it.  Is there scope within the budget this year to cover any possible change to the salaries of newly qualified teachers?  In that context, will the Minister comment on what the Taoiseach said yesterday in the D&aacute;il?  I think the Minister was sitting beside him.  I refer to the possibility of opening up negotiations on the salaries of newly qualified teachers after the conferences.  Is that something that is planned and likely to happen?  Is it something that is going to be announced next week or perhaps here today?<\/p> <p>  On capitation and grants payable to schools, primary and post-primary, effectively those payments are static.  There is a minuscule increase despite the number of pupils going up quite a lot.  Will the Minister acknowledge that it is difficult for schools to cope at the moment because of the static nature of the overall grant?  It means parents are forced to fundraise and some schools can fundraise better than others.  However, all the time, schools are put to the pin of their collars, so to speak, in regard to operating with the current costs.  I will not talk about capital at this point but I will later on.  I refer to the current costs of insurance, extra ancillary help etc.  Schools are finding it really difficult.  Has the Minister any plans to increase capitation and grants?<\/p> <p>  I want to highlight another issue that is a disgraceful indictment, namely, broadband.  While the Department states that 100% of post-primary schools have access to high-speed broadband, the number of primary schools with access to high-speed broadband was listed at 23% in 2016.  Last year, there was a target of 33% and this year there is a target of 37% of schools.  That is extraordinary.  I would like the Minister to comment on that because we get this all the time as constituency Deputies.  The schools are finding it increasing difficult to operate without broadband.  Some programmes can be delivered online to assist teachers.  Teaching methods can also involve online resources.  It is also frustrating when people see broadband being put into a local village but not being extended slightly up the road to the local school.  What discussions has the Minister had with his colleagues in Government, but also with Eir and other providers as well, such as SIRO, about providing that crucial resource to schools?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2018032800002#C00200","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1522252800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Like Deputy Thomas Byrne, I wish to refer to pay restoration.  I see the circulated document gives a figure for pay restoration.  There is a budgetary allocation that includes provision of &euro;236 million for salary increases to more than 106,000 whole-time equivalent staff numbers under the various pay restoration agreements.  Will the Minister clarify if that is the figure he is working with?  We all heard what the Taoiseach said yesterday about possibly going into further negotiations.  It is a similar question, but on whether that figure is negotiable.  I think it can only be negotiated in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  When we were asked if we had any particular issues, I indicated I was interested in special education.  I refer in particular to the new model and what the financial implications might be.  In the circulated document there is a figure of 100 additional resource teachers to be appointed from September 2018.  It says that is to meet the needs of new and rapidly developing schools and funding is also to meet the costs of teaching posts in special classes in special schools.  All of that is welcome.  However, I just wanted to get a sense of whether and how the new model was affecting the financial resources towards resource teachers?  Are the figures growing in largely the same way as they would have under the old model or is there a change?  It may be more of a policy issue, but I would be interested in how the new model is working in schools.<\/p> <p>  Special schools are also under particular pressure because we have so many special classes now.  That is a good thing.  Many children are able to go to regular schools in special classes.  I refer in particular to children on the autism spectrum.  However, that means that children in special schools sometimes have greater needs.  How are those extra posts allocated?  We do have figures on special needs assistants, SNAs.  I do not think there is any need to ask a further question except to note that they are continually rising, as they have done over a number of years.  Again, that is responding to need.  Is there a ongoing review of the SNA system?<\/p> <p>  On the curricular reforms, particular at junior cycle, is extra funding required for subjects like well-being for example?  Is there a specific extra allocation in that area and for the other curricular reform areas?  I think they are in the figures but whether they are specifically anywhere in the figures, I am not too sure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2018032800002#C00300","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1522252800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Like the previous speakers said, the elephant in the room is pay equality.  I understand there may be some moves towards that and I welcome the Taoiseach's comments yesterday on possible new talks on the issue.  It is something that needs to be tackled with the utmost urgency.  Are the Taoiseach's comments an indication that the Government is finally willing to commit to the principle of equal pay for equal work?  We know it cannot be done overnight.  The recent report shows that.  However, would the Government be willing to indicate a timeline for the delivery of equal pay for equal work?<\/p> <p>  I have read today, like other Deputies, that, alarmingly, we do not have enough junior certificate home economics teachers to examine the practical element.  It is going to delay it, which will cause stress for the students involved.  Will the Minister outline the measures he is taking to address that issue or how will that effect the budget Estimates here?  On career guidance counsellors, I do welcome the additional 100 posts.  That will bring us to 500 of the 600 posts cut having been restored.  However, that is based on the number of career guidance posts needed in 2011.  The Minister in his opening statement referred to an expanding young population, so surely we should not be working towards a number for career guidance counsellors that was needed in 2011.  It is 2018 now.  We should be looking at delivering one guidance counsellor per 500 students at this stage.  We are not going to achieve that if our marker is the 2011 number.  What is the Minister's intention to deal with that?<\/p> <p>  On the superannuation subhead, A8, and indeed in C10, in each of the past two years we have had to vote through a considerable Supplementary Estimate at the end of the year in respect of superannuation payments for teachers.  I see this subhead is down 5% and 7% for the equivalent at third level this year.  Does the Minister anticipate that we will be looking at a similar increased Supplementary Estimate come the end of 2018?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2018032800002#C00400","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1522252800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Rather than repeat some of the questions that have been asked, I will say that I welcome the increase in the number of SNAs.<\/p><p>How many additional special needs assistants will be recruited by the end of 2018?

If we want to have the world-class education system to which we all aspire, we must have the best people in our classrooms.  We must support teachers by providing for pay equity and restoring middle management positions that were removed in the past because the lack of such positions is causing problems in schools.<\/p> <p>  The 1% increase provided for capitation grants is small given the growing school population.  In two schools in my constituency, capitation grants are not paid for 150 pupils because the schools are considered too large.  This approach is wrong because small and large schools face particular challenges.  I welcome the funding allocated for the pilot model for in-school speech and language therapy because it is badly needed.<\/p> <p>  On special educational needs, are there plans for developing a student-teacher ratio for special needs schools?  This issue is referred to in the Minister's briefing document.  While additional funding has been provided for resource teachers and special needs assistants, children with special needs living in urban areas and in counties close to Dublin cannot secure places in mainstream schools.  This is a serious problem at primary and secondary level.  If the Department is satisfied that sufficient funding is being provided to pay the salaries of resource teachers and special needs assistants, it must also provide matching capital to enable children with special needs to attend their local mainstream school.<\/p> <p>  The briefing document provides for funding for additional school bus routes.  Will this result in greater flexibility regarding eligibility for attendance at a school of choice?  I invite the Minister to respond to the questions members have asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2018032800002#D00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1522252800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Deputy Thomas Byrne acknowledged the progress we have made in areas such as the pupil-teacher ratio, guidance and resource teaching, for which he is a strong advocate.  These improvements have been significant and I welcome the Deputy's support for them.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of newly qualified teachers.  Negotiations with teachers, which took place within three months of my appointment, delivered significant improvements.  As a result of these changes, which were rolled out in January 2017 and January 2018, approximately 75% of the pay gap for newly qualified teachers and teachers has been closed.  A new entrant to teaching will now earn &euro;36,000, which is a significant improvement.  I acknowledge that this is a continuing source of concern for the teacher trade unions and creates tension in the workplace.  For that reason, this matter was specifically listed when the most recent public service pay agreement was negotiated.  While no specific provision was made in this area, it was listed as an area in which a process should commence and a process commenced last October when the teachers' unions entered into the agreement.  As agreed in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, a report was laid by the Minister for Finance around St. Patrick's Day setting out the costs of addressing new entrant pay across the public service.  It is in the context of that report that the Minister indicated he would start discussions with the trade unions, including the teacher unions.  The issue is not a sectoral one but extends across the public service.  I understand it is intended to commence discussions on the matter shortly.  Deputy Catherine Martin indicated that the Government has not set timelines or pathways.  As has been signalled, this is the start of negotiations.<\/p> <p>  Capitation levels are without doubt an area of pressure for schools.  While we are providing a significant increase in funding of &euro;450 million this year and we provided a similar amount last year, it still comes down to many competing demands for the money available.  In the past two years, we were not able to make provision for an increase in capitation, although we made provision in other areas such as investment in digital resources, the pupil-teacher ratio, guidance and special needs.  There has always been competition for resources.  I am conscious, however, that capitation needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  While I do not have figures with me on broadband, we started from a poor base in primary schools in 2014-2015.  High-speed broadband is now available in 1,100 primary schools, which, as the Deputy noted, is approximately one third of the total.  We hope to connect another 400 schools this year, with further schools being added in subsequent years.  While HEAnet does the connecting up of schools on behalf of the Department, it still depends on the roll-out of national programmes that can be accessed by schools.  I fully agree that an upgrade is required in this area because high-speed broadband of speeds of 30 Mgbs or more needs to be delivered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2018032800002#D00300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1522252800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>May I query some of the points the Minister made?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2018032800002#D00400","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1522252800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I suggest that we allow the Minister to respond first.

It covers pay restoration, not only for new entrants but also other elements.<\/p> <p>  I pay tribute to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan for the work she did when she was Minister for Education and Skills.  During her term, she implemented a pilot programme and gained acceptance for the new approach, which I fully support.  The new model provides a better, more integrated service for children with special needs and encourages the whole school to take an interest in children with special needs.  It is good for children with and without special needs and encourages leadership in schools to be more creative in the use of available resources.  This model presents a win-win scenario in that it moves away from the requirement for diagnostic testing which was a source of inequity in the scheme.  On the basis of the work that was done, we rolled out the new approach nationwide from this year onwards, while also providing more resources for special educational needs.  This year, for example, provision was made for 900 additional resource teachers to ensure we had the capacity to roll out the new model without creating losers and in such a way as to meet the demands of appeals and so on.  As the Deputy noted, provision has been made for 100 additional teachers in rapidly developing areas as well as provision for normal demographic expansion.  While the scheme will not grow as rapidly as it did under the old model, schools will be geared up to have the resources to meet their needs.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan also asked what action was required in the area of special needs assistants.  The National Council for Special Education is carrying out a review of best practice and  I understand it has examined the position in 33 different countries.<\/p><p>It is working to come up with proposals that would offer a better approach to supporting the requirements of children with special needs, for some of whom a special needs assistant is not the only requirement.  Deputy McLoughlin raised the development of a pilot speech and language therapy programme.  That pilot programme is a first toe in the water of having a speech and language therapy service delivered within schools, whereby speech and language therapists would support schools in order that both special needs assistants and teachers could help deliver a speech and language service to children in the school.  There are many gains to be got from that.  It is a toe in the water of how that can be done.  It is only a pilot programme at this point.  <\/p><p> On the issue of special schools, we are making provision for the allocation of additional teachers to special schools.  A pupil-teacher ratio operates within schools.  It is made up of different ratios depending on where pupils are on the autism spectrum disorder, ASD, ranging from mild to more complex.  There is an pupil-teacher ratio underpinning the allocation to special schools in place.  It reflects the complexity of the children they are dealing with.  If there is a higher level of complexity, they would be seeing a higher level of resources.   <\/p><p> On the junior cycle reform and well-being programme, we committed to the allocation of the equivalent of nearly 600 extra teachers to provide professional time to allow the junior cycle to be rolled out, including the well-being programme.  It was a significant investment of resources to underpin that.  The well-being programme is being rolled out from this year.  It starts at a 300-hour programme and it is hoped that will build over time.  There has been a warm welcome for the programme.  Most teachers and schools recognise the difficulty in this area.<\/p><p> We have made provision for additional recruitment of home economics teachers for St. Angela's College in Sligo for the past two years.  There is a recognised deficit there.  We are making other provisions to address teacher supply issues generally and we had the first meeting of a teacher supply group this Monday to address that issue.<\/p><p> On the issue of the career guidance service and where it is heading, we are conducting a review of it this year and we will examine how effective it is.  The review will also examine how young people get access to career information and if we should be looking at other channels of information for young people.  It seems that the way in which young people get access to information is more complex than we thought and perhaps there are other initiatives we should be taking to get good career information into the hands of young people, as well as career guidance counsellors who have other roles to play.  There may be other ways we can address that.<\/p><p> On the issue of superannuation, we will have to meet the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and discussions are taking place with that Department.  Our forecasts of expected superannuation are accurate but we need to have an agreed provision with that Department.  Discussions are taking place in the context of next year's Estimates to deal with that.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy McLoughlin's point on the number of special needs assistants, this is the first year in which we have moved away from an assessment of requirement for special needs assistants that had to be conducted in the spring-summer part of the year, after which Government approval was sought, which was the old way it was done.  This resulted in late notification to schools as to when special needs assistants were being allocated.  We changed that this year.  Last year's budget made provision for 1,090 special needs assistants, the anticipated provision that will be needed for this coming September.  We will be in a position to notify schools earlier as a result of not having to go back and get a separate budgetary provision.  <\/p><p> The Chairman raised an important issue about middle management.  Significant progress on the issue of middle management was made this year.  We made provision for 2,600 additional assistant principal posts mixed between primary and second level.  That was on foot of a new approach to the appointment and deployment of middle managers in schools, which will be more flexible.  This is the start of building a stronger middle management, which will be important for the challenges we have to address in schools and which are becoming more complex.  There will be more flexibility in the way responsibility is given to such middle managers, how they report and record progress and so on.  A more professional approach is being taken to middle management, and responding to that we have invested in 2,600 additional posts at assistant principal level.<\/p><p> On the issue of the availability of places for children with special needs and the capital provision for that, our Department is very responsive to needs in this area and it gets special access to capital.  As approximately 80 additional special needs classes are being provided each year, the provision is growing very rapidly.  It has more than doubled in the past four or five years.  The experts are here but, as I understand it, the breakdown of that is that 60% go to mainstream, 20% to special classes, and 20% to special schools.  At this time of the year, people are considering what is the appropriate placement, assessments are taking place, there is engagement with special education needs organisers, SENOs, and so on.  I can understand parents being anxious at this time of year but, by and large, we are meeting all those needs.  There can be a difficulty in placing individual children and that takes time.  Of foot of a recommendation of the Chairman's party, we will be introducing a measure whereby the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, will have the power to require a school to open a special needs class in the event that schools are not co-operating.  By and large we are seeing that level of co-operation.  The number of special classes has increased from 540 to in the region of 1,200 in the space of five or six years.  That is a very rapid expansion.  It is moving from being at primary to now being at second level, reflecting that children are being retained into second level, which is what we are trying to achieve.  Those the issues the members raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2018032800002#D00600","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522252800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I will go back to the members.

The career guidance counsellor is the only trained member of staff to whom a vulnerable child with mental health difficulties or family difficulties can turn.  I respectfully request that when the Minister is reviewing this area, he should not confine his considerations to the career advice aspect of the role of the career guidance counsellor but should also pay attention to the counselling aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2018032800002#F00500","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1522252800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I would like to reflect on what the Minister has said about special education.

I would like to mention a specific case in which an ASD unit was opened in a primary school - Scoil na Naomh Uilig, Newbridge - but, eight or ten years later, no such provision was made in the secondary schools in the community.  Having spoken to my colleagues from around the country, I have no doubt that this situation is mirrored elsewhere.  Solutions tend to be found at the last minute.  They are cobbled together in the run-up to September - perhaps just six months in advance - to try to resolve the issue.  I do not think the section 29 system is the right system to use because it puts schools in difficult positions and creates adversarial relationships between parents and schools from day one.  There could and should be much better planning to ensure children with special needs who have had the opportunity to be in mainstream primary schools - I agree with the Minister that this is the best situation for such children - get the proper type of follow-through at second level.

It is utterly disproportionate.  I think it could be up to a third although I do not have the figures to hand.  The number is massive.  I agree with the Chair that there needs to be a change in this regard and I certainly will be highlighting that.  The stories we hear in this regard are heartbreaking.  Children with special needs and their parents are disproportionately affected in this regard.

A cost has been indicated.  The Government has indicated that it will start negotiations on foot of that report.  That is the current situation.  I have to say that all of these pay cuts happened before I became Minister for Education and Skills.  Indeed, some of them were initiated when Deputy Thomas Byrne's party was in government.  There is no superior moral position.  I sat down immediately and negotiated a reduction of 75% in the gap.  We got a series of improvements for new entrants, not only on pay but also on earlier permanent contracts.  As the Deputy mentioned, I have negotiated posts of responsibility for people.  We are continually seeking to improve the position of teachers within our system.  The issues still have to be negotiated.  The &euro;200 million cost of this has not been provided for.  The Taoiseach has signalled that it has to be negotiated.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge that the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 has been delayed.  It has been delayed because the committee has raised three important issues, which are not easy to resolve.  The first of these issues is the use of religion in admissions policies.  Deputy Thomas Byrne mentioned the second issue, which is the need to make provision for special needs.  For example, we are looking at whether the NCSE should be in a position to require a school to open an ASD unit.  The third issue is access to Gaelscoileanna.  These complex issues have required a considerable degree of complex work by the Department and the Office of the Attorney General.  I assure the Deputy that there is no unnecessary delay.  We are doing our very best to move this important legislation forward.<\/p> <p>  I assure Deputy Catherine Martin that I recognise the much wider role of guidance counsellors in providing guidance and counselling in respect of education and career options.  We are looking specifically at the career area to ascertain whether we should be thinking about additional things in that regard.  We want to see whether there are ways of supporting and building on resources outside the school system that could be very relevant and supportive.<\/p> <p>  I must defend the approach to special education that has been taken by the NCSE and the Department of Education and Skills.  Resources were increased by 40% during the most difficult years this country has experienced.  Provision for children with special educational needs has been expanded rapidly.  The NCSE works with parents and experts to identify the best placements for children.  When additional special needs units have been required in schools, they have been built at breakneck speed in public service terms.  The provision in this area has been more than doubled in the space of a small number of years.  The capital branch of my Department gives this area priority for funding.  The NCSE recognises that some of the models that are in place are not fit for purpose for the long term.  It has brought parents and stakeholders with it throughout its pioneering work in designing new models that are robust for the long term.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan was involved in the difficult process of planning, which has worked.  We need to do the same in respect of other needs, as well as teaching needs, which children have when they come to school.  I appreciate that there are difficult cases.  I absolutely accept that.  Historically, very little provision was made in this area, but we have moved on and it is now a major priority.  Of course it is of great concern every time a child has difficulty getting a placement.  Deputies raise such cases and section 29 appeals are made.  We have a strong independent system under the NCSE.  We have given the NCSE its independence.  It advises us and we act on its advice.<\/p><p>We are seeking to make sure that every child with a special need has his or her needs met.

We committed to a system of collective agreement within the public service.  That means the trade unions negotiate for the entire public service, right across every branch.  We do not have separate negotiations for some parts of the public service because they are intricately related.  We cannot give increases in one area without recognising the knock-on effects in other areas.  The work the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has done recognised the issue of new entrant pay is an issue right across the public service.  He set out what the cost is.  Some of that cost is in education but much of it is elsewhere.  He indicated he will sit down with the parties involved and discuss it.  As with every issue, if extra money is to be found for one thing it has to come away from somewhere else.  That is all I am saying.  There will have to be give and take on all of these discussions.  We cannot make any one thing an absolute requirement.  That is why we have negotiations and why we have collective agreements.  All of the public service unions recognise the value of these agreements to give certainty.  They are making provision for pay increases.  The trade unions decided in the negotiation that the lowest paid should get great priority.  That is the way the structure of the agreement was - there would be increases for everyone and they would be weighted more towards the low paid.  That is what they sought to negotiate.  We have to accept that was the approach that was taken.  It also recognised there are outstanding issues on new entrants' pay and to areas where there is difficulty recruiting.

They are at various stages of development and 11 have gone live.  In those, we already see much more significant female representation.  The traditional trades are still the dominant element of the overall make-up of apprenticeships and that is what is reflected in the low participation.

Part of this is being funded through the national training fund.  There has been a significant increase in the higher and further education budget over the past two years.  There is, of course, the issue raised by Peter Cassells on whether we should move to a new income contingent loan scheme, and I know the committee recently wrote to me about this.  This clearly is another strand.  In terms of the issue of providing, as Peter Cassells sought, additional State funding and additional funding from employers, we have moved forward with this.  We have also indicated that over the next two years there will be additional increases on these from the Exchequer and the training fund source.  We are going ahead in making provision for additional funding.  We are also reforming the allocation model, so the way in which money will be allocated will be more equitable and more effective in promoting expansion and the goals we have set for the higher education system in terms of access and meeting skill needs.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the longer term, of course we have committed in the ten-year plan to a &euro;2.2 billion increase in the investment in capital at higher level and this is a massive increase.  As committee members know, the Exchequer fund provision up to the mid-term capital review was only &euro;110 million in Exchequer and &euro;200 million in public private partnerships.  This is a massive expansion of our commitment to the future investment in third level facilities on the capital side.<\/p> <p>  With regard to SUSI and grants, although we made some changes to improve the terms of access to grants, the main thing is the changes in the economy.  They are means-tested schemes and the proportion of people who are qualifying is down slightly as a result of the reduction in unemployment.  There has been some reduction in grant holders as a result of this but there has been no restriction in the terms of access in any of these areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2018032800002#H00800","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1522252800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>We will now move on to programme D, which is pages 31 to 34 of the Department's briefing and pages C14 and C15 of the committee secretariat's briefing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2018032800002#H00900","speaker":"1343"},{"type":"speech","time":1522252800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I have to say I am deeply concerned about the capital programme and I assume the Minister is also.  Quite frankly, it seems the Minister does not have enough money to meet the demand for school places and, in particular, to meet the commitments his predecessor, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, made in 2015.  Very little progress has been made on this particular capital plan.  The number of projects, as listed in the Estimates, which the Department has completed has dropped dramatically in recent years.  In 2015 there were 936 small extensions and upgrading of facilities in primary schools and this dropped to 600 last year.  In post-primary schools it dropped from 269 to 200.  This is a dramatic drop in works carried out in primary schools in the two-year period and a large drop at post-primary level.<\/p> <p>  There is also not just a creeping back of prefabs but a dramatic expansion of them under the Minister's reign, at the time when it is recognised my former colleagues, Batt O'Keeffe and Mary Coughlan, made progress to try to replace prefabs with classrooms.  Ruair&iacute; Quinn as Minister certainly spoke about it and some progress was made, but under the Minister's watch, the number of prefabs rented increased by 25.7% in one year, and it is an even larger increase since 2015.  What is the Minister's answer to this?  It is a disgraceful situation that it is happening.<\/p> <p>  I have to say I do not think the Department is at the races, with all due respect to everybody, on the increases in population.  I see it in my constituency.  I had reports today, for example, of Oldcastle, which is a rural town, where the secondary school is oversubscribed.  I never heard of that before in a rural town where there is not much other choice.  We know there is oversubscription in Dunshaughlin Community College also.  We know there is massive oversubscription in Ashbourne, and the Department has been notified by school principals in that town of their assessment of the absolutely unprecedented oversubscription.  I am speaking about my constituency because it is the one I know best, but I know Dunshaughlin has similar issues.  Not enough work is being done with regard to the houses that are being built.<\/p><p>A quick drive around many of these areas, whether in Meath, Kildare or Dublin, would show that houses are being built.  I am sure it is also starting to happen in Kilkenny and, perhaps, Sligo.  In towns in my constituency, such as Ashbourne, it is almost impossible to get a primary school place for a child above junior infants level.  One will not find a place for children in third or fourth class.  I am hearing from principals that it will be very difficult for some people to find places for junior infants next September.<\/p><p> I do not believe the Department has enough planning done and, crucially, I do not believe enough budgeting has been done.  This is shown by the substantial drop in the number of projects, the lack of progress on the schools building plan and the dramatic increase in the number of rented prefabs the Department is now using, shockingly, to deal with the issue.  We believed we had seen the last of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESS2018032800002#H01000","speaker":"1225","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522252800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>My question is on the provision of physical education facilities in schools.  I welcome the introduction of physical education as a leaving certificate subject.  I find it remarkable, however, that not one request by a secondary school to build or operate a sports hall has been approved.  How is a school expected to deliver PE at leaving certificate level on an equal footing with another school if it simply does not have a PE hall?  A school in my constituency, Dublin&ndash;Rathdown, opened its doors in 1980 but, almost 40 years later, it still does not have a PE hall.  How many second-level schools do not have PE halls?  I have asked this question before.  I do not get a direct answer to parliamentary questions.  I am told that if a school does not have a hall, there are facilities for it in the community.  The school in my constituency is a DEIS school and it cannot afford to hire a bus to go to a community centre or swimming pool.  It should not have to use part of its double period of 80 minutes to do that.  It is not putting the school on a level footing with others.<\/p> <p>  I presume that, in the pilot programme the Department is running with 80 schools, at least one school with no PE hall is included so the Department can monitor and evaluate the fairness of the system.  How is it fair that schools do not have PE halls?  How will that work in terms of rolling out the new PE subject?  Has one of the schools with no PE facilities been chosen for the pilot programme so that  it might be evaluated?  This needs to be done in order to ensure the fairness of the system.

There is a growing number of children, particularly at second level, but also at primary level.  This is a period of very high demand for additional resources for new buildings.  We have had to prioritise new places above and beyond other areas of desirable capital expenditure.  That is why PE hall provision is not part of our capital expenditure programme at present.  As part of the capital plan, however, we have recognised that both PE halls and laboratory facilities require investment.  We will be investing but it will not be in the medium term.  In the immediate term, 80% of money must go towards getting places for the children who are coming through.<\/p> <p>  I have acknowledged there is more use of prefabs but there will be a programme of prefab replacement from 2019 onwards.

There are currently 85 projects under construction or progressing to construction this year.  Therefore, projects are continuing to flow through.  We never hand back a ha'penny of the money that is allocated to us.  We make sure that every penny in education capital that is allocated is spent.

I have been told by local authority sources - I have not seen the letters so I should obtain them through a freedom of information request - that the Department asked how many developments with more than 100 houses were taking place.  Was that the question, or something along those lines?  It certainly would not be relevant.  There are many developments with smaller numbers of houses.  That is the word coming back to me.  There was certainly a lot of discussion among councillors in Meath on that particular point.<\/p> <p>  We acknowledge that the Minister and his officials spend every penny.  It always happens with this particular budget.  The truth, however, is that land costs will potentially eat up a considerable amount of the budget because they are rising all the time, as are construction costs.  Has the Minister told his colleagues in the Cabinet, including the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, that he just does not have enough money and that, while he is spending every penny he has, the system will not be able to cope and is really falling back.  Has he asked for more money to deal with this?  It does not look like the Minister has done this.  The capital budget is greater than it was a few years ago but it is in the same ballpark.

I will address the issue of transparency and speak on the research I have done on this topic in the European Union and the Council of Ministers in particular.<\/p> <p>  Let me set out the context and what we mean by transparency, which will give members a grounding in the concept that will help the discussion.  The definition in the literature is that transparency is the availability of regime relevant information.  It is about the link between the internal politics of the European Union institutions and outside audiences, be they citizens, the media or indeed national parliaments.  There is an idea that there should be an ideal level of transparency that would allow outsiders to monitor the internal politics of any institution.  This ideal would give us information as outsiders about what is said at any given meeting, who said it, when it was said, why it was said and, probably most importantly, where information on all of the above can be found or, ideally, easily found.  The second point is that transparency on its own is not enough.  It is certainly a prerequisite for accountability but it does not guarantee it.  Just because we have information does not necessarily mean that decision makers will be held accountable.  It is certainly a prerequisite for doing so.<\/p> <p>  What is the EU's regulation on transparency?  It is the famous Regulation (EC) No. 1049\/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents states that all EU institutions should release all records relevant to the decision that they make and do so in a timely fashion.  When one reads it, one thinks it will lead to a very transparent decision-making process, but in Article 4 of the regulation, the exceptions are listed.  Most of the exceptions are pretty reasonable.  There are exceptions to transparency when it might affect: the public interest regarding public security, defence and military matters, international relations, the financial, monetary or economic policy of the Union or a member state; the privacy and the integrity of the individual; commercial interests; court proceedings and legal advice and inspections, investigations and audits.  There is also this idea that transparency can be denied when it is in the interests of protecting the institutions' decision-making processes.  That is a broad exception and it is used all the time to deny access to information.<\/p> <p>  How is this regulation being applied over time?  This is a figure taken from some research I did with a colleague that was published in 2015.  Members can see from the slide the position on Council transparency over a period.  The graph shows the percentage of documents that existed that were released at any given time.  Our first dotted line is when the Regulation (EC) No. 1049\/2001 is agreed.  It came into force in May 2001.  As members will see, there is a significant drop in censorship over time at this point which we can relate to the regulation.<\/p><p>As we move from 1999, there is a decrease in the level of censorship and thus an increase in the level of transparency.  It only goes up to 2010, but I have no reason to think the picture has changed too much.  We see that, on average, between 80% and 90% of the documents produced by the Council are released.  This gives the impression that it is quite transparent, but I argue that that is probably not the case in practice.  We have access to the documents, but whether they are useful is an open question.  <br\/><br\/>The second graph indicates the number of days between a document being drafted and being released.  Again, the first two lines indicate where the transparency regulation came into effect.  We can see that at this point there is an increase in the timeliness of the release of information.  Therefore, we certainly had more timely access to records by 2001.  However, as we move through the years between 2001 and 2010, we see that, on average, there were still probably about 300 days between the drafting of a document - when it was available internally - and when it was publicly released.  As members can imagine, if takes 300-odd days, on average, to gain access to information, it will not be very useful in trying to keep up with negotiations that are current.  <br\/><br\/>What have been the overall effects of the 2001 regulation?  We certainly have more information than we had before, but as we have seen, records are not supplied in a timely manner.  As an outsider, this makes it really difficult to follow what is going on in the institutions.  <br\/><br\/>A second issue is that records fail to explicitly link the positions taken at meetings with the individual delegations that take them, that is if the positions taken are recorded at all.  If we look at the documents released, usually they are just drafts of the legislation under consideration, without much information on the positions delegations are taking.  That is problematic also.  <br\/><br\/>If an outsider wants to find information on ongoing discussions at the Council of Ministers, he or she must go through the document register which is Byzantine in nature.  I spent the time doing my PhD battling with this website and still do so today.  It is not intuitive.  It is difficult to navigate for someone who does not have the time and patience to go through it.  In practice, the level of Council transparency is not very high, despite the fact that all of these documents are available.  <br\/><br\/>Moving to the Ombudsman's recommendations, the good news is that the Ombudsman has flagged a lot of these issues.  The Ombudsman's report points out that records tend to be released after negotiations have finished when it is too late to do anything about a decision.  It also flags the overuse of the LIMITE status of documents, a way the Council it uses to keeps documents to be used for negotiation purposes only away from the public eye until a decision is taken.  The Ombudsman has flagged that there is inconsistent recording of delegations' positions.  Therefore, even when someone gain access to a given document or record, it does not tell him or her which delegations are taking which positions.  I have spoken about the Byzantine nature of the document register.  On the basis of these findings, the Ombudsman recommends that the Council take a more systematic approach to recording delegations' positions and needs to develop clear criteria for the use of LIMITE status and review documents given LIMITE status before negotiations conclude rather than looking after the fact at releasing them.  <br\/><br\/>What is my reaction to the report?  If implemented, would the recommendations actually improve the position?  It is important to note that there might be positive and negative effects.  Let us suppose we increase the level of transparency such that the Council gives better access to records and has better systems for recording delegations' positions.  Potentially there are positive effects because the increase in the level of transparency will increase the potential for publicity, for example, by outside media taking an interest in proceedings.  This, in turn, will help to advertise the decisions being made in a timely fashion and provide potential for accountability on the part of decision makers.  It would go some way towards addressing the potential democratic deficit about which we often hear in EU decision making.  <br\/><br\/>Another potential effect of increasing the level of transparency is that when actors take positions and know they will be on the record, they will generally be more credible.  Therefore, it would be harder to back away from position taken publicly.  Perhaps that is something we want.  <br\/><br\/>There would also be negative effects.  Increasing the level of transparency means that when decision makers are in meetings, they will know that there is a potential audience monitoring ongoing negotiations.  This would provide incentives to grandstand and take artificially extreme positions because they would be playing to a domestic audience.  This, in turn, could make reaching a compromise difficult.  If we want to have an efficient EU decision-making process, we want reaching a compromise to be easy.  <br\/><br\/>Another effect is that it could push the real negotiations outside the committee room.  If decision makers know that proceedings of a meeting will be on the record, what tends to happen is that they will broker a deal outside the room beforehand, go in and announce it.  Therefore, the quality of deliberations in the room can suffer.  <br\/><br\/>What about having less transparency or maintaining the <i>status quo<\/i>?  It would have the opposite effect.  If there was less transparency, there would be no potential audience and fewer incentives to grandstand.  This would be good and make reaching a compromise easier and there would be delliberations of better quality.  The negative effects also involve the opposite.  Less or no transparency means no potential publicity, no accountability and less democratic decision-making.  These are the things to consider when taking a position on transparency in negotiations at the Council and in general.  <br\/><br\/>What can I conclude?  The 2001 regulation has certainly worked.  The Council is more transparent than it was.  Is it transparent enough to hold decision makers accountable for the decisions they make and the positions they take?  I would say almost certainly not, given how the system is run.  Should the level of transparency be increased or should we pursue or advocate for increased transparency?  As I said, there would obviously be trade-offs and it would depend on one's perspective of them, but, in general, I argue that increased transparency would be better because it would provide for accountability.  We will always have exceptions in place.  That will allow for extreme situations where one needs to protect the decision-making process, but, in general, the Council should be encouraged to be more transparent and provide information on ongoing decision-making processes in a timely manner.  It is important to note that on its own transparency is not enough.  Just because we have access to information does not mean that citizens will become more engaged.  It is potentially the case that it could happen.  If someone is interested, he or she can find this stuff, but that is not a solution to the problem of the democratic deficit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018032800002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. James Cross","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522242000,"counter":118,"content":"<p>We really appreciate Dr. Cross's contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018032800002#B00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1522242000,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Cross for coming before us.

He has put a lot of work into this matter.  I can only offer my own practical experience.  It has been some time since I was in the Council of Ministers but I had responsibility, delegated by the Government, for the Single European Act, SEA.  At that time, I was not fond of too much transparency and scrutiny.  The British Government was represented there at the time, and we went around the table to deal with issues.<\/p> <p>  The situation then was that one went to Brussels the night before a Council meeting.  One would be briefed by the Irish ambassador and the advisers from each Department relevant to the negotiations.  The talks could concern an educational matter, such as recognition of qualifications.  They could concern telecommunications or freedom of movement of goods and services.  All sorts of derogations would be discussed.  The United Kingdom Government worked very well with the Irish Government on issues in regard to which we were basically in the same situation.  We worked together to get results.  Frankly, I do not know if too much transparency would be of great benefit to the member states.  However, I understand circumstances have changed and there is far more transparency now.  The late Dr. Garret Fitzgerald once said to me that when writing his memoirs he was sorry he did not keep all the documents from European Union negotiations during the Irish Presidency of the EU Council.  I said to him that nobody would want to read them, quite frankly, because they are boring documents, and there is an unbelievable amount of material.  I understand there is a bit more transparency now.<\/p> <p>  I do not know whether audio or visual recordings are made of meetings of the Council of Ministers.  Dr. Cross might be able to answer that.  I do not know whether such recordings available, which would be very transparent.  Many county councils, including Roscommon County Council, now record their entire meetings.  What happens at that level is very transparent, and it has changed the structure of the council.  I was watching a meeting the other day, and I was quite impressed by the contributions of the members when the cameras were there and the meeting was being published online.  What is happening there now?  I do not know the current situation.  I was in Brussels when Dr. Cross was completing his PhD.<\/p> <p>  This is an interesting and complex area.  People want more transparency.  That said, different countries have different approaches.  In the case of some Scandinavian countries, everything is agreed in discussions with Ministers before they go to Brussels.  There are no doubts about their decisions.  Denmark is one of the countries with very strong views.  What the Danish Government does and does not do is very transparent.  That is just my observation and  I would like to hear Dr. Cross's views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018032800002#C00200","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1522242000,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I thank our guest for carrying out the study, and for the presentation of his information.  My question concerns the benefits of total transparency in this area versus the negatives.  While it might contribute to democracy in one sense, it might create problems in another.  It has been suggested from time to time over the years that the more transparency is required, the less people in executive positions are inclined to take decisions and put their name on the line.  Is there a danger that a greater degree of transparency might slow down what is an already relatively slow process at European level?  Would the bureaucrats that we regularly complain switch from moving slowly to not moving at all?<\/p> <p>  Alternatively, they might move more quickly to seize the high ground on positions where it might not necessarily be beneficial to the member state.  For example, my colleague made reference to Danish and Swedish positions on certain issues.  Some years ago in this room I asked a delegation from Sweden how they reacted to a decision taken at the Council of Ministers.  I found out that the Swedish Minister was mandated by the European affairs committee in his homeland.  To my mind, that was not of any great benefit to the rest of the European Union.  We must consider how the Union works, and whether it works for the benefit of the entire Union, having regard to each of the constituent bodies, or works at the behest of a member state and its own particular, perhaps parochial, interests.  There would a danger of parochialism in those circumstances.  In the course of his examination, did Dr. Cross find evidence that a member state could influence decisions taken at meetings of the Council of Ministers to a huge extent, above and beyond their status?  I am worried about that, as I have previously expressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018032800002#C00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1522242000,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I will start with the questions of whether just having access to information is enough and what we do with all of this information.  The <i>status quo<\/i>is that the provision of records is almost like an information dump.  The records are not well linked.  The European Parliament is slightly better, in that one can carry out meta searches and find the areas one is interested in.  The Council does not have this facility.  It provides records in permanent document format, PDF.  They are generally not searchable.  They are available in a document register.  Users can carry out keyword searches, but because it is not a very advanced document register, one invariably gets a thousand results for every search.  It is hard to sort what is relevant from all the other information.  It is almost as though by providing so much information the institution is becoming less transparent, because it is not clear what is relevant and what is not.  That is definitely a problem, and I think the EU Council could do a lot better by having a more intuitive search function to help explore the information than it does now.<br\/><br\/>If the whole process was made more transparent, could it be misused?  This recalls the famous image of the hacker sitting in his bedroom, looking to undermine the Union.  I do not think there is that much nefarious information in the documents as they currently stand.  Of course, the European Ombudsman is proposing to change that and wants positions to be better recorded than they currently are, and for the identities of those taking positions to be recorded.  That could give more information to individuals with nefarious ideas.  However, if the actors involved are taking positions that are against the public interest, that should be public information.  The overall benefit of making the process more transparent probably outweighs the costs. <br\/><br\/>Moving onto Senator Leyden's observations, I note that there is a difference with negotiations at the highest level, for example, those pertaining to the SEA.  Generally these are treaty negotiations and things like that.  They are never going to be very transparent, and that is because room for compromise is needed.  Access to that information will never be provided in a timely manner.  I would not endorse doing so, because I think it would do more harm than good.  It would open up issues that need to be negotiated in closed door settings, at least where high-level decisions are concerned.  However, we are not just discussing those negotiations, but also negotiations over secondary legislation, which I would say is much less politicised but also has a very important impact.<\/p><p>A huge percentage of Irish legislation now comes from Brussels, as we know.  We need information on how that was decided and whether our representatives fought the good fight, got their way and managed to influence people.  We do not have that at the moment.  We have no idea.  It is difficult to hold decision makers accountable for decisions.  That is true across the board whether one likes the decision or not.  <\/p><p> On the question of whether Council meetings are recorded, they are.  Anyone interested in such things can watch the proceedings of the European Council on its website.  However, if this was actually done, it would show some of the positive and negative effects of transparency that I mentioned in my opening statement.  The delegations will stand up and read out prepared statements.  There is no deliberation going on.  All the decisions have been taken outside of the room.  This is just representatives standing up and reading out positions.  Then there is a vote.  However, it all is pre-ordained, almost.  It is not very informative for anyone trying to follow how decisions are made.  <\/p><p> It is a pity because in theory, providing public access to these meetings is a good thing.  However, the effect is that decisions are taken outside of the room and then prepared statements are read out.  That is probably part of politics at the highest level.  Generally, what happens at the ministerial level is that much of the details have been threshed out by the working groups and the committee of permanent representatives, COREPER, beforehand.  We know little about how those decisions are made in those contexts and having a bit more transparency around those meetings would be very informative.  <\/p><p> The Scandinavians tend to be quite transparent.  They are used to the process of transparency and would say it is a better way of running Government.  The French have a different idea on transparency and access.  As has been said, there are these different cultures of transparency in Europe.  That is certainly the case.<\/p><p> On the costs and benefits on total transparency, Deputy Durkan is absolutely right.  When decision makers know they are on record, they are sometimes more reticent to take positions than they would be in closed-door settings, which can be problematic.  However, it can also be a good thing because at least we know the positions they are taking when they take them.  The point is that there is a trade-off in this regard and one must figure out what is one's position on that.  As for whether it can slow down negotiations, yes there is a lot of work extant suggesting that if transparency is increased, it can have a negative effect on the efficiency of decision-making processes.  We are back to the idea that when decision makers know they are on record, they are more reticent to take positions.  However, perhaps that is a good thing.  Perhaps the EU to date has been too good and too efficient at making decisions and it is putting out legislation that has not been debated properly and of which the public is not aware.  If the process was more transparent, and they were aware, then maybe these decisions might not be made.  That is another thing that has to be weighed up.  Efficiency has its costs as well.  It can lead to legislation and decisions that do not reflect the will of the people and what the citizens would be interested in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018032800002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. James Cross","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522242000,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Cross for all that engagement.

The debate on the future of the EU 27 has gathered significant momentum since the Commission published a White Paper on the future of Europe a little over a year ago.  The position of Ireland and Irish business in this debate is critical, particularly given current and upcoming challenges posed by Brexit.  I welcome the opportunity to meet with the committee again to present IBEC's document, \"Ireland in the EU: A dynamic future\", which sets out the priorities of Irish business for the future of Europe.  IBEC launched this document in Brussels last week at a joint IBEC-EPP event in the European Parliament, hosted by Sean Kelly, MEP.  The event, with over 300 guests, was addressed by some of the EU's most influential figures, including: Antonio Tajani, President of the European Parliament; Jyrki Katainen, European Commission Vice-President for Jobs, Growth, Investment and Competitiveness; Phil Hogan, European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development; and Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator for Brexit.  Mr. Julian King, European Commissioner for the Security Union and former British ambassador to Ireland also attended the event.  IBEC is the only Irish business group with such reach and influence and Michel Barnier restated his deep commitment to working with us to reach the best possible outcome in the Brexit negotiations.  Following the event, IBEC had a series of meetings with the Irish Permanent Representation to the EU and the European Commission, including with officials responsible for engagement with Ireland under the European semester process.<\/p> <p>  IBEC has been closely monitoring the debate on the future of Europe as it unfolded over the last year in Brussels and across EU capitals.  We carefully analysed the Commission's White Paper and subsequent reflection papers.  I was pleased to address this committee following President Juncker's state of the EU speech last September to outline our initial thoughts.  Since then, IBEC has met with the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Helen McEntee, and her senior officials on several occasions to discuss Brexit and the future of Europe.  We took note of the Taoiseach's address at European Parliament plenary in Strasbourg where he was the first EU Head of State to outline his Government's position on the future of the European project.  Throughout this process, IBEC has been in constant touch with our members, ensuring that Irish businesses are up-to-date on the future of Europe debate and, indeed, that they recognise the value of contributing to this crucial debate at such an important juncture in the EU's history.  We truly believe that this is an opportunity to shape the future of the EU, which has a profound effect on our entrepreneurs and consumers alike, the way we do business, and the way we, as both Irish and EU citizens, live our lives.  A key issue will be to identify how, together, we can all work to achieve shared objectives.<\/p> <p>  The paper that I present to the committee today encapsulates the carefully considered views of IBEC members from SMEs to multinational corporations and across all sectors of Irish business and industry.  The resounding view of our members is that membership of the EU, both today and in the future, is of huge importance both for their individual businesses but also for the Irish economy.  One key message of our paper is that the EU is not broken.  Despite all its challenges, the EU remains a model of global success.  Now is not the time for a major change in direction and now is not the time to be distracted by a protracted debate about the constitutional architecture of Europe.  Instead, we must use the institutions we have to effectively deliver a better, more prosperous future for all our citizens.<\/p> <p>  In this context, the EU must continue to focus on positive reform.  We need greater cooperation in areas where there is a clear collective benefit and where the EU can deliver added value.  That also means less integration in areas where member states are best placed to act and to tailor policy to different country needs.  To be more precise, the major underpinning of our report is that all EU policy should be carried out with a few core principles at its heart.  First, all EU legislation should be crafted with reference to the innovation principle.  Innovation underpins the success and prosperity of the EU, especially the Single Market.  We believe that all EU policy should be designed with the innovation principle at its core, meaning that whenever policy is developed, the impact on innovation is fully assessed.  The principle should be applied by EU policymakers and legislators to ensure that any new policies and laws help to foster and facilitate innovation rather than hamper it.  For Europe to lead the world in science, technology, design, medical advancements, etc., we need to ensure the Union provides a suitable environment for the development of new ideas which bring economic and societal benefits.   The innovation principle should therefore ensure that new ideas are stimulated, not stifled in the EU.<\/p> <p>  The second area we emphasise involves the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, which are key tenets of the EU treaties.  IBEC believes these principles should continue to be championed by EU policymakers into the future.  The distribution of legislative responsibility between the member states and the EU is a critical issue for Irish business and our partners across Europe.  We want the EU to act only in those areas where it has a proven value-add, and to refrain from legislating in those areas which are matters of member state competence.  In this regard, we welcome President Juncker's recent initiative to establish a task force on subsidiarity and proportionality and encourage this task force to engage with business to fully understand the potential impact of regulation on economic growth.  The future EU should continue to fully respect member state sovereignty and intervene only in the areas where the EU brings added value.  The principles I have just mentioned should be seen as a common thread which is woven through policy cycles of all EU-led initiatives.<\/p> <p>  Further to these core principles, our report outlines six areas of priority, or guiding principles, which we have the identified as areas where the EU can add real value.  While those priorities are outlined in greater detail in the report, I enumerate the six as follows to provide the committee with a flavour of what is involved.<\/p> <p>  First is an EU that unleashes the potential of the Single Market and digitalisation.  We want the EU institutions to build on what has already been achieved and complete the Single Market and digital Single Market.  This is also true for the capital markets union, the banking union and the economic and monetary union.  Completion of these big wins will allow for economic growth, job creation and a rise in living standards for our citizens.  Second is an EU that leads the world in trade and investment.  Ireland is the perfect example of how globalisation can bolster an economy.  We have benefitted hugely from having an open approach to international trade, become a leading exporter, and benefit from multinational investment in a wide range of sectors in a relatively short period of time.  The EU should continue with this open approach, building international partnership with strategic investors, pursuing ambitious free trade agreement in a balance manner.  This includes ensuring trade in services is a top priority when it comes to free trade agreements.  It also means that a new trading relationship with the UK should be as close as possible to current situation.<\/p> <p>  Third is a dynamic EU that embraces a competitive taxation policy.  The EU must respect member state sovereignty when it comes to decision-making on all taxation matters.  A competitive taxation policy will ensure that member states have the tools to keep their economies innovative and competitive.  Supply chains, business operations and transactions are now global and increasingly Internet-based.  Any change to current taxation arrangements should be carried out at a multilateral level to mirror this, such as through the OECD's BEPS project.<\/p> <p>  Fourth is an EU that respects member state competency to design labour market and social policy.  Having too much labour and social policy catered for at an EU level will leave citizens feeling disenfranchised and isolated from policymakers.<\/p><p>The EU should continue to ensure that member states have autonomy in designing bespoke labour market and social policy which can best consider nuances in societal culture, local labour market realities, demographics and citizens&rsquo; needs. <br\/><br\/>Fifth is an EU that champions better regulation.  Poorly designed policy, legislation and regulation add to the cost of doing business and are obstacles to job creation, growth and prosperity.  This can be remedied through the Commission&rsquo;s continued commitment to the better regulation agenda, promoting better and more effective legislation across the EU institutions.  We are asking that the EU institutions continue to use platforms such as the REFIT programme to ensure that regulation is designed in a way which is growth enabling and does not infringe upon competitiveness in the EU economy.<br\/><br\/>Finally, the sixth priority should be an EU that ensures fiscal rules are in tune with all member states.  The individuality of member states&rsquo; needs should be considered at European level.  Each state has a diverse and nuanced set of requirements which should be considered by EU policymakers.  We want to see a robust, rules-based approach to spending, but capital investment projects should be treated significantly more favourably.  This is of particular import in the current Irish context.  Ireland needs to invest more now in essential infrastructure to ensure we are well equipped to face current and future challenges in vital areas such as housing and transport.  The EU&rsquo;s policies should reflect this.<br\/><br\/>Of course, how the EU divides its finances is ultimately the best indication of where its priorities lie.  An essential element of our future of Europe paper is IBEC's positioning on the next multi-annual financial framework, MFF, of the EU, on which the Commission will publish its first proposal in May for the post-2020 period.  IBEC has three key priorities for the MFF post 2020.  The MFF post 2020 should be big on big things and small on small things, and dedicate money only in areas in which the EU has real value and can achieve tangible results.  IBEC believes that the EU should increase funding in research and innovation.  The EU needs to be a global leader when it comes to spending on research, development and innovation.  Currently, we are lagging behind our international competitors when it comes to research intensity, spending only 2% of GDP on research and innovation compared with 3.6% in Japan and 2.7% in the USA.  This needs to change if we are to maintain global competitiveness and lead the way in new technologies. Spending on research and innovation must be bolstered in the MFF post 2020.  We also need to uphold current commitments to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP,<i><\/i>and other areas of traditional spending which have a proven added value.  The EU must not underestimate the importance of spending in these traditional areas.  In the Irish context, continued commitment to the CAP is essential not only to ensure the quality of the produce which is essential to our food and drink sector, but also in protecting our rural communities and bridging the urban-rural divide.  Of course, a major challenge to the MFF post 2020 will be the significant drop in contributions once the UK exits from the Union.  How this shortfall is made up is ultimately a political decision, but we are asking that the EU pays close attention to the three aforementioned priorities.<br\/><br\/>It would be impossible to speak about the future of the EU without mentioning Brexit.  Indeed, the departure of the UK from the EU presents an unprecedented and profoundly unwelcome challenge to the Europe we know, but we also believe that the UK will continue to be a vital partner in our future relationship with the EU.  In that context, I wanted to restate IBEC&rsquo;s priorities for Brexit.  First, it wants a smooth exit, and not a cliff edge.  Second, comprehensive transitional arrangements should be in place.  We welcome the progress that was made at last week's European Council in this regard.  Third, IBEC wants the closest possible relationship with the UK in the future.  There is much detail to be worked out to achieve this.  Finally, unique Irish challenges must be addressed, such as the Border issue between the North and South.<br\/><br\/>This year marks 45 years of Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the EU.  Since joining in 1973, our economy and society have experienced many challenges and faced many hurdles.  Ultimately however, EU membership has helped Ireland build an open and resilient economy.  Irish businesses enjoy unfettered access to the world&rsquo;s largest single market.  Irish citizens can work and live freely in any other EU member state and Irish companies can employ talented people from across the EU.  Trading in the EU bloc has also helped Irish companies avail of market access opportunities in previously untapped global markets.  Irish farmers have benefited from CAP funding, which in turn has supported the development of a world-class food and drink sector.  Being part of the EU has also helped Ireland become the dynamic innovative economy that it is today in areas such as biopharmaceuticals, medical technology and services, particularly computer services.  Irish business remains committed to the EU project and we are proud to help shape the conversation as to how the EU will continue to grow and develop into the future.<br\/><br\/>I thank the members here for their work on this important committee and I look forward to engaging with them further as the debate on the future of Europe continues to mature throughout the coming weeks and months and into the new legislature of the European institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018032800002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pat Ivory","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522242000,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Before I open the floor to Senator Leyden, I want to say that we are sorry for Dr. Ivory's injury and that we hope that he will make a quick recovery from it.

IBEC is a very dynamic organisation, and many former members and employees are playing a very important role in European affairs at the moment.  It is a great training ground for people.<\/p> <p>  This document, Ireland in the EU: A Dynamic Future - The Priorities of Irish Business for the Future of Europe, is very well presented.  It is very easy to read and is a great document for people who are involved in negotiations, including the Government.  It serves as a handbook of the facts and outlines the benefits of Ireland's membership of the European Union for the past 45 years.<\/p> <p>  There is no point in further regretting what is happening with the UK, but I am confident that there will be an agreement at the end of the day that will benefit North and South.  It is absolutely in our interests, as we all know, and there is a great deal of goodwill towards us from the other 26 member states of the European Union.  This committee, through our Chairman and our secretariat, have a very active role in relation to the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union, COSAC.  We are meeting Georgians later today, and our Chairman is meeting another ambassador as well.  We have very close relations and friendships with them and regularly have negotiations and discussions.  Our committee has just returned from a meeting in London.  We attended from Sunday until last night.  We met Members of the UK Parliament and Members of the House of Lords.  That is the kind of work that is being done here regularly.  In politics, relations are vital, and direct one-to-one contact, not just phone contact, is essential.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the finding that 90% of IBEC members believe that future membership of the European Union will be important for their businesses.  That is a fact.  Some 65% of others also feel that way.  A very high percentage of people in business realise the benefit of access to that market of 475 million people once the UK leaves.<\/p> <p>  The only other problem that arises is the potential for a trade war.  That has been averted so far.<\/p><p>As the witnesses know, negotiations between the United States of America and China are under way and they will have serious repercussions for those regions.  This may, in turn, have a knock-on effect.  A trade war would be damaging to the whole world.  It is a case of back to the future.  The United States of America has a very open economy and it has been a most successful economy.  Perhaps it has not kept up pace in certain respects - for example, the changes in the field of competition.  Nevertheless, IBEC is probably monitoring this situation and international news relating to it very carefully.  The first concern was that there could be a tariffs on alcohol - bourbon and other American drinks - and that this would have repercussions for the Irish drinks industry.  That would be a most regrettable situation, so everything that can be done to avert it must be done.<\/p><p> It is very important IBEC has an office in Brussels and links all over Ireland and into Brussels, the most important place.  IBEC could mount a most successful seminar, meeting all the key players.  The witnesses should have no doubt about the impact such events have on the decision makers.  Irrespective of meetings with the Government, Ministers, Deputies, Senators and so on, having a non-governmental agency such as IBEC there representing industry is vital.<\/p><p> I say \"Well done\" to Dr. Ivory on his presentation.  There is an ongoing discussion regarding the issues raised.  IBEC has published this document already, but the presenting of it today - and the witnesses' presence has been recorded all over the House - is a very good step in the right direction.  I thank the witnesses for attending.  I have no real questions because all the answers are in this document in a very comprehensive way.  I welcome the witnesses and urge them to continue their excellent work on behalf of the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018032800002#F00300","speaker":"1393","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522242000,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Deputy Durkan, could we have a brief-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018032800002#G00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1522242000,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I am not known for my brevity but I will do my best.  Like Senator Leyden, I welcome Dr. Ivory and his colleagues to the meeting and compliment IBEC on the continuously and consistently positive role it has played in the commercial life of this country and in its relations with other European and non-European countries.  IBEC continues this role, which is a theme that runs through this report.  I take this opportunity to compliment IBEC and the business sector for the ability they have shown to identify the issues, never to be negative and to put forward suggestions in a way that makes it possible for them to be accepted by others.  I wish to go quickly through the positive reforms to which we will all contribute and the need to recognise the needs of individual member states.  The only downside of this is that if we resort to the individual preferences of all member states, it will be very difficult to find a consensus.  I emphasise that in those areas there is a tendency for member states - and the people within member states - to adopt a them-and-us attitude and, instead of taking ownership of the European project, to stand offside and consider Europe as if it is something they should criticise from without as opposed to reforming it positively, like IBEC does, from within.<\/p> <p>  I have similar concerns about the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB.  I hope it is not the thin end of the wedge to target individual member states, particularly smaller ones like Ireland.  I am concerned that, for example, an area that is recognised as the total preserve of the individual member state has now been dragged into the area of competition and state aid and is being examined by other EU Commissioners.  We know there is a report pending which will have an impact in respect of the so-called Apple tax.  Unfortunately, there seems to be a jealously of the 12.5% corporation profits tax this country has enjoyed and promoted recently - indeed, promoted for other countries.  We do not wish to restrict it to ourselves.  This is very important because the smaller countries have difficulty enough competing with their bigger brothers.  In the old days, the bilateral trade agreements always benefited the bigger countries.  That was the way it was.  A certain well-known global politician some time ago said it is a good deal when his country wins.  That does not augur so well for the trade negotiations which we hope will be positive.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Ivory's comments on the MFF are correct.  We need to keep the pillars in place that have worked well and on which we depend and not to allow ourselves to be hustled by those who might suggest to us that it is not democratic or that it does not give us all the same chance.  Each individual member state across Europe has different requirements, and that is as it should be because they are in different geographic locations.  For example, it is not so easy for us to get through the centre of Europe without taking an aircraft or a ship.  Most other European countries, with the exception of the one that is now leaving, do not have this problem at all.  It is of huge economic benefit to be able to sit into a truck and drive where one wants to drive to, even outside the Union if necessary, to Moscow and so on.  We cannot do that.  We should never allow it to be underestimated that we are an island nation which, it appears, will be located off the coast of another island that will no longer be a member of the European Union.<\/p> <p>  The final point I wish to make concerns Brexit.  I compliment IBEC's comments on this and references to it in the report.  I believe that the Irish economy has the resilience, the ability and the stability to meet the challenges ahead.  There are challenges ahead, but I believe we can meet them.  We must be cautious and careful not to take steps which might damage our competitiveness and our access to the European markets and might bring us back to a greater dependability on our next-door neighbour, notwithstanding the good relation we have with it and the need to keep that good relationship in the future.  It is of equal importance that the European Union has a relationship with the UK after Brexit that is such that it will benefit both.  If it does not, the European Union is at stake and will disappear.  If a country leaves the Union and benefits trade-wise as a result, no country worth its salt will want to remain behind, so we will all be in trouble then.<\/p> <p>  The point I am trying to make is simply that there is a lot at stake but I believe we will survive and believe that the island, North and South, which IBEC has emphasised time and again, is important.  There is a tendency to believe that by some kind of shuffle this will disappear in the latter stages.  It will not, nor could it, nor should it.  This island has benefited greatly from the peace it has enjoyed over the past 20 years or so.  It will benefit greatly in the future from the continuation of that peace.  There are those who might see an advantage for a time to draw lines not in the sand but critical lines that would impede the trade and commerce taking place now and which will continue in the future.  That would be a very dangerous and retrograde step.  In that context, we must always keep in mind where we came from.  What we have now is immeasurably better, regarding both Europe and the North-South relationship in this country, and we should strive to keep it, improve it, develop it and encourage its evolution because the alternatives, from what we have seen, are not great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018032800002#G00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1522242000,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Does Dr. Ivory wish to make any concluding remarks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018032800002#G00400","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1522242000,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Yes.  I wish to respond.  I thank the members for the very gracious comments they made about IBEC's work and our document.  We focus not only on the policy coherence and the evidence-based recommendations we make, but also on communicating those in the most effective manner to have the greatest impact on behalf of Irish business, particularly at a European level.<\/p><p>There has been a very good response to our communication documents and the evidence we put forward in the policy recommendations.  I thank the Deputy for his very gracious comments.  <\/p><p> We continue to have grave concerns about the CCCTB proposal and the action taken by the Commission in this area.  The proposal has been talked about for many years at European level.  We expressed our concerns vocally in our meetings with the European Commission last week and other fora and continue to work on the issue with our strategic business partners at a European level.  I agree with Deputy Bernard J. Durkan that our concerns are shared by other smaller member states which also believe these initiatives are to the disadvantage of member states with small domestic economies and to the advantage of member states with much larger populations and domestic markets.  We continue to voice our concerns in Brussels about the development of these proposals and our objections to their adoption in their current format.  <\/p><p> One of the key aspects of our report which I have mentioned is that taxation matters should be determined at member state level in the context of member state sovereignty.  In that regard, we are also very concerned not only about the proposal on digital taxation but also its timing.  As Senator Terry Leyden mentioned, relations between the European Union and the United States are very delicate.  In that context, we have grave concerns about the proposal on digital taxation which was issued last week by the European Commission.  In conjunction with our business partners in Europe, we have made very clear our view that issues such as digital taxation should be dealt with at a multilateral level through the OECD which has been proved, through the BEPS process, to deliver results.  That is where we believe these conversations and actions should take place.  We are very concerned that the European Union might consider taking unilateral action before that conversation has been completed at the OECD.  We believe it is worth giving proper consideration to these issues.  We recognise that the world is changing, that digitalisation is a feature of all economies and that these issues must be considered.  We need to come to a better understanding of them and IBEC is working with its partners in the business and industry advisory committee at the OECD to try to do that.  We are working to arrive at a better understanding of digitalisation, how technology, global supply chains and digital trade work.  We will be travelling to Paris in April for some detailed meetings with the OECD in that regard.<\/p><p> Senator Terry Leyden made reference to the potential for a trade war between the European Union and the United States, something about which we are very concerned.  IBEC has made submissions on it, as have our sector associations which are very concerned about any list of retaliatory products being drawn up by the European Commission.  Senator Terry Leyden specifically mentioned bourbon, but exports of Irish and European whiskey to the United States exceed, by a factor of five, European imports of bourbon from the United States.  We believe it would be a very high risk strategy to get involved in a tit for tat trade war.  We have spoken directly to the Commission about this.  I have also spoken to the officials who are putting the list together.  IBEC and its sector groups have made formal submissions to the Commission and have raised the issue at our meetings with it.  The week before last our CEO, Mr. Danny McCoy, and the executive director team of IBEC travelled to the United States for a series of meetings with strategic business partners, including the US Chamber of Commerce.  We also had a meeting with the Taoiseach when he was in Washington.  IBEC had meetings with the US Department of Commerce and the Unites States trade representative, USTR, to emphasise our particular concerns about the direction of US trade policy and to reaffirm our long-term commitment to having a strong relationship between Ireland and the USA, as well as a strong relationship between the European Union and the USA.  We have been encouraging our strategic business partners in the United States and the officials of the Administration whom we meet to try to ensure the United States will continue to take a leadership role in seeking to have open trade and investment across the world.  This is an area in which we will continue to work.  When our CEO met Mr. Wilbur Ross in the Department of Commerce, he made these very points to him and his officials.  We are pleased that a decision has been made to temporarily exempt the European Union from the measures President Trump and the White House have introduced or are about to introduce.  However, we believe the temporary nature of the exemption means that there is still significant work to be done.  We will be working closely with our colleagues at European level, as well as the European Commission, on this issue.  We will also be working with our contacts in the US Administration in Washington and New York.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018032800002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pat Ivory","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522242000,"counter":140,"content":"<p>The Irish Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, who holds the agriculture portfolio has had discussions on this issue to ensure a whiskey trade war will not happen.

I welcome this opportunity to address the select committee on the Revised Estimates for 2018 for the Department's Vote 38.  Unlike many other Votes, the health Vote is not configured along programme lines.  While the Department is working towards the development of programme budgeting, this will take some time as the financial systems in the HSE will have to be adapted to allow for this in the context of the financial reform programme currently under way.  <\/p><p>The level of funding provided in the 2018 Revised Estimates will allow the Department and the Health Service Executive, HSE, to deliver better access, more health for families and more supports for disability, mental health and older and vulnerable people.  In addition, the welcome increase in the health capital budget over the period to 2021 will allow completion of key developments such as the new children's hospital and will ensure capital investment supports our strategic initiatives and ehealth improvements.  <\/p><p>The improving economy has enabled the health service to achieve much-needed budget increases in each of the last three years.  We are very aware that there are areas where further improvements are required and the Department will continue to work with the HSE to optimise service provision within the constraints of available funding.  <\/p><p>The gross provision for the health Vote in 2017 was &euro;14.801 billion, comprising &euro;14.347 billion in current expenditure and &euro;454 million in capital expenditure, inclusive of &euro;195 million granted by means of a Supplementary Estimate.  The supplementary requirement arose due to new initiatives approved in 2017, central pay decisions, a shortfall in income and additional funding required in the State Claims Agency.  Funding was neither sought nor granted for deficits that arose in service areas which were within the management control of the HSE.<\/p><p>In framing the 2018 budget, the Oireachtas allocated &euro;15.332 billion in Exchequer funding for the health sector.  This represents an increase of &euro;492 million on the 2017 post-supplementary current expenditure budget and &euro;39 million, or 8.6%, on capital expenditure and recognises the Government's commitment to providing a health service that seeks to improve the health and well-being of the people of Ireland. <\/p><p>The issue of health funding is a major policy challenge internationally.  Despite welcome increases over recent years, the need for effective financial management remains crucial as the health service deals with a larger and older population, with more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the rising costs of health technology.  The costs associated with these service pressures will increasingly need to be managed not solely through increased Exchequer allocations but also through improved efficiencies, productivity and value from within the funding base in 2018 and beyond.<\/p><p>I would like to address the recently published Project Ireland 2040 and the Government's capital spending plans for the next ten years.  Capital funding for our health service has been agreed at &euro;10.9 billion for the next ten years, which is 165% higher when compared with the past ten years.  We now have a solid ambitious plan to build a better health service for the future through the combination of this significant capital investment programme alongside the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.  The &euro;10.9 billion funding over the next ten years provides a real long-term opportunity to improve our health services, provide modern fit-for-purpose health facilities, increase bed capacity and modernise how we deliver services through ehealth, reformed pathways of care and the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p><p>Capital investments over the coming decade will support existing Government priority projects and commitments and will enable the roll-out of new additional capacity, guided by the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the recently published health service capacity review.  <\/p><p>The strategic investment priorities for the public health sector in Project Ireland 2040 include a number of major investment projects and programmes over its lifetime, including: the new children's hospital at St. James's campus Dublin and the two children's outpatient and urgent care centres at Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown and at Tallaght hospital, Dublin.  The priorities also included the national maternity strategy developments, including the relocation of stand-alone maternity hospitals to acute hospital campus such as the move of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street to the St. Vincent's campus; national cancer strategy capital developments, including the national programme for radiation oncology at Cork, Galway and Dublin and the expansion of BreastCheck; building the new national forensic and mental health service hospital at Portrane, Dublin; the primary care centre construction programme at various locations around the country; and the replacement and refurbishment of community nursing units for older people and long-term residential care units and housing in the community for people with disabilities at various locations across the country.  In addition, the national development plan provides capital funding to implement the health service capacity review.<\/p><p>With this unprecedented capital investment in the health services we must ensure that we carefully plan and select projects.<b><\/b><\/p><p>To achieve that, we will put in place a robust method of project appraisal, assessment and selection in order to implement health strategies, including developing capacity to meet the population health needs and achieve value for money.<br\/><br\/>Along with my ministerial colleagues in the Department, I am committed to advancing a programme of both investment and reform for our health and social care services.  The recent Health Service Capacity Review provides an evidence base to determine the extent and nature of the capacity that will be required up to 2031.  It forecasts that by 2031, we will need an additional 1,000 general practitioners, GPs, and additional capacity requirements in primary care, acute hospitals and services for older persons for that period.<br\/><br\/>The Government is committed to making tangible and sustainable improvements in our health services and the Sl&aacute;intecare report, published last March, provides a framework to do that.  There is now an unprecedented level of consensus and support for the vision and strategic direction outlined in the report.  We must harness that and work with colleagues across the political spectrum and with all stakeholders to move forward on a programme of health reform.  The Government has already given its approval to move ahead with the establishment of a Sl&aacute;intecare programme office in the Department of Health.  This office will be tasked with implementing a programme of reform, as agreed by Government, arising from the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The recruitment of an executive director of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme is under way.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that many recommendations in the Sl&aacute;intecare are already policy priorities.  These include: the roll-out of our ehealth and health and well-being strategies; the development of a new GP contract and proposals for an enhanced community nursing service; further roll-out of integrated care programmes; the undertaking of a capacity review; and development of an integrated workforce planning framework.  The majority of additional funding for new health initiatives in budget 2018 has been targeted at areas identified in the Sl&aacute;intecare report such as the primary care fund, additional home care and transition beds, reduced medicine and prescription charges and targeted funding for waiting list reduction.  These actions are important first steps in a long-term reform process.<br\/><br\/>Work is under way in the Department to develop an implementation plan in response to the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  A steering group, with representation from both the Department and the Health Service Executive, HSE, has been directing this work over the past months.  Work is well advanced and the Minister, Deputy Harris, expects to bring proposals to Government shortly.  Furthermore, a memorandum will be brought to Government in the coming weeks with the general scheme for a Bill to introduce a governing board for the HSE, which is a key recommendation in Sl&aacute;intecare.<br\/><br\/>Reducing waiting times for hospital procedures is a key priority for this Government.  The HSE has been allocated &euro;12 million for scheduled care measures, &euro;10 million of which has been ring-fenced for scoliosis and Merlin Park University Hospital orthopaedic capacity and &euro;2 million for other priorities.<br\/><br\/>Waiting list figures for the end of February published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, show that 72% of inpatient day case patients and 61% of outpatients are waiting nine months or less.  There was a reduction of 1,165 patients waiting for an inpatient or day case procedure compared to the end of January 2018 and a reduction of 7,175 when compared to the numbers waiting at the end of July 2017.  That is against a background of increasing demands on our acute hospitals which, since 2000, are carrying out four times more procedures for patients aged 65 and over and twice as many in the under 65 age group.  An additional &euro;35 million has been allocated to the NTPF for commissioned patient treatment, which brings its total budget for 2018 to &euro;55 million.  It is estimated that the NTPF initiatives in 2018 will enable the provision of treatment for up to 20,000 patients on the inpatient-day case waiting list across a range of specialties and procedures.<br\/><br\/>This winter has been very difficult for our health services.  During February, there was a 7.7% increase in attendances and a 5% increase in emergency department admissions compared to February 2017.  That growth in demand is well ahead of population growth and reflects international evidence that emergency department demand is driven by more than demographic factors.  This increased demand was further exacerbated in March by the impact of Storm Emma and the associated severe weather experienced across the country since the beginning of March.<br\/><br\/>While demand for services is growing considerably, the inpatient bed capacity to meet the demand is constrained, resulting in an 11.8% increase in the number of patients waiting on trolleys, compared to February 2017.  While fully acknowledging the need for productivity improvements and reforms across the health service, the bed capacity review outlines that in order to reach international standards of bed occupancy levels, the acute hospital system needs an immediate injection of additional beds.  It is only through continued investment in capacity, in hospital staff and in reform of our health services, in line with Sl&aacute;intecare, that we will deliver better services for patients.<br\/><br\/>The Government provided an additional &euro;40 million for measures to alleviate the pressure on emergency departments during winter 2017-2018.  Timely discharge of patients is vital to ensuring that a ready supply of beds is available to those patients requiring to be admitted through emergency departments.  Delayed discharges are a major contributory factor to emergency department overcrowding and adversely affect patient flow throughout the hospital.  It is essential that, in so far as is possible, egress meets demand, and that hospital and community health care organisations, CHOs, processes support timely and safe discharge.  Accordingly, over 60% of the 2018 funding for unscheduled care access measures is being targeted towards providing additional social care supports.  These additional supports have been targeted at the hospitals with the greatest number of patients awaiting discharge home and will help improve patient flow in those hospitals, which will in turn help to relieve congestion in their emergency departments.  As of today, 189 additional beds have been opened this winter and further beds will open throughout 2018.<br\/><br\/>In the light of the recommendations of the Health Service Capacity Review and the current pressures on the hospital system, the HSE has been asked to develop a plan to identify the location and mix of beds across the hospital system which can be opened and staffed by 1 November 2018 in order to improve preparedness for winter 2018-2019 and relieve overcrowding in hospital emergency departments.  In addition, the HSE and the Department have started the process of reviewing the winter initiative 2017-2018, with a view to providing a report in late April and ensuring the learning from this year will inform the agreement and early implementation of measures for next winter.<br\/><br\/>Primary care services can provide key opportunities in the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare as it proposes the adoption of a new model of integrated care, centred on comprehensive primary and community care services.  In 2018, primary care funding of &euro;850 million will continue to build on the significant additional resources that have been invested over the past number of years in the State&rsquo;s primary care services.  For example, we have seen the extension of eligibility for GP cards to the under-sixes and the over-70s and the development of the diabetes cycle-of-care programme.<br\/><br\/>Quite significant investment has also been made in the development of primary care capacity, particularly in the therapy area, continued investment in the development of community intervention teams and enhanced community diagnostic programmes with the delivery of ultrasound and X-ray in the community.  We have also invested significantly in our primary care infrastructure providing modern, well equipped primary care centres - 114 to date - to enable patients access health care in their communities in a more integrated manner.  Capital funding of over &euro;29 million will continue to support the roll out of these centres.<br\/><br\/>The funding allocated in 2018 will continue to deliver these key services and dedicated additional funding of &euro;25 million therein will focus on disease prevention and early intervention, particularly through the further development and expansion of GP services.<br\/><br\/>In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to promoting care in the community, the Department is developing a new statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home care services.  Pending this, the Department and the HSE are continuing efforts to incrementally improve the existing services.  Home support services were a particular area of focus in budget 2018, with an additional &euro;18 million allocated.  The additional resources made available brings the total budget for the direct provision of home support services to &euro;408 million.  The HSE&rsquo;s national service plan provides for a target of 17 million home support hours to be provided to 50,500 people.<br\/><br\/>Of course, there will always be a cohort of people who require long-term residential care, and the nursing homes support scheme, NHSS, commonly known as fair deal, continues to provide financial assistance to those who need long-term nursing home care.  The aim of the scheme is to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone, and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<br\/><br\/>Mental Health remains a priority care programme for the Government.  For this reason, budget 2018 made allowance for an additional &euro;57.5 million for mental health services for 2018, inclusive of &euro;22.5 million of pay-related costs and &euro;35 million to continue to progress new initiatives.  The additional funding will help build on the work commenced in 2017 on the enhancement of community teams for children, adults, later life and mental health intellectual disability services.  It will also help to continue our move towards a full 24-7 service, with an initial focus on increasing the provision of services on a seven-days-a-week basis.  The HSE has been asked to prioritise this work in 2018 as well as develop a service response which is as seamless as possible for every service user.<br\/><br\/>Budget 2018 announced a reduction in the prescription charge and the drug payment scheme, DPS, monthly threshold.  Since 1 January, medical card holders have benefited from a 50 cent reduction in the prescription charge, from &euro;2.50 to &euro;2 per item, and the maximum monthly cost reduced by &euro;5, from &euro;25 to &euro;20.  For approved treatments under the DPS the maximum monthly payment reduced by &euro;10, from &euro;144 to &euro;134.  This will benefit all families who exceed the threshold in any month.<br\/><br\/>While we<b><\/b>have secured a significant increase in funding for the health services in recent years, I do not underestimate the challenges involved in the delivery of a safe, efficient health service for the Irish people.  Despite welcome increases in recent years, a financial challenge remains as we deal with a larger and older population, with more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the rising costs of health technology.<\/p><p>The costs of payments under the State Claims Agency are also rising, adding to the overall cost of health above the operational costs funded to meet the health demands of a growing and ageing population.  We must maintain our focus on improving the way services are organised and delivered, and on reducing costs, in order to maximise the ability of the health service to respond to growing needs.  It is essential that those managing and delivering the service demonstrate good practice by delivering the best possible health care within the limits of the resources that have been made available by Government each year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018032800002#B00400","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I will now bring in the party spokespersons on health, starting with Deputy Kelleher and continuing with Deputies O'Reilly and Kelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018032800002#D00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  As we go through the Estimates for the year, it is looking at things in a historical context to a certain extent as well as everything else and trying to learn from what has been done to date as regards funding and policy itself.  In that context, the Minister of State referred towards the end of his opening statement to primary care.  There is no doubt that a couple of related issues are being discussed at other fora currently, including the GP contract, which is a critical component of the delivery of health care.  That was also alluded to in the Sl&aacute;intecare report where we talked about the transfer of services from the hospital-centric system we have at the moment to the community by way of bolstering primary care, community diagnostics, therapy and so on.  The following is an observation as much as it is a criticism.  I think often that officialdom lives in a parallel universe when it comes to what is happening on the ground in terms of investment figures showing increases in home care packages and home help hours.  When one drills down into it, one still finds huge problems in trying to deliver the very basics in terms of home help hours.  Where a person is deemed to need home help hours to get out of bed, there may only be funding to get out of bed five days a week.  As such, the person has to stay in bed two days a week.<\/p> <p>  We have almost dehumanised our health services in some key areas.  It is not a reflection not the people at the coalface, but it seems we do not have that ability to understand in officialdom and through the system what individuals go through in their lives.  We have to look harshly at how we assess and view cuts to services or the lack of a service in the first place and the impact that has on an individual's life.  I have an 84 year old woman whose husband cannot get out of bed himself.  They need a hoisting system and all of that is in place, which she appreciates very much.  However, she is only funded six mornings a week.  On the seventh morning, every Sunday, she has to get neighbours or friends to help her get her husband out of bed.  She only wants 20 minutes.  That is an issue that has to be addressed if we are to have any meaningful change of heart in the delivery of health care in primary and community settings.  It is just an individual case but it can be extrapolated across the whole are of home care packages, home help hours, access to diagnostics, access to therapy and all of that.<\/p> <p>  When we talk about primary care, which is the Minister of State's particular area, we talk about extending eligibility for free GP care.  While I opposed it at the time, I did so on the grounds that I did not think the GP services in place would be able to cope with what would be thrown at it in the context of the roll-out of universal GP care given the demographics of both the population and of GPs.  We are at the crossroads in how we look at primary care and its delivery.  We talk about it a lot but we have not resourced and funded it accordingly.  The Minister of State refers to the availability of &euro;850 million for primary care, but when one looks at what we expect that to do from a policy and demographic perspective, the two will not match and marry very well.  We will end up with a gravely abused primary care system which is incapable of delivering in the key areas the Minister of State has identified from a policy perspective or, primarily, from the perspective of Sl&aacute;intecare.  That is chronic disease and illness, more diagnostics, retention of people in home or community care settings or step-down facilities.  That requires a great many more GPs.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the involvement of GPs in home care delivery and primary care teams and where we are with the number of GPs, the numbers who are retiring, the capacity of the primary care system in general and its funding and the tortuously slow negotiations around the GP contract, if it is even possible to say there are negotiations at all.  I am beginning to think this is just window dressing.  If negotiations are not moving between the primary actors, namely, the Department of Health and the IMO, others must intervene to push this on.  It is the central and most critical issue in terms of how we deliver care in community and primary care settings in the foreseeable future.  Obviously, we would like to see a rolling contract that is revisited on a regular basis, but we will have to get the basics right or we will end up in circumstances where no GPs are coming into the system while those who are trained and qualified are leaving.  Meanwhile, those at the other end of the scale approaching retirement age will step off because they have had enough.  We could end up with a very difficult situation in which policy refers to primary care but everybody is sent to hospital.  These are observations but they are important from the point of view of the focus on funding.<\/p> <p>  There was an RT&Eacute; report yesterday by Brian O&rsquo;Connell who visited Cork and spoke with GPs and families in Munster on the availability of psychiatric services.  The fact remains that child and adolescent mental health services in the Munster region are not what the Minister of State and I would like.  Certainly, they are not up to standard for those who depend on them.  We have situations in which GPs have no choice where a child attends who is at risk of self-harm, has suicidal ideation or has attempted suicide.  He or she must be referred to an emergency department.  If that is not done, the person is put on a waiting list.  That goes back to my original point about how we dehumanise the health system.  It causes trauma to the individual, the family and the medical professionals trying to deal with it that they cannot access any particular service.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State referred a few times in his opening statement to the number of people we require to expand the health service.  We must carry out a full root and branch manpower assessment as to what we need in our health services beyond the horizon.  We talk about training health professionals and it is seven to ten years before some are fully qualified.  It requires a great deal of long-term planning but we have not carried it out in enough areas.  We have not assessed the demographics and the demands the changing profile of the population will place on health service.  We have not determined what professionals we need to meet those demands.  That means getting involved with the training bodies and agencies to expand and enhance capacity in key areas.  We all speak, for example, about the fact that we will be older.  When one looks at investment in training in geriatric services, however, we are not crowning ourselves in glory notwithstanding the fact that we know the population will be quite elderly down the road.  That is one key area where a failure to drill down and determine what illnesses like diabetes and obesity, which are evident in the population, will mean.<\/p><p>We do not seem to have enough capacity to assess what our manpower requirements will be, not next year or the following year but in five, seven, ten or 15 years' time.  That is something that is never referred to in speeches or in policy other than it being said that we know we need additional doctors.  We have never carried out a detailed analysis.  The last time such an approach was taken was in the context of the Hanly report on consultants.  We need a detailed analysis of all grades - including physiotherapists and occupational therapists - right across the spectrum.  I urge that such an approach would be taken in the context of the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the funding of same or that the Department would independently get someone to carry out a detailed assessment of manpower requirements and then put in place the capacity to train them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018032800002#D00300","speaker":"1229","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I bid the Minister of State and his officials a good morning.  When members ask these questions, we tend to throw about 57,000 issues at the Minister, which means we tend to get very vague answers.  It is hard not to take such an approach because there are deficiencies in so many areas but if I can I will try to focus on a number of areas.  One is scoliosis.  That is something we have raised time and again.  We are not alone in that, as other Deputies, including Deputies in the Minister of State's own party have raised it.  The waiting lists are still unacceptable.  I do not think anyone would defend them.  It is not that long since the Minister was on television apologising in what I am sure was a very sincere way about it, but the waiting lists are unacceptable, in particular for those who have complex medical conditions.  The Minister had promised a detailed action plan for parents, which I suppose is just like a normal action plan but is perhaps a bit longer.  Parents have still not seen the action plan.  They are contacting me and I am sure they are contacting Deputy Kelleher and others as well to ask if we can ascertain when the detailed action plan will be ready.  When the plan is ready it could just be put with all the other detailed action plans.  What people really want to know is when the children will be treated and whether there is a plan to increase the operation of the theatre in Crumlin from three days to five.  If there is, could the Minister of State advise how many staff have been recruited to deal with that?  Given the length of the waiting lists, there is a case to be made for increasing the theatre openings to seven days a week until the crisis is over.  Could the Minister of State outline the position in terms of the recruitment of doctors, nurses and everybody else who will be needed to open the theatre for extra days?<\/p> <p>  That brings me to my next point.  Deputy Kelleher raised a similar point.  We all know that if additional beds are to be opened additional staff will be needed.  Could the Minister of State give an indication of the age profile of staff?  Doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, porters, theatre assistants and everybody else are coming into the system - I do not believe we are getting anywhere near the numbers needed - but at the other end people are leaving because in some instances the workplace is intolerable but there are also people whom we know will leave due to retirement, for example.  It is my understanding that there is not a plan in place to deal with the retirements.  Perhaps the Minister of State could point us to the section in the Estimates concerning recruitment and where the additional moneys for the additional capacity have been put aside.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has said it himself and the Minister, Deputy Harris, has definitely said that one could open a bed in the morning but it is just sitting there if one does not have the staff to care for the patient in it.  How much of the additional &euro;530 million is allocated for additional staff and potential pay increases and how much is just for standing still and maintaining the current level of services?<\/p> <p>  During Storm Emma the Minister for Health announced that &euro;5 million would be provided for additional capacity.  Could the Minister of State give us a breakdown of where the money was spent and whether money was taken from the budget for other areas and ring-fenced for that purpose?<\/p> <p>  It is hard to believe that there are negotiations, much less intense negotiations of any sort going on with general practitioners, GPs.  Can the Minister of State provide us with information on whether any discussion has taken place with regard to salaried GPs?  All of the reports in the media and from the representative organisations suggest there is a crisis in capacity in terms of GPs at the moment.  One issue identified in Sl&aacute;intecare is that we might look at salaried GPs to alleviate the crisis.  I understand that it would not be a panacea.  Could the Minister of State advise us if that has formed part of the discussions and perhaps give us an update?<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State referred to 179 beds that had been opened and that a detailed plan would be provided, perhaps on 1 November, for the opening of additional beds.  Could he give a breakdown of the staffing for those beds?  Is there recruitment in the pipeline?  One cannot just fill out a form.  It is a long process to recruit a staff member at any grade into the health service, except as it turns out, administrative staff because we saw over the weekend that they are being recruited at a rate of knots, unlike health professionals.  That is not to say administrative staff are not needed because of course they are but it strikes me as a bit odd that the recruitment of administrative staff is outstripping the recruitment of front-line health care professionals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018032800002#E00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I welcome my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and his officials here today.

I would have expected more progress with the transport support allowance, for example.

I would welcome a comment in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Does the Minister of State think the extra 4% spend could help to tackle the waiting lists which are now at 288 for an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, assessment in Marian House, Cork?

The Minister of State put a strong emphasis on what would be done to address the issue in his speech.  A boy in west Cork was diagnosed at the age of 11.  He is now 16 and he has yet to be treated five years later.  What is happening is not good enough.<\/p> <p>  What resources does the Minister of State envisage being put into rural hospitals such as Bantry General Hospital in our constituency?

The role of politicians and politics and the role we play all day every day as representatives is to attempt to humanise it.  I appreciate where the Deputy is coming from.  A lot of the figures, facts, percentages and statistics tend to mask the reality and be a protective mechanism, and appear as such to us as public representatives.  Nonetheless, that is how systems are run and analysed and metrics have to be involved but I take on board the point and I accept what the Deputy has said.  Our job is to keep humanising it and bring to the fore real examples as the Deputy did, of the 86 year old lady who is in a bed and getting help six days a week but not the seventh day.  These are real challenges for the system.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked what can we expect from the &euro;850 million funding for primary care.  He made the point that if we are to move towards primary care and go along with Sl&aacute;intecare, which we all accept is the way forward, it will be important.  If we are going to put such emphasis on primary care we will have to fund it accordingly, which will be a real challenge, and the Deputy will appreciate this from his years of observing the health system and other areas where he has served.  The challenge will be in trying to reorient a system away from the here and now, and the day to day pressures on the demand-led scheme, and trying to pull funding back and reorient it into a new system.  It takes time and it is a huge challenge, and the very best we can really hope for is that a lot of it will be done with new funding, and that as new funding comes on stream, a larger proportion of it will go into primary care and this is how we will slowly and, hopefully, substantially build the funding to run it.  We are aware of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made a point on requiring more GPs, and in my opening remarks I acknowledged that we will need up to 1,000 new GPs.  The GP contract and negotiations were mentioned by a number of members.  I understand negotiations with the IMO will recommence in the coming weeks.  They have been stalled since the end of last year.  They are due to commence with intensity and there is an expectation.  It is not for me to put a timeline on it, but I hope that by the end of the year significant progress will be made on this to substantially address the issues that are there.   There is the FEMPI issue about which the GPs are very vocal and there are a number of other issues.  The Government will make the point that in return for any additional funding new ways of doing business will be required along with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018032800002#F00100","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>The IMO has already indicated that it is not in that space and it wants to talk about the reversal of FEMPI first and then any additional services.

The Minister of State does not have to take my word for it.  It is in the newspapers.  The GP service is in crisis.  Laying down markers such as this in advance of a negotiation while, at the same time, the Minister of State states he thinks it might be finished by Christmas, is pushing it further back every time.  I apologise for the interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018032800002#F00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>The Chairman will appreciate I will not go into this type of discussion here.  I will not negotiate the GP contract across the floor with anybody or go into its details.  I have made some points on this.

I will not be leading those negotiations and neither would it be appropriate or helpful for me at this stage to start entering into such discussions at that level.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher also mentioned child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in Munster.  I am aware of the challenges, particularly in the Cork area.  One of the biggest issues we still have in mental health is recruitment, and we are blue in the face from listening to it on every Topical Issue and parliamentary question, but it is a fact.  If one always does what one always did, one always will get what one always got.  If we continue just to acknowledge that challenge and to struggle on, we will be in the same place for a long time to come.  My attitude as Minister of State with responsibility for mental health is to look at how we do what we do and look at a new way of doing it.  The future of mental health, from looking at international best practice and what is done abroad, is to look at online delivery of the service.  This is the space we need to go to.  It does not make sense for a consultant psychiatrist to leave Cork to travel to Castletownbere to see somebody given the amount of time it takes.  These are posing real challenges while we want to have a seven-day week service and availability in every area.  If we look at a model where somebody with a mental health issue can go into his or her local primary care centre where there is an interactive screen and he or she can speak to a mental health professional, whether a therapist, psychologist or psychiatrist and avail of the services online, that could be a new way to revolutionise and radically look at how we deliver online mental health services.  I have asked the HSE to trial the online delivery of mental health services and to select a primary care centre where we can start to trial this.  We need to consider this.<\/p> <p>  There is an ancillary issue, which is the management of waiting lists.  Various people manage their waiting lists in various ways.  There is huge disparity in various parts of the country where the numbers and percentages are broadly the same, such as 70% filling of posts and a certain number of people coming through, but there are various ways of managing it.  Every list must be prioritised on an immediate basis.  If someone presents with a serious mental health issue that person must be seen immediately.  I heard the report with Brian O'Connell yesterday to which the Deputy referred.  Nobody should be told he or she has to wait seven or 12 weeks.  There is supposed to be continuous prioritisation.  The consultant psychiatrist in charge of the team is supposed to look and assess.  There are various ways to do this to deliver the service.  I am aware of the issue and, ultimately, the solution will be to continue with this.  We should not, as politicians, continue to accept recruitment is a challenge.  It is a challenge, but there are ways around everything and the online space offers enormous potential.<\/p> <p>  Long-term planning for staffing is something on which a certain amount of work has been done by the HSE.  A staffing skill mix has been looked at and a review was launched recently into nursing in particular.  I also take the point that we should look at the challenges that will come from a range of illnesses that will present, such as obesity, diabetes and chronic illnesses, and not just look at particular skill sets.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly raised the issue of scoliosis and the detailed action plan.  I will have to come back to her on that.  As she knows, there was an initiative last year and an additional &euro;10 million was put into it.  A new theatre was opened in Crumlin and its capacity is to be increased this year.  It went from carrying out 220 procedures in 2016 to 321 procedures in 2017, which is a 46% increase.  It will take time to catch up.  When one launches an initiative one does not get an immediate result and return.  It takes a bit of time.  Work is ongoing and I will get the Deputy more details on the action plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018032800002#F00300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Does the figure include patients who were sent abroad or is it an increase in operations carried out in the State?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018032800002#F00400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>As I understand it, it is operations carried out at home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018032800002#F00500","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>To be very clear, because we fall out sometimes and perhaps that is because the questions are not clear, I want details on when the plan will be published and information on how, precisely, the staffing arrangements will be organised for the increase in the number of days the theatre is open.

To go back to the answer I gave to Deputy Kelleher about mental health, I believe the issues and challenges are similar across the country.  Pieta House does wonderful work but it is funded by my Department, as is any such organisation.  One of the issues I referred to a number of times is that the organisations do wonderful work but I am concerned that there is a challenge when somebody with a mental health issue in west Cork or anywhere else wonders whether he should go to Pieta House, Jigsaw, Lisheens House in my constituency, the Samaritans or ChildLine.  On one's best day, it would be a challenge.  When one has a mental health issue and is feeling down when trying to figure out where to go, it is particularly challenging.  One of the objectives I have set is to ask the Department to lead with the HSE to put in place one single telephone number that people with a mental health issue can dial.  The number would be universal.  One would be assigned to the most appropriate service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018032800002#G00300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":168,"content":"<p>The person answering the phone-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018032800002#G00400","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":169,"content":"<p>There would be a person answering the telephone who would be appropriately qualified to signpost where people should attend.

The Minister of State might follow up on what occurs in the other jurisdictions where these therapies are practised.  How are conditions triaged?  In recent years, our attitude to mental health has changed and there is not as much stigma attached to mental illness but I do not imagine that we or the Minister of State could say, hand on heart, that everybody from Bantry to Donegal is happy to talk about his or her mental health.  While I do regard the initiative as having value in taking pressure off the services, I wonder about the absence of the general practitioner.  General practitioners, who tend to have a whole-of-person approach to health care, note that if people's mental health is segregated to be dealt with by another entity, be it somebody online or a service in another jurisdiction, there is fragmentation.  We heard last week or the week before about fragmentation of services.  Having the general practitioner in the community as the anchor person for people's health care, be it physical or mental health care, has considerable value.  Is the pilot to complement existing services or to serve as an add-on, bearing in mind the increase in the diagnosis of mental health issues and the significant rate of prescription of antidepressants and such medications in Ireland at present?  We all know there are problems in the Irish health service.  I am not against the initiative but would be interested in knowing the international evidence supporting it.  How will it cascade down into the practical setting?<\/p> <p>  If general practitioners, in the first instance, and then psychiatrists are not seeing the genesis of mental illness and how it progresses in people's lives, will there be a deficit in education when it comes to health care professionals?<\/p><p>It is very hard to engage with some people when it comes to mental health.  Are we going down a road where the people most resistant to treatment will be segregated and we only sort out the people who have a willingness to engage?  I do not see how this will help that cohort of people who, whatever their personal or family circumstances, do not engage with the services.  Will the Minister of State outline that, perhaps after the meeting?  I would be very interested to hear where this is coming from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018032800002#G01300","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and the statement and information he has given to the committee.  There are two or three things that came to my attention.  I am delighted to see the move towards programme budgeting.  One of my fetishes has always been comparison with the health boards, which always had programme budgeting.  Since that finished we do not seem to be able to go anywhere with certainty.  That has been one of the intrinsic problems in the health service over recent years.  It was a woefully bad decision to move away from that.  With programme budgeting, they can assess fairly regularly where they are going in the first, second, third or fourth quarter well in advance.  It cannot be done any other way because it is too vague.<\/p> <p>  In the area of home help carers and home care packages, there is a need for some co-ordination with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The carer's allowance is the first step to deal with situations in which older people do not require institutional care or a home care package but can benefit from being looked in on by a friendly neighbour or family member.  They can have meals prepared at crucial times and can be looked in on in the morning and the late evening and so on.  Most families have done this themselves.  Modern labour force requirements do not allow that to happen to the same extent it used to.  I saw a file last week where a person caring for a person in his or her 90th year was deemed to be ineligible on the basis the person he or she was caring for was insufficiently immobile.  The presumption is that when the person tripped and fell and hit his or her head on something, he or she would become eligible.  It is then too late for that level of care and requires either hospitalisation or institutional care.  It is quite common, as the Chairman knows.  I would like some interaction between the two Departments in that area as a matter of some urgency.  It will not cost anything and it will dramatically improve the quality of life for those who need care and will relieve the pressure on the Department of Health.<\/p> <p>  Waiting times are another of my hobby horses.  There are waiting times for everything and I cannot understand it.  I will never begin to understand why we have them.  It is almost as if somebody decides to pick a time in the calendar and tell people they will deal with them then.  I do not accept it.  I think it is just as easy to tell a person he or she will be dealt with next week.  Waiting lists become longer and longer as time goes by.  It is an acute system.  We need a fairly rapid response.  If we are going to be successful we need a rapid response.  I am anxious that all areas where waiting times occur, whether as a result of a lack of theatre space, lack of adequately qualified nurses in theatre, consultants or GPs, waiting times have to stop because they go on forever.  It will have to be done.  The lists will have to be caught up with and overtaken.  The question of how to eliminate those waiting times is important.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy O'Reilly on the GP contract.  We are long enough talking about it.  We need to see some progress but not in the future.  We are talking about waiting times again.  Why do we have to wait for that?  Why not do it now and have done with it?  At least then we would have some certainty in the future.  I do not want to talk about the procedure or negotiate here but it is not helpful to have a long waiting period in which we promise this in the future.  It has been long enough promised so we should get on with it and do it soon.  Let us produce something in the very near future that will indicate we are serious or not serious about it.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Louise O'Reilly referred to recruitment and I know the Minister of State may not want to comment on it.  Somebody approached me recently about the issue and will come back to me with further information.  There are some strange things happening in recruitment.  Administrators seem to be of greater importance than the front-line staff.  That should not be.  I know we have to have administrators but the fact is we are in a crisis and we need the people on the front line dealing directly with the patients.  We need them as a matter of urgency or else we are back to long waiting lists again and it will go on forever.<\/p> <p>  I have some questions for a different time.  There are a couple of little niggling parts that I am not too sure about, for instance, the issue of medical cards.  The number of full medical cards has dropped and there has been an increase in the number of GP visit cards.  We are a bit uneasy about it.  It is not always to the benefit of the patient.  I would like some comment on it.<\/p> <p>  I try to avoid being parochial at these meetings but when everybody else does it, I think I should do it.  My local hospital in Naas is in the picture.  The endoscopy unit extension is much wanted and has been for some considerable time.  I am anxious to clear the air, get it out of there, have it approved and get on with it.  There is also an oncology unit upgrade required as well.  It is a very busy hospital in a very important location.  To drag out what is required now only reduces the confidence of the staff in the hospital.  We need to avoid that.<\/p> <p>  The shortfall in the health budget has been reducing slowly but surely over recent years.  In 2014, it was something like &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million.  Gradually it has reduced to &euro;295 million or thereabouts.  Could we be coming to the spot where we can identify almost precisely what is required?  I referred already to programme budgeting.  I presume that as we move into that area, we should be able to get dead-headed budgeting.  We should not need to be vague.  A shortfall of &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million is way off target in terms of planning in advance.  If we are going to plan for the health services in advance, we need to be more precise about the exact cost, where it will come from and where it will go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018032800002#H00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan.  Before the Minister of State answers those questions, I will put a few questions to him.  The Minister of State referred quite often in his opening statement to the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the need for health reform and the shift from secondary hospital services to primary care services.  Is there anything in the Estimates to indicate there is a start in attempting to move from the expensive secondary care services to much more practical and efficient primary care services?  Will the Minister of State point out where that is in the Estimates?<\/p> <p>  There is also reference in the Minister of State's opening statement to the expansion of eligibility for medical cards and free care to those under six and those over 70.<\/p><p>There has been an expansion in delivering medical cards to people in receipt of disability allowance.  There is now a proposal to increase eligibility for those who receive carer's allowance.  However, there is limited capacity in general practice to deliver these services.  General practice is at its maximum, yet eligibility is increasing without any recognition that there is a huge manpower crisis.  I do not expect the Minister of State to negotiate the GP contract across the floor of the committee room this morning but there is huge difficulty relating to GP manpower.  The Minister of State would have heard it at the weekend.  How can we propose to shift from secondary care to primary care if we do not have the GPs to deliver the service?  General practice is at maximum capacity and many areas are facing the possibility of not having a GP at all.  Many practices have closed their lists.  We need to move to a new model of care and the GP negotiations are critical.  They have been ongoing for two years.  The Minister of State said they are a challenge and hope to deliver a contract by the end of the year but we have been listening to that for two years.  Perhaps the Minister of State could address the accelerators to develop that contract.<\/p><p> Every part of our health service is interconnected, so if we fail to invest in primary care, naturally, people will gravitate towards secondary care.  Therefore, we have trolley queues, increasing outpatient waiting lists and increased waiting lists for inpatient elective care, so there is a connection.  Will the Minister of State outline his view on how those interconnections can be changed so that primary care can relieve the pressure on our hospital service?<\/p><p> Will the Minister of State address bed capacity?  He identified a number of capital investments in his opening statement.  One of the proposals in Project Ireland 2040 was to build three elective hospitals which would just deal with elective care and would not be overwhelmed by patients coming in through casualty departments and displacing people who are waiting for elective treatment.  It is not mentioned in the Minister of State's opening statement but it is in Project Ireland 2040.<\/p><p> Model 2 hospitals are coming under severe pressure regarding recruitment and retention, particularly for nurses and medical specialists, because they are seen as unattractive places to work.  There is a huge number of consultant vacancies - up to 400.  Many of those are in model 2 and model 3 hospitals.  Certainly University Hospital Kerry in Tralee is under severe pressure at the moment because it is losing three of its major specialists and is having difficulty recruiting.  Ennis Hospital is having difficulty in recruiting geriatricians, so there is a difficulty in recruiting people in specific areas in our health service.  Perhaps the Minister of State might address that.<\/p><p> The Estimates contain an allocation of &euro;1 million to development the Sl&aacute;intecare office and the implementation office.  Will the Minister of State refer to how this is progressing?  Regarding the funding of our hospital services, &euro;670 million comes from private health insurance.  This figure seems to be dropping because private health insurance companies are encouraging patients who come through emergency departments not to designate themselves as private patients because it will not give them any additional care.  This is leading to a reduction in the amount of money coming from insurance companies to fund our public system.  The appropriation-in-aid part of the budget is &euro;460.2 million.  Will the Minister of State let me know what this funding consists of and where it comes from?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018032800002#H00300","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Will the Chairman repeat the last question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018032800002#J00200","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Appropriation-in-aid is &euro;460.2 million.

I think she referred to the online service but when she spoke further, it was more about the phone line.  She said that it would be assumed that certainly the online delivery of any mental health therapy would done in primary care centres under the guidance of the GP.  I think she seemed to be concerned about that.  Of course, the GP would be central to a phone line but GPs face a challenge as well.  If someone presents to a GP, the GP is supposed to be an expert in every area when obviously they cannot be.  They are also expected to be up to date on the whole range of services so GPs would be central to directing people.  What I want to do is create that directory and signposting and make tools available to people regardless of whether people ring to find out the nearest available mental health support or go to their GP, who will also have immediate access to this directory and can direct people to the most appropriate means, because we do have an issue with people being referred.  Not every teenager who presents with a mental health issue, be it anxiety, stress or bullying, needs to go to CAMHS.  In some cases, they do not need to see a consultant psychiatrist.  There can be interventions at different levels, therapies, psychologists and so on.  It is about appropriateness and appropriate referrals but GPs will always remain central and will be the front door and first point of contact for people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018032800002#J00600","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I have a question about the phone number because it is very interesting.

If somebody rings up and says he or she anxiety, which I think was the example used by the Minister of State, that person would be directed to the service.  If somebody rings up and says he or she anxiety but actually that person might have something else, the person dealing with that could be an administrative person.  Is intended that this person would be a triage person or merely a telephonist?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018032800002#J00700","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Obviously, they are taking on a degree of responsibility when they are referring so they would need to have an appropriate qualification and they must be a triage person because they would have to be able to detect if it is much more serious than the person presenting says it is.  For example, has the person suicidal ideation?  The person at the other end of a phone line would need a level of qualification.  The challenge is actually making the directory of services available because a lot of these organisations are opening up and collecting money through voluntary activity.  Some of them are funded by the HSE while others are not.  We need to streamline that.  It is about creating the directory.<\/p> <p>  To answer Deputy O'Connell's concern, the GP will still be very central and the focus of all of this and will use this directory.  However, some people will choose to ring a phone line and not go to their GP, so we are trying to cover all angles.  Is it a complement or an add-on to existing services?  Again, it is both but it is mainly to complement the existing services.  Again, it is about how we do it, what we do and doing it better as opposed to continuing to do what we have always done.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked about the presentation of budgets and programme heads.  I was in the Department during the week preparing for this meeting.  Some of the officials there mentioned to me that Deputy Durkan has been very consistent in his querying and challenge to have this presentation done.  The challenge is acknowledged and recognised.  Basically, it is a case of syncing the Department's accountancy practice with the HSE.  The HSE is developing a new model of financial accountancy and presentation.  Once that is done, the Department can tie into it.  I apologise that we are still on the outdated model this year but we live in hope.  Certainly Deputy Durkan's consistency in highlighting this has been acknowledged and recognised and has been instrumental in forcing the change to come about.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan made a very interesting point about home help, carer's allowance and tying up between the two Departments.  It is something of which I am aware as a practising politician but I am not sure I was aware of it in my role in a Department as a Minister of State.  As the Deputy knows, we are trying to devise a statutory scheme to provide home care and to make sure that people can get it as a right as opposed to the current haphazard arrangement where a lot of it is down to a postal code lottery.<\/p><p>As things stand, a lot depends on waiting lists, queues etc.  We want a system similar to the fair deal scheme, where everybody is entitled to the service.  People will merely have to go through the formalities of the paperwork and they will get it.  To accomplish that, several challenges must be met.  Obviously we have to upskill the workforce and make sure it is sufficient to deliver the service.  We must also ensure that there is transparency and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018032800002#J00800","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":190,"content":"<p>The Department of Health must liaise with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.

Why are there waiting lists?  I know the point being made.  Why can we not deal with everything today or tomorrow?  It is not all about money, but money helps.  It is about how we do what we do.  We allocated an additional &euro;85 million to deal with waiting lists for this particular winter.  Some &euro;40 million was allocated to winter initiatives.  A further &euro;11.6 million was allocated directly to waiting lists, and an additional &euro;35 million was allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to source procedures outside of the State.

Yes, that is true.  However, if we are beset by waiting lists, as we have been for many years now, there has to be some reason for it.  Maybe it is a shortage of administrators.  Maybe administrators are what we need.  I do not know, but I do know that we have to overhaul our waiting lists.  Otherwise we may as well close the shop altogether and go home.  The fact of the matter is this; if we cannot identify the snags in the system and resolve them, then we are wasting money, because time is money.  The costs of running the health service will be reduced very considerably if we can identify and remove those glitches.  It goes back to the old system.  We may ask, for example, how long one has to wait for the result of an X-ray, a scan or whatever.  One should not have to wait at all.  If time is money, then we need to know the results as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  I would emphasise this point.  Some time ago, the comparison between private sector and public sector hospitals was brought to my attention.  It appears that a consultant could work a full day in the private sector uninterrupted.  If they change over to the public sector the following week, they might have a day's work, but they might not.  That might be because some part of the system is not ready.  There may be insufficient staff in the theatre, theatres may be unavailable or whatever the case may be.  All of these are serious contributory factors that make the health service less efficient, and that is what we need to address. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018032800002#K00800","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I take the Deputy's point on board, but I am not sure that there is any policy of focusing on additional administrative staff instead of front-line staff within the HSE.

I was amazed to hear New Zealanders tell me of their high regard for the Irish medical workforce.  They see it as incredibly talented and well trained, which we can be very proud of.  They had one difficulty, however; they cannot retain these workers.  They all want to go back home.  This is the issue they are experiencing on the other side of the world.  Irish professionals come for a short while, but they do not commit.  They are not willing to stay.  That includes different disciplines, including nurses, GPs, physiotherapists and everything in between.  That is the other side to this.  The New Zealanders said to me that the Irish workforce is very mobile, even in the far-off countries to which they go.  They do not necessarily settle there but they like to go for a while.  That has always been part of the Irish psyche and make-up. <\/p> <p>  Bed capacity and ambulatory care have been referred to.

I also know that groups such as Women's Aid have expressed concerns about the issue in a formal submission on the Bill.  The background to the matter is that section 60 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 introduced access to domestic violence orders for persons living together in intimate and committed relationships, replacing the provisions of the Domestic Violence Act 1996 that applied to persons living together as husband and wife.  The intention was that same-sex couples who were not civil partners would have the same access to the protections under the 1996 Act as opposite-sex unmarried couples.  The wording was taken from the definition of cohabitant in section 172 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  The term &quot;intimate and committed relationship&quot; was framed to provide a threshold to which the court must have regard in deciding whether to make an order.  While concerns raised by voluntary sector groups about the suitability of the wording were given careful consideration, it was decided to proceed with the amendment unchanged.<\/p><p>I have considered this matter further in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  I am of the view that it would not be in the interest of victims of domestic violence if perpetrators could try to avoid having orders made against them by arguing that the relationship was not committed, for example, because of their sexual activity with a third party, or because the victim of the violence had previously sought to end the relationship.  This is particularly relevant to safety orders now that section 6(1)(<i>a<\/i>) of the Bill will remove the cohabitation requirement for couples who are not married or, indeed, couples who may not be in a civil partnership.  Amendments Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, 19 and 20 provide that the term &quot;intimate and committed relationship&quot;, where it applies in the Bill, will be amended to delete the words &quot;and committed&quot;.  To ensure protection for victims of domestic violence who are or were in an intimate relationship which is no longer sexual in nature, amendment No. 2 proposes to make clear that a relationship does not cease to be an intimate relationship for the purposes of the Bill merely because it is no longer sexual in nature.  The text of the amendment is drawn from section 172(3) of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018032800002#A01400","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I support and welcome that change in the definition.

They attempt to provide a remedy for women in situations where they need an emergency barring order in the evening or late at night when the courts are closed.  Obviously, we can envisage such scenarios and we want to avoid a situation where somebody could effectively be driven out of their home in the middle of the night and have no recourse and nowhere to go.  This was discussed at length in the Seanad, and the Government said it would look at it again.  The Minister's proposal is the Government's re-examination of the matter, and I welcome that there has been some movement on it.  By deleting the section, the Minister's proposal provides for special sittings of the District Court to issue emergency or interim barring orders after hours.  We welcome that.  The point we are trying to highlight, however, is that there are practical problems associated with that.<\/p> <p>  Firstly, there is the issue of cost.  There is a call-out charge payable to judges on each occasion where there is an out-of-hours hearing, and obviously there are costs related to opening the court, staffing it, closing it afterwards, etc.  Having consulted with members of domestic violence support services, the opinion of SAFE Ireland is that actually these hearings are rarely convened, for whatever reason.  I suppose it is speculating that it is for reason of cost.  Why is it that these hearings are rarely convened or rarely happen?<\/p> <p>  Other practical issues arise around a woman's ability to make her way to an emergency court sitting in the middle of the night when she lacks child care and so on.  I appreciate the Government is trying to address these problems.  I am not sure that our answer is the right one either.  However, these issues need to be looked at.  We have obligations under the Istanbul Convention.<\/p> <p>  The worry is that the Government's proposal might make it appear that there is a provision for out-of-hours emergency barring orders, but the practical reality would be that they would be out of reach to women.  Our amendments allow for a garda to make application for an order by telephone in an emergency situation.  The woman can then appear and swear an affidavit the next day and the issue can be dealt with that way.  I do not think it is a brilliant solution, but it is an attempt to overcome that problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018032800002#B02800","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":256,"content":"<p>My amendment is quite similar.

I know where they are coming from and am familiar with the issue.  Unfortunately, it is an issue that arises from time to time and does present difficulties.  I acknowledge the Seanad amendments, particularly those in the name of Senators Ruane and Black.  I do not see how I can go along in its entirety with the point raised by the Deputies for reasons that are not only obvious but appropriate.  The section provides that on request from a garda attending a domestic violence incident, a garda of appropriate rank can authorise communicating with an on-call judge to apply for an out-of-hours barring order.  There is always an on-call judge.  That is not an issue.  Judges are rostered and are on call to expect appropriate calls for sittings and action.  My officials, in consultation with the Courts Service, the Garda and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, have examined section 10 to see what improvements and adjustments may be needed to the text.  Amendment No. 14 proposes a new section 25, as referred to by Deputy Wallace, to provide for the arrangement of the out-of-hours sitting.  The new section will apply to applications for interim barring orders, protection orders and emergency barring orders but would be limited to cases where a garda actually attended an incident.  It is broad enough to include cases where a victim of domestic violence walks into a Garda station to immediately seek assistance or to seek immediate assistance.  I am proposing that this new section, which has been drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, would replace the current section 10.  To my mind, the new section is legally clearer and will be workable on the part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service.<\/p><p>I have a problem with amendments Nos. 8 and 9.  The interests of justice demand that the court has an opportunity to assess the case fully and the demeanour of the applicant for any order on a face-to-face basis.  This is where I have a difficulty in respect of telephone calls, emails or what might be regarded as a less regular point of view.  We must remember that these applications are being made on an <i>ex parte<\/i>basis and only one side is being heard.  The respondent may not even be around and will not be on notice.  Consequently, I do not believe it appropriate or proportionate to allow for a telephone call or an email application for a barring order from anyone, given the serious consequences for the respondent and the likelihood that this person would be immediately barred from the property.  Allowing applications to be made by telephone - allowing applications that might be made in a rather casual manner where it would be really difficult to verify the identity of the applicant - would give rise to serious problems.  I also believe there could well be applications of a mischievous nature or even worse, applications of a malicious nature by parties with an involvement here.  The sections of the Bill that provide for different orders do not provide for applications for such orders to be made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Applications are to be made by the person who will be the subject matter of the order and who will ultimately benefit from the order except in certain cases where the Child and Family Agency may make an emergency application as provided for in section 12.  I have a concern that even if the amendments were to accepted, which I am not minded to do, they do not set out any criteria or threshold for a court to determine that a telephone call or electronic application would be appropriate in a particular case.  In conclusion, where there are cases in which there is an immediate risk of harm, the new section 25 proposed to be inserted by amendment No. 14, which provides for the special court sitting on an emergency basis, will resolve the fundamental issue for victims of domestic violence, which is really quick access to court and a speedy hearing all, of course, in exceptional circumstances having regard to the fact that we are dealing with an emergency application in the first instance.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018032800002#C00400","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1522224000,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I find it difficult to understand section 10 as it is drafted.

If the members of the Garda believe the husband has assaulted the wife, they should and can arrest him for a criminal offence.  That is what should happen.  I share the Minister's concerns about people being able to simply apply easily for an <i>ex parte<\/i>order to get a barring order to get somebody out of the house in the middle of the night.  Obviously, if there is any evidence of violence, the Garda should intervene and arrest the person suspected of violence but aside from that, section 10 confuses the whole issue.

This was similar, although I take Deputy O'Callaghan's point that the Garda could simply arrest the person.  However, there may not have been the level of violence that would warrant an arrest.  I am not sure.  The Minister said that anyone could ring up and it could be malicious or vexatious.  I find myself in the unusual position where I am in staunch defence of the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are not talking about just anybody ringing up.  We are talking about a call made by a garda who is on the scene, who has assessed the situation and who believes there is a requirement to remove the violent party from the home dwelling.  Rather than requiring a sitting of the District Court, we propose that such a garda be authorised to simply get the permission of the judge in the immediate situation by phone or email.  It was certainly not our intention to preclude members of the Garda from calling out to the judge if that is what they wanted to do instead.  Our intention was to ward off the idea of cost or logistics preventing the special sitting of the court referred to by the Minister.<\/p><p>Maybe we have not got the wording right and we might need to look at it again on Report Stage.

I am somewhat concerned that there might be unintended consequences detrimental to victims if an offence of breaching a domestic violence order was triable on indictment and punishable by imprisonment of up to five years.  There would be adverse consequences for the availability of these orders.  Orders granted under the Bill will be civil orders.  The threshold of proof in these cases is the balance of probabilities.  This is not as onerous a threshold as for criminal cases, where the threshold is beyond all reasonable doubt.  In addition, orders are granted in most cases in the summary jurisdiction of the District Court.  There is concern that if a breach of an order attracts a punishment of up to five years imprisonment, it could have a very distinct chilling effect in relation to the granting of orders.  Respondents would be expected to contest the cases in a more vigorous manner and in the interests of justice the courts might, in certain circumstances, be less inclined to grant the orders.  I have no doubt that this would be to the disadvantage and detriment of victims and those seeking redress.<\/p><p>These concerns were highlighted by the Law Reform Commission in its report of 2013 entitled, Aspects of Domestic Violence.  The commission expressed concern that increasing the possible punishment for breach of a domestic violence order to five years imprisonment might well lead the courts to a conclusion that <i>ex parte <\/i>orders should no longer be permissible.  Of course, if that was the case it would really undermine the efficacy of the legislation.  The Law Reform Commission pointed out in its report that the purpose of criminalising a breach of a domestic violence order is primarily to deter respondents from acting in breach of the order, and also to punish respondents who are in breach of the order.<\/p><p>Making the breach of a domestic violence order a crime does not replace other criminal offences, such as assault, or indeed the issues referred to by Deputy O'Callaghan in a discussion on an earlier amendment where he cited An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's ability to arrest a respondent for a criminal offence.  If an offence of assault or criminal damage is committed by a person acting in breach of an order, the other offence should be prosecuted as an additional charge.  I see that happening on a regular basis.<\/p><p>Criminalising the breach of a domestic violence order would not have the effect of punishing serious misconduct, such as assault causing harm.

That Bill, in the form of section 30 of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, provides for a substantial amendment of Part III of the Criminal Evidence Act of 1992.

I am pleased to have this opportunity to discuss with the committee the 2018 priorities for my Department.  I will also mention the significant programme of capital investment outlined for my Department under Project Ireland 2040 and acknowledge the hugely positive impact this will have in terms of strengthening and expanding the valuable work of my Department in supporting and promoting our national culture, heritage and language.<\/p> <p>  The responsibilities of my Department are broad and diverse and include the conservation, preservation, protection, development and presentation of Ireland's heritage and culture, the promotion of the Irish language and support of the Gaeltacht and island communities.  I propose to address the issues arising across my Department's Vote on a programme by programme basis.  In the first instance, I will provide a broad outline of the overall position.<\/p> <p>  A gross provision of slightly less than &euro;303 million is available to my Department in 2018.  An additional &euro;700,000 in funding has been carried over from the 2017 capital provision for expenditure on priority projects in accordance with the provisions of public financial procedures.  In broad terms, the 2018 breakdown of allocations to my Vote is as follows: &euro;167.3 million for arts, culture and film, including &euro;68.2 million for the Arts Council; &euro;45.3 million for the national cultural institutions; &euro;18 million for the Irish Film Board; &euro;10.4 million for cultural infrastructure and development and a dedicated funding stream of &euro;6 million for Creative Ireland, the Government&rsquo;s legacy project for Ireland 2016; more than &euro;47.1 million for the conservation and protection of Ireland's built and natural heritage, including almost &euro;12 million for natural heritage; slightly less than &euro;6.4 million for the Heritage Council and slightly more than &euro;5 million for built heritage, including the successful built heritage investment scheme; &euro;48.6 million for the Irish language, Gaeltacht and islands; and slightly less than &euro;40 million for North-South co-operation, including support for two North-South implementation bodies, namely, Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga.<\/p> <p>  The gross allocation for my Department in 2018 is more than 5% higher than the comparable figure for 2017 as per the further Revised Estimates for 2017 which took account of the transfer of the regional and rural functions and associated allocations to the Department of Rural and Community Development.<\/p> <p>  The 2018 provision allows for increases in funding across a range of bodies under my Department's remit, as well as increases in funding for a number of arts, heritage and Gaeltacht schemes.  This additional funding is targeted at key initiatives, including an additional &euro;3 million for the Arts Council, a 5% increase in its annual budget; an additional &euro;1.5 million for the Irish Film Board, representing a 9% increase in its annual allocation; boosts in funding for all of the national cultural institutions; dedicated funding of &euro;6 million for the implementation of the Creative Ireland programme; additional funding for a further round of the very successful arts and culture capital scheme in 2018; an additional &euro;1.5 million for heritage, including measures to support biodiversity; an extra &euro;2.5 million for the Irish language, Gaeltacht and the islands; and an extra &euro;1 million for Waterways Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The significance of Project Ireland 2040, the national planning framework and associated national development plan launched by the Taoiseach in Sligo cannot be overstated in the case of my Department.  For the first time ever, the value and importance of our culture, language and heritage are fully recognised and given equal standing with economic targets and essential infrastructure such as roads, schools and hospitals.  The national development plan has allocated an unprecedented &euro;1 billion for capital investment in our culture and heritage over the next ten years.  This is in addition to an investment of &euro;178 million in the Irish language and in supporting and sustaining our unique Gaeltacht and island communities.  The scale of this investment will be transformative, allowing us to renew and redevelop our national cultural Institutions, enhance the cultural offering in theatres and other cultural facilities throughout the country, digitise the national collections and support Galway 2020 European Capital of Culture.<\/p> <p>  Our creativity and culture investment programme will deliver on the objectives of Creative Ireland, both in terms of enhancing our cultural infrastructure and making significant investments in expanding our creative industries.  A particular focus for this investment will be in the audiovisual sector.<\/p> <p>  Our national heritage was specifically identified in Project Ireland 2040 as essential for enhancing the liveability of our communities and creating opportunities for tourism.  Under the plan, my Department will invest in our built heritage to ensure that the historical cores of our cities, towns and villages are protected and regenerated.  I also intend to significantly ramp up investment in our inland waterways, including in the restoration of the Ulster Canal.<\/p> <p>  The value of our natural heritage should not be underestimated either.  Over the next ten years, my Department will develop and implement a major new investment programme for our national parks and nature reserves.  These invaluable natural assets teach us the value of our natural heritage, as well as being hubs for outdoor activities and tourism.  In 2017 alone, 4 million visitors visited our six national parks at Wicklow, Killarney, the Burren, Connemara, Ballycroy and Glenveagh.<\/p> <p>  We also need to protect our natural environment.  The plan will provide for the implementation of the national biodiversity plan, protecting our unique landscapes, peatlands and biodiversity for future generations.<\/p><p>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, and I shall both make brief remarks on individual programme areas.  We are happy to later expand on any matter that members wish to raise.<\/p><p> I shall commence with some details, with the permission of the Chair, on the culture programme.  A sum of &euro;167 million will be provided for arts, culture and film in 2018.  As members will know, the Creative Ireland programme is the Government's legacy project for Ireland.  Creative Ireland aims to harness the goodwill, engagement and momentum created by the Ireland 2016 programme and places creativity at the centre of public policy.  2017 was year 1 of a five-year initiative, which has already yielded positive results in both rural and urban communities with more people engaging with creativity than ever before.  The increased funding allocation for 2018 will build on the momentum by further developing the programme as well as providing increased funding to key institutions, agencies and initiatives that deliver arts, creativity and culture across the country.<\/p><p> The 2018 allocation for my Department's Vote includes boosts in funding for all of the national cultural institutions.  The combined total allocation for 2017 was in excess of &euro;45 million.  The Arts Council will receive an additional &euro;3 million this year to enhance its support to artists and arts organisations of all sizes throughout the country.  The Irish Film Board will receive an additional &euro;1.5 million to build on its vital work in supporting Irish film, television, drama, documentary and animation.  The work of the board is key to the successful roll out of Pillar 4 of the Creative Ireland programme, which focuses on fostering Ireland's potential as a centre of excellence in media production.<\/p><p> Increasing access to arts, culture and creativity is the driving force of the Creative Ireland programme.  A sum of &euro;1 million has been allocated to accelerate the Creative Children initiative under Pillar 1 of the programme.  The funding will be matched by a further &euro;1 million from the Department of Education and Skills.  The programme will be delivered in partnership with the Arts Council.  Similarly, the Department's funding to local authorities in 2018, to support and build on the work of the local Creative Ireland culture teams, has been doubled with a view to harnessing the energy of Pillar 2, entitled Enabling Creativity in Every Community, which saw 750 events take place across Ireland in 2017.<\/p><p> Culture Ireland will receive an extra &euro;500,000 this year thus enabling an enhanced culture programme to be presented across Great Britain in 2018.  The initiative will build on the unique cultural relationship between the two countries and expand the reach of Irish culture to new audiences.  It will also build on Pillar 5 of the Creative Ireland programme, which hinges on extending our cultural footprint globally and highlighting our culture as a unique national strength.<\/p><p> The Creative Ireland programme is the implementation vehicle for a wider, all-of-Government policy on culture in Ireland.  It also links to the heritage, Gaeltacht and Irish language sectors, which all enjoy increased funding for 2018.<\/p><p> Funding of over &euro;47 million has been made available for my Department's heritage programme for this year.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018032800002#B00400","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522240200,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister to delay discussing the heritage section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018032800002#C00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1522240200,"counter":397,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018032800002#C00300","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1522240200,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I wish to give members the opportunity to ask the Minister questions about subhead A.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018032800002#C00400","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1522240200,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I wish to make an observation about the Creative Ireland programme.

The Irish Film Board stated that it would be interested in constituting a film forum which could look at the issues concerning the industry and that it hopes to fix it.  Is it the Minister's view that it should constitute a film forum on this?  We also discussed the issue of the craft sector of that industry and having somebody nominated to the film board, which would be very useful.  If the Minister could nominate somebody from the craft sector, it would mean that that element of the film industry would be represented within the Irish Film Board and therefore would be able to get involved.<\/p> <p>  The Gate Theatre report has been published, looking at some of the difficulties that happened there.  I request that the Minister looks at a similar report within the film industry, or at least a survey of experience among workers in the film industry on how they have experienced their working environments, and also of the production companies and managers too.  It is very important that their experience of the industry there is understood too.

They are having trouble both costing and paying for it.  Some festivals that have run for 50 years or more are now dying away because the cost of insurance is so high.  We have wonderful events such as the Patrick O'Keeffe Traditional Music Festival in Castleisland in November, the World Fiddle Day in Scartaglin, the traditional 15 August fair in Kenmare and Sneem.  Everyone can speak for his or her own place, but right around County Kerry festivals and local communities are having massive difficulty in sourcing insurance.  If the Minister could help in some way to promote these festivals and to retain our culture, it would be greatly appreciated.  Many small villages and towns now have lost many of their shops.  Some may have a post office and some may not.  Festivals are often the only way the identity of these towns can be retained, whether it is Maurice O'Keeffe Festival in Kiskeam or the Con Curtin Festival in Brosna.  They are having a massive problem in keeping these things going, and we need to assist them to promote their events in the first place and to help with the insurance.  If we lose these local events, we most likely will lose our identity, and local identity is very important.  It is incumbent on me to stress the need to help these communities which do so much good voluntary work on their own.  They have run up against a block wall now in terms of the cost of insurance.  I am asking the Minister to help these communities to help themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018032800002#E01800","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1522240200,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I agree that all local communities, including in Kerry, have access to funding for festivals and creative events.  My Department only has a small amount of money available, approximately &euro;50,000, and so the local authorities are best placed to look after any funding for events.  We have increased our funding to local authorities to &euro;3 million this year, which works out at around &euro;96,000 per local authority, and this represents an increase of approximately &euro;1 million from 2017.  We also fund local arts infrastructure as well.  If the Deputy knows of anyone specific who wishes to apply to the local authority for the events he is describing in Kerry, they can do that via the local authority.

I am involved in a festival committee myself, as most of us here are.  I call Ballydehob the festival capital of Ireland.  There seems to be a festival there most weekends.  They are struggling, like many other towns through west Cork, because the festivals cannot keep going back to struggling businesses to ask for funding.  Many are going out of business in very rural parts of Ireland, or else they are paying high rates and cannot afford it.  The voluntary groups who organise festivals end up paying large sums on accounts and for insurance.  If a festival wants to have any chance of getting funding, it has to tick all those boxes, and I know some groups are paying &euro;2,500 or &euro;3,000 in insurance alone, before any claims, to keep the boat on the shore.<\/p><p> I will raise something which Deputy Healy-Rae mentioned and the Minister tried to cover in her answer.  It is a little parochial but the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is co-funding with Cork County Council a hugely successful visual arts degree which the Dublin Institute of Technology delivers on Sherkin Island in west Cork.  Over the years, it has been a major boost, not only to Sherkin Island but also Baltimore, Union Hall, Glandore, Leap, Skibbereen and all the surrounding area where students and families can fill local establishments off-season.  The Department has kept its commitment, and while I am not being critical of the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, and it is super to deliver it on an island where there is little activity off-season, for some reason the local authority is dithering over its &euro;20,000 commitment.  The Department has funding of &euro;167.3 million for arts and culture and &euro;48.6 million for the islands, which we will discuss more with the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh.  Sherkin Island cannot afford to lose this course.  The Department has been the main pillar in this, and I am asking now that it be the main building because if the local authority continues dithering the way it is, the course will be dead in the ground.  The local authority was supposed to come before the joint committee some weeks ago, but unfortunately the meeting could not go ahead because of the snow.  I hope it will be rescheduled in the near future, but I am asking the Minister and the Minister of State to look to their Department to see if it can be the main funder.  I understand that they will be unable to give me an answer now, but it cannot go on like this.  They are looking for a commitment that was given by the local authority, which unfortunately was given verbally, although there are witnesses who can prove it.

It also protects the river basin from pollution and over development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018032800002#G02400","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1522240200,"counter":524,"content":"<p>I suppose we own the land-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018032800002#G02500","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1522240200,"counter":525,"content":"<p>Obviously, the country brings in a law to the effect that development cannot happen in a particular river basin, etc.  It then buys the land and creates a park.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018032800002#G02600","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1522240200,"counter":526,"content":"<p>The Chairman wants to take over private land or farmers' land along rivers.

If members are aware of anybody doing it, please let us know.<\/p> <p>  There have been significant efforts by the State to resolve the issue of the protection of the bogs within the framework of the EU habitats directive, which is the law that covers this area.  There has been a long-term compensation scheme in place to compensate active turf cutters for the loss arising from the cessation of turf cutting and we have seen the numbers fall over a number of years.  Obviously, some of the habitat is protected, particularly the raised bog, and some of it has been lost over the last 20 years.  It is a very nuanced and delicate balance to strike.  On the one hand, we wish to protect the land and, on the other, we wish to ensure that turf cutters have a livelihood whereby they can do it without affecting the natural habitat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018032800002#H01000","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1522240200,"counter":549,"content":"<p>First, I wish to raise our national parks and especially Killarney National Park.  It is a valuable attraction along with Muckross House and Killarney House.  They are already massive tourist attractions but we must maintain the momentum.  However, that momentum is being challenged by the rhododendron and massive numbers of deer.  I understand there is a small amount of culling taking place at present, but the deer are affecting the trees and vegetation.  They are also a danger to people driving their cars on the road.  They are running amuck, especially in the Killarney park.  Sadly, they have caused loss of life for some people.  It is a serious issue that must be addressed.  With regard to the rhododendron, I believe we are losing the battle to eradicate this scourge.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned creating and protecting employment in the national parks.  The number of staff in Killarney National Park has been greatly reduced in recent years.  I ask the Minister to consider increasing the number of staff for a number of reasons, including maintaining the park in the way it should be maintained.  It was given to the State a number of years ago.  At 26,000 acres, it is a very valuable property.  It is the jewel in the tourism product of Kerry.  For that reason, I am asking the Minister to provide more staff for Killarney National Park, Killarney House and Muckross House.  In addition, the number of paths in the park must be increased and they must be enhanced.  Many more people are cycling and walking in the park so we must improve those areas to ensure their safety.  That cannot be done without increased funding.  I ask the Minister to ensure that funding is sourced and protected to do as I ask so the momentum of the park into the future is protected.  Pat Dawson and his team are doing tremendous work, but they can only do so much.  They could do a great deal more if they had more staff.  Given the Minister's reference to creating and protecting employment, more staff are needed in Killarney National Park.  When the economic crisis hit the country it hit the park as well, and the number of staff went down.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the park gets more staff.<\/p> <p>  The Minister also spoke about turf cutting.  That is something close to my heart because my grandmother and grandfather - and my father when he started out - survived by selling turf.  We continue to cut our own turf, as many people in Kerry do from Gneevgullia, Kilcummin and Scartaglin back through Kilgarvan, Cahersiveen and all around.  It is mentioned in the 2040 plan that turf cutting will be ended by 2030.  Many people will be affected if the Government thinks it will be able to bring an end to cutting and burning turf at that stage.  One Deputy in the Chamber said that people would be better off financially if they left the turf in the bog.  Many people would be very cold if they left the turf in the bog because they have traditionally used it to heat their houses.  Other people can afford oil and other fuels but many of those I represent cannot.<\/p><p>It will be serious and there will be repercussions not only in Kerry, but throughout the whole country if the Department tries to implement it at that stage.<\/p><p> Our national park is of vital importance to the tourism product of Killarney.  We are grateful for what has taken place in recent years with the opening of Killarney House and so on.  Indeed, my father worked hard to ensure that funding was put in place to enable the House to be reopened.  In 2010, he ensured that the project was included in the investment programme for 2011 when he had sway with Government.  He had fought for it for several years.  We are glad the project is going ahead and progressing and I thank the Minister for that but, again, I urge the Minister not to forget Killarney National Park.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018032800002#H01100","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522240200,"counter":551,"content":"<p>The Deputy has asked several questions so I might take them backwards.  If I omit a response to a question, please remind me.<\/p> <p>  I already touched on turf cutting in answer to the Chairman's question.  We have no intention of ending the traditional right of someone to cut turf for domestic use, but obviously this must be balanced in any particular area with regard to the EU habitats directive.  This is addressed on a case-by-case basis.  Deputies may raise the issue with me again in respect of any specific case.  We are aware of the tradition of turf cutting and the need to balance it with conservation challenges.<\/p> <p>  In 2017, we spent approximately &euro;2 million on Killarney National Park.  We opened Killarney House in 2017 and that project cost &euro;7 million.  It was a long awaited development.  We have spent approximately &euro;275,000 on the gardens since they opened.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the rhododendron.  We have spent approximately &euro;1 million on clearance since 2011, including &euro;200,000 in 2016 and &euro;300,000 in 2017.  Right now, we are trying to operate a programme because it can be a total scourge.  A strategic rhododendron management plan is being prepared.  The Department has issued a tender to invite suitably qualified vendors for the term of four years to examine the matter.  As the Deputy said, we want to ensure that Killarney National Park is a place where people can go to visit.  It is difficult, costly and labour intensive to control the rhododendron but it is something of which we are aware.<\/p> <p>  A programme of works composed of four elements is under way.  There is initial clearance and follow-up maintenance work by contractors.  There is ongoing maintenance work by volunteers and students.  There is a rhododendron eradication management contract.  There is ongoing work by national parks staff, including co-ordination, research and monitoring.  I note what the Deputy said about seeking an increase in staffing.  We are coming through difficult times, as Deputies are aware, but I hope that as our finances improve there might be scope to increase the staffing.<\/p> <p>  A total of &euro;12 million in funding has been allocated for the national parks in 2018.  This includes funding for each of the six national parks and others activities.  I do not have a specific breakdown as yet for Killarney National Park, as I have not had my sectoral launch yet.  I hope to arrange that and I will let the Deputy know the details.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned Muckross House.  Right now we are investing &euro;400,000 in conjunction with the trustees of Muckross House to upgrade the servants' dining area.  That should be positive.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the deer.  I responded to a Topical Issue matter on this in the D&aacute;il not long ago.  Again, there is a balance between culling deer and trying not to slaughter deer unnecessarily, for want of a better expression.  I understand an issue was raised on Kerry radio this morning about some deer swimming to Innisfallen Island.  A total of 22 deer were culled this morning to ensure that we keep the herd at a level that is manageable.<\/p> <p>  There is scope for people to hold a licence under section 42 of the Wildlife Act to cull deer where necessary outside the annual open season.  In the case of deer on private property, landowners may apply to the Department for permission to cull.  Again, we want to protect them but we also want to ensure they do not cause issues or safety concerns for the people living in the area.  The Deputy had raised an important issue in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018032800002#J00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1522240200,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I wish to comment on the bogs because the issue is prevalent in my constituency.  I thank the officials in the Department for the work they have been doing with turf cutters and their representatives in trying to find solutions to the issues.  There is a good working arrangement now between the Department and turf cutters throughout the country.  We have reached the stage where there is a good understanding of what the Department needs to do and what turf cutters want, especially those who are cutting turf for domestic use.  My engagements with the Department have been positive.  I hope we can finalise all outstanding issues in the not-too-distant future to ensure everyone is working together.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the fact that Coole Park in Gort has been included in the national development plan as one of the sites that will get investment from the Department.  I wish to mention another place, and I am being complimentary in the sense that the Department purchased some land in what is known as Cnoc Meadha beside where I am based.  I compliment the Department on its visionary approach to these issues.  The amounts of money involved are not substantial but what happens when we spend small amounts of money in such areas is that we create a tourism product that is unique.  We are probably developing assets whose potential we do not know.  They can realise considerable tourism potential in places where we do not have a tourism brand yet.  When we launch a tourism brand for the midlands, east and north, we will have products available to showcase it.  I compliment the Department in this regard.  If the Department is considering such projects, one message I wish to relay is that we do not need millions or billions.  We only need some seed money because local communities are enthusiastic about buying in as can be seen in the case of Cnoc Meadha.<\/p> <p>  There is general collaboration between F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Office of Public Works and the Department in the promotion of these areas where there are fantastic opportunities for tourism.  We underestimate the fact that we have these natural amenities.  We simply need to protect and enhance them.  That is important throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  We are not on the Wild Atlantic Way although some of what we are doing is in the wild Atlantic region.  It is important that we brand our products in Ireland and that we create different offerings for tourism.  It does not necessarily all need to be down in Kerry or up in Donegal; some of it can be in the midlands or off the beaten track where there are hidden gems.  We simply need to promote them.  I hope the OPW, the Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland will continue to work together to promote the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018032800002#J00300","speaker":"1260"},{"type":"speech","time":1522240200,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I apologise for my missing the start of the meeting due to a prior engagement.

While it ran into some planning difficulties in Carlow and the southern tip of Kildare, a significant part of it has planning permission.  We are anxious to see this developed.

We are going to deliver a prioritised infrastructure and maintenance programme focused on areas of greatest use and benefit to ensure 90% of navigable waterways are open to navigation from mid-March to October.  We will continue to promote the existing blueway products on the River Shannon and the Shannon-Erne Waterway, as well as establishing new ones on the Royal Canal, Lough Erne and the Lower Bann.  We also want to deliver two recreational activity hubs.  We are going to continue to work with partners to provide water recreation programmes such as the Blueway 10K, Get Going, Get Rowing, Active Schools, Paddles Up and the open water swimming Couch to 5K to ensure more than 1,000 people learn a new water sport in 2018.  We will host the 2018 world canals conference in Athlone in September.  This usually attracts over 400 delegates, including international visitors and professionals.  We hope to successfully deliver year two of the 22 km greenway development along the Ulster Canal from Smithborough in County Monaghan to Middletown in County Armagh.  The inland waterways are not just an engineering marvel, but an amenity within our national tourism offering.  I intend to ramp up investment including the restoration of the Ulster Canal.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Deputy's comment on the national development plan and the biodiversity plan.  This will help us implement the biodiversity plan in a way we were not able to do heretofore.  The plan covers the period 2017 to 2021.  It demonstrates our commitment to meeting our obligations to protect the diversity for the benefit of future generations through targeted strategies and actions.  There are approximately 119 actions in the plan that we want to implement.  It is important that we do so.  There are several projects, such as that at Killarney House to which Deputy Danny Healy-Rae mentioned, as well as other implementations relating to landscapes, habitats, flora and fauna, along with telling the story of man's interaction over the years.<\/p> <p>  The built heritage investment scheme and structures at risk fund are important.  There were 412 projects in 2017 and the priority is job creation.  In 2018, &euro;2 million funding will be allocated.  The deadline for applications being accepted by local authorities for these schemes was 31 January.  It is important in terms of assisting with the repair and conservation of structures which are protected under the Planning and Development Acts.  The built heritage investment scheme leverages private capital for investment in a significant number of labour-intensive scale conservation projects.  The structures at risk fund encourages the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties, as well as helping secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost in private and public ownership.  Up to &euro;1.324 million is allocated to the fund for 2018.  Private investment is usually 50-50, with four to five projects per county.  The quality and scale of these projects is important.  A good heritage officer in a county council helps with this too.  It is important these schemes are availed of because they feed into the wider benefit of the community as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018032800002#K00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1522240200,"counter":556,"content":"<p>B'fh&eacute;idir go leanfaimid ar aghaidh go dt&iacute; sub-head C.

I represent eight of them in my own constituency in Cork South-West.  In fairness, when the Minister of State's name is mentioned there is always a positive response.  As the old saying in west Cork goes, call a spade a spade and be straight with a person.  Having attended the AGMs of various groups on some of those islands, the one issue that keeps coming up is the falling population on the islands.  The question is when a council house was last built on an island.  Is funding being made available to islands to turn this around?  Many families would not have the finances to build a house but they are not being assisted by the local authority because the local authority says that it is not getting the funding to turn it around.  I mentioned the eight islands.  There is Dursey Island; Bere Island, which is a strong island and could take social or council housing; Whiddy Island; Long Island; Sherkin Island; Heir Island; Garnish Island; and Cape Clear.  Some of these are very active islands but their populations are falling.  Every set of statistics which is made available shows that clear trend.  There has not been a focus, however, on building council houses on islands.  That needs to turn around if we are not going to see the demise of islands.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is the Leader funding.  That is an issue on the mainland as well as on the islands, but the islands will survive too and they are looking for Leader funding.  The way in which Leader funding changed was a farce.  It was basically destroyed.  There are similar issues on the mainland, as I have said.  Committee groups are looking for Leader funding, but islands are also looking for it and are finding it difficult to access the funding, which was freely available before. <\/p> <p>  Another issue which is close to my heart, but about which the Minister of State might not be able to do much, is the famous Fastnet Rock, which is an icon around the world.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights has decided that it wants to tamper with it by dimming the light on Fastnet Rock.  It would take the range of the beam down from 28 nautical miles down to 17 nautical miles.  I take a very dim view of that decision, as does the local community.  It is our heritage and our culture.  People have told me that for hundreds of years it was the last light people saw when they left Ireland.  The next light was the Statue of Liberty.  Any movement by the Commissioners of Irish lights towards dimming this light is a backward decision.  I cannot understand it.  I know it has it nicely polished and is saying that there will be no visible difference to the structure of the building itself but it has been an iconic structure.  It is just a few stone's throws away from my own house in west Cork.  It is the wrong decision.  I know the Minister of State cannot intervene personally, but if he could it would be great.  I think it is good for me to highlight this issue and the upset which people have expressed on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018032800002#O00800","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1522240200,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Deputy's thoughts on the islands.  We have issues around depopulation on some of our islands.  I have responsibility for the populated islands.  I am very aware of the potential on the likes of Bere Island and Sherkin Island.  Particularly in respect of Bere Island we have to look at the military heritage.  There is great leadership there in the likes of John Walsh.  There are comharchumainn right through Sherkin Island.  I was speaking to `the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, today and he is looking at attending that AGM if it suits him.  I asked him to check his diary.  Maybe we can meet up with the comharchumann down there.  There are so many other things at play with regard to responsibility for the islands.  For example the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine had a special allocation of pillar 1 money for the islands.  It looked at the islands on their own.  That was a good thing.  There are a number of issues and challenges.  We have responsibility for the populated islands.  The Deputy may have ideas for ways to maintain the current population and to get more people back.<\/p> <p>  Arranmore got an allocation from the Department of Rural and Community Development for a digital hub.  That had a great positive knock-on effect.  In fact, one person who had been living in Scotland was thinking about moving back and bringing their business back if the broadband was available.  The islands are a big focus of the national development plan, as they should be.  I have no problem putting on the record that we should be discriminate when we look at rolling out the national broadband plan.  We have a tendency in Ireland to work from core to periphery.  We have an opportunity here to start from the most peripheral isolated areas and to work back.  That is a very black and white suggestion which probably requires a much more complex answer.  Regardless of who gets the broadband contract, I have always said that we should look at the more vulnerable places when it is being rolled out.  No doubt I will have the Deputy's support in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018032800002#O00900","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1522240200,"counter":603,"content":"<p>Does the Minister of State have any comment on Fastnet Rock?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018032800002#O01000","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1522240200,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I do not think it is a populated island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018032800002#O01100","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1522240200,"counter":605,"content":"<p>It is still off our shore, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018032800002#O01200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1522240200,"counter":606,"content":"<p>My only observation is that my experiences of the Commissioners of Irish Lights have been positive.

The overall allocation for Waterways Ireland for 2018 is increased by over &euro;1 million to just over &euro;24 million.  More than 90% of the waterways remained open during the 2017 boating season.

Waterways Ireland receives &euro;24 million for 2018, which it should, but Foras na Gaeilge has funding of &euro;13 million, which is considerably less.  As such, the Irish language is the poor relation.  I guarantee that if one asked anyone on Grafton Street whether Waterways Ireland, which covers some canals and waterways, or Foras na Gaeilge received more, they would all say it was the latter which received a higher investment.  However, that is not the case.  I made the point to Deputy McHugh but I note it to Deputy Madigan also.  Foras na Gaeilge is in trouble having regard to its funding because it is locked into a funding mechanism with the North, which has no Executive at present.  It might be a way around that problem to take some of its responsibilities away from Foras na Gaeilge and fund them through other mechanisms.  That would leave Foras na Gaeilge with its total funding intact but with fewer responsibilities to fund.  Each one of its funding responsibilities would thereby have its funding increased.  It might just be a work-around while the current system is in lockdown and the Minister might consider that suggestion.<\/p> <p>  Blueways are a great initiative and we are very fond of them.  However, there are lots of rivers, such as the Boyne, which do not currently have blueways but which would benefit massively from them.

That said and while it is a disadvantage that we cannot meet with our colleagues on a formal basis, there is engagement between the finance Departments North and South.
