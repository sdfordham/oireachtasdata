There is work on-going with the HSE HR partners and the National Recruitment Service to attract and retain staff within mental health services. <\/p>  <p>  The CHOs are continuing to recruit across all staff categories in accordance with the Pay and Numbers strategy and are actively pursuing the conversion of agency staff to improve cost effectiveness and workforce continuity.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Consultant Psychiatrists within the CAMHS speciality have proven problematic to recruit and retain, particularly in some CHO areas, and while recruitment efforts have been on-going it must be acknowledged there is a serious shortage of suitably qualified CAMHS Consultants at both national and European level.<\/p>  <p>  Psychiatric Nurse numbers have been affected by the age profile of the grade, with a large number of retirements in recent years. To combat this, agreement was reached at the Workplace Relations Commission in August 2016 which provided for 130 extra student places per annum.\u00a0 Around 32 extra places have been provided for post-graduate students who wish to transfer from general or intellectual nursing disability to mental health. In addition it was agreed that retired staff nurses who returned to service would be able to do so up to the Long Service Increment point of the Scale.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE continue to target relevant events, for example an international CAMHS Medical Conference in Geneva in late 2017 in which they hosted a stand in the convention centre. Further to this, the CHOs are also exploring the use of technology and Skype to communicate directly with prospective international candidates for screening and interview and to make the system more responsive\u00a0 and to reduce costs.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, the HSE is working to provide the best possible service within available staffing resources.\u00a0 A key focus is on managing clinical risks and prioritising referrals accordingly.\u00a0 Mental health services, including CAMHS, will continue to deliver on a number of service improvements to increase productivity and efficiencies. A key approach to developing services for young people, and thereby reducing pressures on CAMHS, is the decision by Government to increase access to counselling services in Primary Care, with the appointment of 114 Assistant Psychologists and 20 Psychologists.

A full review and assessment of the service provision for the entire county was undertaken in terms of quality, risk, safety, population, activity levels and viability before these changes were made.<\/p>  <p>  Previous service provision at the Edenderry and Birr satellite sites was limited and available on a part-time basis only. At all other times patients would have appointments facilitated for them at their nearest full-time MIDOC treatment centre. <\/p>  <p>  It was also not possible for the doctors in the Edenderry or Birr sites to provide home visits to patients.  Following the reorganisation of County Offaly MIDOC services it is now possible to provide call outs and home visits to patients where clinically indicated.<\/p>  <p>  A review of current monthly activity levels indicates that Tullamore will be more than capable of absorbing the patients from Birr and Edenderry centres.  An additional doctor has been placed on duty in Tullamore during weekends and public holidays from 12pm to 8pm.  This will facilitate the more effective management of call outs to the entire county, including Birr and Edenderry.  Additional administration support will also be provided to free up doctors' time, resulting in more patient contact and a more effective out-of-hours service for all.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to reassure the Deputy that there has been no reduction in funding or total GP clinical time allocated to the MIDOC service. As the Deputy will be aware, local HSE management met with public representatives from Birr and Edenderry on 17 April to discuss the reorganisation of MIDOC services. At this meeting the HSE accepted the need for improved public communication around such service changes in future. The HSE also agreed to request a meeting between public representatives and MIDOC. This request has been submitted to MIDOC and is currently being considered. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900044#WRA04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres Data","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900044#WRA04300"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[17109\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900044#WRA04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the range of health services that are available in the Kilcock primary health care facility; the number of general practitioners that are due to or that have commenced practice in this centre; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1323","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":46,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900044#WRA04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Groups","counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900044#WRA04600"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[17114\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900044#WRA04700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the options appraisal in respect of the future acute hospital needs in County Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":49,"content":"<p>I gave approval to the Saolta Group to conduct an options appraisal in respect of future acute hospital needs in Galway.

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard laboratory approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and has been agreed by experts from the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and other Irish and international experts.  This testing is available in Ireland. <\/p><p>Laboratories in Ireland generally follow the laboratory testing recommendations of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Disease Society of America, the European Federation of Neurological Societies, and the British Infection Association.  Irish laboratories have their own quality assurance methods to make sure the tests are working correctly as well as being accredited by the Irish National Accreditation Body to perform the test correctly.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory.  This laboratory uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities which involves a screening test followed by a confirmatory test. <\/p><p>Testing which is performed abroad may be performed in laboratories which have not met National or International Accreditation (Quality Standards).  These tests may be more likely to give a &ldquo;false positive&rdquo; result. <\/p><p>Medical training programmes at undergraduate or postgraduate level in Ireland provides specialist training in infectious diseases, including Lyme disease.<\/p><p>Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics by General Practitioners.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered.  <\/p><p>The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre website () gives extensive information on Lyme disease diagnosis, treatment and how to avoid tick bites.  A Lyme Disease Subcommittee of the Scientific Advisory Committee of HPSC with professional clinical, entomological, scientific and environmental health expert representation (including a representative of the Lyme Support Group, Tick-Talk Ireland) has been established to explore all possible ways of raising awareness about Lyme disease.  This Subcommittee is expected to meet shortly with a view to finalising it report.  This report will cover a number of areas, including initiatives undertaken to date, summary advice relating to awareness, preventive advice for the general public, preventive advice and material for those responsible for sites or locations known to have or suspected as having higher densities of ticks, and summary advice relating to GP management of the condition.  Any person who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900045#WRB04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Building Programme","counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900045#WRB04900"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[17103\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900045#WRB05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if new hospitals built in Dublin under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 will be located in areas of easy access for persons from the wider Leinster area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>The National Development Plan is a ten year plan which will provide the capital funding to develop dedicated ambulatory elective-only hospital facilities in Dublin, Cork and Galway.

Enhancing the European perspective of the Western Balkans is a key strategic priority for the Bulgarian Presidency. The Strategy for the Western Balkans was published by the European Commission on 6 February. It confirmed the European perspective of the region and set out an indicative accession date of 2025 for Serbia and Montenegro, while emphasising that this perspective was extremely ambitious and strictly contingent on countries meeting the relevant accession criteria. In particular, the Strategy underlined the rule of law, the fight against corruption and organised crime, and good neighbourly relations as being fundamental for the Western Balkans to make progress on their accession paths.  Montenegro has made substantial progress on its European path. It is considerably ahead of other candidates in terms of open chapters of the <i>acquis<\/i>in accession negotiations; 30 chapters have already been opened (of which three have been provisionally closed) and just three have yet to be opened. Serbia is also making good progress; it has opened 12 chapters in negotiations (of which two have been provisionally closed); 23 have yet to be opened. The EU-facilitated Belgrade-Pristina Dialogue, aimed at normalising relations between Kosovo and Serbia, has seen renewed momentum this year, and progress in these negotiations will be key for Serbia to advance its membership aspirations. The European Union published country reports on each of the candidate and potential candidate countries on 17 April, and these confirm that while there is still a great deal of work to do, both Serbia and Montenegro are well advanced on their European path. <\/p><p>Ireland is a strong supporter of the enlargement process, viewing it as a transformative driver for stability and peace. We believe that the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries, including Serbia and Montenegro, must be credible, in order to advance the stability and security of the region. Equally, we are clear that candidate countries must, in meeting all the requirements of the accession process, give the rule of law, justice and fundamental rights the utmost priority in terms of reform.<\/p><p>Ireland is therefore strongly supportive of the accession of Serbia and Montenegro, provided that all criteria are completely and unequivocally fulfilled.  This is more important than accession dates per se. But we see the indicative 2025 date as offering an achievable, albeit ambitious, timeline for both Serbia and Montenegro.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900048#WRE04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Cases","counter":293,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900048#WRE04500"},{"type":"question","counter":294,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[17187\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900048#WRE04600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the trial of persons accused of killing a person (details supplied) will take place in June 2018; and if an Irish diplomat will attend part of the trial.","asker":"1309","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":295,"content":"<p>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers and of its importance for human rights defenders who are working in the field of environmental and indigenous rights in Honduras.

In the State PCP finance is underwritten by standard financial institutions, manufacturer banks, and special purpose institutions which exclusively offer motor finance. <\/p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) undertook the first comprehensive study of the Personal Contract Plans (PCP) market in the State.  As part of its study the CCPC issued detailed questionnaires to all the financial institutions that underwrite PCP finance in the State.  This allowed the CCPC to compile, for the first time, primary data relating to the number and value of PCP finance contracts issued.  The report was published on the 6 March 2018 and is available at www.ccpc.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that an Economic Letter on this area was published by the Central Bank on 28 March.  This provides further comprehensive data on the PCP market in Ireland, where at the end 2017 PCP finance accounted for 43%(&euro;1.2 billion) of car-related bank debt.  The Economic Letter is available at www.centralbank.ie.   <\/p>  <p>  My officials will examine these publications and give careful consideration to what actions, if any, would be appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that the Bank publishes car finance data, which contains information on PCP contract numbers and PCP lending amounts.  These data are contained in Table A.19 of the Credit and Banking Statistics.  Data are currently available for the period between 2012 and December 2017.  I understand that the Central Bank is currently developing a regular publication and reporting of this which will begin in Q3 2018. <\/p>  <p>  On the issue more generally, the Central Bank regulates financial services institutions as set out under legislation but does not regulate individual financial products.  Under current legislation (Consumer Credit Act 1995), the CCPC has responsibility for authorising and supervising the credit intermediaries which typically sell PCP contracts to consumers, including garages and retailers. The CCPC provides licenses to credit intermediaries and keeps an online list of credit intermediaries holding a valid authorisation which is available on the CCPC website www.ccpc.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The CCPC also deals with complaints about the advertising of Credit Agreements, issuing Pawnbrokers licenses and the advertising of car finance on credit intermediary websites and in the media.  The CCPC&rsquo;s remit is limited to authorisation, as opposed to having a regulatory role for PCPs.  It also has a specific statutory remit to provide personal finance information and education to assist consumers.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep financial legislation relating to consumer protection under review to ensure consumers are protected.

Instead, where commercially viable, it funds residential delivery on sites controlled by its debtors and receivers.<\/p><p>In late 2013, NAMA indicated that it aimed to fund the delivery of 4,500 homes on lands controlled by NAMA debtors and receivers over the period to end-2016.  By end-2016 this target had been exceeded with NAMA funding the delivery of 4,700 homes.<\/p><p>Subsequently,\u00a0NAMA stated in late 2015 that it would aim to fund and facilitate the delivery of up to 20,000 homes by end-2020, assuming that projects were commercially viable.  In total, since 2014, NAMA has directly funded the delivery of\u00a07,190 homes.  The breakdown by year sought by the Deputy is set out in the following table:<\/p><p><b>NAMA-funded residential units<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>2018-<br \/><br \/>(To end-January)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>NAMA-Funded   Residential Units<\/td><td>1,502<\/td><td>1,029<\/td><td>2,117<\/td><td>2,503<\/td><td>39<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>In addition, I am advised that over 2,700 units are currently under construction and planning permission has been secured for another 8,150 units.  In addition, I am advised that some 2,000 units have been completed on sites sold by NAMA debtors and receivers.<\/p><p>In relation to social and affordable housing, which I am taking to refer to housing made available at below market prices, it is important to note that assets often referred to as &quot;NAMA land&quot; or &quot;NAMA properties&quot; are not owned by NAMA.\u00a0 NAMA owns loans.\u00a0 Such property is owned by private persons who owe money to NAMA (&quot;NAMA debtors&quot;) and serves as collateral for those amounts owed.\u00a0 It is the income and proceeds generated from this property, via rental or sales, that is used by NAMA debtors to repay what they owe to NAMA.  All borrowers have the right to maximise the value of the property which secures his\/her loan.\u00a0 NAMA cannot force a borrower to take action which would reduce his\/her repayment capacity, such as providing property for affordable housing where that is not economically optimal.\u00a0 To do so would breach the borrower's property rights protected under Article 43 of the Constitution.<\/p><p>That said, I am advised that sites controlled by NAMA debtors and receivers are subject to the same Part V planning conditions as other residential developments.  Under Part V, 10% of the properties must be provided to local authorities for social and affordable housing.  Based on this statutory requirement, it is estimated that up to 720 units were deliverable under Part V arrangements since 2014, including 568 units since 2015. For certain developments, the Part V requirements may have been fulfilled through alternative arrangements at the request of the local authorities concerned.<\/p><p>I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that since 2014, NAMA has delivered 2,472 houses and apartments for use as social housing as part of its Social Housing programme, excluding houses which were provided under Part V arrangements.  NAMA identified vacant units within its debtors&rsquo; stock and offered them to local authorities and approved housing bodies.  Where demand was confirmed by local authorities, through the Housing Agency, funding was provided to purchase these properties, and where necessary, complete them in full compliance with all statutory requirements prior to delivery to the housing bodies.  To date, NAMA has invested approximately &euro;350 million in remediating, completing and purchasing properties for social housing use. NAMA&rsquo;s special vehicle, NARPS, purchases suitable units for onward leasing to local authorities and approved housing bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900050#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Rebates","counter":349,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900050#WRG01400"},{"type":"question","counter":350,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[17383\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900050#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a refund of income tax is due and will be arranged in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":351,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that it cannot determine if a refund of tax is correctly due in situations where statutory tax returns remain outstanding.<\/p><p>The person in question has not filed\u00a0their Income Tax returns for the years 2015 and 2016.

My Department and SOLAS\u00a0are committed to supporting the registration of apprentices in the construction sector. Registrations on craft apprenticeships are forecast to increase further up to 2020.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, we are currently expanding the range of apprenticeships on offer to meet the identified skill needs of industry.  Arising from our first call for apprenticeship proposals in 2015 an apprenticeship in Engineering Services Management, with the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) as industry lead, is currently being developed into a national apprenticeship programme.\u00a0 In addition, we recently announced 26 new programmes, arising from last year&rsquo;s second call for proposals, to be further developed into national apprenticeships, including a scaffolding apprenticeship, again with the CIF as industry lead and a senior quantity surveyor apprenticeship with the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland as industry lead.  These new programmes, once developed, will add to and complement the range of apprenticeships currently on offer in developing the skill needs identified by the sector.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to apprenticeship provision, almost 7,000\u00a0beneficiaries\u00a0participated in SOLAS-funded construction related further education and training (FET) programmes\u00a0provided by Education and Training Boards (ETBs) under the &lsquo;Built Environment&rsquo; skills cluster during 2017.\u00a0 Examples of these programmes include programmes in concreting, ground work, scaffolding and sustainable construction. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Separately,\u00a0following a series of discussions with the CIF, SOLAS identified the following semi-skilled occupations as priority areas for the ETBs; <\/p>  <p>  - Form\u00a0worker<\/p>  <p>  - Steel-fixer<\/p>  <p>  - Curtain\u00a0waller (installing glass and plaque tiles on the outside of building\u00a0replacing brickwork)<\/p>  <p>  Programmes have been put in place to produce approximately 100 form workers, 100 steel-fixers and 50 curtain wallers per year.\u00a0 SOLAS will continue to engage with the\u00a0ETBs to expand provision to meet needs in these areas.<\/p>  <p>  There\u00a0were almost 1,700 higher education awards (levels 6-10 on the National Framework of Qualifications) in construction related courses in 2016.\u00a0 Between 2012 and 2016 the number of graduates declined by approximately 1,180 (or 42%).\u00a0 The most significant declines were at levels 7 and 8, which combined saw 1,280 fewer graduates over the period 2012-2016.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>The areas referred to by the Deputy are part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (D.M.R.) North Division and I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the D.M.R. North Division on 28 February 2018, the latest date for which information is currently available was 666 of whom 201 were assigned to the Garda R District (Coolock District) and 161 to and J District (Raheny District). There are also 43 Garda Reserves and 39 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Unit, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 140 have been assigned to the DMR North Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested last month. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Furthermore, the Call for Proposals process will facilitate existing service providers forming consortiums, which could apply to provide services under the new comprehensive approach that is being developed. <\/p>  <p>  GYDPs provide an effective and essential support to the operation of the statutory Garda Diversion Programme by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The principal focus of GYDPs is on young people who receive a Garda caution under the Diversion Programme for involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour and are referred to a local GYDP (primary referrals). GYDPs also accommodate a certain proportion of young people who are considered to be at risk of involvement in offending or anti-social behaviour (secondary referrals).<\/p>  <p>  In relation to secondary referrals, it has to be considered if, in principle, it is appropriate to refer a child to a Garda project where no criminal act has been identified. For some, a better option might be referral to available mainstream youth services that could appropriately support them. That being said, it is accepted that referrals to GYDPs must take account of local needs and issues in relation to access and availability of mainstream youth services. Following the Call for Proposals process, GYDP services will still accommodate secondary referrals and the proportion of these may vary from area to area depending on identified local needs.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is very much aware of the range of concerns expressed in relation to the Call for Proposals process. I can assure the Deputy that careful consideration is being given to all issues raised by stakeholders involved in GYDPs, including those of independent service providers, as part of the extensive consultation process which is currently ongoing. This process includes arrangements for an extensive series of meetings with community based organisations and project workers which will facilitate closer communication and exchange of information in relation to these matters. In addition, the consultations will include arrangements to hear the views of young people, including participants or former participants on GYDPs.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the new approach to GYDP provision which is being developed in preparation for the Call for Proposals will not reduce the level of service that already exists, or the importance of community involvement in its delivery. On the contrary, the intention is to build on, update and improve a very valuable service so that it is available to every child or young person in the country who requires it. This improvement to the service will have benefits for significant numbers of young people in the State who cannot currently access GYDP services. While certain aspects of the new service delivery approach have been determined, work is ongoing to complete the full details to be included in the Call for Proposals, which is expected to issue in the second quarter of this year.  I am convinced that community ownership and participation of the projects is an essential dimension that must be preserved and strengthened in the working out of this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900054#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service","counter":469,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900054#WRL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":470,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[17156\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900054#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the reduction in the rate of interest payable on judgment debts from 8% to 2% enacted by SI 624 of 2016 is applicable to judgments which were made prior to January 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1283","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":471,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, S.I.

I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength Kildare Division on 28 February 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 357. There are also 20 Garda Reserves and 30 Garda civilian staff attached to the Kildare Division.

To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. 85 of this cohort\u00a0have been assigned to the Kildare Division.

This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested last month. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.

The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

for the workers there.\u00a0 My first thoughts are with these workers and their families as well as their local communities as they receive this difficult news.  <\/p><p>I understand that the company in question are planning to achieve cost savings by driving simplification of its products and processes to deliver greater efficiency across its operating systems.\u00a0 They are seeking to realign their cost bases to match the leaner and more agile organisation that they need to become. \u00a0Therefore, they are proposing a voluntary incentivised exit scheme which will be open to most employees.  It is proposed that any redundancies that will result because of the restructure will be on a voluntary basis and the locations will depend on the level of uptake.  <\/p><p>Regarding these possible job losses, Ireland has a robust suite of employment rights legislation, which offers extensive protections to employees.\u00a0 The Workplace Relations Commission is mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation.\u00a0 Workplace Relations information personnel are available to meet staff of the affected companies, either individually or collectively, to discuss their employment rights.\u00a0 The Workplace Relations Customer Service Section can be contacted at <i><\/i>or Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90.\u00a0 The website also provides extensive information on employment rights.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In addition, the State provides industrial relations mechanisms to assist parties in their efforts to resolve any differences they may have. <\/p><p>I understand that the company concerned is not a client of the State Development Agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, or the Local Enterprise Offices.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Employment retention and creation continues to be the primary objective of this Government and we have been working hard to create the improved economic conditions which will support the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new ones.Since becoming Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I have made jobs and enterprise in the regions my top priority. <\/p><p>The Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative is a central pillar of the Government&rsquo;s ambition to create 200,000 new jobs by 2020. A key objective of each of the 8 regional plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region not more than one percentage point greater than the national average.\u00a0 Progress across the eight regions has been very positive since the launch of the initiative, with an increase in employment of 8.5% or 118,600 jobs in the regions outside of Dublin and 166,800 additional jobs nationwide, from Q1 2015 to Q2 2017. <\/p><p>The Local Enterprise offices - or LEOs - are available to support anyone with a business idea and who wants to consider entrepreneurship as a career option. I would urge anyone who was made redundant or who is in danger of losing their job to contact with their local LEO to explore available options. Further information can be found on the LEO website at <i>www.localenterprise.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>I am confident that the measures outlined in the Regional Action Plans for Jobs together with other policies being pursued by the State agencies and the Local Enterprise Offices will continue to support enterprise development and provide employment opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900057#WRO01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research and Development Data","counter":576,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900057#WRO01700"},{"type":"question","counter":577,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[17309\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900057#WRO01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the most recent data for Ireland&rsquo;s ranking in each international table for research and development; and the target originally set by the Government for each such ranking in tabular form.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":578,"content":"<p>Innovation 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for research and development, science and technology, sets out Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to be a Global Innovation Leader.\u00a0 Benchmarking Ireland&rsquo;s performance against other comparable economies is a key tool to enable the delivery of that ambition and to enable us to develop steps to improve our comparative performance.<\/p><p>The European Commission annually produces the European Innovation Scoreboard which sets out Member States&rsquo; performance against a range of indicators and assists countries in tracking progress and identifying priorities.\u00a0 The 2017 Scoreboard was published by the European Commission in June 2017, with Ireland placed 10<sup>th<\/sup>overall and categorised as a Strong Innovator, performing above the EU average.

The Primary Care Division has already appointed a National Clinical Lead for the Addiction Services to improve its response to drug and alcohol abuse at primary care level and this Clinical Lead will work with the Mental Health Clinical Lead to develop a cohesive programme for those with a dual diagnosis. <\/p>  <p>  A Programme Manager was appointed in December 2016, and Dr William Flannery has commenced work as National Clinical Lead for this Clinical Programme. A literature review and clinical service mapping exercise has commenced.  The National Working Group held its first meeting mid-October 2017, and has initiated a work plan to develop a Model of Care based on a Programmatic approach to service improvement and development.  The National Working Group is made up of key stakeholders with clinical, service user and service provider expertise, and is chaired by Dr Flannery.<\/p>  <p>  The aims of this Programme are to develop a standardised evidence based approach to the identification, assessment and treatment of comorbid mental illness and substance misuse. <\/p>  <p>  These include:<\/p>  <p> -   Increasing awareness of the frequent coexistence of mental illness and substance misuse<\/p>  <p> -  Ensuring there is a clear clinical pathway for management of people with such a dual diagnosis including when they present to Emergency Departments<\/p>  <p> -  Ensuring a standardised service is provided throughout the country<\/p>  <p> -   Ensuring adolescents are also included within the scope of this Clinical Programme.<\/p>  <p>  The combination of mental illness and substance misuse is, as the comorbidity suggests, associated with a high degree of risk.  This includes a high risk of suicide as well as a risk of danger to other people. In addition, there is a risk of organic brain damage which may be irreversible.  The risk of suicide is relevant in the context of the Clinical Programme for Self Harm Presentations to Emergency Departments and so there is a crossover between these two Clinical Programmes.<\/p>  <p>  An integral part of the Dual Diagnosis Programme will be to devise a model of care that will ensure that all adolescents and adults suspected of having a moderate to severe mental illness coexisting with significant substance misuse have access to a timely mental health service nationally and this is to be delivered on a CHO basis.  The service will be provided in an integrated manner across the Primary Care Division and the Mental Health Service and will ensure that there are close working relationships with the relevant specialties in the Acute Hospital Groups that would deal with any medical comorbidities that may occur, particularly in those with alcohol misuse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900058#WRP01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Consultant Recruitment","counter":613,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900058#WRP02000"},{"type":"question","counter":614,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[17010\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900058#WRP02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a third paediatric consultant rheumatologist has been approved for Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin as part of the 2018 service plan in view of the waiting list and access issues for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":615,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900058#WRP02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products","counter":616,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900058#WRP02300"},{"type":"question","counter":617,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[17095\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900058#WRP02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the national biosimilars strategy will be published; the reason for the delay in publishing same; the measures the strategy will contain to increase Ireland's low uptake of biosimilars; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":618,"content":"<p>Medicines play a vital role in improving the overall health of Irish patients.

The amount allocated follows an extensive process of engagement between my Department and the HSE, which considers both the funding requirements as submitted by the HSE and the fiscal position.  These types of engagements are a normal part of the Budgetary process and happen with agencies across Government.  All public bodies put forward spending proposals but all such bodies, including the HSE, are required to operate within the amounts proposed by Government and determined by the D&aacute;il.

The capacity challenges across acute, primary and social care that we must prepare for, and address, have been highlighted in the recently published Capacity Review.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that retention of doctors and nurses is critical to the future growth of the medical and nursing workforce. Some progress has been made.<\/p>  <p>  The number of consultants has increased by 109 in the 12 months ending December 2017 to 2,971 whole time equivalents, and by 415 in the 4 years since December 2013.

The Group made 25 recommendations relating to training and career pathways for doctors with a focus on improving graduate retention in the public health system and planning for future service needs. Initiatives taken on foot of the Group's recommendations include the launch of a careers and training website, which gives information about each specialty, including details of training pathways and training duration, increasing the number of family-friendly training places and the appointment of lead NCHDs across sites.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  With regard to nursing, the number of nurses and midwives has increased by 942 in the 12 months ending December 2017 to 36,777 whole time equivalents and by 2,599 in the 4 years since December 2013. This growth reflects the implementation of a Nursing Recruitment and Retention Agreement concluded with the INMO and SIPTU Nursing last year.\u00a0 This committed the HSE to increasing the number of nurses and midwives by 1,224 additional permanent posts across the health service in 2017. \u00a0The HSE remain committed to the Agreement and efforts will continue to fill the remaining posts.\u00a0 Funded workforce plans for 2018 are in the process of being developed.

The first three beef plants were approved and listed on CNCA&rsquo;s website on Monday, April 16th.  A further five plants are in the final stages of approval.  This approval is a huge achievement for my Department.  Getting to this stage has involved a huge joined-up effort across Government, my Department and State agencies, with strong engagement with the Chinese authorities on meeting their detailed requirements.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has, in conjunction with industry, been working for some time towards ensuring that trade with China can commence and run smoothly.  There remain a number of technical requirements which must be satisfied before beef trade can commence.  It is expected that these requirements will take a number of weeks to complete.  In addition, the approved plants will have to deal with their own technicalities including testing requirements.  However, I expect that the trade will commence this summer.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has already had access to the Chinese market for pigmeat for more than 10 years.  Trade has increased considerably from 2,440 tonnes in 2010 to around 65,000 tonnes in 2017 with the value of these exports increasing from around &euro;2 million to over &euro;100 million over the same period.  China is now the second largest destination for our pigmeat exports after the United Kingdom.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to sheepmeat access a detailed questionnaire was submitted to AQSIQ in 2014.

The Commission proposal seeks to protect the weakest links in the\u00a0 supply chain, farmers and small and medium sized food companies.  The ambition is not to cover all UTPs but to address\u00a0unfair UTPs\u00a0 which have a clear negative impact on the food supply chain.  These\u00a0include establishing a minimum standard of protection across the EU, including the banning of late payments for perishable food products (maximum of 30 days), last minute order cancellations for perishable food, unilateral or retroactive changes to contracts and forcing the supplier to pay for wasted product.  Other measures\u00a0 are\u00a0 only permitted if agreed in advance by both parties\u00a0 including, for example, the return of unsold food products to a supplier and so called &lsquo;hello&rsquo; money.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission proposal was first discussed at the Agriculture Council\u00a0 this week (16 April), with a positive reaction from most Member States.  I welcomed the publication of the proposal, and outlined my preliminary views on the matter:<\/p>  <p>  It\u00a0 is clear the issue of unfair trading practices is a crucial issue for the agri-food sector as a whole.  The relative bargaining power of operators along the supply chain is a matter of concern for many farmers and SMEs.  Indeed some of our industry representatives have indicated, it is an issue for larger companies and cooperatives as well.<\/p>  <p>  Up to 20 Member States have specific unfair trading practice rules. Ireland is among those Member States.  However, as a nation that exports more than 80% of its agri food output, Ireland favours a regulatory framework at EU level.  We believe that some commonality in the framework would contribute to the more effective functioning of the single market.<\/p>  <p>  On the other hand, many Member States have done very good work in this area in recent years.  It seems clear that these Member States would prefer that any common minimum unfair trading practice standard introduced across the EU should complement existing national measures and not compete with them.<\/p>  <p>  My officials are analysing the detail of the proposed directive from an agriculture and food perspective, in coordination with stakeholders and particularly with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, which has lead responsibility for\u00a0the Grocery Goods Regulations introduced in 2016.

Agricultural ammonia emissions reached a peak in 1998 and declined to a low in 2011, due to a decline in the ruminant livestock population and reduced use of fertiliser nitrogen. However, since then with the anticipation and removal of milk quotas in 2015, ammonia emissions have been on an upward trend. Dairy and non-dairy bovines comprise the bulk of agricultural ammonia, with these emissions arising principally from animal housing and storage and the landspreading of manures. While sources of fertiliser emissions have fluctuated in recent years (e.g. changing portion of urea and overall amount), there has been a significant decline since the peak in the late 1990s due to a combination of reduced fertiliser use arising from our Nitrates Action Programme. <\/p><p>My Department is actively considering all options for how best to control emissions and specifically in relation to ammonia it is currently preparing an Advisory Code for Good Agricultural Practice to Control Ammonia Emissions. Furthermore, we have a whole territory approach to nitrates implementation so all farmers are obliged to abide by nutrient management planning which has many synergies with reducing ammonia\u00a0through the efficient use of animal manure. <\/p><p>The Nitrates Action Programme (NAP) gives effect to the Nitrates Directive; in late 2017 Ireland agreed with the European Commission on its fourth NAP for the period 2018 &ndash; 2021. The Nitrates Action Programme agreed includes a balanced programme of measures supporting the objectives of achieving good water quality while at the same time encouraging sustainable and efficient agricultural practices. The measures in Ireland&rsquo;s derogation take account of the growing numbers of derogation farmers who are farming at intensive stocking rates, and also environmental objectives for water, climate change and ammonia which Ireland must achieve.\u00a0 For example, a new condition for derogation farms has been included in that from 2018, 50% or more of slurry must be applied by 15 June and after that it must be applied by using low emission slurry spreading (LESS) equipment.<\/p><p>Ammonia losses from slurry are significantly reduced by slurry application in the springtime and also by using LESS equipment.My Department supports grant aid for LESS equipment under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme known as TAMS II and supports the application of slurry via LESS equipment as an option in the GLAS agri-environment scheme.<\/p><p>Modern trailing shoe slurry spreaders and new fertiliser formulations will help to reduce ammonia emissions. Covered slurry stores also offer some potential, however, it is only feasible for outdoor slurry stores and is only beneficial if subsequent slurry spreading is via trailing shoe; otherwise ammonia protected during storage will then be available for release at spreading stage. As mentioned above, investment in trailing shoe machinery is supported by the Rural Development Programme.<\/p><p>Research also plays a key role in improving our emissions reporting:\u00a0 the recent AGRI-I\u00a0 project, funded by my Department, has resulted in changes to nitrous oxide emissions factors for synthetic fertiliser and dung and urine by grazing animals, thereby, improving calculation of these emissions in the National Inventory. \u00a0<\/p><p>Continued support under the Department&rsquo;s Research Stimulus Fund for ammonia research is essential to focus on improving our emissions reporting and emissions factors, in particular our emissions factors for manure storage and housing.<\/p><p>My Department funded the recently completed <i>Sustainable nitrogen fertiliser Use and Disaggregated Emissions of Nitrogen (SUDEN) project<\/i>which was led by Teagasc, with AFBI and UCD partnering, identified that farmers can maintain yields and reduce ammonia loss to the environment. <\/p><p>Another ongoing funded project by my Department is Measurement and Abatement of ammonia emissions from agriculture (LowAmmo) which is focusing specifically on addressing knowledge gaps in national ammonia emissions data. <\/p><p>Achieving the required ammonia reduction targets is a significant challenge and one my Department is actively engaged with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900065#WRW00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":828,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900065#WRW00600"},{"type":"question","counter":829,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[17280\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900065#WRW00700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a budget will be allocated to his Department's early warning system that operates locally to provide assistance and support to farmers before welfare problems emerge.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":830,"content":"<p>The Department operates an Early Warning\/Intervention System (EWS) which is an initiative, introduced by the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council (FAWAC) and includes representatives from the farming bodies, the ISPCA and officials from\u00a0my Department.

Net family income will be determined on the basis of the combined income of the applicant and the applicant's partner, and the scheme will allow for the deduction from gross income of income tax, PRSI, USC, pension contributions, maintenance payments made, and a number of social welfare and related payments in line with planned legislation, namely the Childcare Support Bill 2017 and regulations to be made thereunder. The highest levels of subsidy will go to families with the lowest incomes, with the level of subsidy tapering down smoothly as income rises towards the maximum net income threshold of &euro;47,500.<\/p>  <p>  The level of subsidy will also depend on the age of the child. Higher subsidies will be awarded to families with younger children, to reflect the higher cost of providing childcare for younger children as a result of the higher adult-child ratios required by the Early Years Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the level of subsidy will reflect parents' participation in work or study. For families in which both parents (or the parent in a one-parent family) are in work or studying, enhanced hours of up to 40 hours of subsidy per week will be available. For families in which one or both parents is not working or studying, standard hours of up to 15 hours per week may be awarded. <\/p>  <p>  Recent amendments to the Childcare Support Bill 2017, which is still progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas, have extended the range of circumstances that must be considered in determining the rules on the number of hours of subsidy to be awarded each week. These circumstances have been extended to include specified situations in which a parent is unavailable to care for the child (e.g. because a parent is in hospital long-term), and temporary changes of circumstances in a parent's work or study (e.g. to allow bridging periods between phases of work or study).<\/p>  <p>  The hours of subsidy awarded will also depend on whether a child is taking part in ECCE or is at school, as the hours of subsidy under the Affordable Childcare Scheme are intended to wrap around a child's participation in ECCE or school, as well as meeting childcare needs outside of term-time. <\/p>  <p>  ACS will be fairer and more accessible than the current targeted childcare programmes, under which many low-income families are not currently able to access subsidised childcare because of the requirement to be in receipt of certain State benefits or attending certain training programmes.  <\/p>  <p>  A further benefit of the method for determining the level of subsidy under the Affordable Childcare Scheme will be its flexibility, as the Scheme will allow for adjustment of income thresholds, subsidy rates and income taper rates over time and as further Government investment becomes available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900067#WRY02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Affordable Childcare Scheme Data","counter":913,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900068#WRZ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":914,"qnumday":324,"qnumall":"[17203\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900068#WRZ00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the households in receipt of subsidies under the affordable childcare scheme by gross income bracket (details supplied).","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":915,"content":"<p>Under the Affordable Childcare Scheme, a family will be able to benefit from either a universal or a targeted subsidy. The basis for determining the level of targeted subsidy will be a family's net income, rather than gross income. Given the variation in tax situations between families, it is therefore not possible to state definitively the subsidy that will be awarded to a family with a given gross income, nor is it possible to provide detailed forecasts of the number of families that will receive subsidies under the Scheme by gross income bracket.<\/p><p>Basing the level of subsidy on a family's net income rather than their gross income provides a fairer reflection of the resources available to a family, as well as ensuring an equitable approach as regards the assessment of income that is taxable and income that is not taxable. Basing the income assessment on net income also reduces the risk of high effective marginal tax rates as subsidies are withdrawn in line with increasing income. As such, the approach is supportive of equity and labour market activation policy objectives and should ensure that the scheme is helpful to working families on low to moderate incomes.<\/p><p>The Regulatory Impact Assessment of the scheme included analysis by the ESRI of the impact of the scheme on families at different points in the income distribution. The table, which is extracted from the Regulatory Impact Assessment and attached as part of this answer, shows the impact of the scheme by income decile, demonstrating that the benefits of the scheme will primarily go to those in the lower half of the income distribution, but that the universal element of the scheme will give some benefits to families at all levels of the distribution.

Ahead of the specific 2018 allocations issuing, work under these programmes is continuing as local authorities can commit up to 65% of their 2017 allocation in approving applications for 2018.

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.<\/p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. <\/p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, are designed to enable the development of mixed tenure sustainable communities. Part V units are excluded from the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme 2016 to ensure that units delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time. The continued development of mixed tenure communities remains very important in promoting social integration. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in Rebuilding Ireland, a review of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken.

These matters are now almost completed and I expect to be in a position to publish the outcome of the review shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900070#WRBB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":999,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900070#WRBB02300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Funding","counter":998,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900070#WRBB02200"},{"type":"question","counter":999,"qnumday":353,"qnumall":"[17237\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041900070#WRBB02300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if special funding for a person (details supplied) will be granted; if a special funding scheme to support exceptionally talented young persons under 18 years of age will be investigated, with a view to its introduction; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":1000,"content":"<p>The Arts Council is the principal agency through which current funding is channelled to artists and arts organisations.
