There are now five investigations under way between the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the HSE, the Charities Regulatory Authority and the remaining directors of Console itself.  We all look forward to the outcome of those reports in order that we can have some peace of mind that the charity's good work over many years can continue and that its reputation can be cleaned up.<\/p>  <p>  There is, however, a very serious issue at large with the some 3,000 other charities.  There is clearly an issue among some with what is referred to within the charity sector as founder's syndrome, which has often served to undermine the introduction of good governance and appropriate management controls.  Apart from all this, however, is the failure of these Houses to commence provisions of the Charities Act 2009, in particular Part 4.  It is incumbent on the Government to explain why, during the previous Administration and this one so far, the Oireachtas and the Government have failed to provide the necessary provisions to commence that part of the Act in order that the Charities Regulatory Authority can begin to do the work which it was set up to do.  Why do we have a regulator if it does not have the teeth or the resources to do what we wish it to do?  As things stand, the regulator can only seek materials from these organisations with the agreement of the organisations themselves, so in effect, despite its good intentions, it can do no work.  Can the Government confirm, therefore, that it will commence the provisions relevant to resourcing and giving the regulator the necessary teeth, as envisaged by the 2009 Act, before the summer recess and that the necessary resources will be provided to do that?<\/p>  <p>  Over recent years &euro;12 million of public funds has been made available to the charity in question.  Many millions more were donated and fund-raised by service users, their families, relatives and neighbours and the many communities throughout the country which have been hit with the blow of loss of life through suicide.  These are people who cannot afford to give money or to dig deep and fund-raise and give valuable resources throughout a recession and a most difficult period in this country, yet they do.  The Oireachtas and the Government have a responsibility to ensure this Act is more than just window dressing.  We need to see tangible action to introduce the provisions of this Act that give the regulator teeth in order that we can begin to focus on the other 3,000 charities, most of them doing an excellent job.  They are entitled to the peace of mind of knowing that their hard work, taxpayers' money and donations are going to a good cause that is appropriately managed with the appropriate level of governance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000003#A00100","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1467284400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>First, I share Deputy MacSharry's view that this has come as a shocking revelation in an area of particular sensitivity.<\/p><p>We all understand the trauma people and families go through in cases of suicide.  There has been major shock and disgust among those who have supported the charity.  As the Deputy said, it is very important that we protect the valuable work done by many of those who have worked in the area.  It is heartening to see that the investigation comes directly from the HSE's close scrutiny of charities under its framework.  The HSE has a revised framework for all of the bodies it funds.  It was in this context that the irregularities in Console were first identified, followed by an audit and the investigation, with a new governance structure being put in place to deal particularly with the issues in Console.<\/p> <p> The Deputy referred to the role of the Charities Regulatory Authority, which is being rolled out.  Its first priority was to establish a proper register of the organisations the operations of which it would oversee.  It has done this.  It has established an interim arrangement under which it receives complaints from individuals.  It is moving to provide staffing in order that it can, as the Deputy requested, commence Part 4.  The authority has 23 staff and its 2016 budget provided for an increase to 36.  This will allow the regulator to move to establish the basis on which this Part of the Act can be implemented.<\/p> <p> Some elements such as the investigation of potential fraud fall beyond the operation of the Charities Regulatory Authority.  Failings in respect of directors' responsibilities fall to be investigated by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Issues are being actively pursued in the case of Console that fall outside the Charities Regulatory Authority's direct responsibility.  We are moving to ensure the authority will engage in the oversight which the Deputy rightly says is appropriate for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000003#A00200","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467284700,"counter":9,"content":"<p>That is not acceptable.

A precise date is required from the Government, before the D&aacute;il rises on 31 July, by which this Part of the Act will be fully commenced, as well as a commitment to focus heavily to ensure it will not take a \"Prime Time\" or a HSE audit to bring this stuff up.

It is as a result of this work that we have such scrutiny.  This has been found in a HSE audit.  While it is very uncomfortable, it is the result of the system working.  Oversight has resulted in the identification of wrongdoing and misgovernance which is being tackled in a very determined way.  We are determined to ensure all organisations will be subject to appropriate scrutiny.  The work being done by the Charities Regulatory Authority with its new staff will put it in a position where it will be able to implement the Part of the Act that provides for investigations.

Sadly, we have been down this road previously with other charitable entities.  The programme told a story of irregularities in finances, of altering accounts, and of how benefits were extracted.  It was reported that the charity's founder, Mr. Paul Kelly, his wife, Patricia, and indeed their son used 11 credit cards over a two-year period to shell out almost &euro;500,000 of the charity's funds to fund their lavish lifestyle.  That is truly shocking and despicable.  Money was used for trips to Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, designer clothes by Hugo Boss and Ralph Lauren, tickets for the Rugby World Cup, dental work, groceries, restaurants and consultancy payments at an extraordinary level.  This has left those who work for Console and those who avail of its services not just shocked but angry and traumatised by these revelations.<\/p> <p> I am sure the Minister will be as shocked as the rest of us by this turn of events.  His claim that all this emerged because of exacting scrutiny by the HSE needs to be considered.  I suggest all this is evidence of a lack of scrutiny and a lack of accountability.  As I understand it, the flag of concern was first raised by the National Office for Suicide Prevention as far back as 2009 and the question has to be asked, once the flag was raised, why this was allowed to continue.<\/p> <p> Will the Minister join me in calling on the HSE to make available immediately to the Committee of Public Accounts a copy of its audit report and the service level agreements with Console?  Will he also join me in insisting that the HSE presents itself before the committee next week?  This issue, this story and this scandal cannot be allowed to fester.  I appreciate other agencies have tasks to fulfil in investigation but the buck stops with us, and the turning of over stones in the previous D&aacute;il was largely done by the Committee of Public Accounts.

That resulted in control actions being taken then.  It was when the 2013 accounts became available to that body, which oversees this work, that irregularities were identified and that resulted in the HSE undertaking the audit.  This information resulted from direct action.  The audit was completed earlier this year and that has resulted in the appointment of external accountants who are in place now.  Clearly, the House is entitled to scrutinise the HSE on the way it oversaw this, but there is no doubt that there is a trail of activity.  It is not one of ignoring the issues that were identified in 2009.  HSE staff have been watching closely.  The irregularities that were identified resulted in the audit.  Of course, they will have to be investigated, and if further action needs to be taken by appropriate bodies such as the ODCE or the Garda, there must be due process for everyone involved in pursuing the steps that might follow from the findings of the audit.  The House must respect that as well.<\/p><p>There will be follow-up in those various agencies where there has to be due process.

Anything less than that is not acceptable.  The taxpayer who funds, in large measure, agencies such as this, of which there are thousands, need to know that taxpayers' money is not being used for Ralph Lauren, Rugby World Cup tickets, fancy cars or big consultancy fees.

Has the Minister secured funding to underpin that recruitment programme?<\/p>  <p>  I know of two Tipperary garda&iacute; who recently retired, both at the age of 53, both of whom had served 30 years.  That is an example of trained, qualified, experienced members being allowed to retire.

Is there a definite long-term plan to address the future capacity and training facilities at Templemore and also in relation to the lands in the possession of the Department at Clonmore?<\/p> <p> In recent years, a block has been imposed on legitimate transfer requests due to the reduction of Garda numbers.  Many members have failed to get a positive response for a transfer despite the fact they have compelling, substantiated grounds for such a move.  There are 430 members of the Garda Representative Association, GRA, awaiting a transfer in stations for more than two years.  In addition, there is a logjam and no transparency in how transfer rules are applied.  The system is too rigid and unresponsive.

Many garda&iacute; are caught in this housing trap.  The Department of Justice and Equality and the Office of Public Works could contribute to addressing this issue by restoring the many vacant houses in the possession of the Department.  In my county of Tipperary, there are numerous neglected and vacant housing properties in need of restoration or refurbishment.  For example, such properties exist in Templemore, Cashel, Emly and Mullinahone.

We recently provided additional funding to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality to supplement the original 2016 Estimate in order that the expansion of Garda activities could proceed.

Certain organisations have opted out of the Lansdowne Road agreement to date, of which the GRA is one.

We all know this type of scenario.  Instead, he accompanied his sisters to Egypt.  They went there on a regular basis because they had cousins in Egypt.  They got caught up in the protests of the time.  My 17 year old son would probably have got involved.  At that age, one stands up for democracy.<\/p>  <p>  In the middle of the protests, the young man and his sisters sought refuge in a Mosque.  People know what happened then - the mosque was surrounded, shots were exchanged and everyone inside, including Ibrahim Halawa and his three sisters, were arrested.  Ibrahim has been imprisoned for three years.  He has been brought to court on 13 occasions, but there has been no trial.  No evidence has been presented and there have been no proper procedures.  Amnesty International has decreed him a prisoner of conscience and is campaigning for his release.<\/p>  <p>  On 16 August three years ago when his parents first realised that their son and daughters might be in difficulty in Cairo, they immediately rang the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  In fairness, its officials stated that they would do everything that they could.  However, it is now clear that whatever the Government has been doing is not working.  Others have been pardoned and released, for example, Mr. Peter Greste.  On Tuesday, the trial was yet again postponed until October by when, we are told, the judge will have had time to review video evidence.  Two people were released, but Ibrahim Halawa was not.<\/p>  <p>  What is the Government planning to do in addition?  Many Deputies on this side of the House have an interest in the case and have followed it.  We have held our counsel, as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has regularly stated that we should not say anything because it had the matter in hand, the case would be dealt with this week and it believed it could manage the situation.  That has not worked.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we get this right.  It is important that we send the message that every citizen of this country, no matter his or her creed, is treated in the same way and that we stand up for the rights of our people when they are caught in circumstances in which their rights are clearly being abused.<\/p><p>We must be brave and take radical, strong action internationally where needed.  Standing up for that one young boy is standing up for every young boy in the country.  It says something about ourselves and what we stand for.<\/p> <p> Considering that the trial was postponed again until October and that the young man has for three years been in prison conditions that we increasingly hear are deeply worrying, given the concerns about torture and other forms of abuse, what does the Government intend to do?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000008#F00300","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467286500,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I share the Deputy's deep disappointment that there is a further delay in the trial of Mr. Halawa.  The courts had indicated in advance of the latest hearing that there would be significant developments.  Therefore, this latest adjournment is a real source of concern and frustration for Mr. Halawa and his family.  I understand the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, met members of the family earlier this week.  The Government is continuing to pursue every route it can to offer consular support to the family and, more important, secure the release of Mr. Halawa by the Egyptian authorities.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is continuing to keep its approach under close review.  As recently as 16 June, as part of that approach, the Minister, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, met the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Mr. Shoukry, during his visit to the Middle East.  Our Minister discussed the case of Mr. Ibrahim Halawa during that meeting and underlined our concerns.  He clearly restated our objective of ensuring Mr. Halawa is returned to Ireland as soon as possible.  The Minister also made clear that everything possible should be done to ensure Mr. Halawa's welfare and well-being while in custody.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the Government has been extremely active on this issue.  If the Deputy has suggestions for further initiatives that could be taken, I have no doubt the Minister and his team will consider them.  Considerable effort is being made and it is disappointing to see the court case adjourned again.  I will convey to the Minister the Deputy's continuing concerns and his hope that further initiatives can be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000009#G00200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1467286500,"counter":46,"content":"<p>What I hear from the Minister's response is that he has no new initiatives.  He has no different plan, even three or four days after this latest setback.  In the interim, we have still been doing trade deals with Egypt, as if there were no problem.  I suggest that we start to raise this at a higher level, at European level.  This is the sort of issue in respect of which we should be putting pressure on Egypt not only as Irish citizens but also as European citizens.  We should be operating at a far greater scale than before.<\/p>  <p>  I suggest that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade bring in the legal team for the likes of Mr. Peter Greste, who was successfully extricated from similar circumstances.  How was it that the Australians were able to achieve something in this regard while we have not been able to?  At some stage, it will be asked why the Government is not exerting sufficient political pressure, including in respect of trade and other matters, with the Egyptian State because the latter is treating us with contempt in the way it is dealing with an Irish citizen.  We have held back to allow due process, but there is no due process.  That is what the Minister needs to raise at a much higher level than it has been raised to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000009#G00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1467286500,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I understand the Government did examine closely those other cases to determine whether there were lessons to be drawn from them that could be applied in this case.

The housing report issued by the special committee in recent weeks sought an urgent and immediate review of the scheme.  Notwithstanding this, I propose that the Bill be taken to address the fact those tenants in Part V accommodation do not have the same rights as their counterparts in local authority units, for whom the tenancies are very much the same.

I move the Bill on behalf of the Anti-Austerity Alliance and People Before Profit, whose six Deputies have signed their names to the Bill.  This is not just adhering to the commitment we made when we stood for election, it is also very timely.  Tonight, the issue of fatal fetal abnormalities will be discussed in the D&aacute;il.  It seems the Bill will be ruled unconstitutional, so those women will continue to suffer the horrors of leaving the country for medical treatment.<\/p><p>Repeal of the eighth amendment is necessary to cater and legislate for abortion in all cases, according to the Government.  The Bill recognises the reality of abortion in this country, whereby thousands of women leave every year or conduct abortions in their own bedrooms with safe medical abortion pills for a variety of reasons.  There is widespread recognition in society that banning abortion does nothing to stop the practice.  Everybody knows that it will continue, with or without the eighth amendment which just brushes the issue under the carpet.  We must, therefore, cater and legislate for it.<\/p> <p> Last year when I introduced a similar Bill, the Government stated there was no appetite for it.  That was its constant refrain to any proposed change.  It is extremely clear that there is a huge demand for change.  In the most recent opinion poll 75% of respondents indicated that they wanted a referendum to be held to repeal the eighth amendment.  There is, therefore, a democratic deficit in this regard also and it is the one issue in society on which people are clear.  The consensus is that we should get rid of the eighth amendment and to then debate and discuss the relevant legislation to be brought before the D&aacute;il.  I see some Deputies shaking their heads, but I am afraid that they are behind the curve because it has been shown consistently in opinion polls that there has been a sea change in attitudes on this issue among young people and women.  The only people who are behind are those who saw fit three years ago to criminalise women for making these decisions with a 14-year jail sentence.  That was very behind the curve.  In introducing the Bill, therefore, I appeal to young people, women and pro-choice organisations to use the next 100 days to contact their local Deputies to meet them at their clinics or seek appointments with them to discuss the need to repeal the eighth amendment.  We give this notice in order that organisations can do what should be done, which is to ask their local Deputies to represent a clear majority of the people who favour repeal of the eighth amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000016#O04400","speaker":"1254","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467290100,"counter":247,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000017#P00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1467290100,"counter":248,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000017#P00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1467290100,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Cuireadh agus aonta&iacute;odh an cheist.\r\n\r\nQuestion put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1467290100,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000017#P00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1467290100,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Tairgim: &quot;Go dt&oacute;gfar an Bille in am Comhalta&iacute; Pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideacha.&quot;<\/p><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000017#P00600","speaker":"1254"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1467290100,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Cuireadh agus aonta&iacute;odh an cheist.\r\n\r\nQuestion put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Standing Orders: Motion","time":1467290100,"counter":253,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000017#P00750"},{"type":"speech","time":1467290100,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Standing Orders of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann relative to Public Business be amended in Standing Order 11 by the deletion of paragraph (1) and the substitution of the following:(1) Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle, an election shall be held according to the procedures outlined in these Standing Orders for the election by secret ballot of a Ceann Comhairle, save that:<blockquote>(a) the time and date of the secret ballot for Leas-Cheann Comhairle shall, where practicable, be agreed by the Business Committee;<br \/><br \/>(b) nominations for candidates shall be received by the Clerk not later than 6 p.m. the day before the secret ballot, not counting a Saturday, Sunday, or a public holiday;<br \/><br \/>(c) where reference is made in the procedures to the Clerk&rsquo;s Election Report, such reference shall be interpreted to refer to the time and date of the secret ballot for Leas-Cheann Comhairle, save that where no candidate is validly nominated, or where the successful candidate selected by secret ballot is not elected, it may be decided&mdash;<blockquote>(i) to schedule a secret ballot for another occasion; or<br \/><br \/>(ii) to set a date on which motions may be made without notice for the election of a Leas-Cheann Comhairle in accordance with Standing Order 8; and<\/blockquote>(d) following the secret ballot, the votes shall be counted as soon as the Clerk considers it practicable to do so, and the Clerk shall announce to the House the name of the successful candidate selected by secret ballot as soon as he or she considers it practicable to do so thereafter.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000017#P00900","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1467290100,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Animal Protection (in relation to Hares) Bill 2015: Second Stage (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1467290100,"counter":256,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000017#P01050"},{"type":"speech","time":1467290100,"counter":257,"content":"<p>A division was challenged on Thursday, 23 June, on the question that the Animal Protection (in relation to Hares) Bill 2015 be read a Second Time.

I will take two topics and give them one minute each.  My first point on Brexit is about the how Ireland now finds itself placed with regard to foreign direct investment.  Companies have been signalling their intent to look at Ireland a second time or consider Ireland as a possible alternative location.  We need to ensure our State agencies, including Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the other agencies, capitalise on this.  They are certainly in a position to do so.  Visa and work permit schemes should be fast-tracked and packages should be put in place in order that if there are expressions of interest from companies looking to relocate, which seemingly there are, then we should be in a position to welcome them and take them on.<\/p>  <p>  Again, the housing crisis comes into play.  One issue for companies potentially looking to relocate is accommodation.  I have heard anecdotally that places are already being snapped up or at least inquired about.  We should prioritise that.  Every job created through foreign direct investment generates three more in the local economy as well as the obvious benefits of those high-end jobs coming to our country.<\/p>  <p>  The question of the Northern Ireland Border is crucial.  It is critical that we look at arrangements to insulate the all-island approach, if at all possible.  All the work of the Good Friday Agreement, cross-Border institutions and everything we have seen done in recent years should be protected.  It would be disastrous if the Border were to re-emerge.  I encourage all interested parties to look at how an all-Ireland border could be put in place instead.  If customs posts or controls are to be put up, then they should be put on the United Kingdom rather than our Border, if at all possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000025#X00600","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1467293100,"counter":280,"content":"<p>This is the second time I have spoken about Brexit in the House.  In my maiden speech I spoke on the concerns and fears I had, how Brexit would affect our country and, critically, how Brexit would affect the United Kingdom.  Some of the things I alluded to in that speech are the things we have been listening to in recent days, including the potential for untold damage to the United Kingdom as a country and the possible eventual destruction of it as a single country.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to concentrate on the impact of Brexit on our country.  The Government will undertake the lead task of negotiating, along with our fellow EU 27 member states, with the United Kingdom.  It is vital that we come with the best possible plan to ensure the UK remains with as much access and involvement in Europe as possible in future.  It is to the benefit of our country to have such an arrangement and we need to ensure it is realised.  The onus is on every political party and every politician, regardless of party, to work together on behalf of our country.  We need to support our Government to ensure the UK's onward involvement is as total and immersed in Europe as it can be, even if it chooses not to remain a member of the EU.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to caution one point in that regard.  If we, as the European Union, undertake a deal with the United Kingdom, it is vital that we ensure we stitch in to any arrangement certain precautions and provisos.  For example, if the UK has free access and free trade, all of which would be to our benefit, we must not allow the UK to engage in practices such as not observing minimum wage or environmental regulations, etc.<\/p><p>If the UK does not have the restrictions placed on it that we should insist on, then an unequal playing field could develop where the UK becomes a base for business and enterprise selling into the European Union while not observing any of the laws we and our fellow members of the European Union would like to see.<\/p> <p> However, while observing that potential risk, it is key that we work together to ensure the European Union has a stance that is not vindictive and does not bear any animosity towards the UK for how it voted.  That stance needs to recognise that we will be better off together regardless of whether the UK is a member.  We need to develop a proper free trade understanding with the UK while also insisting that it observes things like free movement as well, which, if it wants access to the benefits of the market, is an inherent part of it.<\/p> <p> This is probably the worst thing that could have happened to our country.  It is one of the worst things that could have happened to the United Kingdom.  I believe there is some mechanism within the Article 50 process for a country not to complete it, but to withdraw from the process even after it has started it.  I still believe the UK would have a better future as part of the EU and that is where I would like to see it.  However, if that is not to be, then the onus is on all EU states, but particularly Ireland, to ensure Britain plays as full a part as possible and that we have as full a relationship with the UK, particularly in trade, as is possible in the current situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000025#X00700","speaker":"1310","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467293700,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister of State on his reappointment and wish him every good luck and success.<\/p>  <p>  This is certainly a very worrying time for everybody.  Even though we were all preparing, we still did not expect the vote to go the way it did.  The European Union, formally created in 1993 after decades of international co-operation between the countries of Europe, has provided an exceptional outlet in the free movement of goods, services and individuals, creating an economically strong and vibrant Europe.  For the United Kingdom to move away from these values in favour of its own independent policies, formed without regulation from the rest of its community, is certainly an upset to our society.<\/p>  <p>  I very much respect democracy and I respect people's right to vote, but the decision by the British people to leave the European Union will have effects far beyond its borders.  We will also be affected by this action.  With the removal of the UK from the EU trade channels, it will become more difficult for Irish producers to export their goods across the Irish Sea, resulting in a potential decrease in bilateral trade flows between the two countries and also a drop in the total merchandise exports from Ireland, disproportionately affecting the basic and fabricated metal, agricultural, forestry, fishing, food and beverage, and textile sectors.<\/p>  <p>  Trade is not the only area affected by the British exit.  With its departure, foreign direct investment into the UK is likely to fall, leading to lower productivity and lower growth which will in turn also negatively affect Ireland, I am afraid.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the movement of workers between Ireland and the United Kingdom is not at risk.  Given previous EU migration laws this has not been a problem, but now it is possible that the UK could impose restrictions on Irish citizens working in the UK, creating great upset and inconvenience for our citizens.  Furthermore, migrants, who had been bound for the UK, may now come to Ireland, with research suggesting an average wage fall of 3.9%, with workers in high-skilled positions experiencing a 5% wage decrease.<\/p>  <p>  Politicians and the business community have to deal with the political reality we now have.  We must try to make the most of the situation.  While it is a bad situation, with intelligence and determination and everybody pulling together, we have to come out of this with the negative effects minimised.<\/p>  <p>  I was concerned that the price of beef would be low in September or October.  Now with this UK decision I can see it being further negatively affected.  As the Minister of State is aware, the farming community is on its knees.  One thing which was always true about farming was that irrespective of what was happening with beef or sheep, those milking cows had an income.  However, that is no longer the case.  It is tragic that dairy farmers are losing money every day.  I am afraid that Brexit will compound that problem.  These family farms are really struggling for survival.  If the price of beef were to go lower than I had anticipated for autumn, it would lead to a crisis in that sector.  That is one concern we need to try to address.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to the European Union affairs committee getting its structures in place in the coming weeks.  I know that all the members of that committee look forward to working with the Minister of State.  I believe it will be us, as Ireland Incorporated, working together in unity in whatever way we can to mitigate the negative consequences of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  In recent days the Taoiseach was out fighting our corner with the other EU leaders.  To say that this is unprecedented and something out of this world altogether is not an overreaction or an exaggeration.  If a man had placed a bet with Paddy Power at the start of the year that the United Kingdom would leave the EU and that Donald Trump would become President of America, he would have got some odds.  There was money to be made.  The first part has come true, whatever about the second part.<\/p>  <p>  On a serious note, I hope the committee will be able to work with the Minister of State in ensuring we try our best to ensure Irish people working in Britain are taken care of in the best possible way and that our trade and our tourism figures will not go down as a result of this.  I certainly hope that will not happen.  It is a very unusual time to say the least.  Politically there is an onus on all of us to pull together and do everything we can for the citizens of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000026#Y00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1467293700,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his kind words.

They are worried about the possibility of destabilising a cosy consensus among the ruling elite on a global, financial, capital arrangement they have, and on future projects that they hoped to create around battle groups incorporating an EU-wide army that included the British.  They are also concerned about the effect this exit might have on the arrangements for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, and other competitive and trading arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  The sentiment behind Brexit is definitely complex.  Racism played its part, but so did a sentiment that is part of a wider revolt against the European Union that I just described - the European Union of war, wealth, power and economic bullyboys who have shaped Europe as a haven for the very wealthy at the expense of the people, whose democratic wishes they chose to ignore.<\/p><p>This is a slap in the face for the Europe that forced Irish, Greek, Spanish and Portuguese workers to bail out bankers and bondholders.  Even though Greece is the cradle of democracy, the EU cruelly ignored the democratic wishes of the Greek people when it forced them to privatise some of their most precious assets, including their heritage.  What the EU has done to the people of Europe is absolutely obscene.<\/p> <p> The racist far-right proponents of Brexit, including Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson, have no place in shaping the future of Britain.  Their hateful rhetoric against migrants and refugees was largely unchallenged in the debate by both the \"Leave\" and \"Remain\" sides, to the disgrace of both sides.  There must be a lesson in that for the future of politics of Britain and elsewhere.  The vote to leave was encased in Labour strongholds, including areas that were decimated by the loss of jobs in coalfields, mines and steelworks and by the imposition of austerity by successive Tory and Labour governments.<\/p> <p> I believe the future of Britain will be shaped by the battle that is taking place inside the UK Labour Party today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.  The leadership of that party will either remain with Jeremy Corbyn, who has a vision for change that involves redistributing wealth and getting justice for the British people, or pass to the warmongering, racism and austerity of his opponent, Angela Eagle.  If Jeremy Corbyn wins this important battle between the right and left of the UK Labour Party, the future of British politics will be blown open.  I want to send solidarity to Jeremy Corbyn from the left in the Irish Parliament.  We hope he stays in for the long haul and wins this battle despite the haranguing and harassment of the right.<\/p> <p> I would like to put the record straight with regard to the future of Scotland and Northern Ireland, both of which voted to stay in the EU.  People Before Profit absolutely respects the democratic right of those countries to have polls on their futures.  We are in favour of a Border poll.  We are extremely disappointed that Sinn F&eacute;in has attacked People Before Profit.  I assume that attack is probably based on the stated position of our allies in the Anti-Austerity Alliance.  We have an honest disagreement with the alliance on the question of the Border, just as Sinn F&eacute;in has honest disagreements internally on the question of the right to choose.  Indeed, Sinn F&eacute;in has an honest disagreement with its allies in the DUP on the question of Irish unity.<\/p> <p> When one considers the impact of Brexit on Ireland, one must reflect on the EU's recent statement on the derogation from water charges.  The ink was hardly dry on the Brexit result when the EU told the Irish people that they have no derogation from water charges and will have to pay.  This statement was made in spite of the demonstrations, the protests and the votes that were cast against water charges in the general election, the result of which is reflected in this Parliament.  The first and most important lesson to take from Brexit is that we must always stand and organise against racism and the far-right.  The second lesson is that we have to continue the fight for democracy and against the EU in this country.  We might even see an Eirexit at some future stage.<\/p> <p> The startling hypocrisy of our Government in eulogising the EU despite the savagery it has imposed on us is absolutely breathtaking, as Deputy Boyd Barrett might say.  Brian Hayes, MEP has announced that if the EU goes after our 12.5% corporation tax rate, we are out.  It seems it is okay for the Government to go after lone parents, teachers and nurses, to impose stealth taxes and to create a housing crisis and a trolley crisis, but it is not okay for anyone to dare to touch our corporation tax rate.  It is absolute hypocrisy.  The response of the EU to the result of the referendum has been to organise separate meetings.  It is astounding that it has responded to the democratic will of the British people with this sort of \"up yours\" message.  The Government sitting across from me is also behaving disgracefully.  It is shameful that it has spent almost &euro;500,000 defending Apple, which owes the State &euro;19 billion, in the European courts.  It is a disgrace.  Rather than defending Apple, we should be trying to get that money back from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000026#Y00400","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467294300,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I want to contradict the views of the previous speaker.  I am astonished by the amount of ignorant and uninformed rhetoric that has just come from her.  I would like to explain to her the subsidiarity of national law to EU law, which was in place when we joined the EU in the 1970s, but I cannot do so because she is walking out the door.  We will have to pretend we do not know that the system to which I refer, which has been in place since before Ireland became a member of the EU, exists.<\/p><p>If I am being really honest, a little part of me wanted to see the EU get a kick in the backside.  I suppose it got a kick in the backside and an awful lot more.  It got a bloody nose.  The result of the referendum has done a great deal of damage.  I believe the voters of the UK, who are our nearest neighbours and friends, have made a mistake that will have significant repercussions elsewhere.  I remind the House that when we were facing our worst ever economic difficulties in 2008, the UK Government provided a bilateral loan of billions of euro to this State.  That is something we should not forget.<\/p><p>As I waited for the result of the referendum the other night, I watched as the results came in from two of the 380 counts, those in Newcastle and Sunderland, which started a trend that was clearly only going to go one way.  In one case, the &quot;Remain&quot; vote won but was lower than we would have liked and in the other case, the &quot;Leave&quot; vote won and was higher than we would have liked.  The real difficulty we face now as the UK's nearest neighbour is that we might get caught in the crossfire.  There is annoyance, anger and vexation, particularly among the countries of eastern Europe, because of challenges for those countries that probably did not exist five years ago.  They are being challenged by developments in Russia, by the refugee crisis in Syria and by the possible accession of Turkey to the EU.  It was better to have a more stable and more concrete bloc of 28 countries than a bloc of 27 countries and another country that has decided by a small margin to leave.<\/p><p>I do not subscribe to the point of view that the voters of the UK should be given another go at it and asked to vote again until they come up with the right answer.  My opinion is that the &quot;Leave&quot; vote would have been much closer to 60% if it had not been for the horrible killing of an MP, Jo Cox.  The trend was going in that direction until this young woman was the victim of a savage attack.  Perhaps the result would change if the referendum were held again, but I do not know whether the &quot;Remain&quot; side would win.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that the biggest challenge for Ireland is in the agriculture sector.  Approximately &euro;5 billion of our total food and beverage exports of &euro;11 billion are exported to the UK.  I saw a remarkable and more important statistic recently.  Approximately 90% of our food exports to the UK, which as I have said are worth &euro;5 billion, are consumed within two weeks.  That is how quickly our produce is brought to the UK, put on the shelves, paid for and consumed.  It will be a real challenge for our agriculture sector to replace that market if it has to do so as a result of the outcome of the conversation between the UK and the EU when Article 50 is invoked.<\/p><p>As I said at the outset, the people in the UK are our friends.  Many of them are our family.  I do not want to see them punished.  I can understand the thoughts of those who do not think the UK should be rewarded.  They should not have an opportunity to pick and choose in an <i>&agrave;<\/i><b><i><\/i><\/b><i>la carte<\/i>manner, to use a term I heard yesterday.  They cannot have the best of both worlds.  They cannot have an opportunity to undercut or reduce workers' rights or environmental standards while retaining access to the Single Market.  That certainly cannot be allowed to happen.  I believe last week's vote was a mistake.  It will probably lead to the break-up of the Act of Union between England and Wales, and Scotland.  It has the potential to lead to the break-up of the Irish Act of Union.  My real concern is that it could lead to the break-up of the EU.  We are in a political time when anything could happen.  I have to say I found the applauding of some people in the European Parliament disappointing.  Those people were elected and that is democracy.  Democrats disappoint us on some occasions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000027#Z00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1467294900,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I would like to share one minute of my time with Deputy John Brassil.  <\/p><p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in the D&aacute;il on the decision returned last Friday by the British electorate to exit the European Union.  While the decision may have come as a shock and a disappointment to many, it is one that we must accept.  We have to respect the will of the British people.  Since the foundation of the State in 1922, we have consistently and constructively engaged with our closest neighbours to build a strong relationship that has seen them become our largest trading partners.  It has taken the better part of a century to construct the special relationship we have with the British, which is why Ireland must be to the fore in the impending negotiation process to protect what has been built.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach gave a commitment in his address last Monday that he and his officials would be at the table for every major decision in the negotiations. This is obviously welcome.  However, I remind the Taoiseach of the importance of the negotiations to our agricultural output, 40% of which goes directly to Britain.  For example, just over half of all our beef exports - 52% to be exact - go directly to Britain.  Some 84% of our poultry exports and 30% of total dairy products are exported to Britain.  As a farmer, I cannot emphasise enough the importance of ensuring the agricultural market is prioritised, protected and enhanced.  The beef and dairy markets, in particular, have endured much volatility of late.  The Taoiseach must ensure farm families and the communities of rural Ireland are not adversely affected by the impending negotiations.  Even though we are a member of the European Union, we must have our bilateral arrangements recognised by Brussels and seek the necessary exceptions to protect such vital trade agreements.<\/p><p>A report published by Teagasc in April serves as a stark reminder of the potential implications for the agriculture industry.  The report examined four scenarios in the event  of Brexit.  The largest impact showed a reduction in total Irish agricultural food exports of &euro;800 million, while the smallest estimated an annual loss of agricultural food exports of <i>circa<\/i>&euro;150 million or 1.4% of agricultural export value.  That is serious.  Obviously, the magnitude of the potential loss in agriculture export value would depend on Britain&rsquo;s future trading relationship with the 27 members, including Ireland, and the direction of British agricultural policy, both of which remain unknown.  I suggest the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, seek talks with his British counterpart in an effort to provide some certainty on the many questions that have arisen surrounding the agriculture sector post-Brexit.<\/p><p>Of course, Brexit raises many concerns about the North.  There has been a common travel area since the 1920s.  The British and Irish Governments have agreed reciprocal visa arrangements, including free passport travel, measures to increase the security of the external common travel area and sharing immigration responsibilities between the two countries&rsquo; immigration authorities.  Ireland must do all it can to try to preserve the common travel area, as any change would have significant effects on the labour market, trade and tourism.  The peace process and the Good Friday Agreement which was achieved through years of painstaking work by political figures on both sides are often championed as an example to the rest of the world of how peace can be achieved in even the most difficult of circumstances.  Therefore, it would be extremely regrettable to return to the days of Border controls between the North and the South which, regretfully, is emerging as a realistic possibility in the fallout from Brexit.  I suggest the fallout represents an opportunity for the European Union hierarchy to reflect and take a moment for self-assessment.  We need a strong European Union, with cohesion and solidarity among the remaining member states, but, most importantly, we must maintain our unique relationship with Britain for the benefit of the Irish people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000028#AA00100","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speech","time":1467294900,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Bobby Aylward for giving me one minute of his time to discuss this topic.

In particular, a number of nursing students are going to Scotland.  What will be the implications of this decision in completing their education?  What will be the further implications for the Irish system in this capacity?

Sinn F&eacute;in believes health care services must be developed on an all-Ireland basis.  Ideally, we should move from increased co-operation to ultimately full integration of island-wide services.  As Deputies are aware, in the past decade there have been developments in cross-Border co-operation, with a number of exciting joint departmental projects being developed. They include work on shared radiotherapy and paediatric cardiac services, health promotion, cancer research, mental health initiatives and suicide prevention.  The result of the British referendum is deeply worrying for the future of this co-operation and parents, families and communities are anxious to see its continuation. This is particularly important, given that the new children's hospital will have a state-of-the-art cancer centre which will serve children across the island.  However, there needs to be a critical mass of population to make sure the centre will be viable.  That critical mass can be achieved only on an all-island basis.<\/p>  <p>  At this time, it is important that we see concerted engagement with the Minister for Health in the Assembly to ensure current and future cross-Border projects are maintained and secured for the future.  We cannot rely only on North-South Ministerial Council meetings for this engagement.  There should be more regularised contact.  Illness, disease and health know no borders and it is important that success in cross-Border projects, in which we have achieved a lot of success, be continued and guaranteed into the future.  Earlier this week I was in Brussels as part of a health delegation led by the Sinn F&eacute;in MEP Martina Anderson.  It had been arranged prior to the referendum result being known, but it turned out to be a timely engagement.  It was a delegation of health professionals, educationists, innovators and stakeholders from the north west health innovation corridor.  The project spans the north west and was launched in May 2013 by Martina Anderson, MEP.  It is an example of how well cross-Border co-operation can work and it is a positive step towards creating an island-wide health care system.  The fear among many in the delegation and the questions being asked of officials from the Commission was how the result of the Brexit referendum would impact on this cross-Border collaboration.<\/p>  <p>  As my other party colleagues have already highlighted during the course of the statements, Brexit is not just a British issue. It is not an issue that will affect just the Six Counties; it will affect people in counties Louth, Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal and beyond.  The reality is that cross-Border health care agreements are under threat as a result of the outcome of the referendum.  Irish patients have been availing of health services in the North and Britain under the EU cross-Border directive. It meant that where there was an overly long waiting list, people could travel with ease to receive the treatment that they needed.  The waiting lists are not going away; neither are the demands.  Going North across the Border or across the sea was manageable, but it may become unmanageable.  We need to be out in front on this issue and aware of it.<\/p>  <p>  Let us not forget the big elephant in the room: access to termination services.  The Government well knows that it and its predecessors have been systematically outsourcing the issue of terminations to our neighbours across the sea.  Imagine what a woman with a diagnosis of a fatal foetal abnormality will feel as we see the Border deepen.  The services will not be available.  The Government cannot and should not continue to outsource this problem, but Brexit will throw up a very serious issue in this regard with a deepening of the Border.  We cannot ignore it; the issue has to be dealt with.<\/p><p>We need to hear when the engagement to identify and assess how to minimise any adverse impact on the provision of all-island health services will commence.  When will measures be taken to ensure there will be no adverse impact on or logistical challenges to accessibility issues in the case of cross-Border emergency medical transport services?  These issues need to be identified.  We need to consider how specifically we can all work together.  When will the Minister be meeting his counterparts in the North on these issues?  When will we see a plan?  It is clear that nobody had anticipated the result of the referendum.  I do not believe the Government has a plan.  I think its plan was to wait and see and hope this would not happen.  We need a plan because there are people who need to access services across the Border, who need to know there is a plan and that their future and services are secure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000028#AA00300","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467295500,"counter":291,"content":"<p>There is a plan and a Government.

All of us, North and South, must work together, notwithstanding the huge disadvantage of the decision made in Britain over the weekend.  It is very important that the economic corridor grow.  We in County Louth are at the very heart of that economic corridor, with two of the biggest towns in the country, Drogheda and Dundalk.  We have huge employment and export potential and tourism is improving and increasing.  Regrettably, there is no Minister in the constituency for the first time in many decades, which is a matter of concern to my constituents.  All Deputies in the county are working together to make life better for everybody.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, when section 50 is applied by the United Kingdom, the Government here should concentrate on recognising that fact and seek to have European agencies such as the European Medicines Agency, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, EBRD, and any other that may be based in England to relocate here.  That is an action plan that is needed and we should be ready to do it.  The Government should make sure Drogheda, the largest town in the country, will have a stand-alone local enterprise office, LEO, which should be the centre for enterprise in the region and a gateway city to Europe.  Co-operation, cohesion and economic links are very important.  Cross-Border trade is also very important.  If we co-operate and work together, we can make all of these ideas a possibility.<\/p>  <p>  Previous speakers have raised the issue of a Northern poll.  I am a Nationalist, like all my family and most people I know.  We favour a united Ireland but by consent.  If there was a poll tomorrow, we do not believe it would be successful.  It may even be divisive.  What will never be divisive is us working together, reaching out our hand, getting the agencies to meet.  I ask the Government to consider asking the regional bodies in the South to make immediate contact with the regional bodies in the North to talk about increased co-operation and working together.  Some years ago there was a Lord Mayor&rsquo;s cross-Border initiative in Dublin in respect of the Dublin-Belfast economic corridor.  The theme of its conference was \"2025\" and very positive suggestions were made.  That is the way forward.<\/p>  <p>  Several traders in my constituency are concerned about the impact of Brexit on Christmas shopping, the increase in smuggling and cross-Border trade which, if the value of sterling keeps going down, will place them at a very serious disadvantage.  There are huge economic problems arising from Brexit.  It is clear that we must do more to tackle them.  The North and the South working together is the way forward.  I would welcome progress in that regard.  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly is meeting this weekend and its meeting is timely.  Many of these proposals will be discussed.  It is a case of co-operation, working together, recognising what is happening and at the same time taking advantage of the situation.  If we are the only English-speaking nation which provides a gateway into the European Union, that is a huge opportunity for us to seize.  I urge the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs to work closely with all of his colleagues in Europe to that end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000029#BB00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1467295500,"counter":292,"content":"<p>Several immediate problems and challenges arise from the result of the referendum, particularly for exporters, those involved in the agribusiness, tourism and the retail sector and we need a detailed and an immediate response.  It is also important not to overstate the panic or not to engage in a panic reaction.  There is an opportunity for the Government to involve the Parliament in its reaction.  There is a need for a Brexit committee in some shape or form to be established in order that there can be monitoring of, and engagement with, all the implications for Ireland.  The local authorities should be involved because every county and local authority will feel some effect.  Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd spoke about some of the effects in Border counties.

Local enterprise offices should be tasked with coming up with some analysis of how each county will be hit in order that we can have a targeted response that will deal with the issues that matter.<\/p>  <p>  The scariest part of the result is that those who advocated the United Kingdom should leave do not seem to know what to do.

Subsequent events suggest they do not.  We do not know when they will press the button to engage the process.  There are different messages coming from the United Kingdom.

Every Department should assign responsibility for dealing with the Brexit consequences to someone at assistant secretary level in order that there will be some management and monitoring.<\/p>  <p>  Amidst the panic and recriminations we have to look into our own hearts and ask if there was a referendum on our membership of the European Union in the morning, how it would go.  We cannot give a guarantee as we used to.  I am on record as saying I firmly believe the European institutions walked away from us in our time of need.  The Commission, in its dealings with us and particularly in its dealings with Greece, in the way it rammed home an austerity programme which did not stand for anything in terms of cuts but re-engineered society, was wrong and removed from the principles of the European Union and its establishment, principles that hold today.<\/p>  <p>  We mark today the centenary of the Battle of the Somme.  That cannot happen because of the European Union and its achievements in bringing people around the table, but the European Union cannot be allowed to exempt itself from criticism.  I was struck all week in watching the response of the Commission and the Parliament to see that they were blaming Britain, politicians and everybody else, but they need to look at themselves, too, particularly in their engagement with this process in the coming weeks and months.  They need to reflect on how they have walked away and lost that sense of mission.  We, too, blame the European Union for many of our ills.  We tend to gold-plate regulations that come from Brussels and blame the Commission.  The same happens in the United Kingdom.  I was intrigued that the people of Hull which has one of the biggest ports in the United Kingdom, predominantly trading into and out of the European Union voted to leave.  The abandonment people felt, about which I heard on radio, was all due to London and lack of investment from there, but they took it out on the European Union.  Two national governments have to discover why politicians seem to have left communities behind and why these communities vent their frustration and anger in the manner they did last Thursday.<\/p><p>Let us not dismiss or ignore those who voted to leave.  They did so for a reason and we need to understand that, as well as urgently addressing the consequences for this country.  We need to involve as many people around the country, on an all-island basis, in our response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000029#BB00300","speaker":"1335","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467296100,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I want to join with my colleagues across the political divide in expressing my deep regret that the United Kingdom has taken the decision to leave the European Union and the Common Market.  This decision is a bad outcome for the UK, the EU and the Republic of Ireland.  Although I do not agree with the decision we, as a fully sovereign nation, must now accept and respect the will of the British electorate.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to leave the EU, while a major challenge for the UK, will ultimately and unfortunately lead the Republic of Ireland down a similar path of economic uncertainty.  It has the real possibility of derailing our strong recovery.  It is especially dangerous for my constituency, encompassing parts of Donegal, Cavan, all of Leitrim and Sligo, which will be faced with many economic issues if a border is put in place and sterling continues to fall.  This is why I believe the Parliament needs to be ready for the challenges which will most definitely arise.<\/p>  <p>  On this basis, I welcome the Government's swift announcement of Ireland's contingency plan and key actions which will seek to limit the damage Brexit will cause in the intervening period.  I hope there will be regular discussions and briefings between all of the leaders of the Opposition and the Taoiseach on this issue.  I say this as I believe that any political instability at home will only further aggravate the difficulties which we are now about to face.  If we are to be successful at limiting the damage of the exit decision, the Parliament, Government and elected Members of the Seanad, from all parties and none, need to work together to meet it head-on as one strong unified force.<\/p>  <p>  We need to focus our political efforts and negotiation skills on getting the best deal for Ireland in the forthcoming exit negotiations between Britain and the EU.  Most important, we need to fight for and secure the best possible deal for our Border with Northern Ireland, the common travel area, our trade and tourism industries and Irish citizens who reside and work in the UK.  As the UK is Ireland's largest customer for food and drink, our agriculture and agri-food industry trade with the UK must be protected.  We also need to ensure that tourism is not damaged by this decision.  As I am sure the Government is aware, over 3 million UK citizens visit the Republic of Ireland every year.  They are the lifeblood of many hotels, restaurants and SMEs throughout the country.  They are vital to ensuring that the recovery the industry has witnessed is not damaged in the future.  I also welcome the swift action taken by Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, Bord Bia and many other agencies and organisations over the past number of days which have sought to limit the damage caused by the decision or begun to seek new trade opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  I firmly believe the Republic of Ireland is better off aligned with Europe and is stronger in the European Union.  When we joined in 1973, Ireland was a completely different country.  The EU has and continues to revitalise Ireland's rural areas through funding from the European development fund.  It has, via the Common Agricultural Policy, strongly supported Irish farmers and allowed Ireland, a small nation on the periphery of Europe, to become a world leader on seven different occasions by holding the Presidency of the European Council.  Our small nation is better off with Europe and I hope the European Union can survive this, the most challenging period since its establishment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000030#CC00200","speaker":"1343"},{"type":"speech","time":1467296100,"counter":295,"content":"<p>It is fair to say that the only certainty to emerge from last Thursday's Brexit vote is that there will now be a period of prolonged uncertainty.  Whether we like it, we in Ireland are caught in the middle of the uncertainty.  The political turmoil in the UK is contributing to the economic fallout from its decision to vote to leave the European Union.  The impact of the Brexit vote on our economy will take some time to become clear, but it is very hard to see anything other than it having a very negative impact over the short and medium term.<\/p>  <p>  The outcome of the referendum is very disappointing, but we have to respect the views of voters.  We still have the right to say that we regard the outcome as a bad result for Ireland, the United Kingdom and the European Union as a whole.  Fianna F&aacute;il is very clear that while the outcome of this referendum will have far-reaching and wide-ranging implications for Ireland, it does not and should not change our relationship with European Union.  We will not support any move to follow the lead of the UK and leave the European Union, and will instead work from within to reform the EU and rebuild European solidarity and cohesion.  On Monday, sterling fell to a 31 year low against the dollar.<\/p>  <p>  A very worrying aspect has crept into behaviour in parts of the UK.  In the past few days despicable graffiti was daubed on a Polish community centre and verbal abuse was hurled at individuals because they were members of ethnic minorities.  We cannot and will not stand for hate crime or these kinds of attacks.  They must be stamped out.<\/p>  <p>  What does this mean for Ireland?  We are in uncharted territory.  Ireland and Britain have enjoyed a special relationship for many years.  The common travel area has been in existence since the 1920s.  The Irish and British Governments have agreed reciprocal visa arrangements, including passport-free travel, measures to increase the security of the external common travel area border and to share immigration data between the two countries' immigration authorities.  We need to be cognisant of how this special relationship will change as a result of the referendum outcome and must do all we can to try to preserve the common travel area as any change will have significant effects on the labour market, trade, exports and tourism.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, while the vote to remain won in Northern Ireland, the overall result means that the issue of a Border re-emerging between North and South is now a real and live issue.  A recently published report by the House of Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee noted that there are nearly 300 formal crossing points between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as many informal crossings.  This indicates the scale and complexity of the issues before us.<\/p>  <p>  Northern Ireland will now share a land border with an EU member country, which will undoubtedly bring its own difficulties.  We need to avoid knee-jerk reactions and work constructively with the European Union and the United Kingdom to come to some sensible arrangement that will minimise, as much as possible, the re-emergence of a hard border which would be a regressive step on many levels.<\/p>  <p>  There is a real concern among pensioners living in Ireland, in particular those in receipt of English pensions, as to whether they will continue to be paid and about the fall in the rate of sterling.  People on a fixed income who depend on these pensions do not need the added strain of this uncertainty.  I acknowledge the comments of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, that he will make a particular effort to ensure cross-Border workers and pensioners retain all of the rights they currently have.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Tourist Industry Confederation said it was as yet unclear what the Brexit vote means for the industry here.  However, uncertainty is certainly not good for business.  Britain remains the largest source market for inbound visitors to Ireland.  According to the CSO, 3.55 million visitors came to Ireland in 2015, a market value of approximately &euro;995 million for the Irish economy.  The fall in sterling and potential weaknesses in the UK economy mean that Ireland's competitiveness is more vital than ever.  In my constituency, Kildare South, the agriculture and equine industries have a significant relationship with Britain.  Irish agribusiness is now bracing itself for the outcome of the Brexit result as the UK remains its prime market outlet.  Primary trade between North and South and EU and non-EU approved ingredients and how they would be labelled and marketed are also of real concern to Irish farmers.<\/p>  <p>  Some 50% of Ireland's total beef exports go to the UK and are worth &euro;2 billion, followed by one third of our total dairy exports which are worth &euro;1 billion.  With the UK leaving the EU, a drop in Irish exports of between &euro;150 million and &euro;800 million can be expected.  We have to ensure this does not happen.  We need a calm, stable and measured approach.<\/p><p>Our main focus should be on doing all that we can to protect Ireland's interests and ensure we are shielded as much as possible from the negative consequences of a European Union without the United Kingdom.  We should also look at opportunities that might be presented to us.  I met people just now who have been living in China and who have just moved back to Ireland and they spoke about the potential for a very positive relationship with China.  That is something we should consider.  In Kildare we have Kildare Village, which is very popular with Chinese people who come to Europe and visit Kildare to do their shopping there.  While this is a crisis, there are opportunities we must consider as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000030#CC00300","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1467296700,"counter":297,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions - Priority Questions","time":1467296700,"counter":299,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000031#DD00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"JobPath Implementation","time":1467296700,"counter":300,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000031#DD00700"},{"type":"question","time":1467296700,"counter":301,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[18818\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000031#DD00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the assurances that can be provided that jobseekers who have been selected for the JobPath activation scheme will not be forced into unsuitable and inappropriate jobs given that participation on JobPath is mandatory; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1467296700,"counter":302,"content":"<p>In tabling the question I wish to emphasise that we do not oppose the provision of programmes to help people to get back into work, but we are very concerned about any question or element of coercion into inappropriate or unsuitable employment, in particular now that the service has been privatised and there is a profit motive at the end of it.

The updated national action plan for social inclusion identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing poverty.  The goals include a focus on early childhood development, youth exclusion, access to the labour market, migrant integration, social housing and affordable energy.  The national social target, set in 2010, is to reduce consistent poverty to 4% by 2016 and to 2% or less by 2020.  The target is to lift over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020.  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the Europe 2020 poverty target is to lift a minimum of 200,000 people out of combined poverty, namely, at-risk-of-poverty and-or basic deprivation, by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  These targets are now more challenging than when they were set because poverty rates rose substantially during the recession from 2009 to 2013.  However, the CSO survey on income and living conditions, SILC, shows that for the first time since the crisis, poverty levels stabilised in 2014.  Consistent poverty decreased marginally to 8% while consistent poverty among children was 11.2%.  We expect those positive trends will have continued in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The full impact of the recovery is not yet reflected in these 2014 figures.  Ireland has returned to strong economic and employment growth.  The unemployment rate in May 2016 was 7.8%, down from a peak of 15% in 2012.  As unemployment is strongly linked to poverty, we can expect further decreases in poverty as the figures for 2015 and 2016 become available.  It is envisaged that 2015 data will be released in November next.<\/p>  <p>  Social transfers play a crucial role in alleviating poverty and inequality.  In 2014, social transfers, excluding pensions, reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate from 37.2% to 15.6%, thereby lifting over a fifth of the population out of income poverty.<\/p><p>Ireland is the best performing EU member state in reducing poverty through social transfers.

I attended a very good conference on child poverty last week, organised by the Children's Rights Alliance.  All of the NGOs and groups there were of the same opinion, namely, when it comes to cash transfers such as child benefit and benefit payments, Ireland actually has among the highest payments in the EU.  Where we fall down badly is on services, such as child care, and because people on low incomes have to pay to see their doctor, when they do not have to do so in other countries.  I will, of course, be looking for measures in the budget that increase income supports targeted at those who need them the most, but the real focus has to be on improving services and also on getting people into work.  No welfare payment can compete with a well-paid job.  We need more people in work and we need to focus particularly on services.  An extra &euro;5 a month in child benefit costs &euro;60 million but &euro;60 million invested in speech and language or early intervention in child care goes so much further when it comes to the alleviation of poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000033#FF00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1467297900,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I do not disagree with that.

Back in 2014 the Government set a target for reducing consistent poverty, which was then at 8%, to 4% by 2016.  However, it is still at 8%, so the figure has not moved at all.  In addition, a target was set in 2014 to take 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020.  I am now reliably informed that the number of children who will have to be taken out of consistent poverty by 2020 to enable the Government to meet that target is 97,000 because, again, the figure has not moved at all.  Is the Minister confident he will realise his ambition to take 97,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020 and that he will get the rate of consistent poverty down from 8% to 2% by 2020, in view of the fact it has not moved at all since the target was originally set in 2014?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000033#FF00400","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1467297900,"counter":335,"content":"<p>The figure was 8% for 2014 and, as we will not have the figure for 2016 until the end of 2017, we will not know how much lower it is than 8% until then.

Interestingly, the reason the number of children we have to take out of poverty has gone up from 70,000 to 97,000 is not because living conditions for children have fallen in that period but because of the rise in median incomes.  For example, if the pension for pensioners is increased but nothing is done for children, child poverty increases because of the relativities involved.  If, for example, we restored pay for young teachers, nurses and garda&iacute;, most of whom do not have children in poverty, that actually increases the child poverty figure.  What we do not want to do is meet the targets by suppressing people's incomes; we want to reach them by improving people's living conditions.

A few weeks ago my Department wrote to a cohort of jobseeker customers, who are classified as casual jobseekers, offering the option of payment into a bank account.  These customers are in work and claim a jobseeker's payment for two to three days per week, or work week on, week off.  They were paid by cheque each week due to the changing nature of their work and claiming patterns and the short turnaround time to issue and collect payments.  This group of customers was not paid by post offices under the Department&rsquo;s existing cash payments contract with An Post, although I expect many of them cashed their cheques in the post office.  The vast majority have responded and opted for payment to a bank account.<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that no further letters are being issued to this group.  My Department has developed its payment capacity in respect of changing work and claiming patterns, and is offering payments direct to accounts in financial institutions for casual jobseeker customers.

Farm assist recipients retain the advantages of the jobseeker's allowance scheme such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2016 Revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure of &euro;85 million per year on the farm assist scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Changes introduced in budgets 2012 and 2013 brought the farm assist scheme into closer alignment with the jobseeker's allowance scheme's treatment of self-employed people.  Farming families with the lowest incomes were the least impacted by these changes as the headline rates of farm assist were maintained.<\/p>  <p>  Farm assist customers continue to receive more beneficial treatment than other self-employed persons as payments received under the agri-environment options scheme, the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and the National Parks and Wildlife Service farm plan scheme are assessed separately from other farm income.  Farm assist remains a flexible payment and any farmer experiencing lower levels of income or cashflow issues due, for example, to bad weather can ask his or her local Intreo office to review the level of means applying to his or her claim.<\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government contains a commitment to undertake a review of the farm assist scheme, recognising the challenges facing farmers on low incomes.  I have asked my officials to review the farm assist scheme from a policy and administrative point of view.  This review has commenced and its recommendations will be considered in the context of the budget for 2017, subject to the overall budgetary context.

Is he willing to attend the Oireachtas committee dealing with rural development to discuss this very major rural issue in order that we can consider in detail the ramifications of the policy decision made?  Are farmers getting any relief under the farm assist scheme by virtue of being on the NPWS scheme?

The farming community across all sectors of farming, be it dairy, beef, poultry, pigmeat or whatever, are facing a very serious income crisis which has been ongoing for some time.  Many small-scale farmers who come to our clinics and are in touch with us weekly have practically no income at present and are in very serious circumstances.  They are very anxious to see the farm assist payment brought back at least to the 2011 level because at the time there was a basic income supplement through farm assist that is not available at present.  This year has been one of the most difficult for the farming community in many years, and there is a real crisis, particularly among the smaller-scale producers but also the medium and larger producers also.  Farm assist can help out the smaller-scale farmers about whom I am very concerned.

Applications for DCA in 2015 were 33% higher than in 2013.  Applications for carer's allowance in 2015 were 25% higher than in 2013.

One of these actions is a proposal for the Departments of Health and Social Protection to work together to pursue a fit for work programme to support more people with an illness or disability to get back to work through early intervention.  The fit for work proposal is based on the findings of a pan-European study, which examined the impact of musculoskeletal disorders, MSDs, on an individual&rsquo;s ability to work.  The key module of this study was progressed by the fit for work coalition.  There are stakeholders led by Arthritis Ireland, the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICTU, IBEC and the Health and Safety Authority.  They all contributed to the study.<\/p>  <p>  Early interventions and developing return to work practices in the case of people with musculoskeletal incapacities is consistent with my Department&rsquo;s approach to illness-disability income support, which aims to reduce the number of people progressing to chronic disability and long-term social welfare dependency.  To this end, my Department issued, in 2015, a set of certification guidelines for GPs, which sets out defined periods of recovery for common medical conditions, including MSDs. <\/p>  <p>  The certification guidelines build on the Renaissance project, which was an initiative of my Department back in 2003.

I believe economic and labour market conditions have changed considerably for the better since the scheme was introduced in 2011 and that the time is now right for a much more targeted scheme.   <\/p>  <p>  JobBridge has been very successful in meeting its objectives over the past five years.  It helped about 19,000 mainly small employers to provide valuable work experience to nearly 48,000 unemployed jobseekers.  An independent evaluation of JobBridge published in 2013 found that overall satisfaction levels with the scheme were very high.  That was the view of the participants.  Two thirds of participants would recommend the scheme to a friend or family member, and levels of abuse of the scheme by employers were comparatively low.  Most notably, the evaluation found that 61% of participants progressed into paid employment within a short period of time without completing their internship.  As the Deputy will know, that compares most favourably with community employment, CE, and other schemes.  This is a very high progression rate and suggests that JobBridge has been instrumental in helping about 30,000 jobseekers to secure employment.  <\/p>  <p>  I have asked the Labour Market Council to assist the Department in designing the new scheme.  The Labour Market Council includes representatives from the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, INOU, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, IBEC and a number of leading labour market economists.  <\/p>  <p>  It is also important that the design of a new scheme be informed by the best evidence possible.  It is for this reason that I intend to await the results of a second large-scale evaluation of JobBridge currently under way before finalising the design of any replacement scheme.  The results of this evaluation, which is again being undertaken by Indecon, are expected in September and in September I will announce my proposals for a new scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000038#LL01300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1467300900,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I strongly dispute the notion that a high progression rate from JobBridge into work was proven.

What it indicated, therefore, was that there was a substitution going on, a replacement of work for free labour.<\/p>  <p>  There is a problem in terms of the Labour Market Council being the body that consults on this.  It is a bit like having the former Senator, Joe O'Toole, oversee water charges when he is clearly in favour of water charges.

I have received many queries from distraught parents who are trying to acquire the best possible education and supports for children with autism at primary and secondary levels.  Those in the latter face State exams and must have access to the necessary supports, but I will use this short time to discuss primary education.<\/p>  <p>  Primary schools are getting holidays this week and pupils are looking forward to summer.  Many parents are preparing their young children to attend primary school in September, a significant milestone in anyone's life.  The Minister supports the notion that every child deserves access to a full education, an equal chance to attend school at the appropriate age and within reasonable reach of his or her home, and to be educated in the manner most suitable to him or her.<\/p>  <p>  South Kildare has been frustrated by a lack of resources for primary schoolchildren with autism.  In recent weeks, four parents have approached my constituency office to report that their children, each of whom is well above schoolgoing age, cannot get places in the county, let alone near their homes or in the schools attended by their siblings.  One case went through section 29 and the school made it clear that it would happily accommodate the child by opening another classroom were funding provided, but this was turned down.  A sibling with autism is attending the same school and doing well.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the initiative in Kildare-Wicklow of the autism register.  As an education professional, I believe we must stop simply fighting fires.  The recent census had no way of recording whether a child had special needs, such as autism.  That did not bode well in terms of planning ahead.<\/p>  <p>  The situation faced by the families in question is not being resolved.  Section 2 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, EPSEN, required that a child with special educational needs should be educated in an inclusive environment with children who did not have such needs unless the nature or degree of the child's needs were such that to do so would be inconsistent with his or best interests and the effective provision of education for the other children.  Twelve years on and with a greater knowledge of what is required in schools for all children, including those with autistic spectrum disorders, ASDs, any progress has been whittled away, there has been no reduction in class sizes, there has been yo-yoing on the entitlement to special needs assistants, SNAs, and there has been no year-on-year increase in the number of ASD classes when the demand obviously exceeds the supply.  There are fewer than 20 ASD classes at primary level in south Kildare.  Each can accommodate six children, amounting to 120 across the constituency.  The Department has not sanctioned new classes for that part of the country for the coming school year, resulting in only those places vacated by children, usually in moving to secondary level, becoming available.  The Minister has referred to a range of placement options and supports for schools that have enrolled pupils with ASD, but what of the options for children who cannot enroll?  Must they wait until next year?  Will there be places then?  How long should a child wait before a place becomes available?<\/p>  <p>  The proposed national autism registry is intended to highlight the shortfall in education and health services for children with ASD.  The pilot phase has been launched in Kildare-west Wicklow and I encourage parents to register, as it is essential for the advanced planning of resources that accurate information, including medical and educational histories, be gathered on each child from diagnosis through development.  I hope the register helps to provide a symbiotic relationship between health and education in terms of children with autism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000040#NN00800","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1467302100,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.

It presents a picture that is better than the one she has painted.  Therefore, I would like to see the south Kildare data.<\/p><p>Overall, there are 14,000 students with ASD in the school system, of whom some 63% are educated in mainstream classes, 23% in special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools and 14% in special schools.<\/p> <p> The position on special classes, an issue the Deputy raised in particular, is that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, recently published a list of special classes for the coming 2016-17 school year.  In total, 1,153 special classes will be available.  This represents an increase of over 100% on the number of special classes available in 2001.  There will have been 605 additional special classes provided, many of them for students with ASD.  The number of ASD classes at primary level in the 2016-17 school year will be 652, which represents a 15% increase approximately on the 2015-16 figure.  In one year there has been a 15% increase in the number of classes.  Therefore, there is substantial expansion occurring.<\/p> <p> There should be no child with special educational needs who cannot find a school place because the NCSE will assess the needs of each child with special educational needs.  Many are accommodated in mainstream classes, but in each case the child will be assigned the required resource teaching and SNA supports in order that he or she can participate in class.  As I stated, there is an increasing trend towards the provision of special classes.  There has been growth of 100% in the space of just five years.  What I have outlined represents growth of over 20% per year.  As this represents substantial expansion, I would be disturbed to think the picture was different in south Kildare.  The rights I have described are automatic and there have been no constraints.  The schedule from which these resources are applied was reduced at the height of the recession in 2012, but the number of resource teachers in the system has been increased.  The number of SNAs has increased by almost 22%, while the number of resource teachers has expanded by 9% in just one year.  Therefore, it is growing very rapidly.  Close to &euro;1.5 billion of our budget is devoted specifically to special education.<\/p> <p> The EPSEN Act is the gold standard for the personal education plan for each child and we are moving towards it.  Each school is expected to have a personal plan for each child.  It is a legal requirement, but until we have rolled out the infrastructure to underpin it, it will be hard to trigger the Act, as it stands.  However, it is certainly the target we are trying to reach.<\/p> <p> I will undertake to obtain more data, specifically for County Kildare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000040#NN01100","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467302700,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for outlining the improvements made.  I acknowledge the excellent work taking place in the special unit in Scoil na Naomh Uilig in Newbridge and the Educate Together school in Kildare town.  While the figures the Minister gives are comforting in general, it does nothing to address the four specific sets of circumstances I have outlined.  I would be very happy to forward the details directly to the Department.  I am absolutely sure there are no places for the children in question within County Kildare.  One family has been offered a place in Dublin, but, as the Minister can appreciate, it is very difficult to take up this offer if there are other children in the family.  In the case in question, a sibling must travel to school ten miles from the family home in Newbridge.  It is difficult to cater for a child with autism in such circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  As we must acknowledge, a diagnosis of autism should result in a child being provided with the required services.  In some cases, however, it is actually shutting a child out from services.  There is a very high rate of mental health issues among those with autism because there is an increased risk of anxiety disorders, mood disorders and ADD.  This is not to mention the mental health issues and stress that can arise among parents and siblings.  A lack of intervention without a diagnosis of a condition compounds the problem.<\/p>  <p>  There are many cases in addition to the four I have mentioned in which families are having difficulty in dealing with a diagnosis.  It is very difficult for parents to face a future for their child that they had not imagined.  Sometimes cases are not presented until it is too late and behaviours can be entrenched.  Already parents of children with autism must fight for their children every step of the way.  A place in a school in the child's own environment must be a basic requirement and not be required only after waiting to see what the new register presents.  I would be very happy to forward details the four cases mentioned to the Minister who I appreciate will come back to me with the figures for south Kildare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000041#OO00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1467302700,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I would welcome receiving the details.

Unfortunately, the second phase of the school has not been identified and we do not know when this will occur.  This also applies to the third phase and more prefabs are to be built.  Obviously, therefore, the school is expanding.<\/p>  <p>  I was driving home only the other day when I passed yet another development in Lusk.  That is good news and it is great that people are moving to lovely north County Dublin, but, unfortunately, it will bring with it additional pressures on the school system.  There is no gym in the school in question.  The local sports clubs, namely, the GAA, athletics and soccer clubs, are coming together to spearhead an initiative, under the heading of Lusk 2020, that will involve building adjacent to the school.  Obviously, we want to be in a position to tackle issues such as childhood obesity and associated problems, but this will not be possible in an expanding school with no gym available.<\/p>  <p>  I will not need the full four minutes because my question is very simple.  When will we see the next phases of the school project commence?  It is not acceptable that pupils are being accommodated in prefabs.  This issue has been raised with me by a number of constituents.  We happened to be compiling a petition on the reduction of Garda services and the closure of a Garda station when the issue of the school was raised with us by several people in the area.  They want to know when the school will be built.  They are not happy that their children are being accommodated in prefabs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000041#OO00500","speaker":"1302"}]
