That calls into the question the Government's true agenda and whether it is able to run the country in the way it has been elected to do.<\/p><p>I refer to the mortgage to rent scheme, a pillar of Labour Party policy.  Labour Party Senators were among the first to recommend such an approach, although I recommended it in a report for the Joint Committee on Social Protection three years ago.  The reality is, as Mr. Justice Dunne said in the High Court recently, the scheme gives false hope to those in mortgage difficulty.  Is not working out; it is a sham.  The record showed last summer that only one transaction had been completed.  Last week when Bank of Ireland officials appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, they informed us 13 transactions had been completed or were being looked at, yet Labour Party representatives all over the country are issuing statements about the scheme offering great hope.  Leaflets about the scheme are being dropped through letter boxes.  People are attending my clinics saying the scheme will save them, but, unfortunately, it will not.<\/p><p>The Government parties are playing with the emotions of those in mortgage difficulty by making such loud noises about the scheme when a High Court judge has had cause to say it is not working out.  It is worrying that the scheme is the only response from the Government to protect those in mortgage difficulty.  Everything else in place was introduced by the previous Government.  I invite Government Members to outline what is in place for those in mortgage difficulty that was not in place under the previous Government.  They will only find the mortgage to rent scheme.  At least one person in five is in mortgage difficulty and time after time, the Government has taken the side of the banks, as we witnessed yesterday in the debate on the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012.  With the usual wave of the hand, the Minister for Justice and Equality said that, unfortunately, normal commercial contract law applied to those in mortgage difficulty and that they had to pay their way.  However, normal commercial contract law does not apply to many other groups and, in particular, the banks and the Government parties have given them a veto.  They abolished mortgage interest relief, thus forcing people to negotiate with their banks without giving them any help.  The Banks have also been allowed to run amok with interest rates.  The mortgage to rent scheme is a public relations exercise for the Labour Party.<\/p> <p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, come to the House to discuss the failure of the mortgage to rent scheme and outline to the people, including those with mortgage difficulties, what hope there is for them, and apologise to them for having given false hope and putting in place a scheme that simply has not worked out, as a High Court judge said this week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112200002#A00500","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353580200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>While I am sure Senator Thomas Byrne has read the Regling-Watson report, he has obviously forgotten it, like most of the Members on the other side of the House.

I had not intended to speak on this subject but was so greatly moved by the dignity, composure and solemn grief of Mr. Halappanavar that I feel bound to say something.  Two points, in particular, made by Mr. Halappanavar really struck home.  He reiterated that when his wife was desperately, mortally ill and when both begged that the procedure that might have saved her life be carried out, they were told this was a Catholic country.  Once again, it is deeply offensive that the preservation of some kind of abstract system should be put ahead of the life of a living human being, wife, daughter and sister.  It is shocking.  Mr. Halappanavar spoke of the bigger life.  That is a very simple concept, but it is telling.<\/p><p>Some years ago citizens were misled into voting as they did in a referendum that I considered was wrong at the time.  It is wrong to second-guess the people, but they were misled.  I remember saying in this House that I found it profoundly shocking that the same right to life would be given to the fertilised ovum as to a fully developed human being who might be a wife, mother, sister or daughter.  What are the people in question - principally men, including men in churches and celibate men in the case of one church - thinking of when they put the same value on a tiny organism with potential, for which I would have respect, as on people of realised potential?  As somebody who is strongly pro-life - I want this to echo in the Chamber - I recognise that there are circumstances such as those we have just witnessed in which, sadly, the question of abortion must be raised and faced.  We have failed significantly to face it.  It is wrong that the language should be taken over.  Who are the &quot;unborn&quot;?  It is like the &quot;undead&quot; or being non-Catholic in this country.  I feel very strongly about this issue.  From where did this come?  It came from a group that was strongly motivated.  I am sure the group's members' motivations were, in their own minds, very good, but they are featuring again.  What is the Iona Institute?  What is its background?  How is it funded?

I ask the Minister for Finance to recognise, when framing the budget, that the motor industry in Ireland employs in the region of 40,000 people.  I ask him to ensure the budget will not reduce this number in the coming year.  I appeal to him to consider, in particular, the introduction of a mid-year vehicle registration system.  Rather than having every purchase registered at beginning of the year, one could encourage sales in the second half of the year.  This issue has been debated in the public domain recently.  Doing what I suggest would provide a mid-year stimulus for the motor industry.  Traditionally, there has been a significant number of sales in January and very little activity later in the year.  It is believed that instead of purchasing a car in the second half of a given year, one is better off waiting until the beginning of the following year.<\/p> <p>If there was a change of number plate from which it was easily identifiable that the car was purchased in the second half of the year, it would stimulate some activity in the trade.  I understand there is some equalising to be done with the vehicle registration tax system regarding older vehicles versus newer models.  When restructuring the system, I hope the Minister will not make it a disincentive to change one's vehicle in the coming year.  I also appeal to him to ensure the incentives already in place for electric and hybrid vehicles remain after the budget.  The car industry employs 40,000 people.  It has seen a drop from the 2007 figure of 50,000.

On October 21, Emily O'Reilly, the Ombudsman, decided to exercise her right to make a special report to the D\u00e1il and the Seanad because of an unsatisfactory response from the Department of Health and the Minister.  It deserves our urgent consideration because citizens over the age of 66 years have been denied and continue to be denied access to the mobility allowance scheme, even though this is illegal.  It is not fair or just to senior citizens.  As the Ombudsman stated in her report, is it because these citizens are too old to be equal?<\/p><p>The ramifications of this case go beyond justice for the senior citizens who are being illegally denied a service they are entitled to access.<\/p> <p>The first serious implication is that the rule of law need no longer apply based on an administrative decision by the Department or Minister, for in this case the Department and the Minister know their actions are illegal, but have refused to accept the Ombudsman's recommendations and give older people their entitlement on the grounds that it would create liabilities that the State could not afford.  The disregard for the rule of law involved in this approach is breathtaking and scandalous.  It may well be done on the assumption that the older citizens involved do not have the resources or aggressiveness to challenge the illegality in the courts.<\/p><p>The second most serious implication is the contempt shown for the Office of the Ombudsman and the demeaning of her role by the failure of the Department of Health to abide by the commitments made to her to bring the operation of the scheme into compliance by the end of October.

However, he does not simply need sympathy; he needs support from the State and all politicians.  The only way he will get this support is if we have an independent public inquiry.  Any inquiry that does not have the support of the Halappanavar family will not work or do justice to what happened in Galway some weeks ago.  Everyone is keen to hear the truth and see justice and everyone is keen to see an inquiry that will bring about justice.  However, any inquiry which does not have the family front and centre would be wrong.<\/p><p>Yesterday, the Taoiseach engaged in megaphone diplomacy by speaking to the Halappanavar family through the D\u00e1il.  The Taoiseach and the Minister should be engaging directly with the family instead.  The inquiry is important but we have a greater responsibility to legislate because that is what we are elected to do in the D\u00e1il and the Seanad.  I was offended by some of the disgraceful comments from Labour Party and Fine Gael representatives in the D\u00e1il yesterday when this issue was being discussed.  My party was labelled opportunistic for bringing forward a simple, moderate motion calling for legislation on the X case.  No political party in Ireland could be accused of being opportunistic for raising a sensitive, complex and divisive issue such as abortion.  There is nothing to be gained politically by anyone on this issue.  What can and should be gained is a realisation that we, as legislators, should do what we were elected to do - that is, to make laws to protect women and to ensure medical professionals have the proper advice and guidance.  That is what yesterday's motion was about.  Regardless, on two occasions in the D\u00e1il in recent months both Government parties have voted down suggestions and amendments to legislation which would have filled this gap.  I put it to the Leader and every legislator in the State that we should do what we have been elected to do - that is, to legislate for the X case and provide certainty for medical professionals.  More importantly, we should do the right thing by the women of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112200005#D00300","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1353581400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>We have been discussing this tragic case in Galway for two weeks now.  From the outset I requested an independent inquiry.  I realise we are in a logjam situation at the moment.  Incredible sensitivities are involved in this case.  I appeal for openness on both sides in order that we can proceed in the interests of truth and justice, bearing in mind that a grieving husband is involved.<\/p><p>I wish to raise an issue about which I am most concerned - that is, the increasing levels of new teacher unemployment.  A number of graduates in Galway have come to me to say they are only getting an occasional day substituting here and there.  One case involved a young man who had applied for 131 places but got only two interviews.  More important is the lack of places for new teachers to work their probation.  There was a time when one left college and had up to five years to do this, but the last Government brought this down to three years.  I appeal to the Minister for Education and Skills and I call on the Leader to ask that he increase this by at least one year to four years.  Many of these young people are at the end of their three years and cannot be full teachers, which means they cannot travel abroad as qualified teachers.  I question the wisdom of continuing to train more teachers if we cannot at a minimum provide places for them to do their probation.  One easy way to do this immediately is to extend the period from three years to at least four years.  Obviously, if there is a lack of places and jobs they will need more time.  We should be smart and think of our young people, the talent base of our future generations when it comes to teaching and learning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112200005#D00400","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1353581400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I second the proposal of Senator Kathryn Reilly on the jobs issue.  Several calls have been made this morning from both sides of the House with regard to a public inquiry into the unfortunate death of Mrs. Halappanavar in Galway recently.  I am unsure but I know my party is seeking this and it may well be a way of doing it.<\/p> <p>If it could be done without having legal costs involved, I would be enthusiastic about it but if it cannot be done without them, then we must be careful.  <\/p><p>Another issue arises in this case.  A woman from my area died in hospital a number of years ago when she contracted MRSA and it subsequently transpired that she picked up that infection from taking a shower.  The Halappanavar case is highly emotive but we should remember that every year people die in hospitals in questionable circumstances.  Whatever we do here and whatever template is applied, all other people who are bereaved must be entitled to similar consideration and to a similar system for getting at the truth.  That is an important point of principle.  When I think back on the many sad cases I have heard of, some of which were never mentioned in this House, I realise how important it is that we have a proportionate and fair balance in this case.  These are very emotive and personal issues for families, who are really traumatised by what happens in these situations, of which we must be mindful.<\/p><p>In the circumstances, to proceed with the current inquiry is a mistake because without the active participation and support of the family, it is difficult to see what it can actually achieve.  I call on the Minister to move away from the current inquiry proposal and to try to devise a system which will be acceptable to the family.  <\/p><p>A comment was made in the House today to the effect that everybody is pro-life and would that it was so.  I have heard people who are looking for liberal abortion regimes and who are in favour of under 16s being entitled to an abortion without parental consent and, unfortunately, one of those is the chairman of this inquiry.  I am calling on the Minister to have him step down from this inquiry because a broad proportion of this population would not have confidence in him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112200005#D00500","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353582000,"counter":45,"content":"<p>This is entirely inappropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112200006#E00400","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1353582000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Senator Walsh, I ruled on this matter yesterday.

Anyone who watched the \"Prime Time\" interview with Praveen Halappanavar last night could not fail to be moved by his dignity, the extent of his grief and the appalling situation that he is in.  Clearly, a genuinely independent inquiry is needed and the key issue is that it would meet the needs of the family of Savita Halappanavar, as President Michael D. Higgins has said, in very careful terms.  The Government must move quickly to ensure that such an inquiry is set up.  It does not need to be a fully public tribunal and people are rightly concerned about the length of time, the extent of legal challenges and so forth that such a model might entail.  We have plenty of other models of independent inquiries.  Indeed, HIQA could carry one out and some of the genuinely independent people who have been appointed to the inquiry team could be involved in that.  The key issue is that it must be done in consultation with the family.<\/p><p>Also, as events have unfolded - those of us who were at last night's vigil outside the D\u00e1il will be conscious of this - a real consensus is emerging on the need for legislation on foot of the expert group report that is going to the Cabinet next week.  We need to see a Government commitment to legislate.  If the Government was to make that decision at the Cabinet next week and announce it, that would be very useful.  We could then, in the D\u00e1il and the Seanad, debate the content of the legislation in light of the expert group's report.  <\/p><p>I remind Members that a briefing will be held at midday in meeting room A of Leinster House on the separation of church and State, which I am hosting, with Atheist Ireland.

Whether the inquiry is public or sworn, the HSE will be seen to have a horse in the race and no HSE employees should be conducting this inquiry.   They should be witnesses to it.

The HSE is obliged to carry out an inquiry and there is no question that the country needs answers.

The most important point we must remember at the conclusion of the debate on the Bill is that Civil Defence is not solely about governance and regulations but about the volunteers who give of their time to this great organisation.  I have no doubt that this work will continue into the future.  We all know that the role of Civil Defence has expanded over many years and I have no doubt that this will continue to be the case.  The role played by the organisation in the local community will also grow.  Some Senators mentioned local festivals and instances of flooding.  When nobody else is willing to do the work local Civil Defence volunteers give generously of their time to ensure a professional job is done.  They are to be found in every county and town.<\/p><p>Looking to the future of the organisation, the paramount aim is that volunteers will continue their work.  After the Bill is passed in both Houses, we will look for a cross-section of views from all stakeholders, including Civil Defence members, the local authorities, the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, city and county managers and the HSE.  We will bring them together and ensure their views are heard.  The legislation only involves the dissolution of the board.  The great work done by Civil Defence will continue into the future.  There is no doubt that we are in changing and recessionary times.  As Minister of State, I will do my best to ensure the current budget will hold.  It is all about finances and seeking an agreement from the Minister for Finance that Civil Defence should hold its budget.  <\/p><p>Another point was mentioned.  How do we encourage young people to join this great organisation?  If they do, they will receive absolutely brilliant leadership skills which they can use not only in Civil Defence but in other voluntary organisations also.  Membership of Civil Defence gives young volunteers great standing and offers leadership skills in whatever job opportunities of which they may avail.  I have been a member of many interview panels and noticed that those who have been members of Civil Defence show genuine leadership skills that many in other organisations do not possess, on which I compliment the organisation and its leaders.  <\/p><p>I compliment the outgoing board on the service it has given to this great organisation in recent years.

Higgins and the Being Young and Irish implementation group at \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in.  The report captured the views of nearly 800 young people who took part in a wide-ranging consultation process over a number of months earlier this year.  Contributions were made by e-mail, post and video.  It was an integrated and dynamic process to include as many young people as possible and to hear as many views as possible.  <\/p><p>The most common recurring themes were issues of employment and unemployment, the economy, sustainable economies, social security, political reform and accountability, education for life, equality, the involvement of young people in institutional decision-making, positive thinking, health and mental health, community, civil society, solidarity, cultural identity and language issues.  <\/p><p>We have been told that young people are disengaged from the political system.  The proposals in this report and also the Taking Charge of Change declaration demonstrate that this is not necessarily the case.  We do not want the Government to sit on this report because we do not wish to alienate young people from the decision-making democratic process.  I ask the Minister if any proposals from the Being Young and Irish initiative will be pursued and whether there is a proposed timeline for its implementation.  Has there been any interaction with the group?  These proposals are the result of a very wide-ranging consultation process with 800 young people and from the participants in the regional conferences.  The presidency seminar was held only 11 days ago in \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in.  <\/p><p>I raised this matter because I do not want this initiative to be lost.  The Government should embrace the initiative which has been the focus of such wide-ranging dialogue and consultation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112200011#M01600","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1353585600,"counter":198,"content":"<\/a> <p>I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who is unable to be present to take this Adjournment matter.  I thank the Senator for raising it.<\/p><p>The Ministe was delighted to join the President in welcoming the launch of the report on the Being Young and Irish initiative on Saturday.  The Minister paid tribute, not just to the impressive work that took place in developing the declaration, but to the detailed consultations with young people held earlier this year, in which they were invited to share their views through multimedia and at four regional workshops.<\/p><p>There are more than 600,000 young people in Ireland in the age range 17 to 26 years.  This is the age range which is presented in the report, representing a comprehensive study of range of issues.  A number of these issues apply to a wider age range, and are being considered in a broader context.  However, the views of this age cohort must be given equal standing as those from other sectors of society.<\/p><p>The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is developing a children and young people's policy framework to set priorities for the period 2013 to 2017.  The framework will provide a whole-of-government policy approach for children and young people.  Within this overall policy framework a more detailed youth strategy will be developed.  The Department will look carefully at the report in developing both the policy framework and the youth strategy.<\/p><p>The Minister for Children and Youth affairs is fully committed to the participation of young people in decision-making.  The Department supports the work of 34 Comhairle na n\u00d3g groups which act as local councils for those aged 12 to 18 years.  Greater consideration needs to be given to participation by young adults.  It is sometimes assumed that as young people over 18 have the vote they are as well positioned as anyone else to influence decisions.  However, as the experience of the women's movement shows, the franchise is only the starting point in having one's voice heard.  In developing the youth strategy, the Department will consider how citizen participation by young adults can be promoted.<\/p><p>The Department has conducted a consultation of 67,000 children and young people to inform the policy framework and the youth strategy.  A further public consultation was conducted recently, in which members of the general public were invited to participate.  This invitation led to over 1,000 submissions which are being analysed.  The output of the Being Young and Irish initiative provides us with another important resource in this process, as young adults represent a distinct and important cohort who must also be heard.<\/p><p>The need for an overhaul of the education system is highlighted in the report.  Last month the Government announced plans for a radical reform of the junior cycle.  The reforms recognise the need to promote a model of education which is attuned to a more rapidly changing world.  The transition from second to third level is also being examined by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair\u00ed Quinn, in conjunction with the HEA and the universities.<\/p><p>The report shows that the issue of positive mental health is a priority for young people.  The Government has made available an additional \u20ac35 million this year to improve mental health services, of which an additional \u20ac3 million is to be used in suicide prevention measures.  The issue of alcohol was highlighted in the consultations.  The Government will shortly consider proposals to assist in tackling problematic alcohol use.  The Government has a leadership role to play in this issue, but it will require a commitment from a much wider range of actors if we, as a society, are to achieve a healthier relationship with alcohol.<\/p><p>One of the most important issues facing us is youth unemployment.  We must revitalise the economy to meet the very significant challenge that this poses us.  We must also further develop the effectiveness of training and labour market supports for young people to enable them to acquire the skills and resilience needed to gain and maintain employment in a much more uncertain world.<\/p><p>The consultation report and declaration are much more comprehensive than it is possible to do justice to in my brief remarks.  The Minister will draw on this work in the youth strategy being developed by her Department next year.  The Minister will also bring relevant recommendations to other colleagues in government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112200012#N00200","speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","time":1353585600,"count":199,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112200012#N00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1353585600,"counter":200,"content":"<\/a> <p>Cuirim c\u00e9ad f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire.

I appreciate that as the senior Minister in the Department he has come to the House to reply to my matter on the Adjournment which relates to the overall departmental budget.  My questions are straightforward.  At this stage of the year, how much of his Department's budget has been spent?  Is the Department running a deficit or a surplus?  What measures does the Minister intend to take to deal with that deficit or surplus?  My questions are in the context of the overall comprehensive review of expenditure.  I am aware the Department needed to make savings of \u20ac6 million this year and that the indicative savings for 2013 will mean a need to slice another \u20ac10 million, with savings of \u20ac12 million in 2014.  Many groups and organisations are looking for support from the Department from the arts, heritage, cultural and language areas and under headings such as North-South co-operation.<\/p><p>My area of expertise is in the arts, Gaeltacht and Irish language areas.  Organisations such as \u00dadar\u00e1s na Gaeltachta have suffered funding cuts under the previous Government.  Capital funding of \u20ac25 million a number of years ago has decreased to \u20ac6 million.  Capital funding is used to create employment in Gaeltacht areas.  Many of these organisations are strapped for cash.  I know the Minister intends that all the cash available to him will be made available as funding.  He indicated at a number of recent meetings about the Aran Islands air service that cuts in the departmental budget of 6% and 10% will be made next year.  We need to have information from the Minister as to the state of his Department's budget for 2012.  What are his plans to ensure that any remaining moneys are spent before the end of the year?<\/p> <p>What are the Minister's plans to ensure that happens or if he has overspent in any particular areas, how does he intend to compensate for that to ensure compliance with budgetary targets.

As he will be aware, my Department oversees and has policy responsibility for the conservation, preservation, protection, development and presentation of Ireland's heritage and culture.  My Department also seeks to promote the Irish language, to support the Gaeltacht and to assist the sustainable development of island communities.  A gross provision of \u20ac268.451 million was provided to my Department for this purpose in 2012, \u20ac225.541 million for current expenditure and a further \u20ac43 million for capital expenditure.  A further \u20ac8.6 million is allocated to the National Gallery Vote, of which \u20ac7.6 million is current and \u20acl million is capital.<\/p><p>Details of the individual expenditure allocations at subhead level are published in the Revised Estimates Volume.  Published profiles of expenditure for 2012 at Vote group level, which would include both my Department and the National Gallery, are available on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's website.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform also publishes, on an ongoing basis, details of my Vote group's monthly expenditure with reference to these published profiles.<\/p><p>As Members will appreciate, a consequence of the significant fiscal deficit facing the country is that we just have not had the resources available in recent years to fund all the services that we would like to provide and my 2012 allocation reflects this position.  Accordingly, I am very committed to ensuring that the maximum value is derived from within these provisions in terms of maintaining, promoting and protecting Ireland's heritage and culture, developing cultural tourism, advancing the use of the Irish language, and supporting the sustainable development of the islands.  This is clearly reflected in the fact that in 2011, excluding departmental administration, my Department expended approximately 99.76% of its available programme funding.<\/p><p>The Senator will also be aware that while monitoring and management of my Department's expenditure relative to profile at subhead level is carried out on a routine basis, such ongoing expenditure figures are provisional and subject to verification internally through my Department's financial management system and, ultimately, by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I consider that publication of detailed interim expenditure reports at subhead level before year end would require an additional layer of verification and a disproportionate amount of time and work on an ongoing basis that would be difficult to justify.  Nevertheless, for the Senator's information, on 31 October 2012, my Department's gross expenditure at 31 October totalled \u20ac211.3 million, which is on target at 96% of profile.  This represents approximately 79% of the total REV allocation for the year.  Current expenditure accounts for just under \u20ac185 million of this total, 98% of profile, with capital expenditure at \u20ac26.4 million, 84% of profile, accounting for the remainder.<\/p><p>As with last year, I expect that close to my Department's full provision will be utilised and no significant surpluses or deficits are envisaged.  I will, of course, continue to closely monitor expenditure trends across all my Department's subheads in the lead up to year end and in line with public financial procedures where necessary I will, under the specific authority of the Minister for Finance, seek to find savings within certain subheads to meet pressures on other subheads within the Department's overall allocation.<\/p><p>We have a monthly meeting at which we look at all expenditure right across the Department.  As it is a small Department compared to the Departments of Social Protection, Health, or Education and Skills, it is easy to identify where money is being spent or is not being spent.  That is the reason we have had almost a maximum spend before the end of the year.  If moneys have not been drawn down before the end of the year obviously they can be transferred to other areas.  There will be very little scope to do that because the amount remaining will be very small owing to the pressure on financing.<\/p><p>In the four programme areas of my Department there has been a reduction in funding since 2008 of almost \u20ac247 million or 51%.  I am left with a very tight budget to look after the arts, culture, the Gaeltacht, the islands and so on.<\/p><p>I thank my officials and the organisations that spend the money.  They do a very good job at getting more for much less.  They are working hard with the available resources to retain the services as much as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112200013#O00200","speaker":"1046"},{"type":"speech","time":1353586200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>T\u00e1im thar a bheith bu\u00edoch don Aire as an bhfreagra sin.  It is good to see there is tight management and that the Minister is confident that the moneys will be spent and spent well.  I note that the Department has suffered a huge decrease in funding in recent years.  I note for the Gaeltacht and the islands there has been a 64% reduction in the spend.  From my rudimentary knowledge of these types of budgets, the Minister notes that current expenditure accounts for just under \u20ac185 million of the total which is 98% of the profile.  I note that at the end of October 98% of the current expenditure is spent.  Is that an overspend in the sense that there are still two months to go with only 2% of the budget profile remaining?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that issue, or it may be an accounting issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012112200013#O00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1353586200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>It is not.

The Department has managed well.  There will be no issue, be it current or otherwise.  Sometimes under capital expenditure we expect projects to be completed but for contractual or tendering reasons they may not.  Issues could arise as invoices may not be submitted because the contractor may have a difficulty and that could pose a difficulty.  If the invoice is not produced the money is still available.
