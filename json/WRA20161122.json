This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>Over &euro;19 billion will be spent by my Department on its various income supports and other programmes in 2016.  <\/p><p>Across the main social welfare schemes, last month my Department received over 38,000 applications for processing and cleared over 42,000.  The number of applications awaiting decision and the average time to award for each main social welfare scheme is set out in the following table, which was provided to the Deputies earlier today.<\/p><p>The time taken by my Department to process applications depends on a number of factors, primarily the conditionality and relative complexity that applies to the relevant scheme.  The quality and completeness of the application form and other material is also an important factor.  The inclusion, at the outset, of any supporting documentation that is requested on the application form is key to a customer getting a timely and appropriate decision.<\/p><p>Long term schemes with medical or caring conditionality are relatively complex to decide upon and, consequently, take longer to process.  When the number applying to any particular scheme increases significantly, it can put pressure on my Department&rsquo;s capacity to process those claims in a timely manner.  <\/p><p>Reducing waiting times is a priority for my Department and they are working hard to make this happen.  For example, the processing time for carer&rsquo;s allowance has dropped from 22 weeks in May 2016 to 14 weeks in September 2016 and continues to fall.  As part of its programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented by my Department in recent years.  In addition, staffing needs are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p><p><b><i>Table of Main DSP Schemes (arranged alphabetically) with Number of Applications awaiting decision and Average Weeks to Award<\/i><\/b><table><tr><th><div>Scheme<\/div><\/th><th><div>Awaiting Decision at end October <\/div><\/th><th><div>Average weeks to award<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carer's allowance <\/td><td><div>3,833<\/div><\/td><td><div>14* <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carer's benefit <\/td><td><div>404<\/div><\/td><td><div>9<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Child benefit<\/td><td><div> 1,400<\/div><\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Disability allowance <\/td><td><div>5,671<\/div><\/td><td><div>12<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Domiciliary care allowance <\/td><td><div>2,059<\/div><\/td><td><div>16<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Family income supplement (new claims)<\/td><td><div>3,639<\/div><\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Invalidity pension <\/td><td><div>2,003 <\/div><\/td><td><div>9<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's allowance <\/td><td><div>6,955<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's benefit <\/td><td><div>1,741<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>One-parent family payment <\/td><td><div>1,244 <\/div><\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State pension contributory<\/td><td><div>4,115<\/div><\/td><td><div>6<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State pension non-contributory <\/td><td><div>1,834  <\/div><\/td><td><div>14 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Widow\/widower\/surviving civil partner contributory pension<\/td><td><div>309<\/div><\/td><td><div>1<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Widow\/widower\/surviving civil partner non-contributory pension<\/td><td><div>43<\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><b>* Most up-to-date statistics are from the end of September 2016<\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200059#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":11,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 53 to 55, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Payments","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200059#WRA01100"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[36028\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200059#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if his Department has assessed the impact on youth poverty of the lower rates of unemployment allowance; if so, the findings of such an assessment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1308","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>Lower weekly rates for younger jobseekers were first introduced in the Supplementary Budget in 2009, and further extended in subsequent Budgets up to 2014.  The rationale for these rates is to prevent young unemployed people from entering longer term welfare dependency by providing a strong financial incentive to take up a job, or a training or education programme.<\/p>  <p>  The CSO publishes consistent poverty figures for all young people aged 15 to 24 inclusive.  The CSO does not separately report poverty rates for young people in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.<\/p>  <p>  The consistent poverty rate for all young people aged 15 to 24 was 4.2% in 2008 and peaked at 14% in 2013.  The most current data available relates to 2014 when the consistent poverty rate for young people decreased to 13.1%.  The CSO will release the 2015 SILC data in the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  Poverty is strongly linked to unemployment.  The number of young people under the age of 26 on the Live Register has fallen from 51,200 to 32,260 over the two years from October 2014 to October 2016, a reduction of 37%.  Similarly, the monthly unemployment rate for 15 to 24 year olds fell from 21.9% to 15.1% over the same period, a reduction of 31%.  It is positive that unemployment among young people is falling at a faster rate than among the general population.<\/p>  <p>  These trends are very positive.  Of course, more remains to be done and I am determined that we help more young people in the most effective way possible, by supporting them into the workforce, education or training.  <\/p>  <p>  For that reason, on Budget Day I announced additional incentives for young people to participate in education.  From next September, when a young jobseeker participates on the Back to Education scheme, he or she will be entitled to receive the full maximum rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, which will then be &euro;193 per week, as against the &euro;160 which they are currently on.

It was my Department&rsquo;s expectation that the report would provide detail on the design of specific activation programmes that work for lone parents that could assist in developing further activation measures for these customers.  The fact that it doesn&rsquo;t include that information is a lost opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  The research commenced in January 2015 and therefore takes no account of the final phase of the one-parent family payment reforms in July 2015, or improvements targeted at lone parents in the last three Budgets which resulted in lone parents benefitting more favourably than the average household.  <\/p>  <p>  We are still at an early stage of the implementation of the reforms to the one parent family payment and I think it will take several years before the full impact of the reforms can be assessed.  This is because many lone parents, on foot of the reforms, are taking up education, training or employment support programmes, which will take time for them to complete.  <\/p>  <p>  However, I listened carefully to the views of One Family, and other groups, in the months before the Budget and consequently, I announced a package of measures supporting lone parents in the social welfare Budget package.  <\/p>  <p>  All lone parents on the one-parent family payment, the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance will benefit from the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment from March.  A new &euro;500 annual Cost of Education Allowance will be made available to Back to Education Allowance participants with children from the next academic year in September.  In addition, the income disregards for the one-parent family payment and the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment will rise by &euro;20 from January, from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week, reversing in part previous reductions, to encourage one parent families to stay in, and return to, work.   <\/p>  <p>  In addition, as part of the debate on the Social Welfare Bill last week, I agreed that I would commission a report on the changes to the one-parent family payment.  I will introduce a Report Stage Amendment to that effect.

A family in receipt of maintenance will always be better off than a family where maintenance is not a factor as FIS replaces just 60% of the difference between total family income and the relevant FIS threshold.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200060#WRB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Fraud","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200060#WRB02300"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[35717\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200060#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the procedures in place to identify welfare fraud nationally; and his plans to tackle welfare fraud nationally and in the Sligo-Leitrim constituency.","asker":"1343","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[35888\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200060#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the procedures in place to identify welfare fraud; and his plans to tackle same.","asker":"1304","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 81 together.<\/p><p>The majority of people in receipt of a payment from the Department of Social Protection receive what they are entitled to.

The actions set out in the strategy are designed to prevent and detect fraud, to ensure effective oversight of schemes, to pursue prosecution of offenders and to pursue the recovery of any overpaid entitlements identified. <\/p><p>All Departmental staff exercise a control and compliance function in processing new applications and reviewing existing entitlements.  The systems used to support schemes are designed to detect wrongful claiming and to highlight anomalies.  In addition, the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate undertakes detailed examination of claims on a risk assessed and random basis.  This is supplemented by at least three fraud and error surveys of Departmental schemes annually and the findings from the surveys are used to tighten control measures around schemes, where this is found to be warranted.  The survey reports are published and subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  <\/p><p>In addition, the Deputies should note that my Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit, which comprises trained inspectors and Garda officers, is tasked with undertaking targeted and systematic examination of claims to tackle fraud and to work with other enforcement agencies to identify more serious breaches of the law.  <\/p><p>Cross-functional and targeted actions are undertaken - both internally and in joint operations with other national and international agencies - to ensure a strategic response to high risk sectors or where fraud is considered to be most prevalent.

I agreed that I would commission a report on the changes to the one parent family payment.  The report shall examine the financial and social effects of the changes taking into account poverty rates and welfare dependency of those impacted by the reforms.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department values quality social policy research and the contribution it makes in assisting it in terms of informing policy across its broad remit.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware from the title of the report, the report does not claim to be an analysis of the lone parent reforms.

Ireland has returned to strong economic and employment growth.<\/p>  <p>  The monthly unemployment rate in October 2016 announced by the CSO was 7.7%, down from a peak of 15% in 2012.  As unemployment is strongly linked to poverty, we can expect further decreases in poverty as the figures for 2015 and 2016 become available.  The Government continues to focus on activation, to help people back into the workforce.<\/p>  <p>  Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the national policy framework for children and young people, published by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2014, includes a target to reduce child poverty by two-thirds by 2020.  Meeting this target means lifting 97,000 children out of poverty.  Under this Framework, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in collaboration with my Department and other relevant Departments is taking a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty.<\/p>  <p>  Social transfers play a crucial role in alleviating poverty and inequality.  In 2014, social transfers reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate in Ireland from 37.2% to 15.6%, thereby lifting over a fifth of the population out of income poverty.  Ireland is among the best performing EU Member States in this regard.  Budget 2017 increased the weekly rates of payment for working age schemes and also raised the income disregard for one-parent family payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s transition payment recipients.  These measures will help to tackle child poverty. <\/p>  <p>  Continued economic recovery, together with Government action to sustain and develop the social welfare system, will support further reductions in poverty over the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  However, reducing child poverty is not just about income supports and welfare.  Rather it is also about supporting parents to make the transition into employment and assisting families through the provision of quality services in areas such as childcare, education and health.<\/p>  <p>  That is why one of the most important measures contained in Budget 2017 for tackling child poverty was the announcement that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will implement next year the new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme.  This scheme is a step change in State support for childcare in Ireland.  It is an important scheme as it will significantly reduce the cost of childcare for low income parents and will provide further substantial support for families to lift themselves out of poverty by taking up employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200060#WRB05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Eligibility","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200060#WRB05600"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[36059\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200060#WRB05700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will review the operation of the contributory State pension; if he will examine the difficulties being experienced with regard to the annual averaging that is set out in the eligibility criteria; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":74,"content":"<p>The rate of payment under the State pension (contributory) scheme is related to contributions paid over the years into the Social Insurance Fund, and credited contributions where applicable.  As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid at a higher rate under that scheme than those with more intermittent contributions made during their working life.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a State pension contributory, whether at full or reduced level.  These include that the person must be aged 66 or over, and that they have at least 520 paid contributions, i.e., a minimum of 10 years.  Provided a person satisfies all the relevant conditions, they may qualify for a State pension contributory, the minimum personal rate of which is &euro;93.20, and the maximum personal rate of which is &euro;233.30.<\/p>  <p>  Since the contributory pension was introduced in 1961, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the level of pension entitlement, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (from their entry into insurable employment up to the year prior to their reaching State pension age).<\/p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for such periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, where people cannot qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.<\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration in the first half of next year.  It&rsquo;s worth noting that this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200060#WRB05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Reviews","counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200061#WRC00100"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[35826\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200061#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the consideration he has given to a review of the provisions of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013, including single insolvencies and their effects on pensioners.","asker":"1259","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":78,"content":"<p>In Ireland, occupational pension schemes are generally set up under trust and are maintained by the employer on a voluntary basis.  The trust deeds and rules of a scheme differ from scheme to scheme, and as with any contractual situation, reflect the level of obligation of the parties involved.  While the Pensions Act provides a framework for the regulation and supervision of occupational pension schemes, it does not impose any requirement on an employer to fund scheme benefits or maintain an existing scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013 provided for a fairer and more equitable distribution of scheme assets in the event of the wind up of an underfunded scheme.  It also facilitated a greater sharing of the risk between all the beneficiaries when a scheme is underfunded, while still providing for priority protection of pension benefits.  Prior to the introduction of this Act, pensioner benefits were given priority over the benefits of active and deferred scheme members which meant a situation could arise whereby pensioners received all or almost all of the pension fund and members who had contributed but not retired received considerably less than expected.<\/p>  <p>  When an underfunded pension scheme is winding up (and when the employer is still solvent), the existing 100% priority given to pension benefits was changed to provide for a reduced priority for higher pensions.  It is important to note that the changes introduced in the 2013 Act still give high priority to existing pensioners in the discharge of the liabilities.  For pensioners this is:<\/p>  <p>  (i) 100% priority will be given to the first &euro;12,000, if the annual pension is &euro;12,000 or less;<\/p>  <p>  (ii) the lesser of &euro;12,000 or 90% of the annual pension if the annual pension amount is over &euro;12,000 and less than &euro;60,000;<\/p>  <p>  (iii) the lesser of &euro;54,00 or 80% of the annual pension if the annual pension amount is &euro;60,000 or more.<\/p>  <p>  After that the next priority will be to secure 50% of current and former employee&rsquo;s benefits.  Then any remaining funds will be used to secure pensioner benefits to the extent that they have not already been discharged and after that, current and former employees benefits to the extent that they have not already been discharged.<\/p>  <p>  This change in the order of priority when a scheme winds up redistributes funds to the current and former employees.  If the pension scheme is sufficiently funded the pensioner will get back further funds as the scheme moves through the order set out above.<\/p>  <p>  I have no plans to review these provisions as the changes made provided for a fairer and more equitable distribution of scheme assets in the event of the wind up of an underfunded scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200061#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Payments","counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200061#WRC00400"},{"type":"question","counter":80,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[36026\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200061#WRC00500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"his plans on cutting unemployment payments following reported comments (details supplied) made at a recent Pobal conference in Dublin City University; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1308","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":81,"content":"<p>In addition to assisting unemployed jobseekers through the payment of income supports the Department of Social Protection, through its Intreo service, provides a range of employment supports and services to assist jobseekers find and secure employment.

In the interim, it is important to stress that all payments made by the Department of Social Protection to entitled persons, including those to recipients who are resident in Britain and Northern Ireland, and payments from the UK to residents in Ireland, will continue to be paid.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200061#WRC02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Waiting Times","counter":96,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200061#WRC02100"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[36025\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200061#WRC02200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the processing times for carer&rsquo;s allowance and benefit applications; the measures he will take to reduce these times; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1308","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[35976\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200061#WRC02300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"his plans to deal with delays in the administration of carer's allowance.","asker":"1225","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 90 together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.

The average waiting time for new CA applications at the end of September 2016 was 14 weeks.  The waiting time for new CA applications as at the end of October 2016 is not yet available.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has seen a significant reduction in CA processing from 22 weeks at the end of May to 14 weeks at the end of September and expects the processing times for both schemes to reduce further, as recently assigned staff get up to speed with the work involved in claim processing.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of October, there were 3,833 CA and 404 CARB applications awaiting decision.  These figures compare very favourably to the end May figures which were 6,398 and 660 respectively.<\/p>  <p>  The volume of claims on hands are a consequence of continued strong claim intake and the delays in processing are frequently caused by the customer failing to fully complete the claim form or failing to attach the supporting documentation that is requested on the application form.  Applications for CA by the end of September 2016 are 20% higher than in the same period in 2015 while applications for CARB are 24% higher.  This has impacted on the timely processing of applications.<\/p>  <p>  Reducing waiting times is a priority for the Department and we are working hard to make this happen.  As part of its programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented by the Department in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, staffing needs are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.

The review&rsquo;s methodology is evidence based and reflects the pressures on rental properties in each location.  Officials in my Department continue to monitor both overall availability of rental properties, which remains at historic lows, and the on-going relevance of the new limits.  Both my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will jointly undertake a review of the effects of the increases on rental costs and homelessness after a 12 month period.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the ongoing supply difficulties, my Department continues to implement a targeted case-by-case policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits.  To date, approximately 9,300 persons at imminent risk of homelessness have been supported through increased rent supplement payments.  There has been a significant reduction in these cases following the introduction of the increased rent limits.<\/p>  <p>  The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), which is a key pillar of the Social Housing Strategy 2020, will transfer responsibility for all those on rent supplement with long term housing needs to the local authorities.  It is expected that HAP will be available in all local authorities in early 2017.  HAP represents a significant reform of the system and rent supplement will continue to be paid to households who are already in the private rented sector but who, generally because of a loss of income through unemployment, require short term income support.  Any recommendations to reform the administration of the rent supplement scheme have to be carefully considered in the context of this significant change in policy direction.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputies that I am continuing to keep the matter of rent limits and the administration of the rent supplement scheme under close review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200061#WRC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pensions Reform","counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200061#WRC03200"},{"type":"question","counter":108,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[36038\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200061#WRC03300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"his plans to introduce a universal pension to tackle income inequality in the elderly population; the progress to date in facilitating a transition to a universal pension system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":109,"content":"<p>I understand the Deputy has clarified that when he refers to a &ldquo;transition to a universal pension system&rdquo; he is referring to an introduction of a universal flat rate State pension.<\/p>  <p>  There are no plans to abolish either the State pension (contributory), or the State pension (non-contributory), as both are very effective in ensuring that older people have a decent standard of living.  In relation to the State pension (contributory), workers who pay PRSI over their working lives receive a benefit which allows them make further provision for their retirement without losing that benefit via a means test.<\/p>  <p>  The State pension (contributory) is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the State pension contributory is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and may not always be their most advantageous payment to claim.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons why someone might not have sufficient contributions paid to qualify for a State pension (contributory).  Some would have been employed in the public service for a significant period, others would have worked abroad during their working life and qualified for a foreign pension based on foreign contributions, and some would have spent significant periods out of the labour force altogether for a number of reasons, e.g., caring for children or elderly relatives, prolonged periods of unemployment or incapacity and other circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.<\/p>  <p>  Providing a full rate pension to everyone over 66, regardless of their PRSI record or their means would be a very expensive measure, which would require significant additional funds (either through higher PRSI rates or exchequer subvention) or a reduction in the rate of the maximum pension.<\/p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  The position of gender and gaps in contribution records will be considered very carefully in developing these proposals.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from around 2020 and work is underway in my Department in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200061#WRC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Income Inequality","counter":110,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200061#WRC03500"},{"type":"question","counter":111,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[35934\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200061#WRC03600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the way he plans to address inequality and social exclusion in 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":112,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s strategy for addressing social exclusion and poverty is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 (NAPinclusion).

This Statement of Strategy sets out the vision, mission, values and the strategic objectives and high level strategies that will underpin the Authority&rsquo;s work programme for the next 5 years.  The Strategy will be reviewed mid-term to assess whether it continues to be appropriate to guide the Authority&rsquo;s activities or whether the environmental and operational context has altered to such an extent that a new or revised Strategy is required.<\/p>  <p>  Oversight of the executive of the Pensions Authority is provided by a three person board.  This consists of the following:<\/p>  <p>  - Mr David Begg as Authority chair.<\/p>  <p>  - Ms Ann Nolan, Second Secretary General in the Department of Finance, who represents the Minister for Finance.<\/p>  <p>  - Ms Anne Vaughan, Deputy Secretary General in the Department of Social Protection, who represents the Minister for Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  The role of the Pensions Authority is to promote and support compliance with the Pensions Act and to address any non-compliance it encounters.  It is not, however, responsible for running pension schemes and PRSAs.  Rather, the responsibility for managing pension schemes and PRSAs and for making decisions relevant to their operation and management rests with the trustees, the PRSA providers and employers.  The Authority is responsible for ensuring those managing and providing services to pension schemes and PRSAs operate in compliance with the requirements of the Pensions Act.<\/p>  <p>  If it is considered that benefits due are not being paid in accordance with the rules of a pension scheme, the person concerned can invoke the dispute resolution procedures which the scheme is obliged to operate and if they are still dissatisfied, they can bring the complaint to the Pensions Ombudsman.  The Pensions Authority also comes under the remit of the Ombudsman (not the Pensions Ombudsman), who deals with customers who feel they may have been unfairly treated by public bodies.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, the Authority continued its robust compliance activities by opening 45 new investigations, closing 66, and referring 18 cases for prosecution.  The Authority held 60 compliance meetings with stakeholders.  225 occupational pension schemes were selected for audit and 37 prosecution cases, most of which related to the construction sector, were concluded.  The increase in prosecutions resulting from whistle-blowers&rsquo; reports highlights the increased awareness of the Authority as an avenue for citizens to raise their concerns.

As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, and who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid under this scheme.  Under the scheme, entitlement is calculated by means of a &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life.<\/p><p>Social insurance contributions (Class S PRSI) were introduced for self-employed people on 6 April 1988.  These contributions provide<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>cover for self-employed people for long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widows\/widowers pension (contributory).  A person must have paid self-employment contributions in respect of at least one contribution year prior to reaching age 66,<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>and all self-employment contributions payable must have been<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font>paid in full.<\/p><p>There is also a State pension (contributory) half-rate pension for self-employed people.  The legislation providing for this partial pension came into effect from 9 April 1999 to provide a basic payment for groups who would not otherwise qualify for a contributory social welfare pension, and who did not satisfy the means test for the State pension (non-contributory).  In this case, the measure was designed to benefit self-employed people who were already over 56 years of age when compulsory self-employed social insurance was introduced in 1988, who had not paid other contributions (such as voluntary contributions, or other contributions while in employment), and who could not therefore satisfy the condition of having entered insurance 10 years before pension age.  The pension was seen as a reasonable response to the position of the self-employed who were in their late 50s when Class S contributions were introduced, and I believe most would agree that it represents good value for the contributions made.<\/p><p>EU Regulations provide for the inclusion of social insurance periods a person has incurred in another Member State(s), in a combined Irish\/EU record, for the purposes of state pension contributory (SPC) eligibility.  Taking the combined record into account, and subject to their satisfaction of the standard SPC eligibility conditions set out in domestic legislation, a claimant may qualify for a reduced-rate &lsquo;pro-rata&rsquo; EU state pension (contributory) under EU Regulations.  These arrangements apply to all countries covered by EU legislation, including the EEA countries Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.  All such applications are first assessed under Irish legislation, on the basis of the claimant&rsquo;s Irish contributions record only, then separately under EU legislation, using the pro-rata calculation method.  If the eligibility conditions are satisfied, the most financially beneficial pension entitlement is awarded.<\/p><p>There are also a series of Social Security Agreements which apply to other countries not covered by EU regulations.  These agreements protect the pension entitlements of Irish people who go to work in these countries and they protect workers from those countries who work in Ireland.  They allow periods of Irish social insurance and, depending on the legislation in the other country, periods of residence\/contributions which are completed in the second country, to be taken into account so that the worker may have his\/her entitlement to a pension determined.<\/p><p>Prior to the introduction of the Homemakers scheme in 1994, there was no provision for the recognition of periods of homemaking.  This scheme introduced such recognition of periods going forward from that date as the costs for backdating it would have been very considerable.  I am advised that if the Homemakers scheme was to be backdated to all dates prior to 1994, for payments from January 2017, the net cost to the Exchequer could be expected to amount to approximately &euro;290 million in 2017, and this annual cost would rise at a faster rate than the overall cost of State pensions.<\/p><p>Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), which amounts to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.<\/p><p>It is worth noting that the most recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund found the self-employed and women achieve very good value for money from the fund.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200061#WRC05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Waiting Times","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200061#WRC05500"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[36001\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200061#WRC05600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which he will improve waiting times in respect of the determination of appeals and access to oral hearings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":317,"qnumall":"[36295\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200061#WRC05700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which he can continue to reduce the time taken to process appeals in respect of various social protection payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":133,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 317 together.<\/p><p>The average appeal processing time for appeals determined in 2015 and to date in 2016 broken down by all social welfare scheme types is outlined in the following tables.<\/p><p>Significant effort and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeals process in recent years resulting in a marked improvement in overall appeal processing times.  The average time taken to determine an appeal requiring an oral hearing reduced from 52.5 weeks in 2011 to 25.5 weeks in 2015 and the average time taken to finalise an appeal decided by way of a summary decision dropped from 25.1 weeks in 2011 to 18.1 weeks in 2015.  This downward trend in overall appeal processing times has continued to date in 2016 to 24.3 weeks for an oral hearing and 17.4 weeks for a summary decision.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding these improvements, the Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times will continue to be a priority for her office and will continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>The quasi-judicial nature of the appeals system means that there are inevitable time-lags involved.  However, the system is designed to be flexible and fair and allows for review and submission of further information at all stages.  The time taken is proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal which require a high level of judgement, and the need to ensure due process and natural justice.<\/p><p>Appellants are advised of their right to request an oral hearing when their appeal is registered as an information leaflet (SW56) issues with the appeal acknowledgment.  This information leaflet is also available on the appeals office website &ndash; .<\/p><p>I am advised that where an appellant requests an oral hearing, the request is generally granted unless the Appeals Officer is of the opinion that the appeal can be allowed on a summary basis, or where there is clearly nothing to be gained by granting an oral hearing, for example where the appeal question relates to contribution conditions or means and the underlying means or PRSI contribution figures are not disputed.<\/p><p>The Deputy may be aware from figures reported in the Chief Appeals Officer&rsquo;s Annual Report that 36.4 per cent of appeals determined by Appeals Officers in 2015 involved an oral hearing &ndash; the equivalent figure in 2014 was 31.2 per cent.  Social Welfare legislation provides that an Appeal Officer may determine an appeal without an oral hearing where s\/he is of the opinion that it can be determined fairly on the basis of the documentary evidence provided.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p><p><b>Appeals processing times by scheme 01\/01\/2015 &ndash;

In doing so, the survey explored the work experience and ambitions of disability allowance (DA) recipients.  The survey found that 13% of DA recipients are currently working (part-time or full-time) while 31% had never worked.  56% of respondents stated they had previously worked (full-time or part-time) but were not currently working.  The survey also asked those who are not currently working to give an indication of their employment ambitions given the right supports.  Of those who completed this question, 35% expressed an interest in working part time, while 8% expressed an interest in full time employment.<\/p>  <p>  The survey, undertaken as part of my Department&rsquo;s commitments under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES), also explores disability allowance recipients&rsquo; experience and ambitions in four key areas: education level and ambitions; work experience and ambitions; supports which would be helpful to achieve employment ambitions and barriers to achieving employment ambitions.  In addition, the survey explores recipients&rsquo; self-declared health status.  The survey will provide considerable assistance to my Department and the Comprehensive Employment strategy overall in the management and development of supports and services to help persons with disabilities find and maintain employment where this is appropriate and voluntary.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the DA payment, my department manages a number of specific supports and measures to support people with disabilities in moving into employment.  These include the wage subsidy scheme, which is targeted at employers to encourage employment of people with disabilities and the EmployAbility service, which supports people with disabilities who wish to work through the provision of a dedicated job coach.  The department also provides a range of grants under the reasonable accommodation fund, which comprises employment supports to assist people with disabilities to access and progress in employment.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, people with a disability in receipt of social welfare income supports who work can retain a portion of their payment.  For example, if a person&rsquo;s doctor recommends that the work is of a rehabilitative or therapeutic nature, recipients of DA can work and earn &euro;120 per week without affecting the rate of DA being paid, while if the weekly earnings are between &euro;120 and &euro;350, fifty per cent of the earnings will be disregarded in the DA means test.  The results from the DA survey show that some 10% of recipients avail of this provision. <\/p>  <p>  For people who are in receipt of invalidity pension or who have been in receipt of illness benefit for a minimum of six months, the partial capacity benefit scheme provides an opportunity for persons to take up employment and continue to receive an ongoing portion of their weekly social welfare payment, including any increase being paid in respect of a qualified adult or qualified children. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES) for people with disabilities, the Department is progressively rolling out its full Intreo service to people with disabilities who wish to avail of the service on a voluntary basis.  People with disabilities who present at INTREO service offices will be offered an interview by a case officer who will agree suitable personal progression plan with the individual and record the action plan for the person on the case management system.  In addition, relevant officers in INTREO Centres have received training, to enable them to interact effectively with people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, an interdepartmental group was established under the CES to review and make recommendations on making work pay for people with disabilities.  The research afforded by the DA Survey formed an important input into the work of this group and to the formulation of strategy generally in this area. <\/p>  <p>  The interdepartmental working group is currently completing its examination of this complex area and is due to present its report to Government before the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200062#WRD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Eligibility","counter":145,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200062#WRD00950"},{"type":"question","counter":146,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[36057\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200062#WRD01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will review the impact on recent retirees, who are qualified for the contributory State pension, of the way the homemaker scheme years are calculated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":147,"content":"<p>The State pension contributory is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC. It does not involve the award of credits.<\/p>  <p>  My Department reviews these and other provisions on an ongoing basis and has estimated that the cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost &euro;290m in 2017.  This figure would increase in subsequent years.<\/p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.<\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration in the first half of next year.  It&rsquo;s worth noting that this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200062#WRD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":149,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200062#WRD01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committee Meetings","counter":148,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200062#WRD01150"},{"type":"question","counter":149,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[36010\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200062#WRD01200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on transport last met.","asker":"1224","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","counter":150,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[36011\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200062#WRD01300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee on communications last met.","asker":"1224","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":151,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 106 together.<\/p><p>The Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure, Environment and Climate Action last met on 25 October 2016.

It is accepted that the valuation element of the rating system should have both a comprehensive revaluation and revision programme running in tandem.<\/p>  <p>  The national revaluation programme currently underway is the first general revaluation of all commercial property in the state since the middle of the 19th century and has priority status in the work of the Valuation Office.  It is a very significant undertaking and involves the valuation of some 146,000 commercial rateable properties.  Completing the first revaluation and getting properties in every Local Authority area onto the 5-10 year cycle of revaluations provided for in the legislation represents a sea-change for the valuation system.  As part of the national revaluation programme, the revaluation of all commercial properties in the Limerick City and County rating authority area was completed in December 2014 when certificates of valuation were issued to over 6,700 commercial and industrial ratepayers.  The new valuations took effect from 1 January 2015 and have formed the basis for commercial rates since then. <\/p>  <p>  While the revaluation work has been underway, the Valuation Office has continued to carry out revision work and, during 2015, some 5,438 applications for revision were processed nationwide.  Also, any backlog of revision work is cleared during the revaluation of a local authority area.  As already mentioned, revision of valuation is the process by which the valuation lists are maintained between revaluations and reflects changes to property of a structural nature and the addition to the valuation lists of new properties. <\/p>  <p>  The number of applications for revision of valuation in respect of the Limerick City and County rating authority area which are currently on hands and awaiting assignment to valuers in the Valuation Office is 198, of which 105 have been received within the last 6-month period.  In addition, there are 35 cases currently being actively processed to completion.  I am informed that all of the Limerick revision applications awaiting assignment to valuers relate to properties already on the valuation list and consist of properties that have been demolished, sub-divided, amalgamated or extended and would also include some applications for removal on the basis of exemption from rates.  I am also informed that none of the applications awaiting assignment relate to newly built properties. <\/p>  <p>  It has been a priority for the Valuation Office to enter into collaborative arrangements with all Local Authorities including the Limerick City and County Council, to ensure that an efficient and effective revision programme can be conducted on an ongoing basis.  To this effect, the Commissioner has implemented a number of initiatives to enhance the capacity of the Valuation Office to deliver a high-quality and timely revision service.  To that end, several improvements have already been put in place in recent times.  For example, the Office has recently carried out a revision pilot project involving four local authorities which was designed to improve data exchange with local authorities in general.  Following the conclusion of the pilot project, this approach is now being rolled out to all local authorities and online services have been enhanced to facilitate more effective data exchanges between those bodies and the Valuation Office.  <\/p>  <p>  The Valuation Office recently commissioned a review of its revaluation and revision processes.  That review made a number of recommendations in line with best international practice based on methodologies and processes for handling statutory valuation work in other jurisdictions.  These recommendations will now form the basis of an implementation plan being put in place by the Valuation Office.  The review also proposed establishing a separate, permanently resourced, Revision Unit responsible for the processing of revision work and the ongoing assessment of properties falling under this category.  Following the receipt of a business case by the Valuation Office seeking the provision of additional funding to allow for the establishment of a dedicated resource to deal specifically with the ongoing revision programme, I was pleased to be in a position to announce as part of the recent budgetary provisions, the allocation of an additional &euro;750,000 to the Valuation Office during 2017 for this purpose.  This development, which will involve the appointment of a number of additional staff, in tandem with the rollout of improved online facilities and enhanced processes and procedures, is specifically intended to address backlogs in conducting revision assessments and to enable the Valuation Office to provide timely and high quality revision services to all Local Authorities including Limerick City and County Council and to ratepayers into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200062#WRD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":176,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200062#WRD03050"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[35723\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200062#WRD03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps she has taken to make reforms of the direct provision system in view of the programme for Government commitment to reform the system; if she will consider the ending of the direct provision system for asylum seekers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1254","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":178,"content":"<p>While the operation of the system of State provided accommodation and the direct delivery of services such as education and health to residents therein is kept under continual review, there are no plans to replace it with any other system at present.   <\/p>  <p>  This is a system which facilitates the State providing the essential and necessary accommodation and related services to all in the protection process and which has provided accommodation to more than 56,000 people since its establishment.  It allows the State to provide such accommodation in a manner that facilitates resources being used in the most economic means possible while also delivering services (such as education and health) directly to those within the system.<\/p>  <p>  The Report of the Working Group on Improvements to the protection process including Direct Provision and Supports to Asylum Seekers provides a template for the development and improvement of a wide range of services being delivered to those seeking international protection. <\/p>  <p>  One of the key recommendations of the Report was the introduction of a single application procedure in the protection process.  The International Protection Act 2015 provides for such a procedure.  My Department is currently preparing all of the steps necessary to commence the Act which responds to some 26 of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations and can be expected to positively address the crucial issue of the length of time that applicants spend in the protection process and by extension in State provided accommodation.  <\/p>  <p>  On this particular point, significant efforts have been made to deal with those who are longest in the system and at this stage the vast majority of those who are over 5 years in the system and who do not have any impediments to progress, such as pending judicial challenges, have now had their cases processed to completion.  This has been a key achievement that has had a real impact on many people and families in the protection process. <\/p>  <p>  A transition Task Force was established in 2015 and put in place important supports to facilitate people with status moving into and integrating with the community.

Prescription fees for all those in receipt of the Direct Provision allowance, including children, have also been waived.

This was published in parallel with information sessions coordinated by the Citizens Information Bureau in accommodation centres which gave an opportunity for such persons to seek assistance and clarification on the services provided.<\/p>  <p>  Once some form of status is granted, residents cease to be ordinarily entitled to the accommodation supports provided through RIA.  Notwithstanding this fact, RIA have always continued to provide such persons with continued accommodation until they secure their own private accommodation.  RIA are particularly mindful of the reality of the housing situation in the State and the pressures on the Community Welfare Service in respect of Rent Supplement or the City and County Councils in respect of Housing Assistance Payments and Housing Lists.  That said, the provision of housing for persons coming out of the protection process has been incorporated in the recently published Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200063#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Staff","counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200063#WRE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":211,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[35844\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200063#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of appointed District Court judges that acted as directors of elections at both local and constituency level from 2005 to 2015; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":212,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is not available.

On Budget day I announced that the Government has approved my proposal that by 2021 the overall Garda workforce should comprise a total of 21,000 personnel; to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  4,000 civilians will effectively double the current figure of civilians undertaking administrative and technical duties within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and represents a medium term target of 20% civilians by 2021.  This will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently with 14% civilians, more into line with international norms and ensure that trained Garda&iacute; are not engaging in administrative and technical duties which could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff.  The Garda Inspectorate, in its 2015 report &quot;Changing Policing in Ireland&quot; has estimated that there may be up to 1,250 Garda&iacute; currently in such posts and the Government&rsquo;s plan aims to return as many of these Garda&iacute; as possible to front-line duties over the next five years.  With this in mind, the Garda Commissioner, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, has been requested to identify posts suitable for redeployment by the end of the year and to prepare a 5 year plan for reaching the 20% medium term target.<\/p><p>The recruitment and appointment of up to 500 civilians provided for in Budget 2017 will facilitate the Garda Commissioner in addressing capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation including in corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management at the national, regional and Divisional level.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of Garda Reserves by Garda Division on 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, is as set out in the following table.<\/p><p>The strength of the Reserve has fallen in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013 to 756 currently.  The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways - firstly over 160 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointment Service have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last two years. <\/p><p>Now that the recruitment process for trainee Garda&iacute; is bedded down and a continuous pipeline of successful applicants is in place to ensure ongoing recruitment, there is the capacity in the system to commence work on the development of multi-annual plan to increase the Reserve numbers to 2,000 over the next five years in line the commitment in the Programme for Government.  Achieving this will require in the order of 300 new Reserves to be recruited and trained annually.  This will be significant undertaking and it is important that the processes around it are efficient and effective as possible.  With this in mind the Commissioner is examining how the recruitment should be done - centrally as has been the case to date or more locally -  and also how the training can best be delivered.  The expectation at this stage is that we will see new reserves entering An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na mid next year.<\/p><p>The Garda Reserve performs policing duties as determined by the Garda Commissioner, while accompanied by full time Garda&iacute;.  The role is to provide local patrols and participate in crime prevention initiatives targeted at specific local problem areas.  Reserve members are also involved in policing major incidents and events, and in providing other operational support to full time Garda&iacute;.  In recent years the Garda Commissioner has conferred further powers on reserve members under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Road Traffic Act 1961 and has also decided that they should carry out more duties including the serving of summonses, and the issuing of Fixed Charge Penalty Notices where offences are detected.  <\/p><p>In the context of the planned expansion of the Reserve it is important that consideration is given to optimising its use.  I am informed by the Commissioner that the Garda Reserve Management Office is currently undertaking an audit of the experience and skills of Reserves which, when completed, will assist Garda management in considering the future role to be played by the Reserve including whether additional powers should be conferred on Reserve members.  <\/p><p><b>Reserve Garda&iacute; by Garda Division

Community Garda&iacute;, among the various Garda Divisions and Districts and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>I have been informed that as of the 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 740 Community Garda&iacute; assigned to Garda Divisions throughout the country.  The specific information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table.<\/p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.<\/p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na bringing the Garda strength to around the 13,000 mark by year end.  It is expected that Community Policing and all other Garda activities, will undoubtedly benefit from these resources now coming on stream. <\/p><p><b>COMMUNITY GARDA&Iacute; SEPTEMBER  2016<\/b><table><tr><th><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>-<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/th><th><div>COMMUNITY GARDA&Iacute;

The ETIAS does not apply to EU citizens which, of course, includes Irish nationals.  In addition, ETIAS will not apply to recognised refugees or stateless persons.

Gable was principally selling commercial insurance policies and surety bonds in a number of European countries, including Ireland, on a freedom of services basis. <\/p>  <p>  Gable entered into administration in October 2016, with PricewaterhouseCoopers AG (PwC) appointed as Special Administrator by the FMA.  Subsequently, following an extraordinary shareholders meeting on 11 November, the FMA were informed that no capital injection will be made to Gable by its parent company.  Consequently, on 17 November the Special Administrator filed an application with the competent Liechtenstein court, seeking an order that Gable is wound-up.  The FMA have stated that the Liechtenstein Court has opened winding-up proceedings and a liquidator has been appointed as of 18 November 2016. <\/p>  <p>  In regard to Gable customers in Ireland to which the Deputy refers, the Central Bank are advising that Gable policyholders immediately contact their insurance broker to establish their legal position, including the need to seek alternative insurance cover.  The Central Bank state that the urgency stems from the fact that any claim made by policyholders who hold active policies with Gable, may not be fully covered due to the indebtedness of Gable and the pending winding-up order.\u00a0 I understand that the Central Bank has written to the relevant brokers in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Further information is available from the FMA at www.fma-li.li\/en\/.  The Liquidator may be contacted at the following email address gable@bwb.li <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that Gable passported into Ireland under a key principle of the European Union, that of the freedom to provide services from one Member State throughout the European Union.  This principle is an important one and is also availed of by a number of\u00a0 insurance firms established in Ireland\u00a0 in order to conduct business into other EU Member States. <\/p>  <p>  Underpinning the ability to conduct business whether in a company's home territory or elsewhere in the EU under the freedom to provide services is the\u00a0Solvency II Directive which came into force from 1 January 2016.  Solvency II is a revision of EU insurance and reinsurance law designed to modernise supervision, deepen market integration and increase the competitiveness of European insurers.  Prudential home state insurance supervision has been in place for decades based\u00a0on the principle of mutual recognition, and an understanding\u00a0that all supervisory authorities in the European Union supervise at a similarly high level.  However,\u00a0 in reality, there was no\u00a0uniform standard of supervision in the EU, meaning that there was always the possibility for companies to exploit the regulatory\/supervision regimes to their own advantage.  One of the main purposes of Solvency II therefore is to try and ensure a\u00a0harmonised approach to supervision across the\u00a0EU going forward. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated to me that it \u00a0continues to work closely with relevant foreign National Competent Authorities and EIOPA (the European insurance supervisory authority), which has identified as one of its key strategic objectives 'to improve the quality, efficiency and consistency of the supervision of EU insurers and occupational pensions.'  It has\u00a0informed me that it\u00a0fully supports EIOPA's work in this regard and has actively engaged with EIOPA in its revision of the General Protocol which will enhance the exchange of information between supervisory authorities.<\/p>  <p>  In the area of business conduct, the Central Bank has put in place a consumer protection framework to protect the interests of consumers in dealing with insurers.\u00a0 The consumer protection framework also applies to European insurers selling in Ireland on a freedom of establishment basis or a freedom of services basis.  The consumer protection framework includes codes and regulations that set out standards for firms when dealing with consumers, including when selling insurance policies, handling claims and renewing policies as well as the provision of information and dealing with complaints.\u00a0 This includes the provisions contained in the Consumer Protection Code 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200065#WRG04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax Administration","counter":373,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200065#WRG04050"},{"type":"question","counter":374,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[36184\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200065#WRG04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if multi properties owners will be permitted to pay their local property tax at the post office in view of the fact that every property has a unique property identification; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":375,"content":"<p>Section 44 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that owners of more than one relevant residential property must meet their Local Property Tax (LPT) payment and filing obligations via electronic means.<\/p>  <p>  To assist property owners in meeting this statutory requirement, Revenue developed an online system that facilitates a wide range of payment alternatives, including various phased payment options.

In 2016 the home carer tax credit was increased to &euro;1,000 and I announced in the recent Budget that the credit will increase to &euro;1,100 with effect from January 2017.<\/p><p>The Home Carer credit may still be claimed where the home carer has a certain amount of income in his or her own right.  The full tax credit is due if the Home Carer's income is less than a threshold amount.  This threshold was increased to &euro;7,200 with effect from 2016, from a lower limit of &euro;5,080 which applied in prior years including 2014.

For example: In 2014 if the home carer had income of &euro;6,000, the home carer tax credit due would have been &euro;350.  This is calculated by reducing the full credit of &euro;810 by one-half of the income earned in excess of the &euro;5,080 threshold: i.e. &euro;6,000 - &euro;5,080 = &euro;900 \/ 2 = &euro;460. &euro;810 - &euro;460 = &euro;350 credit due.<\/p><p>For 2016, as a result of the increased credit of &euro;1,000 and the higher income threshold of &euro;7,200, a portion of the home-carer credit is due where the home carer's income is between &euro;7,200 and &euro;9,200.

As legislation currently provides for the relief to continue to end-December 2017, it was not necessary to include legislation in Finance Bill 2016 to provide for the tapered extension of the relief.  However in my Budget speech in October I confirmed my intention to extend MIR beyond the current end date on a tapered basis to 2020 and that the details of the extension will be set out in Budget 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Mortgage interest relief generally operates as a tax relief at source, meaning that the relief is deducted by the bank from the mortgage payment due, and the homeowner pays only the net amount due.  Therefore existing recipients of the relief would face a step\u00a0effect in 2018 when their monthly mortgage payments would\u00a0increase when the tax relief\u00a0would have been withdrawn (all other factors being equal).  The purpose of the proposed tapered extension is to avoid a sudden significant increase in mortgage repayments for those losing the relief, but instead to withdraw the relief gradually, allowing the mortgage holder time to adjust to the change in mortgage repayments.<\/p>  <p>  As advised previously, at\u00a0present,\u00a0Section 244 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief in respect of interest paid on qualifying home loans taken out on or after 1 January 2004 and on or before 31 December 2012, with relief being available until 31 December 2017.  Mortgage interest relief has been abolished for homes purchased since 1 January 2013.<\/p>  <p>  The system of mortgage interest relief is designed and targeted in such a way that the relief is of greater value in the early years of a qualifying loan where the interest represents a greater proportion of the repayment.  First-time buyers who purchased between 2004 and 2008 when the property market was at its peak also receive an enhanced rate of relief.  Mortgage interest relief is of lesser value to individuals whose repayments are made up of a higher proportion of principal than interest, as would generally be the case for those who move in to the eighth and subsequent years of their loans.  It is worth noting that the application of the ceilings already work to reduce the relief available in a gradual manner.  In addition, as the amount of\u00a0interest payable reduces as a mortgage is paid down, the level of mortgage interest relief also reduces in tandem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200066#WRH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":393,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200066#WRH01500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Curriculum","counter":392,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200066#WRH01400"},{"type":"question","counter":393,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[36262\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200066#WRH01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a compulsory LGBT module will be added to the SPHE and-or CSPE courses in post-primary schools as part of the LGBT youth strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":394,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to develop an LGBT Youth Strategy.  Work on this commitment will be progressed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and my Department will actively contribute to the work as it progresses.  In that context, I expect that discussion on LGBT issues in the school curriculum will take place.  In the meantime, the current SPHE curriculum, the Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) programme, and the Action Plan on Bullying provide a framework within which schools and teachers can respond to specific issues relating to LGBT.<\/p>  <p>  All schools are required to develop and implement an RSE programme at junior cycle and senior cycle in post-primary schools.  RSE includes the acquisition of knowledge and understanding, and the development of attitudes, beliefs and values about relationships, sexual identity and intimacy.<\/p>  <p>  As students progress through an SPHE\/RSE programme, they will encounter a wide range of issues that are addressed in an age-appropriate manner.  The emphasis is on building a foundation of skills, values, attitudes and understanding relevant to all these issues, with specific information and focus on particular topics provided where and when it is deemed necessary by the teacher.<\/p>  <p>  RSE provides the context within which young people can learn about important moral, physical, social and emotional issues around relationships, sex and sexuality.  Post-primary schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, as set out in the curricular documents that have been provided, within the ethos and value system of the school.  Such a programme provides opportunity to explore with students the topic of sexual orientation.  The manner in which such issues are explored is contingent on the students' needs and the age-appropriateness of the content.  This includes supporting students to know where to get reliable information from trusted sources.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan on Bullying, which was published in 2013, sets out my Department&rsquo;s approach to tackling bullying in schools.  As part of the implementation of the Action Plan, new National Anti-Bullying Procedures for schools, which include a specific reference to homophobic and transphobic bullying, were published in September 2013.  The Procedures place an emphasis on generating a positive school culture and climate that is welcoming of difference and diversity, and is based on inclusivity and respect.  The procedures offer advice to schools on steps that can be taken to generate a positive school climate and culture.<\/p>  <p>  It is noted that the general school climate and culture will promote positive attitudes and dispositions towards the whole-school community, outside of the teaching of specific subject areas such as SPHE and RSE.  A number of anti-homophobic and transphobic bullying initiatives, including BeLonG To&rsquo;s Stand Up! campaign, and the development of resources for schools to support LGBT students are also being supported through the implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200066#WRH01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Site Acquisitions","counter":395,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200066#WRH01700"},{"type":"question","counter":396,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[35734\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200066#WRH01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the progress made in securing a permanent site for a school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1357","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":397,"content":"<p>A project to provide a new school building is proposed for the school to which the Deputy refers.

This will allow parents, patrons and other stakeholders to have their say and to ensure that the right balance can be struck between competing rights and that there would be no unintended consequence that would create an adverse impact on the schools of minority denominations.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that this matter requires time to allow adequate scrutiny and debate in order to ensure any new approach is reasonable, fair and workable.  I believe that the work of the Education and Skills Committee will be invaluable in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 does not propose any changes to section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act and I propose to advance the Admissions Bill separately from the issues before the Committee.<\/p>  <p>  As I have said previously, I believe that this is the correct way to proceed.  In this way, we can ensure that the important pragmatic changes contained in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill can be implemented as quickly as possible, and not be tied up with contentious issues that could end up in the Courts.  At the same time, we can in this way give the time and space for the complex issues involved in the Equal Status Bill to be properly teased out.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note that even if the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 is enacted by the Oireachtas in the coming months it cannot apply in respect of admissions in September next as schools have already begun that process.<\/p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016\u00a0provides an over-arching framework for greater transparency and consistency in school enrolment generally and thereby gives greater confidence to parents that the admission criteria laid down by schools and the procedures used by them are legitimate, reasonable and fair.

The strategies for higher education, skills development, innovation, supporting access to higher education, international education and the future funding of the sector all have people, talent and growth at their core.

The National Skills Strategy was launched earlier this year and while encompassing the whole of the education and training system is highly relevant to the higher education system and sets out a number of relevant priorities for the next ten years including developing relevant skills across the population, employer participation in the development of skills and an increased focus on lifelong learning: <i><\/i><\/p><p>3. The Higher Education sector is key to the implementation of Innovation 2020 the new strategy for Research and Development and in particular for developing the people &ndash; the researchers required to deliver on our national ambitions.

The Cassells report on Future Funding for Higher Education, which was published in July 2016, is also an important development.  The Report clearly outlines the funding challenges and offers a number of approaches and recommendations for consideration.  The report is now with the Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  I look forward to working with the committee to work out a viable, long-term funding model that we can all support.  We will require political and societal consensus to enable us to move forward with a realistic and achievable strategy for funding the system into the future: <i><\/i><\/p><p>6.

This will allow parents, patrons and other stakeholders to have their say and to ensure that the right balance can be struck between competing rights and that there would be no unintended consequence that would create an adverse impact on the schools of minority denominations.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that this matter requires time to allow adequate scrutiny and debate in order to ensure any new approach is reasonable, fair and workable.  I believe that the work of the Education and Skills Committee will be invaluable in that regard. <\/p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 does not propose any changes to section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act and I propose to advance the Admissions Bill separately from the issues before the Committee. <\/p>  <p>  As I have said previously, I believe that this is the correct way to proceed.\u00a0 In this way, we can ensure that the important pragmatic changes contained in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill can be implemented as quickly as possible, and not be tied up with contentious issues that could end up in the Courts.  At the same time, we can in this way give the time and space for the complex issues involved in the Equal Status Bill to be properly teased out. <\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note that even if the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016 is enacted by the Oireachtas in the coming months it cannot apply in respect of admissions in September next as schools have already begun that process.<\/p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016\u00a0provides an over-arching framework for greater transparency and consistency in school enrolment generally and thereby gives greater confidence to parents that the admission criteria laid down by schools and the procedures used by them are legitimate, reasonable and fair.  The following is an outline of some of its key\u00a0provisions:<\/p>  <p>  - The Education\u00a0Admissions Bill will bring tangible benefits to all parents.  The Bill will oblige all schools to admit pupils where there are available places.  It is important to note that 80% of schools are not oversubscribed.<\/p>  <p>  - The Bill provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion while including provision for single sex schools and denominational schools to reflect, in their admission policy, the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation.<\/p>  <p>  - The Bill\u00a0includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school's arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.<\/p>  <p>  - The Bill contains a provision prohibiting the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions for an application for admission to a school or for the enrolment or continued enrolment of a student in a school.<\/p>  <p>  - The Bill also provides for the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) to designate a school for a child with no school place and for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to designate a school for a child who has no school place for reasons related to the child&rsquo;s special educational needs. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the second\u00a0question raised by the Deputies regarding opting out of faith formation, Article 44 of the Constitution and Section 30 of the Education Act 1998 provides that parents have a right to have their children opt out of religion classes if they so wish.  The manner in which any school ensures that the right to opt out of religion classes is upheld is a matter for the school concerned. <\/p>  <p>  Each individual school must determine the particular arrangements which are most appropriate in its individual circumstances having regard to local issues such as available space, supervision requirements and how the school concerned organises classes etc. <\/p>  <p>  The Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the primary school sector (2012) recommended steps that could be taken to ensure that the education system can provide a sufficiently diverse number and range of primary schools to cater for children of all religions and none. <\/p>  <p>  A paper, entitled \"Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector: Progress to Date and Future Directions\", which took account of the public consultation, was published in 2014.

These Regulations were made under section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and amend the Social Housing Allocation Regulations 2011 to require that each housing authority must provide for a CBL procedure in their allocation schemes no later than 31 December 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200069#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pyrite Remediation Programme","counter":583,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200069#WRL01700"},{"type":"question","counter":584,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[36092\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200069#WRL01800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of homes that have been remediated under the pyrite remediation scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":585,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[36093\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200069#WRL01900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans for homes that are affected by pyrite but which have been left out of the current remediation scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":586,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[36094\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200069#WRL02000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to extend and expand the pyrite remediation scheme for homes that failed to reach the high thresholds set down under the previous Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":587,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 to 259, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The latest figures available from the Pyrite Resolution Board indicate that 1,409 applications have been received under the pyrite remediation scheme, of which 1,064 have been approved for inclusion in the scheme as follows:<\/p><p>- 271 are at remedial works planning stage, <\/p><p>- 41 are at tender-tender analysis, <\/p><p>- 35 are at tender decision, <\/p><p>- 241 are under remediation, and <\/p><p>- 476 are complete.<\/p><p>The Pyrite Resolution Board have indicated that applications have been received from 45 developments containing multiple applications, 27 developments with only one application, and 36 single site applications.<\/p><p>The Report of the Pyrite Panel (June 2012) recommended a categorisation system as a means of prioritising pyrite remediation works in recognition of the expensive and intrusive nature of pyrite remediation and the unpredictability of pyritic heave.

Under the social welfare system, people who are homeless and people in temporary accommodation have entitlement to the full range of social welfare schemes, including supplementary welfare allowance (SWA), subject to the normal qualifying conditions.<\/p>  <p>  The primary responsibility for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with local authorities.

It is expected that HAP will be available in all local authorities in early 2017.  HAP represents a significant reform of the system and rent supplement will continue to be paid to households who are already in the private rented sector but who, generally because of a loss of income through unemployment, require short term income support.

In doing so it is hoped to promote competitiveness and productivity.<\/p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market the rate of youth unemployment continues to fall  with a rate of 15.1% (30,500) in October 2016 (as estimated by CSO), compared to 15.9% (32,400) in September 2016 and a peak of over 31.1% (70,500) in 2012.<\/p>  <p>  In considering these figures it is important to note that youth unemployment in most economies  generally averages about twice the overall rate irrespective of the overall level of economic activity.  This is because of the lower rate of youth participation in the labour market associated with higher rates of participation in education as compared to older workers.  For example at an EU level youth unemployment is estimated by EUROSTAT at 18.2% as at September 2016 compared to an overall level of 8.5%.  The relationship between youth and overall unemployment rates is also clear in the Nordic countries which are generally considered to be forerunners of the youth guarantee approach.  For example youth unemployment in Denmark of 12% compares to overall unemployment of about 6.3%.  The equivalent numbers for Norway are 10.3% and 4.1% and for Sweden are 17.4% and 6.7%.  This relationship of youth to overall unemployment also holds over time - for example in January 2007 the EU youth unemployment rate stood at 16.7% compared to an overall rate of 7.6%; in Ireland the youth unemployment rate in January 2007 was 8.5% compared to an overall rate of 4.5%.<\/p>  <p>  Although the labour market situation is improving considerably as the recovery continues, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate young unemployed people find and sustain employment.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy (published January 2016) and the Youth Guarantee plan (published January 2014).<\/p>  <p>  The key objective of Ireland&rsquo;s policy response to the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard there is monthly engagement by case officers with young people to assist them to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  Where young people do not find work relatively quickly, additional supports may be offered, both through reserved places on existing employment and training schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.  Overall, over 19,100 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2015.  The wage subsidy JobsPlus Youth is also available to employers who hire young jobseekers under 25 who were previously at least four months unemployed (JobsPlus is otherwise available to jobseekers over 25 who are at least 12 months unemployed).<\/p>  <p>  Pathways to Work 2016-2020 continues to prioritise these measures for the young unemployed and further commits to a number of additional measures.  These include increasing the share of workplace-based interventions for youth unemployed; ensuring that monthly engagement, at a minimum, is consistently applied and maintained; restructuring the First Steps programme; and implementing the Defence Forces Skills for Life programme.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident these measures, and continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in youth unemployment and add to the substantial improvements that have already been seen over the last few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200070#WRM04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Payments","counter":668,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200070#WRM04100"},{"type":"question","counter":669,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[36065\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200070#WRM04200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a person (details supplied) will be in receipt of a carer's allowance payment and reimbursed all moneys owed following their successful appeal on 11 October 2016 to the refusal of their original application for carer's allowance in October 2015; and his views on the length of time it has taken his Department to process this person's application and appeal.","asker":"1252","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":670,"content":"<p>An application for carer's allowance (CA) was received from the person concerned on 8 October 2015.<\/p><p>The evidence submitted in support of this application was examined and the deciding officer decided that this evidence did not indicate that the requirement for full-time care was satisfied.

This increase relates to all lone parents in the State and reflects the increase in economic and employment growth generally.

Overall, 58.8% of the 25,406 appeals which were finalised in 2015 had a favourable outcome for the appellant, i.e. were either allowed in full or in part, or resolved by way of a revised decision by a Deciding Officer\/Designated Person.  To date in 2016, 58.7% of the 19,128 appeals finalised have had a favourable outcome for the appellant.<\/p><p>Of the 18,913 appeals which were finalised by Appeals Officers in 2015, 6,886 (36.4%) were determined following an oral hearing.  4,444 (64.5%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.  Of the 14,215 appeals finalised by Appeals Officers in 2016 5,362 (37.7%) were determined following an oral hearing.  3,485 (65%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.<\/p><p>There are a number of reasons why a decision which was refused at first instance might be successful on appeal and it is not necessarily the case that the first decision was wrong. <\/p><p>Where new evidence is provided with an appeal the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person as was the case in some 35 per cent of favourable appeal outcomes in 2015.  Where the decision was not revised in the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds and in addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at oral hearing which may influence the outcome of the appeal.<\/p><p>Decisions concerning entitlement to a social welfare payment or insurability of employment often require a high level of judgment and may involve complex legal questions.  The Courts have found that decision makers are required to be free and unrestricted in discharging their functions.<\/p><p>Where an appellant requests an oral hearing, the request is generally granted unless the Appeals Officer is of the opinion that the appeal can be allowed on a summary basis, or where there is clearly nothing to be gained by granting an oral hearing, for example where the appeal question relates to contribution conditions or means and the underlying PRSI contribution figures or means are not disputed.  Social Welfare legislation provides that an Appeal Officer may determine an appeal without an oral hearing where s\/he is of the opinion that it can be determined fairly on the basis of the documentary evidence provided.  In general, where there is a conflict in the documentary evidence presented, an Appeals Officer will convene an oral hearing in order to explore the evidence and seek to resolve any conflict.<\/p><p>I

the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall (with a rate of 16.5% (33,800 persons) in October 2016 estimated by CSO, as compared to 20.8% (38,700) persons in October 2015 and a peak of over 31% (70,600 persons in 2012).<\/p><p>While systemised data is not readily available on employment outcomes on all programmes specifically for those jobseekers under 25, some indicative figures are available. For example:<\/p><p>- The evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon (report published October 2016), shows on the basis of self-reported survey results that 61% of interns aged 20 to 24 years (and 53.8% of those aged 15-19) were currently in employment at the time of the survey.  Overall, individuals similar to those who participated in JobBridge had a 36.6% probability of securing employment within one year, whereas the JobBridge interns&rsquo; probability of securing employment within one year increased to 48.4% (an 11.8 percentage point difference and a 32% increase in the probability of becoming employed).<\/p><p>- JobsPlus provides subsidies to employers for the full-time employment of those formerly long-term unemployed on the Live Register.  In October 2016 there were 4,323 participants benefitting from JobsPlus, 765 (17.7%) of whom were under 25.<\/p><p>- In 2015 the level of satisfaction among under 25 year olds Intreo clients with getting on to course, training or getting a job was very high at 4.27, of a possible maximum of 5.<\/p><p>Under the Government&rsquo;s policies to support the young unemployed, the first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  There is monthly engagement with all young jobseekers by a case officer, and a Personal Progression Plan is developed to chart the steps to be taken to facilitate a return to employment, which may include further education and training or other opportunities.<\/p><p>For those who do not find employment, through the process just described, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes\/workplace based interventions such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s and First Steps; or in subsidies to employers, through JobsPlus Youth.  Long-term unemployed jobseekers under 25 are also referred to JobPath, a contracted, payment-by-results employment services that provides additional resources and supports to those long-term unemployed.<\/p><p>Pathways to Work 2016 to 2020 sets additional targets in relation to addressing youth unemployment:<\/p><p>1) increase the relative share of workplace-based interventions (Gateway, T&Uacute;S, Positive to Work etc.) for youth unemployed;<\/p><p>2) to ensure the frequency of engagement with all young unemployed people is a minimum of one case officer meeting per month;<\/p><p>3) restructure the First Steps programme for young unemployed people to improve take-up by offering a higher level of support to jobseekers and employers - these consolidate reforms undertaken in previous Pathways to Work strategies; the fourth action, to implement the Defence Forces Skills for Life employment support programme, is a new programme.  Actions are in progress and on target.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that these policy measures, together with an improving labour market, will continue to address youth unemployment.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Welfare Services Provision","counter":747,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200071#WRN03450"},{"type":"question","counter":748,"qnumday":314,"qnumall":"[36292\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200071#WRN03500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which community welfare services remain readily accessible in all areas throughout the country with particular reference to meeting out-of-hours or emergency needs where necessary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":749,"content":"<p>People claiming supports under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme generally only interact with the Department on an occasional basis, for example, when seeking an exceptional needs payment or in claiming additional supports such as rent supplement.

The last review (The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, 2010) was carried out by KPMG on behalf of the Department and was published in 2012.  This review projected (as part of its base case assumptions) that the number of persons aged 65 and over in the population would increase from 514,000 in 2010 to 750,000 in 2020 (and increase of nearly 46%) before rising again to 1,034,000 in 2030 (a further increase of nearly 38%).

However, this data will be included in the next review which is imminent. <\/p><p>In this regard, the Department has issued a Request for Tender to carry out a new Actuarial Review and this will be completed by end June 2017.

The list has been prepared according to the information available to my Department and aims to be as comprehensive as possible.  The purpose of the agreements is indicated by the title in most cases and further information is either publicly available or can be made available by my Department should it be required.<\/p><p>There are 74 agreements on the list:<\/p><p>- 17 Multilateral agreements for which the UN Secretary-General is the depository;<\/p><p>- 19 Council of Europe agreements;<\/p><p>- 23 EU agreements;<\/p><p>- 8 Other multilateral agreements; and<\/p><p>- 7 Bilateral agreements.<\/p><p>The two-step process whereby a state will first sign an international agreement subject to ratification or some other form of approval, such as an exchange of notes informing of completion of the necessary internal procedures, is the usual manner in which international agreements are concluded.  This interval permits states to take whatever legislative or administrative measures are required to fulfil obligations assumed under the agreement.  The signing of an agreement may be an important demonstration of a state&rsquo;s support for it, pending its ratification when in a position to do so.  Whilst a state is not bound by an agreement which it has signed but not ratified, it is obliged to refrain from acts that would defeat its object and purpose.  The alternative would be to refrain from signing the agreement at all, which may be interpreted as a lack of support for the agreement.  In this regard, there is nothing unusual, or wrong in principle, in having some time period between signature and ratification, and the length of time required may depend on the complexities of the particular issues involved.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Article 29.6 of the Constitution provides that international agreements do not form part of the domestic law of the State unless the Oireachtas so provides through the enactment of legislation.  This is what is known as a &ldquo;dualist&rdquo; approach to international agreements.  In contrast, for some states, ratification of an international agreement automatically incorporates the terms of that agreement into its domestic law.  Such states may be in a position to ratify agreements more quickly than dualist states such as Ireland.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have an important role in relation to all international agreements entered into by Ireland.  Before a treaty may be signed, ratified or acceded to, it is necessary to obtain an authorising Government Decision.  As the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 designates the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade as the Minister responsible for external relations, all Memoranda for the Government concerning international agreements (other than International Labour Organisation Conventions) are brought by me, irrespective of their substantive content.  Where the agreement is the functional responsibility of another Department, as is usually the case, the Memorandum is brought by me on behalf of the relevant Minister. <\/p><p>Therefore, while my Department has a central role in relation to signing and ratifying international agreements, it is often the case that the necessary legislative or administrative measures required to implement them are for the line Department responsible for the subject matter of the agreement.  Line Departments, in taking steps to ratify an agreement, will consult with my Department as the ratification process develops to ensure that important procedural steps are followed. <\/p><p>My Department lays all international agreements before this House after they enter into force for Ireland and annually publishes all such agreements in the Irish Treaty Series, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  A notice of all agreements laid before the D&aacute;il is also published in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il.  In addition, a list of the international agreements which have been signed but not ratified by Ireland is published on the Department&rsquo;s website and updated annually. <\/p><p><b>List of

Given the complexities involved in establishing, designing, developing and testing this new service, it is anticipated that it will take 4-5 years before it is fully operational and will require a staffing complement of 15 full-time posts at that point.  Met &Eacute;ireann has appointed one new staff member to date to lead the project.<\/p><p>The Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group has met on five occasions in 2016, held three public consultation days and has agreed to trial the lowering of lake levels in Lough Allen and consider the costs and benefits of piloting the removal of pinchpoints and dredging of the Shannon, as a further commitment to enhance co-ordinated activities by the relevant State Agencies.  The work programme for the agencies involved and other information is available on the OPW website, . <\/p><p>The Interdepartmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group is considering the potential costs and benefits associated with the introduction of an individual property protection scheme.  The Group is being informed by two pilot projects which are currently underway in Thomastown and Graiguenamanagh in County Kilkenny and Crossmolina in County Mayo.  The OPW is funding the cost of the consultants engaged to carry out the property assessments in the locations in question and will reimburse Mayo County Council for the cost of installation of the pilot flood gates in Crossmolina.  The Co-ordination Group&rsquo;s work, when completed, will be submitted to Government for consideration in the context of the merits of the introduction by Government of any scheme to support individual property protection measures. <\/p><p>A review of the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme is currently underway with a view to examining the criteria for consideration within the Scheme, including for example the various thresholds for the assessment of benefit.  Consultations are underway with Local Authorities with a view to examining any potential improvements, administrative or financial, which will encourage applications under the scheme.  The review will be carried out in the shortest possible timeframe and is expected to be completed by the end of 2016. <\/p><p>On 8th November I announced funding of &euro;2m for a targeted humanitarian aid scheme for those primary residential properties that flooded during last Winter and had flooded in previous years to ensure those worst affected homeowners have a primary residence.<\/p><p>While the Government has agreed that the terms of funding for relocation will be in line with the previous scheme in 2009, I am to appraise Government of the ongoing review of the administrative arrangements from that earlier scheme, to ensure that the arrangements for this once-off scheme are reflective of its targeted objective and all relevant circumstances.<\/p><p>I want to ensure that the funding is targeted at those homeowners at greatest risk of future flooding and would gain greatest benefit from State support to relocate.<\/p><p>The Office of Public Works is working jointly with Local Authorities and the Department of Social Protection to identify and prioritise homeowners and review the administrative arrangements for this scheme.  I hope to be able to appraise Government and subsequently make initial contact with a small number of targeted homeowners towards the end of this year.<\/p><p>Further examination is ongoing by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, OPW and Local Authorities in evaluating on an individual basis if any alternative remedial works can be undertaken to protect those at risk farm buildings that flooded again last Winter in order to inform the feasibility of any future once-off targeted scheme for Voluntary Farm Building Relocation.<\/p><p>Guidance and support to clarify the rights and responsibilities of landowners in relation to the maintenance of water course on or near their lands is being developed for Spring 2017, subject to legal advice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200073#WRP02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1260"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":848,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200073#WRP02050"},{"type":"question","counter":849,"qnumday":353,"qnumall":"[35767\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200073#WRP02100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the policy on the unwinding of cuts imposed on public service pensioners under the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":850,"content":"<p>In June 2015, Government approved proposals for a significant\u00a0adjustment of the public service pension reductions (PSPR) which had been applied to all public service pensions above specified thresholds\u00a0under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest\u00a0(FEMPI) legislation.

Nursing and midwifery recruitment and retention is a priority for the health service.  There are many initiatives currently underway to improve staffing levels throughout the country in the short, medium and long term.  The HSE is offering permanent posts to 2016 degree programme graduates, and full time permanent contracts to those in temporary posts.  The HSE is also focused on converting agency staffing to permanent posts.  The HSE's National Recruitment Service is actively operating rolling nursing recruitment campaigns.  The campaigns encompass General, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability and Registered Children's Nurses, and also Midwives.  In addition, a relocation package of up to &euro;1,500 continues to be available to nurses who return from overseas.<\/p>  <p>  A number of specific measures have also been taken in relation to pay that will support the recruitment and retention of Irish nursing and midwifery graduates.  Measures to date include the first stage of pay restoration under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, additional pay in return for taking on some duties from doctors and an increase in the rate of pay for the student nursing placement to 70% of the first point of the staff nurse pay scale.  Last month the Government approved restoration of incremental credit for all nurses in respect of the 36 week clinical placement undertaken by 4th year student nurses in the context of the 2017 Estimates.  This decision means that all nurses and midwives will receive incremental credit for the 36 week placement restored from 1 January 2017, restoration of the credit to 2016 and future graduates having been approved earlier this year.  It is estimated that the inclusion of 2011 to 2015 graduates will benefit around 4,000 nurses who are currently working within the public health service and potentially another 3,000 who may wish to return to the public system in the future.<\/p>  <p>  There has been an increase of almost 1,200 nurses employed in the public health service (34,336 to 35,534) from September 2014 to September 2016, numbers having fallen by almost 4,600 from 2007 to 2014.  The total budget for the health service in 2017 is &euro;14.6 billion, the highest budget ever allocated to the health service and this will allow for the recruitment of additional nursing staff to meet service needs.

Persons who opt to be private on admission to hospital are liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care.<\/p>  <p>  It is the case that only those who express their wish to be treated as private patients are subjected to the private charges under Section 55 of the Health Act.  It is not the act of having private health insurance which makes a person a private patient but rather the waiving of their eligibility for public hospital services.  Where a patient elects to be treated privately by a consultant, the hospital must treat that patient as a private patient.<\/p>  <p>  While everyone ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to use a public hospital, an essential element of the eligibility arrangements is that the public or private status of a patient must be specified on admission to hospital.  The main benefits cited by people for having private health insurance are the choice of consultant and hospital.<\/p>  <p>  The procedure concerning the issuing of private health insurance forms is a matter for the HSE and I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy on this matter.  However, the HSE has confirmed that it does not have any policy to operate the private in-patient charging in the manner suggested and will investigate any cases brought to its attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200076#WRS01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services Provision","counter":1021,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200076#WRS01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1022,"qnumday":411,"qnumall":"[35865\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200076#WRS01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the dental care provision available to children between the ages of 12 and 16 years of age in areas where school dentists are unable to visit schools due to limited resources; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1023,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200076#WRS01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services ","counter":1024,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200076#WRS01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1025,"qnumday":412,"qnumall":"[35866\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200076#WRS01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if private dentists are permitted to treat the children of medical card holders between the ages of 12 and 16 years of age under the GMS scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1026,"content":"<p>The Dental Treatment Service Scheme (DTSS), which is delivered by private dentists who have contracts with the HSE, provides access to dental treatment for medical card holders aged over 16 only.

Currently, 2725 people live in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.<\/p><p>The HSE has established a subgroup, under <i>&lsquo;Transforming Lives&rsquo;,<\/i>the Programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions.

From that date, long stay contributions will replace the existing system of long stay charges for in-patient services (under section 53 of the Health Act 1970 and associated regulations).<\/p>  <p>  The long stay contributions framework requires that affordable contributions be made towards maintenance and accommodation costs by service users in residential settings where services are provided directly by the HSE or by agencies funded under Section 38 of the Health Act 2004 to provide services on behalf of the HSE.  The framework reflects modern residential support models (primarily in the disability, mental health and care of older people sectors).<\/p>  <p>  From 1 January 2017, long stay contributions will apply to the further provision of residential support services (other than acute in-patient services and nursing home services provided to those supported under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme\/Fair Deal), to persons who have already received at least 30 days of such services during the immediately preceding 12-month period, irrespective of where those 30 days of residential support services have been received.<\/p>  <p>  Long stay contributions will be contributions towards the maintenance and accommodation costs associated with providing residential support services (similarly, charges under the existing long stay charges system are charges in respect of the maintenance element of the in-patient services provided).<\/p>  <p>  The Health (Residential Support Services Maintenance and Accommodation Contributions) Regulations 2016 provide for three different classes of income-based long stay contributions towards accommodation and maintenance costs in three accommodation categories:<\/p>  <p>  - Category A (to which this question relates) refers to accommodation where 24-hour nursing and\/or medical care is provided, subject to a maximum of &euro;175 per week for a person whose income is &euro;208 per week or more.  These rates are identical to the rates which currently apply under the existing long stay charges system.<\/p>  <p>  - Category B relates to contributions payable by those in accommodation where part-time nursing and\/or medical care is provided and is subject to a maximum of &euro;130 per week for a person whose income is &euro;194 per week or more.  Again, these rates are unchanged from the current system.<\/p>  <p>  - Category C relates to all other non-nursing settings (such as independent living settings), subject to a maximum of &euro;70 per week for a person whose income is &euro;188 per week or more.<\/p>  <p>  In all three accommodation categories, contribution rates will be on sliding scales, with proportionally lower contribution rates applying to those on lower incomes.<\/p>  <p>  Affordability and the avoidance of financial hardship are built-in features of the long stay contributions provisions (as with the existing long stay charges system):<\/p>  <p>  - Firstly, section 67C of the Health Act 1970 caps the maximum contribution amount that may be set at 80% of the non-contributory State Pension weekly rate.<\/p>  <p>  - Secondly, the relevant Regulations are structured to ensure that those making long stay contributions will retain income for personal use of at least &euro;33 per week for Category A residents (in full-time nursing settings), at least &euro;64 per week for Category B residents (in part-time nursing settings) and at least &euro;118 for Category C residents (non-nursing settings).<\/p>  <p>  - Thirdly, section 67D of the Health Act 1970 provides that the HSE may reduce or waive a contribution where appropriate, in order to:<\/p>  <p>- avoid undue financial hardship on the part of the service user and\/or on the part of the service user&rsquo;s dependants,<\/p>  <p>  - advance a service user&rsquo;s identified needs (e.g. care plan objectives), or<\/p>  <p>  - take account of separate contributions (if any) made by a service user towards his or her maintenance or accommodation costs.<\/p>  <p>  To assist in the fair application of the framework, the HSE has developed national guidelines for the correct determination of long stay contributions and comprehensive waiver guidelines (approved by the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform) on the individual circumstances where such contributions may need to be reduced or waived.  The guidelines specify that service providers must have regard to the individual circumstances of each service user and his or her dependants.  The guidelines ensure that the applicable contribution may be reduced or waived where appropriate, taking account of each person&rsquo;s income and necessary outgoings, including reasonable regular financial commitments, with a view to ensuring there is no unfair burden on the service user or on his or her dependants.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the long stay contribution scheme which will commence on 1 January 2017 and the existing long stay charges scheme are reasonable and fair and ensure that each service user's contributions are based on what he or she can afford, taking account of the service user's individual circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200076#WRS03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Transfers","counter":1045,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200076#WRS03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1046,"qnumday":419,"qnumall":"[35922\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200076#WRS04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Donegal can expect to be transferred from Beaumont Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1047,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200076#WRS04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Contracts","counter":1048,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200076#WRS04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1049,"qnumday":420,"qnumall":"[35923\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200076#WRS04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding negotiations for a new GP contract; if he will consider introducing a salary for general practitioners to provide a service in rural areas as part of these talks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1273","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1050,"content":"<p>The development of primary care is central to the Government's objective to deliver a high-quality, integrated and cost effective health service.

An over-riding objective is to achieve more integrated services, and to address identified gaps over current provision.  It is working in collaboration with many different sectors and communities to improve:<\/p><p>- Emotional literacy around talking about mental health and reduce stigma;<\/p><p>- Awareness of services and supports;<\/p><p>- Accessibility to services and supports at different times and in different areas; and<\/p><p>- Alignment of services and supports across different providers (public, private, community, and voluntary).<\/p><p>The Government also recognises that schools play a vital role in the promotion of positive mental health in children, through strong working partnerships fostered between the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Health, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and the Health Service Executive.

The NDTP has carried out research that infers there is a short fall of respiratory consultants in Ireland.  Work is ongoing in NDTP to develop evidence informed workforce plans across all medical specialties, including respiratory.  When completed, the plans will be used to inform workforce related decision making including the most appropriate number of postgraduate training places and consultant appointments.

In June 2016, the Department of Health convened a cross-sectoral Steering Group, including NDTP, to begin the work on developing recommendations for the establishment of governance systems and a framework for integrated health workforce planning in Ireland.

The health needs of Travellers cannot be remedied or improved in isolation from addressing the societal, cultural, educational and environmental factors that combine to influence health as well as more obvious health related factors such as lifestyle issues and access and usage of health services.  The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Justice and Equality is leading on the development of a new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy.  The Department of Health is represented on the Steering Group developing the Strategy.  The Strategy, which is expected to run from 2016 to 2020, aims to provide a set of specific actions that need to be taken to improve the situation for Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.  It is envisaged that the Strategy will include agreed actions in relation to improving the health of travellers.  <\/p><p>The Department commissioned an internal review of the role and functionality of the Traveller Health Advisory Committee (THAC) in 2013 in order to inform the Department's consideration of the appropriate national structures required to address traveller health.  The review was presented to the Department in June 2013.  This internal review was not published at the time as it formed part of the Department's deliberative process in considering the future role of the THAC.  The review found that the transfer of the health budget to the HSE in 2006 resulted in significant changes to the functioning of the THAC and that the original purpose and focus of the Committee had changed.  The THAC has not been convened since the review.  The Traveller Health Advisory Forum, chaired by the HSE, continues to act as a national forum for discussion on issues around traveller health.  In the circumstances, the Department intends to await the completion of the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy to inform consideration of the necessity for any additional national structures to address traveller health.<\/p><p>In the Department traveller health issues are firstly addressed in the context of <i>Healthy Ireland<\/i>which is the national framework for action to improve the health and well-being of the people of Ireland.  <i>Healthy Ireland<\/i>takes a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to improving health and well-being and the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and provides an overarching approach to addressing health inequalities among Travellers.  The Healthy Ireland Council was established as a multi-stakeholder forum to support the implementation of <i>Healthy Ireland<\/i>across sectors.  The Council includes a representative from Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre.  The Department's Social Inclusion Unit also works closely with the HSE and oversees the delivery of traveller specific health measures by the HSE.<\/p><p>The Deputy's questions regarding traveller health funding and the HSE Service Plan for 2017 have been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200078#WRU03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cross-Border Health Services Provision","counter":1171,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200078#WRU03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1172,"qnumday":465,"qnumall":"[36239\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200078#WRU03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a claim under the cross-border directive will be reviewed in respect of a person (details supplied) considering the significant cost of their treatment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1173,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200078#WRU03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","counter":1174,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200078#WRU04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1175,"qnumday":466,"qnumall":"[36242\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200078#WRU04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children and adolescents waiting for an appointment for the child and adolescent mental health service in counties Donegal and Cavan; the current waiting times from initial referral in counties Donegal and Cavan; the total number of children and adolescents waiting for an appointment for the child and adolescent mental health service in the State; the efforts being taken to reduce the waiting lists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1176,"content":"<p>The HSE Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service has been prioritised in new funding made available by Government since 2012, designed to support timely access to appropriate services to address the mental health needs of all children.

This was to ensure that payments were targeted at &ldquo;trained young farmers&rdquo; who have a genuine interest in farming.  Approximately, 2,000 young farmers required places arising from the education requirements of the Young Farmers Scheme and the National Reserve. <\/p>  <p>  My Department in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, approved the appointment of 70 education officers and 7 administrative staff on two year contracts to enable Teagasc dramatically increase enrolments for the Green Cert Programme.  The scheduling of courses and allocation of teaching staff within the Teagasc network of agricultural colleges is an operational matter Teagasc and not the Department of Agriculture.  I understand that most of the teachers have been recruited and are helping to deliver record numbers of Green Cert enrolments.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above measure, the agreed delegated sanction arrangements for Teagasc provide them with greater flexibility over permanent staff appointments.  The arrangements enable Teagasc to replace staff when they retire and to make 75 new appointments subject to compliance with multi-annual pay ceilings.  While Teagasc must remain within its overall pay budget, the flexibility provided by the new arrangements will allow them to fill critical vacancies and to react faster when such vacancies arise in the future.  I understand a number of education appointments have been made to help meet the current demand for places.<\/p>  <p>  As can be expected, the Young Farmers Scheme and National Reserve has stimulated added interest in the adult Green Cert among other farmers who have &ldquo;registered an interest&rdquo; with Teagasc in completing the course.  My Department has asked Teagasc to explore other staffing measures, beyond further temporary recruitment, to ensure that any residual demand for the Green Cert can be accommodated within a realistic time-frame.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.<\/p>  <p>  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that up to 70% of premises in Ireland will have access to \u00a0commercial high speed broadband services provided by telecommunications operators, while the \u00a0remaining 30% consisting of just over 750,00 premises will fall within the proposed State led intervention under the National Broadband Plan.\u00a0\u00a0Currently, approximately 1.3m premises in Ireland can\u00a0get high speed broadband from commercial service providers.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the extent of the State Intervention area:<\/p>  <p>  -  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.<\/p>  <p>  -  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will\u00a0have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network\u00a0rolled out.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  There are 1.6 m premises in the BLUE area of which approximately 1.3m premises in Ireland can now get high speed broadband.\u00a0 My Department is actively monitoring the deployment\u00a0in the BLUE areas\u00a0to ensure that all premises can get access to services.  In this regard, direct feedback from consumers is important and\u00a0if customers\u00a0cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at broadband@dccae.gov.ie, quoting their address and Eircode and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area comprising\u00a0over 750,000 premises, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. \u00a0Householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 megabits per second but potentially up to 1000 megabits per second with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds. <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids.  In addition, bidders need adequate time\u00a0to get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further on timelines at this juncture, given that discussions are on-going in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. <\/p>  <p>  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline\u00a0to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll out of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200080#WRW04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1322,"content":"<p>Question No. 516 answered with Question No. 514.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":1323,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200081#WRX00300"},{"type":"question","counter":1324,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[35981\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200081#WRX00400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of applications that have been refused for injury warrants under the Superannuation Acts since 1995 within his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1261","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1325,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that since the establishment of this Department in\u00a02007,\u00a0no applications have been received\u00a0for injury warrants under the Superannuation Acts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200081#WRX00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illegal Dumping","counter":1326,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200081#WRX00600"},{"type":"question","counter":1327,"qnumday":518,"qnumall":"[36102\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200081#WRX00700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if his Department investigated any cases of illegal dumping of industrial waste on bogland owned by Bord Na M&oacute;na in County Kerry over the period 2010 to 2016; the steps which were taken in such cases; the discussions his Department had with Kerry County Council and the EPA in this regard; the actions taken to prevent such future activity and to provide for penalties to be given to persons involved in such illegal dumping; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1328,"content":"<p>My role, as Minister, is to provide the legislative and policy framework under which both local authority and EPA enforcement action against illegal dumping is initiated.

The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids.  In addition, bidders need adequate time\u00a0to get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further on timelines at this juncture, given that discussions are on-going in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. <\/p><p>During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline\u00a0to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.

This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.

This first Interim Report focused exclusively on the Commission's request for an extended time frame for the completion of the reports of the confidential committee and social history modules.  The Government agreed to the requested extension and all three reports will now be completed by February 2018.

Since receiving this report I have met with the Commission to discuss the report and the general progress being made with the investigation.

The proud record of the ship in operational service with the Naval Service was duly recognised and the range of activities which the ship was involved in was recalled and commended.<\/p><p>There are a number of recognised methods for disposing of a ship which has reached the end of its effective or economic service life within the Naval Service.  Options available include the donation, or sale for re-use by way of public auction, which allows for the refurbishment and reuse of a vessel by a secondary party.  Such uses can include operational restoration for further life as a ship, or vessel reutilisation as a museum.  Indeed the possibility of donating a vessel as a museum or visitor attraction arose in connection with the disposals of the former<i>L&Eacute; Emer<\/i>and the former<i>L&Eacute; Aoife.<\/i><\/p><p>However, the former <i>L&Eacute; Emer<\/i>was disposed of in 2013 by way of public auction, and &euro;320,000 was realised by the Exchequer in this regard.  In 2015, the former <i>L&Eacute; Aoife<\/i>was transferred to the ownership of the Maltese Armed Forces on humanitarian grounds following a request from the Maltese authorities, to endeavour to deal with the ongoing refugee crisis in the region.<\/p><p>The question of using the former <i>L&Eacute; Aisling<\/i>as a visitor attraction in Galway City has been raised with me and is under consideration.  I am advised that given the age, size, structure and layout of Naval Service vessels that they are considered rather unsuitable for conversion to use as museums or visitor attractions.  Many issues arise in connection with the conversion of vessels into visitor attractions.  This is because a vessel requires ongoing protection measures to affect the physical condition of the vessel to defend it, to stabilise the structural integrity of the vessel, and to guard it from deterioration.  A vessel must be kept structurally sound, weather resistant and watertight and this requires the availability of materials and competent personnel with requisite skills and expertise to carry out work, at a significant cost.  There are other significant costs for the recipient associated with a donation of this type, such as health and safety issues and insurance liabilities and risks.<\/p><p>The former <i>L&Eacute; Aisling <\/i>is currently being stored on water at berthage facilities at the Naval Base in Haulbowline, County Cork.  Given the pressures on berthage infrastructure and the cost of maintenance on the vessel, the most cost effective and responsible approach will have to be taken into consideration in informing my decision on this matter.  I will be concluding my approach on the disposal of the former<i>L&Eacute; Aisling <\/i>very shortly, and I will take all of these matters into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016112200083#WRZ04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"}]
