We will deal with matters arising as we discuss the work programme.<\/p> <p>  We will now deal with correspondence received.  First, we will deal with category A, briefing documents and opening statements in respect of today's meetings.  Correspondence No. 1206A was received from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General, Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  This is her opening statement.  We will note and publish that.  Correspondence No. 1117 is the briefing document also from Ms Licken which we received.  We will note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  We now move to correspondence from category B, which is correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers and follow-up to PAC meetings and other items for publication.  The first is No. 1185B from Mr. Neil McDermott, System Funding, The Higher Education Authority, providing an update in relation to St. Angela's College Sligo Limited and its incorporation with NUI Galway.  We will note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  No. 1186B is from Professor Brian Norton, president, Dublin Institute of Technology, dated 20 March 2018.  The item provides details requested by the committee on &euro;3.16 million of non-compliant procurement which came to light when we were looking at DIT's annual accounts.  If nobody has any question on that we can note it and move on.  We will note that.<\/p> <p>  No. 1192B is from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, dated 22 March 2018.

A note is included on EU rulings in relation to landfill sites and an update on the number of landfill sites and their remediation status.  It has been several months since the information was requested.  We will put the information up on the screen.  A document was to be attached.  Did we get an attachment?  Perhaps I missed it.

There will be only two landfill sites available from next year in addition to the incinerator.  Waste is also shipped abroad.  It seems there is not serious control on this whole area.  There is control over unlicensed landfill sites but quite a lot of public money is likely to come into play in terms of landfill sites that might be in private hands where money needs to be recouped, as in the case where the site then went out of business.  Is that an area that could require particular attention?

It charged fees so it recovered its own costs and therefore there is not an Exchequer funding for it.<\/p> <p>  There is a limit to the extent I can get involved in that, but it is something we encourage the relevant Departments to look at in terms of the potential costs, the contingent liabilities, that are associated with cleaning up illegal sites or sites that need remediation.  One way of accessing it from the committee's point of view is the environment fund, which is a fund under the current Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I think the account for 2016 was presented relatively recently so it could be something for the committee to examine.

It is taxpayers' money and public money.  In autumn we found an illegal site with 70,000 tonnes, which will take 15 months to remediate at a cost of &euro;6 million.  There is a wider issue here.  We have heard the warnings about people just putting waste outside for it to be collected and thinking there is no consequence to these unregulated illegal collections.  The consequence is &euro;6 million of public money being spent to remediate illegal sites.

Mr. Watt said he will consider this and on page 2 of his letter, he states, \"The committee may wish to note that my Department intends to initiate a review of Department of Finance [25\/2000] Official Entertainment Circular\".  He intends to do that this year.  He enclosed a copy of the circular that was issued 18 years ago, in 2000.  We need a new circular on hospitality and entertainment where it involves taxpayers' money directly.  We will acknowledge it and write back and ask if there is a timetable for the new circular and ask that we be provided with a copy as soon as it is ready.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#C00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>The letter quotes all sorts of bits and pieces but it does not deal with the elephant in the room.

Will there be action taken against the college?  There is no way any existing circular, however much it is in need of being replaced by a new circular, sanctioned &euro;13,000 for a bash with ice sculptures and so on no matter how important the person.  He is not really telling us anything.  There are three pages here that can be summed up in one sentence, namely, \"We do not have adequate measures in place, we plan to have adequate measures in place and we will let you know at some stage.\"  The key point is there is still no sanction.  Is someone divvying up this &euro;13,000 in Cork?  That is the issue.  It is the issue with everything we do in here.  When we identify things, it is not our role to determine what a sanction might be, as the Chairman said at the report launch yesterday.  What are we doing it for?  Is it just to highlight stuff, give copies to the media and then nothing happens?

Sometimes there are changes and the Comptroller and Auditor General will alert us to positive changes in accounting practices and how accounts are presented and so on.  In terms of wrongdoing, there is no sanction whatsoever and it is a slap on the wrist or a shrug of the shoulders from the Accounting Officer.  This letter is exactly that.

My instinct is our main challenge would be to the board of directors or governance of any State body.  Our sanctions should not involve any cuts to services down the line, whether it is in the HSE, health, social or education sector.  Our sanctions should be directed at board level because they are the people who are responsible for running the organisations.  Our sanctions should be directed at that level.  They are the people responsible for corporate governance, not the staff down the line.  That is a thought.  We will come back to it on another day.

The level of hospitality spending in organisations is generally a function of the culture.  It may not be a lot of money in itself but it tells one a little bit about how governance is managed in an organisation.  We examine expenditure on hospitality as part of a set of propriety tests we do every year.  That process in itself acts as a control over the level of spending.  However, sometimes we find something that looks to us to be excessive and in a situation like that we push for publication.  With the revision of the code of practice, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has required organisations to publish where there is any significant level of hospitality.<\/p> <p>  They have got to declare what the spend has been.  Questions then can be asked here by the committee or others who look at the financial statements, because it can clearly be seen what the level of spending is and justification can be sought.  While there is not a provision for a direct sanction, the fact that the committee takes it seriously and regularly raises it has an effect of adding to that control that is exercised.  Most public sector organisations are very careful about not spending in an extravagant way because this committee and our office are interested in it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I disagree, respectfully, with that.

Are benchmarks set initially and then checked to see if they have been met?  Has there been any comparison with the post-project reviews in this State and how they are carried out internationally?  It is all very well to have post-project reviews but if they are internal, they may do what we want them to do or they may not; we do not know because we have not seen them before.

Some people ask what actually happens as a result of our meeting.  We had the meeting here last year.  As long as any of us have been here, we have never seen a post-project review of a public private partnership project.  It has not happened.  We had quite a stand-off here last week when we threatened to close down the meeting and went into private session to discuss it.  We came back and said that we were not happy.  It was said in the meeting that they would be produced.<\/p><p>In response to the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendation in his report last year, a commitment was given that the post-project reviews would be published and it was being worked on.  Six months elapsed and the Department was here last Thursday.  We asked when was that going to happen.  As a result, a circular, dated 26 March, has been issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to all Departments since our meeting last Thursday.  We have had an instant success on this.  I said I wanted to hold over the circular.  It is only a page and a half.  There are two paragraphs I want to read, where the Secretary General refers to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report last year.  He states &quot;The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform also accepted the recommendation that such post project reviews should be published, and indicated that a requirement to this effect (subject to redaction of any commercially sensitive information) will be included in a revision of the Public Spending Code which is currently underway and in revised PPP guidance to be issued in the near future.<\/p><p>Paragraph No. 5 of this circular, which has been issued to all heads of Departments and Government offices, states: <\/p><blockquote>However, in advance of completion of the updated Public Spending Code and PPP Guidance, I wish to advise all Departments and Offices that this policy on publication of post project reviews for all public investment projects, including PPPs, is now being implemented with immediate effect.  Accordingly, any post project reviews undertaken from this date should be published at the earliest possible opportunity, following completion.<\/blockquote> <p>That is a complete success for the Committee of Public Accounts here last Thursday.  We are achieving something in respect of the publication of these reports that has never happened.  As a result of last Thursday's meeting, the circular was issued within a matter of days stating such reports should be published and to get on with it.  They are to be published at the earliest opportunity.<\/p><p>We look forward to receiving them.  I want to note this is an example of the Committee of Public Accounts achieving something that is across the entire public sector.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has been calling for it year in, year out and the meeting last week has brought about this positive result.  We will wait to see it happening, but a circular has gone out and that is a positive result.  It is an achievement as a result of people appearing before the committee.  We welcome the note and look forward to seeing the reports.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1205B is from Mr. Michael Nolan, CEO of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, providing follow up to our meeting on 8 March 2018 on motorway maintenance contracts.  We note and publish it.  People will find it interesting and should work on it as they see fit.<\/p><p> Correspondence category C is from private individuals and any other correspondence.  Correspondence No. 1162C was held over from last week.  This item is from Mr. Tadhg Daly, CEO of Nursing Homes Ireland, dated 6 March 2018, on the cost of care in HSE nursing homes.  We agreed to discuss this as part of the work programme, which we deferred last week.  We will discuss the work programme in a few minutes.  The correspondence is noted.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1176C was held over from last week and is from an individual alleging that a number of Departments are misclassifying employees as self-employed in order for some employers to evade PRSI obligations.  This is a large document and at first glance it appears to be related to a matter considered by the committee in some depth before.  I propose in the first instance that we write back to the individual to request a summary of which Departments are involved and to specify how the misclassification is being done.  It is an extensive document and we will ask for the person's assistance because he or she must have quite a bit of knowledge, so we can narrow the focus and then deal with it.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1188C is anonymous correspondence regarding alleged misuse of public moneys in relation to the children's hospital in Crumlin.  There is no evidence presented so we will just note the document.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1189C is from an individual in relation to the racing industry.  He is calling for an investigation into the industry to ensure that it is tax compliant and employees are treated fairly.  It is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners to ensure all businesses are tax compliant and if employees are treated unfairly they have recourse to the mechanisms of the Workplace Relations Commission.  I propose that we note the item and our consideration of the matter is closed.  The tax affairs of employees in an individual sector is not something we can specifically get into.  Perhaps we will forward the letter to the Revenue Commissioners for their attention and with regard to any action they deem appropriate.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1193C is from an individual, dated 22 March 2018, in relation to the wards of court funds.  We forwarded correspondence from the Courts Service to the individual.  I propose we note the correspondence for now.  We dealt with this last week and the correspondent is not happy with the response that was considered here at the meeting last week.  We have sent the documentation and I know this matter will come up again.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1195C, dated 21 March 2018, is from a specific individual in relation to the non-payment of 2017 farm grants for the GLAS and organic schemes.  I propose, with the individual's permission, that we forward the item to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for its attention and request to be updated on how the case is being addressed.  We will forward it directly to the Department and ask it to keep us informed.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1196C is an anonymous piece of correspondence in relation to Inland Fisheries Ireland.  We have had similar issues raised with us and we received a response from Inland Fisheries Ireland.  I propose we note this correspondence.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1197C is from Professor Patrick O'Shea, the president of University College Cork, dated 23 March 2018, providing information as requested by the committee on UCC's partnership with Cork Opera House.  Deputy Kelly raised this matter and we will hold it over to our next meeting because he is not here today.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1198C from Ms Catherine Colman, from the estimates section in the finance division of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, dated 23 March 2018, enclosing an information note on swimming pools.

This is the first time it has really been opened up since.  It is there in theory, but I wonder about the good use of public money.  It has to be there in practice, but the amount of grant aid is not sufficient to build a swimming pool.  It requires matching funds.  Swimming pools do not make money; they are expensive to run and the energy efficiency side of it is very important from this point of view.  Many of the pools do not materialise, and it strikes me it is a terrible waste of money to give the impression a scheme is available but we do not actually see new swimming pools emerging in some cases, or it takes years for them to be built because they must find the matching funding.  I absolutely support the need, but I question the value of this approach because if the local authority will not put up matching funding then we will not get the swimming pool.  There is a constant round of disappointment because there are announcements without follow through.  Areas most affected by this are those which do not have facilities to begin with that can be expanded on, such as my area and the areas of the Chairman and Deputy Cassells, which are growing areas.  If we are going to look at some of these initiatives, can we look at them from the point of view of whether what is being proposed is viable, or is this something that really should be looked at from another committee's perspective?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#E00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>The Deputy is talking about the viability of future projects and the line Department is the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.

It is an unfortunate reality that the viability of these projects is called into question.  I have a legacy community based swimming pool in an affluent suburb, which has required consistent and continuous funding from local government and national Government to keep it going, and now we are proposing to put pools into communities which, quite frankly, really require them because there are no private facilities that offer the same service at a reasonable cost.  However, the ongoing maintenance and the energy and environmental side of things have to be taken into consideration.  I am all for these projects, but the reality from the perspective of the Committee of Public Accounts is we are spending huge amounts of money on projects and there are no criteria that I can see in terms of a capacity of a community to support it or a capacity of a community to have a sufficient number of residents within a reasonable distance to access the facility.  I question the viability of continuing funding for projects such as these based on good value for money and taxpayers' money being put into projects.<\/p> <p>  Of course, I am all for these projects, but we really need an injection of reality into the conversation as to whether they can be funded.  If we look at other community facilities that have been built, there is one, for instance, in Donabate which required &euro;600,000 of taxpayers' money to keep it from going under a few years back, and that was before the crash I might point out.  There are some serious questions that have to be asked as to whether the State can afford to run these projects and whether we might be better looking at public private partnership as an option to keep them running.  This is not an ideological thing, it just relates to whether or not it is possible to afford these things.  It is something I would certainly like to weigh in on, and I accept it would be a matter, in terms of policy direction, for the line committee and the Minister to look at, but we as a body have a responsibility to look at whether it represents good value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#E00400","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I suspect there would be no money in it for public private partnerships so I do not expect that is a likely route.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#E00500","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>It is just a suggestion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#E00600","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>There have been instances where there was public funding for a number of pools in the same location.

We might as well not have a national standard if we do not have the means and do not recognise that we need to provide sufficient money because carrying a debt in a situation that is very finely tuned means that we are into a difficulty from day one.

Dr. O'Connor provides a breakdown of consultancy and legal fees and copies of minutes from board meetings where key decisions were made relating to the merger with Institute of Technology Tralee.  An explanation for the higher costs and effects on student services is provided.  Can we note and publish this documentation?

I know that in the case of Waterford and Carlow, they are way behind the Munster one, for example.

It talks about corporate procurement plans and the national public procurement policy framework introduced in 2005.  Then there is a voluntary code of practice.  It goes back to what we said last week.  All this seems to be on a voluntary basis, not on a statutory basis.  There are guidelines, but that is all they are.

The committee and the HEA feel it is necessary, and that is where it rests.  Notwithstanding that, this university has not even given the accounts parallel with its own accounts.  The issue of foundations and who controls what is huge.  When NUI Galway, NUIG, appeared before us, it very proudly told the committee it had no control over it, so therefore there was no need to do this.  Again, that office is on the campus site.  It does not pay rent or anything.  In fact, the question of why it would pay rent was laughed at.  <\/p> <p>  There is a huge blurring of boundaries here that is not under scrutiny.  That is of extreme concern to me.  If the university does not control the foundation, it begs questions as to whether the foundation controls the university, the direction in which it is going or the nature of the buildings.  Notwithstanding that very good things could come out of a foundation, it has to be done in an open and accountable way.  In my view, that has not been done.  If the president of a university says the university has no control over it and yet the president and the bursar of that university sits on its board, then there are serious issues.  If there is a separate board in America, for example, with the president on that board as well, there are questions that have to be asked if we are to hold a system to account and achieve value for money, in particular when it came across repeatedly that more and more money was coming from the foundations, so the universities were not happy to have them scrutinised.  The universities maintained that the foundations were entirely separate.  They did not recognise that the universities are what they are because of public money.  For the record, it is something I will be keeping a close eye on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#G01700","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy want the committee to include that issue in the letter to UCC and for it to give us its rationale?

We have the NTMA, National Treasury Management Agency, listed on 21 June to deal with its accounts and financial statements.

Under the new licence they are supposed to be used for the promotion of the national lottery and special draws, but there is no oversight of that.  That is the role of regulator.  The regulator has written to PLI asking for the figure and was told by PLI that it does not have to give the figure.  I raised it last week with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and he is refusing to state what the figure is or what oversight there is in terms of the role of regulator in ensuring that unclaimed prize money is being used as it is supposed to be used under the licence.

I do not think the latter is the appropriate body to manage this fund.  We now have a State Claims Agency that manages these types of funds.  We will include discussion of this issue in the work programme.  Long-term, we should not have a particular body managing the wards of court fund given the expertise in the NTMA to manage it, which we are told is the best in the world.

As per the schedule, we are due to meet the Tax Appeals Commission on Thursday, 28 June at 9 a.m. and the Revenue Commissioners in the afternoon.  I am suggesting that we ask those agencies to attend the meeting with the Department of Finance on 19 April.  We had already decided that we could deal with the Tax Appeals Commission in a two-hour meeting in any event and we have already had some discussion with the Revenue Commissioners on corporation tax so I think we would be able to move quickly through the second half of Revenue Commissioners' business.  The issues for discussion with the Department of Finance include Government debt, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council are routine items to note.  We will try to combine our discussions with the Department of Finance, the Tax Appeals Commission and the Revenue Commissioners to one meeting on 19 April in an effort to free-up space for other hearings.  We will communicate with the Department of Finance, the Tax Appeals Commission and the Revenue Commissioners in this regard.  There is no point in our meeting only with the Department of Finance and concluding our business with it by lunch time if we can complete the work with the other organisations in the afternoon.

This was distributed across five expenditure programmes, as indicated in the figure on screen.  The largest programme was in relation to arts, culture and film, accounting for expenditure of just under &euro;174 million or 47% of the total for the year.  This included grants of &euro;60 million to the Arts Council and &euro;15.6 million to the Irish Film Board.  Funding of almost &euro;42 million was provided towards the general expenses of State museums and art galleries, with &euro;21 million spent on cultural activities, including funding of &euro;5.5 million provided to Culture Ireland.  A total of &euro;28.4 million was spent in 2016 on the programme for the Decade of Centenaries 1912 &ndash; 1922.<\/p> <p>  Chaith an Roinn &euro;53.3 milli&uacute;n ar a cl&aacute;r ar son na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus na nOile&aacute;n.

Waterways Ireland received &euro;26.6 million from Vote 33, while the Language Body received &euro;13.2 million.  I audit these and five other cross-Border bodies jointly with my counterpart in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The final programme funded under Vote 33 in 2016 related to regional development and rural affairs.  Responsibility for the programme transferred into Vote 33 as part of the restructuring of portfolios following Government formation in June 2016.  Under a further reconfiguration in July 2017, responsibility for regional development and rural affairs transferred again to the newly formed Department of Rural and Community Affairs.  Vote 33 was then renamed \"culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht\".<\/p> <p>  While responsibility for the programme was transferred into the Vote only at mid-year, the account presents the full-year Estimate and outturn for the programme in line with transfer of responsibility rules.  As shown in the account, expenditure under the rural development programme in 2016 amounted to &euro;51.7 million.  The largest elements of expenditure were just under &euro;25 million spent on national rural development schemes, &euro;10 million spent on the Leader rural economy programme and &euro;9.9 million spent on town and village regeneration.  For comparison purposes, note 6.7 showing the change from year to year has been provided.  It is not on the face of the appropriation accounts.  I have also provided a diagram for members, which aims to summarise the public bodies within the Department's aegis.  Members should note that the Western Development Commission has been under the aegis of the Department of Rural and Community Development since 2017.<\/p> <p>  I have given a clear audit opinion on the appropriation account.  However, I draw attention in the audit report to non-compliant procurement disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control and to chapters 7 and 15 of my report on the accounts of the public services for 2016.  Chapter 7 refers to the dormant account fund which was examined by the committee on 8 February.  As noted then, oversight of that fund is now the responsibility of the Department of Rural and Community Development.<\/p> <p>  Turning now to the chapter, the report before the committee this morning concerns the administration and management of the provision of &euro;8.4 million in public funds over many years to assist in the development of an art house cinema in Galway city.  The largest funding contributions came from the Department, with a final contribution of &euro;3.5 million, while Galway City Council contributed &euro;2.4 million and the Irish Film Board contributed &euro;1.1 million.<\/p> <p>  In 2006, the Department launched the second arts and culture capital enhancement support scheme, which is generally referred to as ACCESS II.  The aim of the scheme was to provide cultural and arts organisations with funding to build new cultural infrastructure and develop existing facilities.  A private company called Solas\/Galway Picture Palace Teoranta applied for funding in 2006 under the ACCESS II scheme to establish a specialist art house cinema in Galway city.  By May 2007, the total committed or projected public investment for the project amounted to &euro;6.3 million, including a &euro;2 million ACCESS ll grant.  In 2008, Galway City Council purchased a site for just under &euro;2 million and made it available to Solas under a 99 year lease.  Solas applied for and received planning permission for a 360 seat cinema complex, which represented a 30% increase in capacity relative to the original proposal.<\/p> <p>  In July 2009, following a tender competition, Solas awarded a contract for the construction of the cinema and the project commenced in the months that followed.  The project experienced significant difficulties and by June 2010, it became evident that an adjoining property was physically at risk and the work was stopped.  Following negotiations, Solas agreed to demolish and rebuild the adjoining property in October 2010.  In March 2011, the Department received notification from Solas that the building contractor was terminating the contract, citing poor ground conditions and design inadequacies.<\/p> <p>  A second construction contract was awarded by Solas in March 2012 for the remaining works.  The Department stated this was done without its knowledge or consent.  The first phase of the works covered by the second contract finished in early 2014.  No further construction or fit-out followed until, in July 2016, agreement was reached for a private investor to be granted a 30 year lease to manage and operate the cinema in return for a contribution of funds.  In July 2017, Solas entered liquidation.  I understand the cinema has been recently completed and has now commenced operations, albeit some nine years later than originally planned.<\/p> <p>  While the project was developed by a private entity with grant and other funding assistance from public funds, in practice, the State bore the project and financial risks.  There was no overall oversight arrangement in place for this project at the outset, despite the planned involvement of a variety of public agencies in funding it.  When Solas ran into difficulties, Galway City Council stepped in to take over responsibility for the project and charges on the property were registered to safeguard the State's interests.  I thank the Acting Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":207,"content":"<p>We should give the Comptroller and Auditor General a gold star for his use of Connemara Irish.

I am very pleased to have this opportunity to address the committee at what I believe is a very significant period in time for the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.<\/p> <p>  The recently announced Project Ireland 2040 sets out a roadmap for delivering on key strategic outcomes for the country, including strengthening rural economies and communities, and enhancing amenity and heritage in both urban and rural settings.  The Department will play a critical role in delivering on these strategic outcomes.<\/p> <p>  As part of Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan provides for significant and much-needed investment in our cultural infrastructure throughout the country making sure that opportunities to participate in arts and culture are available wherever one lives, not just in the cities.  It is also clear on our responsibility to protect our built and natural heritage and to enhance our visitor facilities so that more people from Ireland and abroad can experience our unique heritage tourism assets.<\/p> <p>  The sectors the Department represents are diverse and far reaching, and it is vital that we ensure the investment will be spread across all three of the Department&rsquo;s divisions - culture, heritage and Gaeltacht - so that all of the Department&rsquo;s stakeholders will see investment in their area over the lifetime of the plan. <\/p> <p>  The significant scale of the investment proposed over the ten years &ndash; approximately &euro;1.2 billion &ndash; means that it is critical that the Department develop the required capacity to deliver on the full extent of the proposed investment in the most efficient and cost-effective manner, delivering for our stakeholders across society while at the same time ensuring value for money for the Irish taxpayer.  All of the proposed investment will be underpinned by robust evaluation and appraisal methodologies, complying with the public spending code and ensuring that all investments deliver demonstrable benefits to citizens, communities and businesses across Ireland. <\/p> <p>  As Accounting Officer for the Department, I am determined to learn from any issues that have arisen in the past with a view to ensuring this programme of investment and existing programmes of investment provide the optimum value for money to the benefit of all taxpayers and communities we serve.  The Comptroller and Auditor General and this committee have an important role to play in identifying issues and in challenging and supporting the Department in addressing issues as they arise.  This is in addition to the controls and processes that are already in place within the Department.  We have worked very constructively in recent years with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, seeking its advice and input where issues arise, and taking on board its recommendations for improvements in how we govern expenditure and the management of risk within the Department. <\/p> <p>  With regard to my appearance here today, the briefing note provided to the committee outlines: the key achievements of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in 2016 by programme area; and the programme priorities of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for 2017-18 and the future.  The briefing note also provides some detail on the Galway art house cinema project which is the subject of Chapter 15 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 2016 and which opened to the public last week. <\/p> <p>  The committee will be aware that in June 2016, as part of the restructuring of Departments announced by the Taoiseach, a new Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was established.  It essentially brought together all of the functions from the then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, together with regional development and rural related functions from the then Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.<\/p> <p>  Responsibility for the regional and rural affairs functions, along with certain community functions that were previously dealt with by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, formally transferred to the new Department of Rural and Community Development with effect from 27 July 2017.  The Department was renamed the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht with effect from 1 August 2017.<\/p> <p>  The year 2016 was a very significant one for the Department as we celebrated the centenary of the Easter Rising of 1916.  The Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme was a whole-of-Government initiative, led by the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to provide the nation with the opportunity to remember and reflect on this pivotal event in our history.<\/p> <p>  There was an extensive and diverse programme of State ceremonial and public events.  An array of community-led projects was delivered throughout the country in conjunction with local authorities.  An extensive education programme was delivered across all levels, and a number of significant capital projects were completed under the permanent reminders component of the programme, including the GPO Witness History Centre, Richmond Barracks, the Kevin Barry rooms at the National Concert Hall and Ionad Cult&uacute;rtha an Phiarsaigh in Rosmuc. <\/p> <p>  As the Irish language was central to the 1916 ideal of an independent sovereign Ireland, the language was interwoven throughout the programme of events, while a distinctive range of events and activities through Irish was delivered as part of An Teanga Bheo &ndash; the living language strand of the programme.  The entire programme was underpinned by five intersecting and overlapping themes: remembering, reconciling, presenting, imagining and celebrating.<\/p> <p>  The response to the programme was a year of extraordinary participation, by all walks of life, across all of the components, ranging from concerts and exhibitions at our national cultural institutions, to schools&rsquo; activities, flag-raising ceremonies, events to remember the role of women in 1916 and, indeed, to remember the children who lost their lives during the Rising and a whole range of other shared community, historical and cultural events.  This remarkable level of participation was in many ways epitomised by the crowds of more than one million people on the streets of Dublin on Easter weekend 2016. <\/p> <p>  In December 2016 Creative Ireland was launched as the Government&rsquo;s legacy programme from the Ireland 2016 initiative and as the main implementation vehicle for the ambition set out in Culture 2025 - &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach, Ireland&rsquo;s first national cultural policy developed on foot of an extensive consultation process with stakeholders throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s proposed programme of investment under Project Ireland 2040 prioritises strategic and sustainable projects that demonstrate clear public benefits as committed to under the Cl&aacute;r &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach, the Creative Ireland programme, and goes beyond this to deliver much-needed investment in our national parks, monuments, built and natural heritage, language and islands. <\/p> <p>  Ensuring that we take the lessons from the past as we move towards a 10 year investment programme in culture and heritage is critically important and I therefore welcome the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General as outlined in Chapter 15 of the 2016 report.  That chapter examined the administration and management of the Galway art house cinema project, including funding and payments made by the Department and other public bodies related to the new cinema.  There were two recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General on foot of this detailed examination, both of which I have accepted in full in my capacity as Accounting Officer for the Department. <\/p> <p>  The first recommendation was that the Department should review its approach to the projects that are being grant aided, in particular where the key project risks are carried by the State.  Where projects do not progress as expected or serious shortcomings are identified with the project sponsor, early action needs to be taken, including formal reviews of the project viability, in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s public spending code requirements. <\/p> <p>  I can assure the committee that the Department is fully committed to ensuring that all projects are effectively managed in accordance with the public spending code and relevant grant circulars.  Measures are in place to ensure that staff are appropriately trained and supported in the appraisal and oversight of grant-aided projects as part of the Department&rsquo;s annual quality assurance process, and the Department held a number of training sessions around the appraisal and management of capital projects in 2016 and, as promised to the Comptroller and Auditor General, in 2017, and as recently as March 2018. <\/p> <p>  The second recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General was that particular care should be exercised by lead funders to ensure adequate formal oversight mechanisms are in place and operated where a variety of funding agencies are involved. <\/p> <p>  Once again, I reiterate my commitment as Accounting Officer to ensure that all projects are managed in accordance with the provisions of the public spending code and relevant circulars.  The training provided to staff in the past two years has emphasised the importance of the early establishment of performance metrics to be used as a signal for action during the implementation phase, the need for regular management reports to be provided and reviewed, and how best to deal with project challenges. <\/p> <p>  In addition, I wish to advise the committee that the Department is participating in an organisational capability review, to be conducted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform later this year.  The purpose of these reviews, which are being rolled out across all Departments under the Civil Service renewal programme, are to embed a culture of regular and objective assessments of the capacity and capability of the Department to achieve its objectives.  While only a small number of Departments or agencies have been reviewed to date, I had actively sought to have an early review of this Department, and I believe this will prepare us well to deal with the challenges that lie ahead as we move towards implementation of a ten-year capital investment programme.<\/p><p> I am establishing an advisory group within the Department to contribute to both the preparatory work and the delivery phases of the review, which is due to commence in the second half of 2018, and will ensure that the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts will be taken into account in the review process.  I am confident that this review will facilitate the Department in building the required capacity for the effective evaluation, appraisal and management of capital projects.  It will identify the skills, structures, processes and personnel needed on top of what we already have, and determine whether such structures need to be put in place to deliver effectively for all our stakeholders, which include the taxpayer.  I am happy to expand on any of these areas, or explore any other areas as the committee wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Katherine Licken","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I thank the witness for that comprehensive opening statement.

I cannot think of a more inappropriate name in light of the history of this.  I have to declare that I was on the council for a period of time and this is a difficult topic.  Despite the word \"Solas\", there was an absence of light in the way this was handled.  I will ask a few quick questions on it.  As a councillor, I, along with a number of other councillors, struggled to ask questions about this.  I will be coming back to this later in regard to Foras na Gaeilge and other projects.  This is a small country, with small cities.  Very often asking questions is not rewarded, which is what we have seen here at the Committee of Public Accounts.  However, it is extremely important to ask questions.<\/p> <p>  In regard to art, which I will come back to, there is a perception that one is a philistine if one questions it.

The figure of &euro;593,000 was to be paid for the first 15 years and for the next 15 years &euro;63,000 a year would be taken off that for refurbishment costs at four quarterly repayments.

To me it looks like a calamity of errors from 2006 to 2018.  I will not go over it all again because the witnesses have answered enough questions on it.  I cannot understand how that could have happened given that professional people were brought in and four site investigations were carried out with architects and engineers.  Ground conditions seem to have been the problem.  There was water logging.  Ground works were carried out and then a neighbouring property was damaged and that had to be rebuilt.  To me, that is laughable.  Professional people were involved who were supposed to have degrees and accreditation to carry out site visits and yet we see what happened.  That does not make sense.  It does not add up.  It is poor project management.  Who is paying for it?  The taxpayer.  A total of &euro;8.4 million was spent.  I will not say it has gone down the Swanee because at least we have a cinema there.  It took a private operator to come in and finish the project.  Questions must be asked all around.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for his analysis today and what was presented.  It shows that there was something seriously wrong.  Why are there not better systems in place to stop that happening?  It took 12 years for the project to come to a conclusion.

If there are two, the tender competitions potentially put one out of business for five years during the term of the contract.  Therefore, anything to do with island transport services is extremely emotive and gets island communities extremely exercised.  That does not detract from the fact that there are no exemptions for us from using public tendering procedures.  That can create a difficulty.  The other difficulty is that when one is dealing with a very small market, one has to leave the tender conditions and the conditions to be complied with as open as possible in order to encourage competition.  If we were to have specified that a vessel could not be older than ten years, for example, the likelihood is that we would have got no tenders for that service.  Where would we have been left then given our obligation to provide what is a lifeline service to the islands?  We have to take these points into account.

With challenges such as Brexit, climate change and an expanding trade policy on the horizon, its importance cannot be underestimated.  The committee has been following discussions of CAP at the Council in recent meetings, as well as communications published last November, and there are plans to make a series of contributions ahead of the first proposal, which is expected in June.

The committee will recall that my Department briefed it on CAP and Mercosur late last year.  I will endeavour to avoid going over old ground and brief the Committee on the current state of play on each of these issues.<\/p> <p>  I will begin with the reflection on the post 2020 Common Agricultural Policy, which is currently under way at EU level.  Members will be aware that the EU Commission, through DG Agri, intends to publish legislative proposals on a new policy in June of this year.  This is intended to follow in a logical sequence proposals from DG Budget on a multi-annual financial framework.  These are to be published in May 2018.  The Minister for Finance takes the lead on this issue.  That framework will establish the maximum annual ceilings within which annual EU budgets will be negotiated in the period 2020-2027.<\/p><p>There will be obvious pressures on the CAP budget in the next financial period.  These result not only from the departure of one of the largest net contributors from the EU, but also from new and very real political imperatives such as migration and defence.  I want to make one thing clear.  Ireland has been, and will continue to be, a defender of the CAP budget.  In his speech to the European Parliament the Taoiseach made it clear that Ireland is prepared to make additional contributions to the EU budget, but only if these are to be used to fund &ldquo;things that contribute to the advancement of the European ideal&rdquo;.  The Common Agricultural Policy, as established by the treaties, is a core policy of the European Union and is at the heart of the European ideal.  Not all member states feel the same, however.  At this stage, the Netherlands, Denmark, Austria and Sweden have indicated that they are not prepared to make additional contributions.  Commissioner Oettinger has indicated to the finance committee of this House that he anticipates a cut of between 5% and 10% in the CAP budget, against a background where some member states are seeking a 30% cut.  So there will be some tough negotiations ahead.<br\/><br\/>Moving to the likely shape of any future Common Agricultural Policy, the members have already been briefed on the broad shape of the Commission communication published in November 2017.  Key themes include: more discretion for member states, simplification, continued support for farm incomes, a greater focus on the environment and climate change, new options for risk management, and encouragement for generational renewal.  My Department ran a public consultation from 26 January to 23 March.  This included six public meetings held throughout the country during the month of February.  The venues were Carlow, Charleville, Navan, Athlone, Claremorris and Carrick-on-Shannon.  I attended three of these meetings and the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, attended the other three.  These meetings were instructive and while attendees were universally supportive of a strong CAP budget, there were, as might be expected, a variety of views on the more difficult issues such as the distribution of direct payments, the definition of active farmer and the means by which farmers should be compensated for their environmental contribution.  These are matters with which we will have to grapple in the context of any new CAP.  The aim of this exercise was to hear the views of citizens on what is a strategically important policy for Ireland.  Approximately 150 written submissions have been received and these will help to inform Ireland&rsquo;s position in the upcoming negotiations.  My Department is currently analysing the submissions and will produce a summary report in due course, which I will be happy to publish.<br\/><br\/>There has been significant progress in relation to Brexit since the joint declaration late last year, but there is much more to do.  Negotiators have reached agreement on most elements of the withdrawal agreement, including elements of the draft protocol on Ireland-Northern Ireland, which relate to the common travel area and North-South co-operation.  They are also <i>ad idem<\/i>on the need for the final agreement to include text which gives legal effect to the commitments made on Northern Ireland.  This commitment to avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland is critically important.  Ireland has the full support of EU member state colleagues in this objective.  Prime Minister May wrote to President Tusk on 19 March to restate her solemn commitment to all the undertakings given by the UK in December&rsquo;s joint report.  This includes an explicit commitment &ldquo;to agreeing, in the withdrawal agreement, operational legal text for at least the so called backstop option, set out in the joint report&rdquo;.  This backstop requires the UK to maintain &ldquo;full alignment with those rules of the internal market and the customs union which now, or in the future, support North-South co-operation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 agreement.&rdquo;  This kind of alignment is a prerequisite for trade to continue as at present.  Of course, if the UK can develop alternative proposals, that is fine too, and the negotiating guidelines provide for such a development.  Any such proposals must respect the Single Market and the customs union.  The EU and the UK have agreed on a detailed agenda for discussions over the coming weeks to finalise this text.  As part of the withdrawal agreement, a text on a transition, which will apply to 31 December 2020, has also been agreed.  This will provide much needed certainty to people in the agrifood business who are trying to prepare for Brexit.  The commitment to full application of the EU <i>acquis<\/i>during transition means that food business operators, including farmers, can be confident that the UK&rsquo;s regulatory environment will remain the same as that of the EU during transition.  This is critically important for the continuation of trade in agrifood products on the basis of current arrangements.  During transition, the UK will remain bound by EU regulation, while in general having no role in the institutional legislative arrangements.  On fisheries, the Common Fisheries Policy, existing reciprocal access and quota sharing arrangements, will continue to apply in full during transition, although the UK will have a consultative role only.  This is a critically important element in the agreement and has been widely welcomed by the industry here.  The EU Council has also agreed guidelines for the negotiation of the framework for the future relationship.  Once we are through transition, our objective will be to have as close a trading relationship as possible with the EU, while respecting the integrity of the Single Market.  These guidelines will be presented to the UK in the essential principles papers, on the basis of positions put forward by the task force.  Based on UK red lines, the negotiating guidelines indicate that the objective of the negotiation will be a free trade agreement, with zero tariffs and no quantitative restrictions.  On the basis of her recent Mansion House speech, this objective would appear to be shared by Prime Minister May.  This is critically important for trade in agrifood products because these are the products that attract the highest tariff rates.<br\/><br\/>On fisheries, the guidelines clearly state that in the overall context of the free trade agreement reciprocal access to fishing waters and resources should be maintained.  This is also extremely important.  The guidelines also refer to customs co-operation and the application of sanitary and phyto sanitary disciplines.  These are necessary controls, but have the potential to cause friction at borders, so we will be keeping a very close eye on these elements of the negotiation.  There are still a significant number of moving parts in this negotiation.  The timeline is extremely challenging.  Nonetheless, progress has been made in a number of areas which are critically important to the agrifood sector in Ireland.  EU-UK negotiations on both the withdrawal agreement and future relationship framework aim to conclude by October 2018, so that they can be referred to the European Parliament, member states and the UK Parliament for ratification before exit day on 30 March 2019.<br\/><br\/>I would like to turn briefly to the negotiations between the EU and Mercosur countries on a possible trade deal.  My colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, has primary responsibility for bilateral and multilateral trade deals, but of course our Departments collaborate closely on trade issues of relevance to the agrifood sector.  I must begin by saying that as a general proposition Ireland is pro-trade.  Ireland has a small open economy, among the most open in the world.  Trade is our lifeblood, particularly in the agrifood sector, with over 80% of output exported.  We are supportive of trade deals, provided they are balanced and provided our most vulnerable sectors are protected.  From the very beginning of discussions on a trade deal with Mercosur, however, Ireland has articulated concerns about the potential impact on sensitive sectors and, in particular, on the beef sector.  These concerns related to the size of any tariff rate quota for beef and its composition.  Additional volumes of beef imported from Mercosur countries at preferential tariff rates, are likely to exert downward pressure on beef prices given that the EU market is at present more or less in balance and that consumer demand for beef is in decline.  The specific tariff rates and the extent to which any quota is segmented, for example, between high quality and manufacturing beef, would be significant determinants of the degree of negative impact on target markets for Irish beef.  Ireland has continued to engage with the Commission and with other member states at the highest level to ensure that the European beef sector is protected.  Our officials continue to make strong interventions at the trade policy committee, I have made a number of interventions at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council and, as recently as 20 March, the Taoiseach wrote to the President of the Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, outlining Ireland&rsquo;s serious concerns.  I understand that the latest round of negotiations took place between officials in Asuncion between 21 February and 2 March, but that there are still a considerable number of issues in play, including Mercosur offers on dairy, ethanol, car parts and geographical indicators.  I can assure the committee that I will continue to act to protect the best interests of Europe&rsquo;s beef industry as these negotiations play out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018032900002#C00300","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522328400,"counter":811,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for taking the time to come in today.  The Minister started off with CAP, so I will touch on it first as well.  The overall objective has to be maintaining the budget and ensuring that it is protected.  In terms of the commitment that Ireland is giving and also the Minister's sense of where other European countries are at, how confident is the Minister that the budget as it is at the moment can be protected and what will that take?  It is clear now that Brexit will be completed before the new multi-annual financial framework, MFF, comes into play, but simply maintaining the overall budget - it will take additional contributions from existing countries to do that - will not necessarily protect the CAP budget because of the additional pressures.  I know that is a big challenge, but I would like to get the Minister's perspective on that.<\/p><p>We need to be crystal clear.  Will the Minister clarify whether the Government is committed to doing what it takes not only to keep the EU budget steady but also specifically to keep the Common Agricultural Policy budget at its current value?  The overall budget is the most important aspect of CAP.  How that will be distributed once the overall budget has been agreed?  What is the Minister's perspective on how that may unfold?<\/p><p> The Minister undertook some consultation recently.  Specifically, does the Minister believe the reference years of 2000, 2001 and 2002 should continue to play a part in the overall distribution of CAP?  What is the Minister's perspective on that?<\/p><p> I believe kicking the Brexit backstop to touch until October was a backward step.  What had been communicated to us at all stages was that the Brexit negotiations would be conducted in two phases.  Phase one was to deal with the Border question, among other topics, and phase two was to deal with trade talks.  I was with some colleagues in Brussels shortly before the legal text was published by the European Commission.  Certainly, the perception at that stage was that the Commission would push to ensure that Britain would accept the legal text.  In reality, Britain has not accepted the legal text.<\/p><p> Those involved have moved into phase two, which deals with trade talks.  The issue of the backstop has been deferred until the final agreement in October.  The idea of the backstop was that it would be in place in the event of agreement not being reached.  Now, the backstop is not going to be agreed until the final agreement is reached.  The Minister may point out that the backstop was already agreed last December, but we have seen that when it comes to the crunch question of defining the backstop there are totally different interpretations.  Until there is agreement on the legal text, no backstop is in place.<\/p><p> This question is particularly important from an agricultural point of view given our position as an all-island economy, as is the importance of having no border, either regulatory or in terms of tariffs, within the island.  It is a missed opportunity that the Government has let slide.  Europe has stepped back on this as well and has moved into phase two.<\/p><p> The most important thing is that the overall trade agreement is positive and that east-west arrangements between Europe and Britain are appropriate.  It is difficult to call anything a backstop anymore given that it has not been agreed, ultimately, it is to be a part of the final agreement.<\/p><p> Mercosur has major implications, especially the proposal for 70,000 tonnes that has been formally offered.  It seems that 99,000 tonnes has been informally offered.  It appears clear to me from the replies of the Minister to parliamentary questions that the Government has more or less accepted and agreed that the proposal for 70,000 tonnes is something we can live with.  The Minister has indicated in the replies to parliamentary questions from me that the Department's objective is not to increase on 70,000 tonnes and not to go towards 99,000 tonnes.  The clear subtext is that the Minister can live with 70,000 tonnes and that the Minister has agreed, whether formally or informally, with his European partners that he will wear that.  That is the bottom line from what I can see.  Can the Minister comment on that?<\/p><p> Representatives of the farming community have said many times that 70,000 tonnes would have severe implications for our beef trade.  It would lead to a direct reduction in the value of European beef.  The Commission's market assessment indicates and proves as much.  I do not believe the Minister should agree to 70,000 tonnes.  Basically, that amounts to letting the beef sector carry the can for concessions in other sectors of the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018032900002#D00200","speaker":"1244","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522328400,"counter":813,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for the second day this week.  I will start with the CAP budget.  Everyone is in unison with the view that the budget needs to be maintained and even increased if we are to make any difference.  The big issue is that so many EU member states have said thus far that they are not prepared to pay in that extra amount.  What does that mean?  What is going to be the outworking of that?  Where are we going to end with this?  If several strong and influential states make that stand at this point, will it require a lengthy negotiation?  Will they only come to the table if they know what that money is going to be spent on or where it will be spent?<\/p> <p>  We are all conscious of the other side of this, that is to say, the reform of how the allocation is being distributed is a big issue, especially with regard to Pillar 1.  Indeed, I imagine the Minister was conscious of this when he was going around the country meeting people in the various places at the six meetings.<\/p> <p>  Often it is said that 80% of the money goes to 20% of the farmers.  That flies in the face of the essence of the Common Agricultural Policy.  A major part of CAP is sustaining the family farm.  Certainly, that figure is often quoted.  We need to do something to change it around and to make better provision.  One such change is around the levelling of payments on a per hectare basis.  I am keen to know the view of the Minister at this early stage.<\/p> <p>  The greening element is part of Pillar 1.  I understand the idea behind greening is now to integrate everything into one basic payment.  Is that the predominant option?  If it is, will it mean some form of environmental measures in Pillar 1?  Will it mean some action is required by farmers apart from simply existing and undertaking basic activity?<\/p> <p>  The big issue facing many farmers with Brexit is the possibility of the British market drying up and Britain importing food products from elsewhere.  That is something of which we are all conscious.  It might not be so easy for those responsible in Britain to do that in reality when it comes down to it.  The issue is that until they discover that it will not be so easy to do that and that they will have to come back to talk to people in Ireland - their nearest and safest market from which to source their products - many businesses are going to be under stress.  This applies especially for businesses that are exporting.<\/p> <p>  The North-South issue is one dimension but the cross-channel element is another.  Many businesses will need something more solid than the option to get loans.  They will need something in place to ensure their businesses survive the volatile period.  A period of two to three years of uncertainty after Britain leaves is likely until things settle down.  During that period we will have to come up with a solution to keep businesses going.<\/p> <p>  The Mercosur deal is interesting.  We were in Brussels some months ago and we met the Commissioner, Mr. Hogan.  At the time, he was talking it up and suggested it would happen fast and that we were near the end game.  It has not come at us that quickly.  Does the Minister have any indication of the timeline in that regard?  The potential 99,000 tonnes of prime cut is really the issue from an Irish farming perspective.  The issue is taking in prime cuts to the EU under the Mercosur deal from South America.  Is there any sense of a timescale for that to happen?  I have talked to people who export to various parts of the world.  They maintain there is a lengthy period before people can get their product approved.  What will that mean?  Does it mean the EU will have to go out to Latin America and inspect factories there?  What timeline are we looking at before we can see some of the product coming in?  Even if Mercosur was to go through in the next six months, are we looking at one year or five years before we see product arriving in the EU?  The latter timescale would give us some preparation for the change.  That is not to say anyone believes this is the right thing to do; it is certainly not the right thing to do and we should move away from it as quickly as possible.  At the same time we need to understand how we would deal with it if it were to come about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018032900002#E00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1522328400,"counter":814,"content":"<p>We all know that the CAP is the foundation block for food security and the healthy production of food at affordable prices for consumers.  However, CAP measures have been too prescriptive and they have been too much in one's face.  A simplification process has to take place in respect of measures which farmers on the ground have to deal with and the Minister has to give priority to this.  I know he will.  Member states will now get more latitude and, while EU objectives will be set at Commission level, they will be tailored to suit participants.  This will not involve self-funding but will allow flexibility in things such as setting ditches.  Previously, if a farmer was off by millimetres he or she was penalised and nonsense such as that has to stop.  As long a new ditch or fence is put in place it is grand because no one knows better than the farmer on the ground and no one cares more.  Farmers have been penalised by 10%, 15% or 20% for nonsensical stuff.<\/p> <p>  The MFF is important in the context of filling the Brexit gap, which I call the hole in the bucket.

We are prepared to play a role but we will not put in money unless everybody else puts money in.  If we go up to 1.3%, everyone else has to go up to 1.3%.

The case has to be made to consumers too because it is taxpayers' money and it does not grow on trees.  We can all come in here with a shopping list but we must be realistic.  I have always supported the CAP in my 27 years here but my view was always laced with reality.

There is a danger that, if we fail to get a trade agreement, the UK will go off to New Zealand, Australia, Argentina and elsewhere.  Phytosanitary, sanitary and other health standards are also important and they will take a lot of time.  I do not care if I do not see the Minister in the D&aacute;il for the next nine months as long as he is out there fighting for an agreement as that is the most important thing.<\/p> <p>  Mercosur sends shivers down the spines of people from Westmeath, including Senator Paul Daly and me, and it does the same to people from Longford and other midland counties which are highly dependent on the beef industry.  There has to be give and take but if we wipe out the beef industry it will have serious repercussions.  We have heard about the drop in the numbers of suckler cows, which is an unrelated issue, but that will be like a walk in the park as compared to what could happen to our beef industry.  The Mercosur agreement will take a lot of work and, as Deputy Kenny said, it is the prime cuts that will be hammered.<\/p> <p>  In the Mercosur negotiations on beef imports, our focus needs to be on the costs of importing from South America and the issue of regulatory compliance, in particular the record of the South Americans in this regard.  I laugh when I hear talk of the effect of air miles on the environment but we focus on environmental sustainability, while beef from South America will have to transported over thousands of miles, which is a contradiction of our approach to carbonisation.  I read that deforestation had taken place in Argentina to make space for the industry there and this contradicts our approach.  If an Irish farmer did something like that he would be penalised but we are talking about getting an agreement to allow it in this case.  There will be trade-offs and we are certainly open to trade but the Minister should fight this with all his might.<\/p> <p>  Bord Bia is hiring 27 or 28 new people to deal with Brexit and that is good news.  Where does the Minister think alternative markets can be secured?  Whatever happens, there will be a bit of a damper and some negativity.  What efforts have been made to compensate for a downturn as a result of Brexit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018032900002#F00300","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1522328400,"counter":817,"content":"<p>We will take questions from the other three members and the Minister can then answer all of them together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018032900002#G00100","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1522328400,"counter":818,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Willie Penrose.  We are at a critical crossroads.  The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, is a key cornerstone.  The Minister does not have an easy job in delivering what we need in the economy and for industries.  We have probably had one of the worst springs we have ever experienced and farmers' incomes are under huge pressure as a result.  The three things about which we are talking will increase the pressure.  The vast majority of farmers depend almost completely on the CAP for their income, while we have Brexit and Mercosur coming down the tracks.  There is no good news in any of the three stories for farmers' incomes, on which we do not want to lose focus.  Maintaining the budget will be a mighty challenge, but its maintenance is critical for all sectors of the agrifood industry.  I have been nagging about the CAP for many years and will say to the next person who says this negotiation will simplify it that I have been hearing that for the past 20 years and that it will not happen.  We will put up with the lack of simplification if we can hold onto the pounds, shillings and pence.  It is imperative, therefore, that we try to maintain the budget for the CAP.<\/p> <p>  I have a few particular questions about the CAP and what our policy will be in the negotiations.  One is about the reference years - 2000 to 2002.  Are we going to stand over them?  Will future payments be based on them?  I would like to know what our policy is on the price support mechanisms in place.  In 2018 the price support mechanism for skimmed milk powder has been changed significantly.  What will be our stance on it post-2020?  Will the aid to private storage, APS, and intervention schemes be part of the next CAP?  Will they be accommodated in the budget?  In February when supply was very slack, we saw the price of milk drop by 3 cent per litre and there are indications that the price will drop further in March.  Because of the huge costs involved, it will put the sector under immense pressure.  Unfortunately, skimmed milk powder is trading at well below intervention levels.  There is a significant overhang in intervention stores and it looks like it is extremely hard to move the product.  What will our policy position be in the CAP negotiations on these essential market tools, especially when it comes to the seasonality of our production?<\/p> <p>  The way young farmers are treated will be a critical issue.  Many farmers lost money in the last round of CAP negotiations, with a linear cut for young farmers.  We will talk about special schemes for young farmers once we make it crystal clear from where the funding will be sourced.  The same amount of money is coming through.  Do not take my comments as being against having a reserve for young farmers, but it has to be made very clear from where the money will be sourced.  It will be a very difficult hill to climb to have a separate fund in the conditions in which we are operating.  We have to be clear with farmers how such a reserve will be funded.  I would like to know what the Government's policy position is in that regard.<\/p> <p>  At this stage we have talked at length about Brexit and Mercosur.  We have a beef industry that is under extreme pressure.  I am a man who fattens a few cattle for his sins.  We are heading into April and cattle prices are lower now than they were in November.  The markets we have established around the world are dependent on a constant supply of beef on a 12 month basis.  How can we operate without the traditional lift in spring prices?  This is the second or third spring in a row in which there has been absolutely no lift in prices from Christmas onwards.  In fact, prices moved downwards after Christmas and have stagnated since.  The markets have been hard going.  We had a Private Members' Bill about suckler cows and the figure of &euro;200 per suckler cow.  It will be imperative to maintain the suckler cow herd.  Unless there are winter finishers to buy the young stock, no matter what direct aid is given, we will not be able to maintain the herd.  I do not know how farmers will be able to keep coming back to the ringside to buy young stock, given the huge cost involved and the price being paid by processors to compensate them.  As the Minister said in his statement, we are 102% self-sufficient in the market and the consumption of beef is declining.  We now have these two major torpedoes coming at us, with our access to the British market under threat and more beef being brought in from South American countries.<\/p> <p>  It is time we took a realistic look at Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025 in which targets were included to increase production.  However, there is no point in increasing our beef production if we are to receive the price being received.  As has been said, we need to look at these issues honestly and tell farmers exactly the situation in which they will find themselves.  The threatened lack of access to the British market and the increased tonnage given away, with the promise of more to secure the deal, will make participation in what is an already unprofitable sector completely untenabe.  There has to be a realistic look at that issue as we do not know what the final outcome of Brexit will be.  We know what has been conceded in Mercosur.  It is very frustrating for farmers here who are operating to extremely high standards in terms of cost compliance, Bord Bia audits and quality assurance which put an extra cost on food production.  Our already fragile industry will be undermined by the importation of products from South America that will not be produced to anything like the standards imposed on farmers in Europe.  The European consumer is right to demand such standards which we have achieved at a high cost.  However, the European Commission is allowing our markets to be undermined by the importation of products of lower quality.  This is not acceptable.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister has three very hard issues coming down the tracks and absolutely no good news for the sectors involved.  It is absolutely essential to maintain the budget for the CAP.  The Minister is fighting for the survival of the agrifood industry and a positive outcome is essential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018032900002#G00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1522328400,"counter":819,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  As Deputy Jackie Cahill said, there are three major issues which, from where we are sitting, are all negative and very much interlinked.  One will have a knock-on effect on the other.  Brexit will have an effect on the budget for the CAP.  It would affect the beef industry, even if there was no Mercosur.  It looks like the beef industry will be hit from two angles.  While there is work in progress and, to an extent, there are moving targets, things can change overnight.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of brief questions about the Minister's report.

The three topics on which he spoke are probably the three key issues for the farming sector currently.  I will focus on the Mercosur deal and the current situation in that regard.  We are in a troubling scenario in regard to this trade negotiation and there are many questions about it.  There are several points on which I will ask the Minister for clarification.  The trade negotiations began more than a decade ago, possibly as far back as 1999.  When is the next proposed date for the meeting?  The Minister in his report stated the last meeting was in early March.  Are we proposing that there will soon be another meeting and, if so, although it is not technically the responsibility of the Minister's Department, what are we expecting from that deal and when will we be playing it out?<\/p> <p>  The possibility of high-quality cuts and fresh meat coming to the market is a genuine concern for farmers.  If that were to be the case, would it be part of the deal?  Will there be a quota or a tonnage limit in that regard?  How is it proposed to deal with frozen and fresh produce?  I ask the Minister to comment on the dairy offer, which is in his report.  There has been much discussion of the beef offer possibly going from 70,000 tonnes to 90,000 tonnes.  I seek clarity on the dairy offer.  What is the proposal in that regard?  I ask the Minister to elaborate on the possible effect on the industry.<\/p> <p>  The Minister's negotiation skills will be tested on all three items dealt with in his report, namely, CAP, Brexit and the Mercosur trade deal.  These are very troubled times and those three issues will have a knock-on effect on farm income, which has already been affected by an exceptionally long winter, possible fodder issues and a fall in the prices received for produce.  We must seek clarity on this issue.<\/p> <p>  As regards Brexit and the CAP, the Minister has very much been on top of his brief in that regard.  Those two issues have been very well handled and farmers have been very well informed of the current situation.  The six meetings with farmers around the country went down particularly well with the farming community.  That level of interaction and having a Minister and a Minister of State attending three meetings each must be acknowledged and there is general acceptance in the farming community that that has been very positive.  However, clarity is required on the Mercosur deal because there is a fear that if the beef tonnage is too high it could have an awful knock-on effect.  The dairy issue must be clarified.  However, of more importance is that as these negotiations started in 1999, realistically, how long will it take for them to be concluded?  I take into consideration that we closed a deal with Canada last year.  Perhaps this is part of the European Union closing out such deals but I seek clarity and further information in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018032900002#H00200","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1522328400,"counter":822,"content":"<p>I have some brief questions before the Minister responds, although most issues have been very well highlighted and articulated.

They have not been concluded but individually and collectively have considerable potential to have an impact, adversely or otherwise, on the future of the agrifood sector, the rural economy and the economy generally, given that the agrifood sector is the biggest indigenous industry, employing nearly 180,000 people around the country.  All three issues are hugely important and dynamic - what may be the situation today could very much change by tomorrow and so on.  The issues are taking up a huge amount of time and we could spend a considerable period discussing any one of them.  In that context, I do not agree with the point made by Deputy Cahill because I am not that fatalistic, although there is no doubt that they are challenging issues.  I will try to deal with them as comprehensively as possible without attributing the response to any particular question.  If I leave something out, I ask members to come back to me.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to reference years in the context of CAP.  This point came up on several occasions during the debates around the country in the context of it now almost being 2020, the reference years being nearly 20 years old and that it is time to start afresh.  As a result of the redistribution efforts that have been under way since the reference years were established, we have in a way been moving further from them.  The reference years were finite and determined one's absolute entitlements at that point in time but the redistribution efforts have moved matters some distance from them and it is my intention that we would continue and accelerate that redistribution process.  That is a clear obligation and was the message we received from the majority of those who contributed at our public consultation and it is a matter on which the Commission is also clearly indicating a direction of travel.<\/p> <p>  It is untrue that 80% of the money goes to 20% of the farmers under CAP, as stated by Deputy Martin Kenny.  Under Pillar 1, 95% of Irish farmers get 77% of the funds, so 80% of the money does not go to 20% of farmers, although I often hear that figure trotted out.  Nevertheless, we must do more in terms of redistribution, whether that be tearing up the reference years or just continuing the redistribution.  In the lifetime of the current CAP, we will have distributed &euro;100 million from those with higher payments to those with lower payments and brought lower-paid farmers up to 60% of the average payment.  There has been significant progress and the question is as to whether to continue that and, if so, at what pace but that direction of travel is inevitable, as it is clear that more must be done in that regard.<\/p> <p>  As regards the Chair's question as to whether a CAP deal will be concluded in time and the timescale in that regard, that is very challenging for many reasons to do with electoral cycles in the European Parliament, for example, and a new Commission.  To put it in context, the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, which will deal with the budget side of it, will publish proposals in May, which will be for negotiation.<\/p><p>Then in June, the Commission will respond with its proposals.  Positions will be taken by the Agriculture and Fisheries Council by the end of the year and by Parliament.  If Parliament does not conclude its positions in time, it could well be for a new Parliament for to do that.  There are many moving parts.  Thrown into the mix is the fact that the budget is unclear with the British withdrawal, given that the UK is the largest net contributor.  There is uncertainty on whether this can be concluded but we need to continue to progress and engage on the issues.  The Council hopes to have its conclusions by the end of the year and we will feed into that.<\/p><p> I will deal with some of the specific issues therein.  It is imperative that we continue to encourage new people into farming.  I note the point Deputy Cahill made about entitlements, linear cuts and all that.  Nonetheless the only other way we can give entitlements to young farmers is through unused entitlements or the clawback provision.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018032900002#H00400","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522328400,"counter":825,"content":"<p>That would not be sufficient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018032900002#J00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1522328400,"counter":826,"content":"<p>In most cases it is not.  Through consultation and agreement with farm organisations we have had linear cuts.  I acknowledge the challenge to deliver more supports and redistribution as part of that.  If we were to provide a &euro;200 suckler cow payment out of Pillar 1, it would be a very substantial cut across the board and in the context of Mercosur would risk driving numbers through a coupled payment.  I am not knocking the principle that we need to look at how we support the beef sector and how we support the suckler cow sector but we need to ensure there is joined-up thinking.  This has been the position of previous incumbents in my office of all political persuasions who maintained that coupled payments were not appropriate, and that we should decouple and allow farmers to play the marketplace as effectively as possible in an attempt to guarantee incomes and allow them the freedom within certain parameters of minimum stocking densities etc. to respond to what the market is telling them.  Certainly at a time when one of the biggest challenges we have in terms of climate change is numbers, we need to be careful we have a joined-up approach.  At the moment we are putting considerable funds into beef in terms of the beef data and genomics programme.  We need to look at how we can do more in a way that is compatible with other policies we have been pursuing.<\/p> <p>  On Brexit, there will be no resiling from the position that was negotiated in December.  That is the clearly stated position of the Government.  The letter the British Prime Minister sent to President Juncker clearly commits her to the legal text reflecting that position.  I appreciate that everybody is looking for an angle but that is a position from which there is no resiling.  It is recognised in the UK that that is the backstop or else they come up with a better response to it.  Of course, a more comprehensive approach that fits the EU and UK as a whole would be fine by us but we will not resile from the commitment on the all-island approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018032900002#J00300","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1522328400,"counter":827,"content":"<p>I seek clarification on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018032900002#J00400","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1522328400,"counter":828,"content":"<p>I will let the Deputy come back in because I want to deal as best I can with all the other issues that have been raised.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Penrose made this point in the context of the CAP but there are competing and conflicting interests around the table in Europe on all these issues and certainly on Mercosur.  There are forces in Europe that are gung-ho for a deal in circumstances that would not suit us.  We are busy forging alliances with people who share our concerns.  There are other forces at play that do not share our analysis of this.  Whereas offers have been made, nothing is agreed yet.  I am aware of the point made on the 70,000 tonnes as being the public position.  Reference has been made to 99,000 tonnes etc.  However, there has been no formal offer in that context.

We are looking for greater liberalisation and access on the dairy side.  However, there is a lot of official interaction at the moment on both sides.

Mercosur countries currently have access to the EU market.  They are exporting substantial volumes of beef in here from approved plants.

I refer to when the European Union published its draft legal text which clarified its interpretation of the December agreement.

Now, which part of that, in the context of Prime Minister May's commitment in the letter, does the Deputy not agree with?

That is a market prioritisation exercise to identify where those market opportunities would be with which Bord Bia has been charged on behalf of the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018032900002#L02400","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1522328400,"counter":892,"content":"<p>Do members wish to raise any other issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018032900002#L02500","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1522328400,"counter":893,"content":"<p>The Minister is saying that if a Mercosur deal were concluded, it would be six to seven years before we would see products being imported-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018032900002#L02600","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1522328400,"counter":894,"content":"<p>What would happen is that it would be phased in over that period so I understand that it would be introduced incrementally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018032900002#L02700","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1522328400,"counter":895,"content":"<p>This is due to the fact that we already have an element of EU regulation in those countries for the products coming in at present.

We will be considering all of those in the context.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Brexit, we have been active in that space in terms of stakeholder engagement even before 23 June 2016.  Obviously, that level of engagement has accelerated and there have been a number of policy responses in terms of Brexit loans, tax changes for the food industry and the new Teagasc facility in Moorepark in respect of offering companies assistance in moving from certain products that might be more exposed to the UK market.  We have invested in the preferred consumer food sector to assist it in that space.  A series of initiatives across the Brexit issue have delivered assistance.  Yesterday, we launched the &euro;300 million loan fund to the SME sector with a minimum 40% being ring-fenced for the food industry.  There have been a lot of initiatives, engagement with stakeholders and consideration of the policy implications on CAP.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Mercosur, we have regular engagement at Agriculture and Fisheries Council meetings.

We fully support Food Wise 2025 and when we were in government, we wrote Food Harvest 2020.  That was done not only as a blueprint for the development of agriculture, but it was done in a pre-Brexit environment.  It set targets and set out the actions required to achieve those targets in the context of a pre-Brexit environment.  If those targets are still the objective, and I think they should be, that is all the more reason that it should be revised in order to decide how those targets can be achieved in an environment and in a scenario where we are actually facing Brexit.  There is no doubt but that it impacts on the agricultural sector in almost every way, so the idea that we would continue with a plan which does not take into account the impact of Brexit does not make sense.  Certainly it should be revised with a view to how it should accommodate and deal with that challenge.

It is the industry's own stated ambition.  It talks about growing the exports to nearly &euro;19 billion and in that period achieving additional employment of 23,000 jobs.  It is important to also acknowledge that we have been on a remarkable trajectory of growth in the industry, even through very challenging periods.  Brexit is the challenge we face now.  Previously, we faced the challenge of a banking collapse and a virtual economic collapse.  Through all those years, this was the engine that continued to perform in sterling fashion.  This is a significant challenge for us, but the view of all the industry stakeholders with whom I engage, and I chair the implementation committee on Brexit on a bi-monthly basis, is that never was it more important to have these identified actions that are necessary and to have a clear focus on the implementation of those actions.  I share that analysis.  It is not a time to fly the white flag and to diminish our ambition for the industry.  On the contrary, while Brexit is a challenge, there are other opportunities.  There is a growing global population.  There is a demand for the kind of product that we are internationally renowned for and if we were to rescind from the opportunities that are there, even though we have a challenge in Brexit, it is undoubtedly the case that others would avail of the opportunity and put their products on supermarket shelves where ours currently are.  We need to remain focused on the ambition and what is achievable.  The roadblocks that are there have been created by Brexit, perhaps, and they may have been created by a whole host of other issues.  It is important that we analyse how we can remove or circumnavigate any individual roadblock that is there rather than say we cannot do that so we will fold our tent and reduce our targets.  It is an incredibly dynamic industry, populated by people who are driven by innovation, technology and energy.  Everyday, whether the big or small players in the food industry, they are achieving amazing things.  It would be a shame to say that we would walk away from the ambition in that document.  On the contrary, it is time to double down on the ambition that is in it and drive on the implementation.  That is why, within the Department, we have a much more intensive focus on the issues that are there.  Brexit is but one of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018032900002#M00700","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1522328400,"counter":912,"content":"<p>There are no further questions so that concludes our business.

I extend my most sincere personal gratitude to the Chairman of the committee, Mr. Brendan Smith, for giving me this unique opportunity to address this distinguished audience.<\/p> <p>  Today I want to talk to the committee about Georgia's aspirations for membership of the EU and NATO.  I would also like to reflect on ways to respond to existing security challenges in Georgia and the wider European region.  Lastly, but most important, I would like to suggest ways to deepen bilateral relations further between Ireland and Georgia in the future.<\/p> <p>  The opportunity the committee has afforded me to speak to the committee is a sign of the positive current dynamic in parliamentary ties between our countries.  These ties have intensified since the visit of Chairman of the committee to Tbilisi last year.  The exchange of high-level parliamentary delegations is vital to achieve tangible results in different areas of co-operation between our countries.<\/p> <p>  Georgia's aspiration for full membership of the EU is a key foreign policy goal that will inevitably bring Ireland and Georgia closer in the future.  It is a declared choice of our citizens to see Georgia become a full member of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  This decision is reaffirmed by the Constitution of Georgia.  In the past decade Georgia has made great strides to bring itself closer to the European and euro-Atlantic family.  We have implemented a series of comprehensive reforms that have transformed Georgia into a modern European country with vibrant political life, rule of law, open governance, media pluralism, a growing economy and favourable investment environment.  Georgia has improved its rankings in virtually all aspects, including the democracy index and economic liberalisation.<\/p> <p>  All this was made possible by consistent and effective reforms developed and implemented in close co-operation with our partner countries and international organisations.  Support received in this process from our friends and partners is invaluable.  In that context I express my deepest gratitude once again for the unwavering support of Ireland on our way towards EU integration.<\/p> <p>  The Association Agreement for the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area with the EU is fully operational and applied.  It provides a concrete roadmap for modernisation across political, economic and social fields by introducing and applying the European standards.  We believe that the revised association agenda for 2020, which defines a set of ambitious priorities and reform objectives, will bring Georgia closer to the EU.  Georgian citizens continue to benefit from the visa-free travel regime.  This is the most visible and tangible benefit for the entire population of Georgia and an additional incentive for the Government of Georgia to continue the pace of reforms.<\/p><p> The Georgian Government is fully committed to sustained reforms in all these visa liberalisation action plan-related areas, with particular attention given to the prevention of possible abuse of the asylum system in the Schengen countries.  We continue effective co-operation with EU member states in the fight against the organised crime.  Introduction of EU norms and standards has significantly stimulated the economy in Georgia and boosted trade relations with the EU.  As a single market, the European Union has become the largest trade partner for Georgia.  Trade increased by 2% in 2017, while exports increased by 13%.  Approximation with EU policies has significantly upgraded our sectoral co-operation, while we continue extensive reforms in energy, transport, health care, agriculture, environment, research and innovations, education and other related fields.<\/p><p> The upcoming NATO summit in Brussels in July this year presents an excellent opportunity for NATO to reaffirm its commitment to Georgia&rsquo;s eventual membership, which was promised ten years ago at the Bucharest summit.  Since then, Georgia has achieved significant progress on its way to NATO membership, especially when it comes to the practical aspects of the process, using the NATO-Georgia Commission, NGC, the annual national programme, ANP, and the NATO-Georgia substantial package.  We believe strongly that Georgia&rsquo;s accomplishments in democratic transformation, its commitments to NATO integration and shared Euro-Atlantic security and its unprecedented practical co-operation with NATO should be adequately reflected in the upcoming discussions and decisions on the open door policy.  Georgia also welcomes NATO&rsquo;s increased presence in the Black Sea region and stands ready to co-operate actively with NATO on Black Sea security.<\/p><p> Georgia&rsquo;s co-operation and integration with organisations like the EU and NATO are directly linked with our efforts to meet common security challenges on the regional and national level.  Conflicts in Europe share similarities and common patterns, particularly in terms of the infringement of sovereignty and territorial integrity of neighbouring states.  European security is being significantly challenged by Russia&rsquo;s continuous aggressive actions against Georgia, namely, by the ongoing illegal military occupation of up to 20% of integral parts of Georgia&rsquo;s sovereign territories.  This dangerous pattern of arbitrarily altering international borders by force poses a significant threat not only to Georgia and Russia&rsquo;s other neighbours under illegal occupation but also to the strategic vision of Europe as a whole.<\/p><p> The security and human rights situation in Georgia&rsquo;s occupied regions is being further aggravated by the continued installation of barbed wire and razor wire fences and so called &ldquo;border&rdquo; signs along the occupation line.  Killings, abductions, arbitrary detentions, seizure of property and restrictions on free movement, as well as restrictions on education in the native Georgian language - all based on ethnic grounds &ndash; are common phenomena.  These illegal actions are an illustration of Russia&rsquo;s deliberate policy towards the factual annexation of Georgia&rsquo;s regions.  On 23 February, the life of a Georgian citizen, Mr. Archil Tatunashvili, was taken in the occupied Tskhinvali region after he was illegally detained by the Russian occupation forces.  His body was returned home after a month of delay with multiple signs of torture.  This recent appalling and tragic loss of life is another reminder of the gravity of the situation on the ground.  It calls for a joint, immediate and consolidated international reaction.<\/p><p> There has not been any progress on either the establishment of international security arrangements, ISAs, on the occupied territories, return of internally displaced persons, IDPs, and refugees to their places of origin or allowing UN human rights mechanisms into the occupied regions.  It is essential that the EU monitoring mission is given unimpeded access to the occupied territories of Georgia.  In that context, I take this opportunity to again express my gratitude to the Government of Ireland for deploying three Irish observers to serve with the EU monitoring mission in Georgia.  We believe more needs to be done to deliver on tangible results.  First and foremost, what is required is political will and commitment on the part of all stakeholders in the process.<\/p><p> I wish to extend sincere thanks for the first ever resolution, the motion on support for the territorial integrity of Georgia and its integration in to the European Union, which was adopted last year by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence in support of Georgia&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally-recognised borders, as well as Georgia&rsquo;s integration in the European Union.  This resolution is a clear demonstration of genuine friendship between our nations and we highly value Ireland's steadfast support for Georgia&rsquo;s key national priorities.<\/p><p> I am particularly delighted by the establishment of the Ireland-Georgia Friendship Group in the Oireachtas, as a result of our meeting in Tbilisi in July 2017.   It was formally launched here yesterday.  I am confident the effective work of the group will give additional impetus to further deepening bilateral co-operation between the legislative branches of our countries.  My special thanks go to the Irish Government for its continued support for Georgia&rsquo;s annual General Assembly resolution on securing the right of safe, dignified and voluntary return of internally displaced persons and refugees from Georgia&rsquo;s Russian-occupied regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali, as well as for Ireland's overall support for Georgia&rsquo;s positions and initiatives within international organisations.<\/p><p> Against the backdrop of this growing successful bilateral political dynamic, what we are missing are comprehensive trade and economic relations.  A strategic location connecting Europe and Asia, robust economic reforms, a politically stable and corruption-free environment, a free business environment and low taxes are among the key variables that contribute to making Georgia an attractive investment destination.  A solid track record of successful reforms bolstering the rule of law, reducing corruption and building effective, transparent and accountable institutions that focus on improving citizen&rsquo;s lives through excellent public service delivery has earned Georgia a reputation as a state with modern, innovative approaches to good governance, anti-corruption strategies and participatory democracy.  As chair of the Open Government Partnership, OGP, the global initiative, since September 2017, Georgia intends to share its experience and best practices in combatting corruption and creating institutionalised mechanisms for anti-corruption policy coordination and monitoring.  These actions aim to ensure an opportunity for people to influence government decisions that affect their daily lives.<\/p><p> The advantage of being a transit country is increasing more and more in light of intensified infrastructure development in the country.  This serves the purpose of raising awareness about the role of Georgia as a key link in the east-west corridor and a logistics hub.  The development of the only deep sea port on the east coast of the Black Sea, Anaklia, and the Anaklia free industrial zone,  as well as the building of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars international railway line and a new \"Lapis Lazuli\" transport corridor, to be developed between Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, will breathe new life into the East-West trade route.  In this context, Georgia is very much interested in the \"One Belt - One Road\" global economic project initiated by the President of China.  All of these achievements in and advantages of Georgia&rsquo;s investment environment are clearly reflected in almost all international economic rankings, which improve every year.  With that, I wish to call for deeper bilateral trade and economic co-operation between Georgia and Ireland and kindly request the committee to mediate with the Government to initiate and facilitate Irish business delegation visits to Georgia in order to get first-hand information about investment opportunities.<\/p><p> Ireland's Global Footprint 2025 programme could serve as another effective mechanism for enhancing bilateral co-operation between our countries.  More specifically, as Ireland plans to increase the number of its embassies worldwide, we hope that Tbilisi will be considered as one of the priority destinations for opening an Irish Embassy in the foreseeable future.  There is another area where we have considerable space to improve people-to-people relations between Ireland and Georgia.  As I mentioned above, since March 2017 Georgian citizens travel visa-free to the Schengen zone.  Easing the visa regime for Georgian citizens travelling to Ireland will considerably facilitate people-to-people contacts and enhance business, tourism and cultural ties for the mutual benefit of our countries.  As a starting point, we would welcome Ireland&rsquo;s decision to waive the visa requirement for holders of Georgian diplomatic and service passports, considering that the holders of these passports are government officials travelling to Ireland for official meetings.<\/p><p> We are convinced that a diplomatic and service visa waiver will facilitate visits and intensified co-operation on both sides.  Talking about diplomatic missions and embassies, I thank our ambassador to Ireland and his team here for the excellent job being delivered on the ground.  In conclusion, let me underline one more time the vital importance of strong ties between Ireland and Georgia.  Our countries our not only alike in terms of geographic size or our historical struggles for independence.  We share a similar experience of acting as bridges between different continents.  Ireland has long functioned as a bridge between Europe and the Americas, while Georgia, throughout its history, has acted as a bridge connecting Europe and Asia.<\/p><p> Two years ago Ireland celebrated 100 years since the 1916 Easter Rising.  This year Georgia is marking 100 years since the founding of the Georgian Democratic Republic.  I realise how much more there is to be shared between a mature European democracy like Ireland and a younger but rapidly progressing European democracy like Georgia.  <\/p><p> I thank members for their kind attention and look forward to their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018032900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sofia Katsarava","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522312800,"counter":921,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Katsarava for her comprehensive and clear outline of the relationship between our two countries and the potential for further development of trade and other links.

Ms Katsarava made two very strong requests, to which we hope the Government will give urgent consideration.<\/p> <p>  In the meetings Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan and Noel Grealish and I had in Ms Katsarava's country with the Prime Minister, the Foreign Affairs Minister, the European Integration Minister, the foreign affairs European integration committee, the Speaker and other Members of Parliament the clear and strong message at all times was that they were concerned, as public representatives and parliamentarians, about the violation of the territorial integrity of their country.  Ms Katsarava rightly laid very strong emphasis on that issue.  It is one that has been discussed at the committee.  I am very glad that Ms Katsarava referred to the motion of support adopted unanimously on the territorial integrity of Georgia and its integration into the European Union.  It was a very strong message from this Parliament, one that all of us support.<\/p> <p>  I will call two colleagues at a time.  I call, first, the Vice Chairman of the committee, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, who will be followed by Deputy Darragh O'Brien.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018032900002#D00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1522312800,"counter":922,"content":"<p>The delegates are extremely welcome to this parliament.  It is good to see them in Ireland.  We acknowledge the reception and hospitality we received in Georgia.

I know that it is difficult to travel and that it would make much more sense to have an embassy in Tbilisi, but I do not believe it will happen in the near future.  Therefore, it would be good if it was possible for our ambassador to Bulgaria to visit Georgia more often.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of security, we saw for ourselves the difficulties and challenges posed, but as somebody who is committed to Ireland's neutrality and concerned about what we see as its encroachment, I ask about Georgia's anxiety to join NATO.  I would prefer if we were all moving away from the militarisation of Europe and the increasing fears about security, even though I understand Georgia's position because we saw for ourselves the importance of the European Union's presence in the country.<\/p> <p>  The other question I wish to ask is about the international discussions in Geneva.

I had the honour to meet her last night, with colleagues.

They do a fantastic job on her behalf and that of the people of Georgia and its Government.<\/p> <p>  We had a chance to have a detailed discussion last night.  As the Chairman rightly mentioned, the committee passed a strong motion on the territorial integrity of Georgia and in support of its accession to the European Union.  To follow on from the point made by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, I would like Ms Katsarava to update us on where she sees the process leading to Georgia's accession to the European Union.  Are there moves afoot, even in the background by way of discusssions, to try to resolve issues with Georgia's nearest neighbour, Russia, with reference to Abkhazia and South Ossetia?  I am aware that trade between Russia and Georgia has increased in recent years.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a particular point which is more for the committee.  The Government has announced the establishment of six new missions as part of Ireland 2025 and the doubling of Ireland's diplomatic footprint.  I would be fully supportive of the opening of an embassy in Tblisi.  Given the strategic importance of the location of Georgia in the region of the Black Sea, as a fully fledged, mature democracy, we should make the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade aware that the committee would support the opening of an embassy in Georgia.  There is a lot of work to be done.  Ms Katsarava rightly mentioned the great potential to increase trade between our two countries.  The level of trade is tiny.  That is the reason a visit by a trade delegation from Ireland to Georgia and a reciprocal visit by a trade delegation from Georgia to Ireland would make a good deal of sense.<\/p> <p>  I fully support the Chairman on one final item.  Citizens of Georgia can avail of a visa free regime between Georgia and EU Schengen countries.  Given that Britain is to leave the European Union shortly, this will be the only EU country that will not allow Georgian citizens visa free access.  We should start by considering the introduction of diplomatic visas, which would be the bear minimum, and then move to examine how we could improve access between our two countries.  That could lead to initiatives such as having direct flights that would increase trade between our two countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018032900002#D00400","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1522312800,"counter":924,"content":"<p>Ms Katsarava and her colleagues can answers those questions.

We really appreciate them and feel the support offered.  I thank members for their interventions and welcoming words.<\/p> <p>  On the process involved and timeframe for EU integration, I do not believe we can talk necessarily about the timeframe, but what really matters for Georgia are all of the tools, instruments and formats we have with the European Union and the different institutions to deepen our ties and get closer to the them through sectoral development balanced with sectoral co-operation.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has rightly pointed out that when she visits Georgia, she gets the feeling that there is a full commitment, not just among the authorities but also among the public, to integration into the European family and the European space.  That is why we keep reiterating the importance of visa free travel and the reason we are appealing to members to be aware that this is something people felt was a tangible and practical result that we achieved last year.  What we are doing is avoiding timeframes because it is very hard to say specifically when it will happen.  However, my colleagues and I believe - this is the consensus in the country - that we are very much focused on the process leading to EU integration.  We are waiting for the moment when Georgia will become a full member of the European family.<\/p><p>As I said, there is co-operation in a wide range of areas.  I mentioned the association agreement and the new action plan for 2020 as well as the DCFTA, the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas, agreement.  Those are the main instruments and the main formats through which we co-operate with the EU institutions.  A lot is happening from the executive side, including continuing the reforms on the parliamentary and legislative side.  We are very close at the moment but those reforms will finally bring us into the European space and the European family.  This is how we envisage the process.  Again, we appreciate Ireland's support for Georgia's integration into the European Union.<\/p><p> A question was asked about Russia.  In my speech I tried to give members a picture, especially for those who have not been to Georgia.  Those who have been to Georgia have experienced quite acutely how it feels to have the occupation lines so close to the capital.  We spoke a lot yesterday about this concern and I mentioned it in my speech.  We have trade relations with Russia and we have a policy towards Russia which is pragmatic, but at the same time we have a very principled proposition when it comes to Georgia's occupied territories.  In particular, because this is so fresh we want to stop it and we are doing everything we can in all international fora.  This forum is extremely useful too in making our voice heard in this country and elsewhere to ensure that the international community understands the gravity of the situation in the occupied territories.  When we say that we have a pragmatic policy, that means we want to ensure that Georgia is a stable and secure country.  Georgia has gained the reputation of being a stable country over the years, but again, not at the expense of the occupied territories, which is an extremely painful and challenging issue for all of us.<\/p><p> In a way that chimes with the Geneva international discussions because that was also the focus of one of the questions.  The 43rd round of the Geneva international forum and discussions literally finished yesterday.  As has rightly been pointed out, the question is what needs to be done to make it more effective.  We took all the steps to make the forums more effective so that decisions are taken.  What is needed here is the political will to take the decisions and that is why I mentioned that for years we had not seen any step from the other side, namely, the Russian Federation, in fulfilling its obligations on the ceasefire.  That is why I mentioned in the speech about the presence of the international security mechanism in the occupied territory as well as the issue which has been consistently and continuously raised by our side, which is the dignified return of internally displaced people, IDPs.  We have not seen any progress on that.  What needs to be done is for there to be the political will from all sides in the forum on a decision and for the Russian Federation to fulfil the obligations it has to fulfil.  My colleague, Mr. Kapanadze, would like to add more about the discussions in Geneva and other issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018032900002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Sofia Katsarava","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1522312800,"counter":927,"content":"<p>I will be very brief.  Of the three things that were mentioned, the first was the timetable of the EU.  In addition to what Ms Katsarava said, Georgia right now is in the group of the so-called eastern partners together with Ukraine and Moldova.  The programme of eastern partnership only provides for the association agreements, deep and comprehensive free trade agreements and visa liberalisation, but not necessarily for membership.  If one asks the question of what comes next, what should come next is for these countries to get a clear membership perspective and then a clear instrument which helps them to integrate into the EU.  It is true that the association agreements and the association agenda which we heard about today and the visa liberalisation and the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas, DCFTA, provide for certain reforms but beyond those reforms we need a certain programme that would be aimed at integration.<\/p> <p>  There could be different models for that.  One of them could be similar to what was the case with regard to the eastern European countries such as the accession partnership type of model or all the others.  There are different models for how that could be done.  In terms of a timeframe, that is what should be next on the agenda with the European Union.  There is obviously the question of whether there should be a regional approach towards the three countries or an individual approach.  That remains to be seen.  There are different opinions on that but we need to go to the next stage, which together with the reforms also envisages more conditionality and more assistance with regard to the reforms in the agriculture and other spheres.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to NATO.  That is a very important point.  Unlike many countries, including Ireland, we are in a very precarious regional situation where we cannot really afford to be neutral, even if we very much wanted to be.  One cannot really be neutral unless everybody around agrees that one can be neutral.  That is also a major difference that we have with Switzerland, which is often given as an example of neutrality, but unfortunately that is not possible in our region.  To ensure security, we need to be a member of a bigger security alliance or have some kind of bilateral security guarantees, which we do not have.  That is why, out of those two options the best option is to seek the integration into NATO, once again, to ensure that Georgia is secure.  There is often a misconception that Georgia wants to integrate into NATO to restore its territorial integrity but that is not the case.  For us integration into NATO is not about the occupation and the conflict with Russia, rather it is about securing the unoccupied part of Georgia.  That is why it is an important goal for us.<\/p> <p>  Ms Katsarava mentioned in her speech the upcoming NATO summit.  Usually when those kind of high level meetings take place, there is always an issue.  We have been in the NATO process for the past ten years.  We were told that we would become a member of NATO but without a clear timeline.  Anytime there is a NATO summit coming up, there is a question of what should be the actual deliverable for Georgia.  Those are always the big questions that we have.  Whether it is a concrete membership action plan or a concrete statement that Georgia can become a member without the membership action plan, we are seeking the concrete instruments by which we can become a member.  That is probably our main issue with NATO.<\/p> <p>  I do not have much to add to what was said on the Geneva talks but the political will in Moscow, in particular, is an important key to making progress in the Geneva talks.  The things that are being discussed are linked to the divergent political positions on the occupation.  Moscow considers these regions to be independent states but we consider them to be occupied.  Moscow considers that the displaced persons should not return and we consider that they have the absolute right to return under international law.  We want and we believe it is the right way to have an international security presence in these regions and Russia is against that.  That is why there is no progress because there is such a big difference in the positions on those issues.  One way to generate progress there is to generate the political will in Moscow.  The best way to generate political will is through first of all assessing the situation as it is and also through the political pressure on Moscow.  If one asks us what are the few things we would like to ask of our Irish friends, one of them would be when it comes to assessing the situation in Georgia to assess it as an occupation.  That is a word with concrete international legal repercussions and that is very important.  As soon as the issue of Georgia is raised at a high level, similar to the situation in Ukraine where there is international involvement at a high level there will be a possibility of more compromise from Moscow.  Otherwise, it will be very easy for them to keep the Geneva discussions going for another 50 rounds.  I have been the head of the delegation and I have taken part in 21 rounds of talks.<\/p><p>It is a very futile exercise, not because of the round of talks, the structure of the talks or the Georgian side but because of the lack of political will in Moscow.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018032900002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sergi Kapanadze","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522312800,"counter":929,"content":"<p>I am delighted that the witnesses have had the opportunity to visit Ireland and to build on relations between our countries.  We had the opportunity to visit Georgia last year, and I would like to put on the record of the House the tremendous work Mr. Zurabashvilli and his colleagues are doing in the embassy in Dublin on behalf of his country.  He is one of the hardest working ambassadors I have encountered.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, on our trip to Georgia, nominated me as chairperson-convenor of the Georgia-Ireland parliamentary friendship group, which was launched yesterday, in conjunction with the Chairman and the Ceann Comhairle, who is meeting the delegation shortly.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said that the opening of the embassy in Tbilisi is probably down the list of priorities, based on our recent questioning of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, but we will continue to push that issue, and I am sure our colleagues will keep raising it in parliamentary questions to the Minister.  I certainly will continue to raise the issue.  One of the top priorities for Georgia is full membership of the EU, and I was delighted to be able to arrange a meeting recently with the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Phil Hogan, and Mr. Zurabashvilli.  We hope that the Commissioner will make a trip to Georgia in the not-too-distant future to see for himself the reform of the agricultural sector that has taken place there and to discuss how the EU can further support that.<\/p> <p>  Our briefing note outlines that in 2014, &euro;410 million was made available by the EU to support reforms in key areas such as public administration, agriculture and rural development and justice.

Is it a matter of hoping that it will be invited to join or is there still work that it needs to do to meet the full entry criteria?  <\/p> <p>  On NATO, I note Vice President Pence was due to visit Tbilisi shortly after the Irish delegation visited.  How did the negotiations on Georgia's membership of NATO go?  The witness mentioned it, and seemed to have very strong views about joining NATO, as well as the EU.

I believe that the charg&eacute; d'affaires and the staff at the Georgian Embassy have a better attendance record at this committee than many of its members.  They are extremely active around the Oireachtas and are familiar faces to all of us.  Their work record on behalf of Georgia is excellent, and they are to be commended on it.<\/p> <p>  The similarity between Ireland and Georgia was mentioned.  We share a past in that both countries have had difficulties with our largest neighbour.  A witness mentioned Ireland's independence but our country is still partitioned and there are still difficulties arising from that.  The delegation is aware of Ireland's worries about Brexit.  At the moment we have an invisible border, but the worry on the island of Ireland is that we will revert to that militarised situation that we had in the past.   <\/p> <p>  Ms Katsarava spoke about the difficulties Georgia is facing because of what was described as the occupation.  The 43rd round of the Geneva international discussions is taking place at present and Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan mentioned that those discussions have been going on for the last ten years.  Do the witnesses feel that those discussions are just going through the motions?  Do they believe that progress is being made?  Russia is in the news at the moment and there have been debates in these Houses about the events in Salisbury.  Do those events discourage movement in terms of those discussions?<\/p> <p>  The importance of visa-free travel was discussed, as was the waiving of requirements for the holders of diplomatic passports.  Can the witnesses expand on that?  This committee might be able to offer practical help on that issue.  If there is anything that the witnesses would like this committee to do they should feel free to articulate it.  <\/p> <p>  The observers in the region - EU monitoring bodies - were mentioned.  Going back to the Irish context, in terms of Brexit, we would argue that it is extremely important for those officials in the EU to actually visit the Border region and to see at first hand the day-to-day realities of life there.  Do the witnesses believe it is important that international visitors to Georgia should go to see the barbed wire and so on at first hand?  Ms Katsarava discussed everyday life in that region and spoke about the death of one of Georgia's citizens there on 23 February.  It was mentioned that the killing and torturing of people there is a regular occurrence.  Can the witnesses expand on that and perhaps discuss the quality of life of Georgian citizens there?  I believe people are being kidnapped and are not able to travel back and forth.  What can Ireland, as a small country, do to help?  The issue of NATO was mentioned and the witnesses probably are aware that Ireland is a neutral country.  Moreover, any surveys that have been carried out suggest that a huge proportion of Irish people feel very strongly that we should remain separate from such alliances.  We are a part of the EU but many of us are critical about how the EU has developed.  I do not believe that any party in the Irish Parliament would have any objections to Georgia joining the EU but we do have some difficulties with the institution itself and believe that reform is needed.  We hope that reform will lead to a greater expansion of the EU.<\/p> <p>  The decision to join NATO is a matter for the Georgian people.  We believe it is a relic of the Cold War and that such relics need to be disbanded.  I accept what the witnesses say in terms of Georgia's security but other countries in the region have adopted a different route and have not lost sovereignty or territory.  <\/p> <p>  I wish the delegation well on its visit.  If there is anything this committee can do to help please let us know.  I wish them well, and I hope that the discussions that are ongoing in Geneva will be successful.

We are receiving a wide range of support from the European Union in terms of the democratisation agenda as we call it, that is, the consolidation of democracy, good governance and capacity building of the institutions etc.  I do not want to undermine any of the projects, which are all important in their own way, but agriculture was mentioned and one of the flagship projects the European Union has supported throughout the years and which it continues to support is the development of the agricultural sector and supporting local farmers in the regions.<\/p><p>I call it the flagship project because it reaches out to local people and those farmers in the regions who might get more from exporting produce to the European Union.  The European market is one of the biggest markets these days for Georgia.  With the support of the European Union we can bring these tangible and practical benefits to the locals in the regions, which is extremely important.  That is why we are encouraging the European Union and individual member states to continue this support.  Ultimately what matters is that all our citizens get the benefit of these supports and get closer to the European Union.  That is one of the agricultural flagship programmes, which is very important for the whole country.<\/p><p> As I said, there is a range of projects on which the European Union supports Georgia.  Equally important is the process of consolidating democracy.  That, of course, includes the Judiciary, the rule of law, good governance and the institutional building that we are now going through.<\/p><p> There was another question about progress on the Geneva discussions.  I have tried to explain how it works.  I echo what my colleague, Mr. Sergi Kapanadze said: there is no progress whatsoever.  It is not because of the format of the Geneva international discussions but because of the lack of political will from the Russian Federation.  We recently made it very clear that the Georgian side is ready to improve the effectiveness of the Geneva international discussions by possibly increasing, if needed, the political level in the forum because if there is no political will from the other side, it is very hard to achieve to reach any agreement.  The recent Geneva round was yet another demonstration of that.<\/p><p> Thus far, we have seen the destructive approach from the Russian Federation and the lack of will to make the Geneva forum effective and take decisions that would be in the interest of those involved.  At the moment we do not see any progress.  However, as this is the only international forum of this type, we have to continue to utilise it and ultimately reach some agreement for the benefit of those people who are suffering on the ground.  This is ultimately our concern.  Those people who live in the occupied territories face a very challenging environment.  They suffer from the intimidation and discrimination on ethnic grounds and that is why it is important for the international community to come over and see what is happening on the ground.  I reiterate how acute it is and only by seeing it on the ground can our partners understand the gravity of the situation.<\/p><p> For example, on the occupation line there were several checkpoints through which there was movement across the occupation line.  There were people who were receiving benefits from the territory controlled by the Georgian Government, because we were offering all the benefits such as education, health care and social benefits.  All those checkpoints were closed down.  We are talking about this kind of stuff.  People are deprived of all the social, health care and educational opportunities - when it comes to using them on the other side - that we obviously are ready and happy to offer.  As soon as the mobility increased to a certain extent, the checkpoints were closed down.  The gravest and most painful recent case that happened cannot be left without adequate reaction.  The international community reacted and provided support in the case of a Georgian citizen who died recently in the occupied region.  Some 20% of Georgia's territory is occupied and it is very important that our partners get first-hand information on that.<\/p><p> I was asked about NATO.  I again echo the words of Mr. Sergi Kapanadze: it is a matter of security for Georgia.  At present, we have unprecedented and intensive close co-operation with NATO in terms of practical co-operation and strengthening defence capacity and capability of Georgia.  This is extremely important for the security of our country.  We keep saying and we are demonstrating with our actions that we are not so-called recipients of the security but are contributing to the security in the region and beyond.  As Mr. Kapanadze mentioned, Georgia is in a different environment and we should actively pursue our membership of NATO precisely because it is a matter of security for the country.<\/p><p> I may have missed some of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018032900002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sofia Katsarava","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522312800,"counter":933,"content":"<p>What about the issue of visas and passports?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018032900002#G00200","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1522312800,"counter":934,"content":"<p>Georgian citizens nowadays travel visa-free to the Schengen zone.

I understand that there might be some challenges but it is extremely important for people-to-people contacts and deepening the ties.  We need to use areas of co-operation such as education.

I welcome the representatives to the committee.<\/p> <p>  I often consider Ireland's location on the far western side of Europe and the difficult days we had with our nearest neighbour, which still occupies part of the island of Ireland.  I believe that Ireland and Georgia have a lot in common.  The size of our population is about the same and Ireland is on the extreme west of Europe while Georgia is on the extreme east.  It shows the importance of having unification between like-minded people who believe in democracy and in a free and open society.  It is more important that this union is protected as distinct from being recognised as a member of this or that body.  All of us who are fortunate to live in civilised societies have an obligation to colleagues and friends in other countries that are not experiencing the same freedom as us, and that we do everything possible to support that obligation  We must ensure these friends and colleagues are made welcome in a very practical way.  I would support the idea of diplomatic visas.  It would be an important sign that Ireland sees it as a close relationship.  It is more than just about convenience; it is an indication of like-minded people supporting each other.<\/p> <p>  I am not a great admirer of rushing to join NATO.  Much has been made out of the necessity to be a member of NATO.  Ireland is not a member of NATO but we are friends with the countries that are NATO members.  Because of Ireland's history we are more pacifist with regard to not getting involved and in trying to be peacekeepers.  The recognition of being major contributors to peacekeeping missions is a great advantage for Ireland and I would strongly recommend this to a country such as Georgia.  It brings a country in touch with other countries, becoming of a same mind, as distinct from a sense of defence.  I do not believe Ireland has lost anything by not being a member of NATO.  I believe that we contribute more to world peace through our peacekeeping missions.  I am a former Minister for Defence and it was always a great pleasure when people from other countries asked for permission to visit our peacekeeping college in the Curragh Camp, not too far from Dublin.  This is a peacekeeping college where we teach peacekeeping methods to other countries.  One of the most extraordinary requests I received was from the United States military attach&eacute;, who came to see me one day during my reign as Minister.  He asked permission to recommend to his people back in the United States of America to send representatives from the United States Armed Forces to our peacekeeping college.  He told me that they knew nothing about peacekeeping.  He said they equip all their young people with the most modern equipment, teach them how to use it and then send them out on peacekeeping missions.  It was totally the opposite of Ireland's approach to peacekeeping.  It struck a chord with me that there is a rush to be part of a military alliance because we feel we are being defensive, but I believe it is more important to be seen going out on peacekeeping mission.  I strongly recommend that countries such as Georgia consider engaging in peacekeeping missions abroad.  Ireland now has a great reputation for this and people come to be trained in our peacekeeping methods.  Ireland has a reputation for engaging in peacekeeping missions, even if they are small missions.  There may be only 50 peacekeeping personnel in one country on a mission that people may not have heard of.  This type of integration into the free world is, to me, more important than being regarded as an important member of NATO.  Very often that is seen as aggression.  Ireland has not lost anything by not being an active member of NATO.<\/p><p>We have got a great deal of benefit from being non-members while taking part in peacekeeping missions.  I wish the witnesses well and welcome them here again.  I hope we will have the opportunity to meet frequently.  I look forward to Georgia's progress with great interest.  If there is anything we can do to be of assistance, the witnesses will find the door is always open.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018032900002#H00400","speaker":"1219","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522312800,"counter":940,"content":"<p>We have run into time constraints.

I touch on the similarity between Ireland and Georgia.  The best example is that a lot of Irish fans went to Georgia for the recent soccer match who would not have known about the country.  They took back the warmth and friendliness of the people.  They clicked with them.  When they came back, they actually promoted Georgia, which is the Irish way.  There has been a similarity in the histories of Ireland and Georgia.  That people can understand and relate to those histories ties them in very quickly.<\/p> <p>  We pride ourselves on peacekeeping and being a peaceful nation and we pride ourselves on being extremely proactive in that regard.  The witnesses mentioned that at times someone has to take a leadership role.  It took a very long time in this country.  History was not kind to us and it was hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  It was a question of keeping tipping at it, being proactive, looking for leadership, gaining that and going with it.  Other nations will go into a village, make a lot of noise, set up a perimeter and try to police people.  The Irish way was that the little jeep pulled up outside the village and the soldiers kicked a football into the square.  It encouraged people to come out and engage.  It is an issue one could look at as an example of how to break down barriers.<\/p> <p>  As a nation, I see the strength and forward planning of Georgia.  I wish the country the very best of luck.  As the country which is furthest west in Europe, if there was political will for us to pull Georgia, as the furthest east, into the European Union, it would benefit us all.  While we can sometimes be critical of Europe and while there are a few things still to be learned there, I would love to welcome Georgia into that family.

I understand that.  I was asked about Russia, Georgia and the impact of recent events in Britain.  We have not had diplomatic relations with Russia since 2008.  What I forgot to mention and which is very important is that, following the tragic deaths of our citizen, the Georgian Parliament adopted a bipartisan resolution on the part of the ruling party and the opposition.  This is an issue where we all unite.  Not only this, we are united on our foreign policy aspirations, which is extremely important.  The resolution condemned the grave human rights situation in the occupied regions.  What we have seen in the recent developments in Britain is that the Georgia issue has been raised in international fora.  All of our partners have been vocal on the occupation in Georgia by Russia.  This is very important and it might be a plea.  Despite the fact that we are a forward-looking nation, progressing in the right direction and consolidating democracy, we must not undermine at all the issue of what is happening in the occupied territory.  We would like all of our partners to be aware that the conflict is there and that we will need their support to ensure Russia meets its obligations so that those who live on the ground in the occupied territories have even slightly better conditions when it comes to human rights.  This is extremely important for us.<\/p> <p>  It was rightly said by members that our country is developing in the right way.  I really liked the comment that we are like-minded people with shared values, which include a belief in democracy.  We cherish that and will continue on the path to develop the country in the way that our people deserve.  When we talk about EU and NATO integration, we should be aware that it is not the choice of any political party.  Rather, it has been the choice of the Georgian people since independence.  Over 70% of the Georgian population supports Georgia's EU and NATO integration.  As I said in my opening statement, this is also reflected in the new constitution for Georgia.  It is a matter of security, stability and developing the country in a way that makes it fully democratic.  We are in the process of consolidating democracy with the support of the committee here.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee again for providing us with this unique opportunity to speak here.  It is a very good illustration of our strong bilateral ties at committee levels and of interparliamentary co-operation.  This is a very good example of how both countries should be contributing to the achievement of more practical co-operation between Ireland and Georgia.  We have had very good and successful political co-operation, which will, of course, deepen further, through the recently established friendship group and our committees.  I thank the committee for the opportunity it has given us to visit this beautiful country and discuss the areas we can work on that will bring tangible results to both our countries.<\/p><p>I look forward to the committee's visit to Georgia this year, particularly the members who have not visited our country.

We want to bring to the committee's attention the recent report on the persecution of Christians in India.  I am the director of Church in Chains.  We are an independent charity that seeks to support persecuted Christians worldwide.  With me today is Pastor Baiju George, an Indian Christian who has been living in Ireland since 2006, and Ms Pamela Coulter, who acts as our advocacy officer.<br\/><br\/>Our concerns about this matter can be summarised in the title of the report, which is Official India on the side of the militants &ndash; an analysis on the persecution of Christians in India with the tacit approval of police and government officials.  The report covers the period from July to December 2017, and we have also produced a short summary, which has been circulated to members, but I have copies available for anyone who wants one.  Our presentation is divided into three sections.  I want to speak about the facts behind the report, with a few brief case histories to illustrate what is going on in India at the moment.  Then Pastor George will speak about some of the reasons behind the rise in persecution, which has brought this particularly to our notice.  Then Ms Coulter will speak about some recommendations and suggestions as to how this committee could act in response.<br\/><br\/>Church in Chains has appeared before this committee previously.  We have been in existence for over 30 years.  We began when we became aware of the plight of Christian prisoners in the Soviet Union.  We try to do four main things in our work.  We try to raise awareness about the fact that Christians are persecuted around the world, and we do that by publishing accurate and reliable reports.  As a Christian organisation, we encourage people to pray, so we circulate a quarterly magazine and a weekly email to our supporters, and we organise various events for them.  The third strand, which is the strand that has us here today, is that we advocate for justice.  We seek to engage with ambassadors of governments where Christians face persecution.  We seek to engage with the committee in the Oireachtas, and we have also been a member of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's NGO standing committee on human rights.  The fourth strand to our work is that we seek to support victims of persecution.  That can involve different things in different countries.  It includes seeking to support displaced Christians in countries like Iraq, Syria and Nigeria; seeking to support pastors and churches attacked by Hindu extremists in India, which we are considering today, and those who suffer at the hands of Islamist extremists in Pakistan and Egypt, and the families of prisoners in Eritrea.  We also support the provision of Bibles and Christian literature in countries where they are not freely available, countries like Iran and North Korea.  While our strapline is an Irish voice for persecuted Christians, we would like to make it clear that we believe strongly in religious freedom for all people, and while our focus is predominantly on Christians, we acknowledge that other religious groups, and indeed those who profess atheism, also suffer persecution in many countries, alongside Christians.  They would include groups like the Ahmadi Muslim community in Pakistan, the Baha'i community in Iran, Muslims in Burma, China and India, and the Yazidis in Iraq.<br\/><br\/>The report that we produced on the period July to December 2017 documents a representative sample of 57 serious incidents of persecution during that period.  It is a gross understatement of the actual number of incidents.  Since we compiled that report, we got some figures from Indian organisations.  I do not want to go into too many statistics, but it is clearly seen that in 2016, Indian Christians reported 441 incidents in the country, and in 2017 that number had gone up to 736.  Even in the period January to March of this year - the latest news we have is up to last Sunday, which was Palm Sunday, when an attack was recorded - there were 90 documented cases.  This is not just being reported by Christian organisations.  The first line of the 2017 Human Rights Watch report for India says:<\/p><blockquote>Vigilante violence aimed at religious minorities, marginalised communities, and critics of the government - often carried out by groups claiming to support the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - became an increasing threat in India in 2017.  The government failed to promptly or credibly investigate the attacks, while many senior BJP leaders publicly promoted Hindu supremacy and ultra-nationalism, which encouraged further violence.<\/blockquote> <p>So in many ways, the Human Rights Watch analysis tallies almost exactly with what we have found on what is behind persecution of Christians.  Last June, Dr. Ahmad Shaheed, who is the UN rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, was in Dublin speaking at a summer school in Trinity College, and I was at that event.  When he was underlining what the current challenges to freedom of religion or belief around the world are, he spoke about the persecutions of Christians in India as being one of those challenges.  It is important to note where this persecution is happening in India.  It is not happening, to a large part, in the cities of India, where churches are bigger and are more visible.  Many of India&rsquo;s Christians are able to practise their faith freely.  It has been the case that Christians in India have suffered attacks over decades.  I have been involved in this work for 30 years or more.  During that time, there have been reports coming in, but it is very evident that there has been a huge increase in recent years.  We attribute that to the fact that those who are perpetrating the attacks feel a sense of emboldenment to do that.  They feel that they will not be punished for taking part in such attacks, and indeed that they may have the support of local government officials, or the police.  A bizarre feature of many of the attacks, which is hard to believe, is that an attacker would attack innocent victims, often drawing blood as the committee will have seen in some of the pictures in the report, and then they drag the victims to the local police station, asking that the victims be charged with forcing conversion.  As we consider that, it is also important to note that it is widespread.  It is not just in one state in India.  Our figures show that attacks last year were reported in 24 out of 29 states in India.<br\/><br\/>Let me summarise four cases that are shown in the report, beginning with the man whose picture is featured on the front cover of the report, Pastor Khel Prasad Kurre.  He was attacked in October 2017.  He was on his way home from visiting a member of his church.  Four people attacked him, beat him with sticks.  He was hospitalised and needed 12 stitches to his head.  When he reported the incident to the police, he was informed that the attackers had been to the police station to report that he was converting people to Christianity.  The police threatened him with arrest, which deterred him from lodging a complaint about the attacks.<br\/><br\/>On page six of the report, the committee can see a picture of Pastor Karthik Chandran.  He was attacked by a group of 20 Hindu extremists in the southern state of Tamil Nadu in December.<\/p><p>His church was running a pre-Christmas charity event open to everybody.  The event was intended to distribute clothing to the poor, aged and widows.  The extremists came in and broke the music equipment, chairs and glass windows.  The Christians submitted photos and videos of the assault to the police.  In this case, the police did register a case against the assailants, but they did not arrest anybody despite the clear evidence.  Again, that prompted fears of collusion between police and the attackers.  <\/p><p> On page 7 of our submission is a picture of Pastor Harjot Singh Sethi.  He is pictured with his leg in plaster.  He suffered head and leg injuries in Rajasthan state in August 2017.  About 50 extremists attacked a group of Christians holding a prayer meeting in one of their homes.  This took place in a private home.  The extremists said they would stop the attack if the Christians, and Pastor Sethi in particular, would shout \"Hail, Lord Ram\".  It is hard to see a more clear-cut example of the motivation behind the attacks.  Before receiving medical treatment, Pastor Sethi was taken to a police station.  The attackers came there and abused the Christians, and accused Pastor Sethi of forceful conversion.  This is a regular pattern.  Pastor Baiju George will speak about why they do that.  Six attackers were charged by police, but with minor offences.  <\/p><p> The last example I want to mention on this occasion is pictured on page 6 of our submission.  Pastor Muniyandi Elangoan Jebraj suffered soft-tissue brain damage after a brutal attack by five Hindu extremists in July 2017 in Tamil Nadu.  This took place outside the church gate.  Pastor Jebraj and his son, who is also a pastor, were battered with a knife, wooden sticks and steel rods.  The attackers were identified as members of the Hindu Makkal Katchi, an extremist group.  However, police denied any religious motivation in the incident despite the fact that the group the attackers belonged to had been aggressively inciting Hindus in Tamil Nadu to attack Christians.<\/p><p> I could provide many more examples.  I mention those to highlight what it is like on the ground.  At this point I would like to turn to Pastor Baiju George.  He is an Indian Christian who has been living in Ireland since 2006.  He will speak about how things have changed for Christians in his home country, speak about some of the people he has been in contact with and outline some of the reasons behind the rise in persecution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018032900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Turner","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1522312800,"counter":952,"content":"<p>I hope I will do justice to what I have been assigned today.  I will address some of the reasons for the rise in persecution of Christians in India in the past two to three years.  We have been noticing an increase in persecution across the country.  The year 2016 was probably the worst since the independence of India.  Persecution then doubled in 2017.  Most of the cases were authenticated by organisations that stand with Christians in India.  Some cases are reported, some go unreported.  This is because the church itself tries to take care of some of the cases and does not report them to the police, newspapers or TV channels.  Incidents have largely taken place because the victims are independent.  They are attacked because they are not a part of big organisations.  Such matters are taken care of by organisations.  One such organisation is Persecution Relief, headed by Mr. Shibu Thomas.  I know him personally.  That group has been working for Christians in India for the past three or four years.<\/p> <p>  I will outline some of the reasons that persecutions have increased in India.  Even though the central government at the highest level has been silent about religious freedom, ministers or officials at state level make public statements to national news channels and newspapers saying that they want India to be a Hindu country or that India is for Hindus and not for any other religion.  However, when asked about this, central government and top officials, including the Prime Minister and other Cabinet members, remain \"mum\".  They do not say anything about it.  As such, one of the reasons for persecution is that people are not speaking out.  The top authorities do not speak out against the religious persecution happening in India, not only against Christians but also against other minorities.  <\/p> <p>  It is not only Christian minorities who are targeted.  Muslims are also targeted.  Christians are targeted because of their faith.  However, the Muslims are not targeted because of their faith.   They are targeted because of the food they eat, including beef.  Most Muslims are involved in beef trading and have businesses involving meat.  The committee members will know that the cow is considered very sacred by Hindus.  Even though the meat served does not come from cows, but from buffalo, lamb or other animals, Hindus attack Muslims.  Muslims are persecuted for that reason.  In the case of Christians however, it is all about faith, and the charge that they are converting.  \"Conversion\" is the word used for any Christianity.  They say that any Christian programme active around the country is trying to convert people.  <\/p> <p>  There has been a very large increase in the number of Christians in India.  Government officials have stated that the percentage of Christians in India is around 2.4%, but unofficially it has increased to 12%, which the Government is not ready to accept.  Christianity is spreading and people are getting to know about God in the right way as we provide them with information.<\/p> <p>  New Hindu extremist groups are appearing in almost every state because of the influence of the central Government.  Groups who were silent during the last Government have come up with their own agendas because the central Government has been helpful to them in every way.  The police have aided the Government and enabled attacks on Christians.  One such group is Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, RSS, which was silent until this Government.  That is one of the main groups targeting Christians in India.  There are a number of other groups.  <\/p> <p>  As Mr. Turner said, such incidents take place most often in rural or village areas, where churches have much fewer members.  They are targeted because there is nobody to stand for them.  By contrast, the smallest church in a city might have at least 5,000 members.  It is not easy for Hindu extremists to attack churches with large numbers of members.  I come from a church which has 15,000 members.  Our church does not experience such attacks because it has very strong political backing.  However, people in villages and rural areas do not have enough supporters.  That is one of the reasons they are attacked.<\/p><p>Although 2016 was bad, 2017 was worse.  In 2018, by 21 March, details of 90 cases of persecution against Christians had been reported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018032900002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Baiju George","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522312800,"counter":954,"content":"<p>There is some conflict about the number.

It is thought that there are more Christians than are officially recorded.  There is a belief that this suits the Indian government in arguing that Christianity is not on the rise.  It also suits some Christians that the figure is understated in that a perceived rise would lead to further persecution.

We are not coming to the committee with problems without presenting some solutions and recommendations.  I will now put forward our recommendations, of which there are three parts.  The first relates to the Government of India.  We recommend that Prime Minister Modi speak clearly and consistently in support of full religious freedom for all in India.  He made a major speech in February 2015 but did not follow up on it and consequently it had little effect.  We recommend that the national leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party, BJP, would abandon its call for a national anti-conversion law.  This law is demonstrably at variance with the promotion of national harmony and is against international norms of human rights and religious freedom.  We recommend that state governors make clear that religiously motivated violence will not be tolerated and instruct police under their jurisdiction to bring the perpetrators of such violence to justice and to refrain from the current widespread practice of arresting the victims of the violence rather than the perpetrators.  The police represent a major issue.  We recommend that the police at all levels should impartially uphold the law at all times to protect religious minorities in daily life, to prosecute the perpetrators of religiously motivated violence rather than the victims and to treat seriously threats against religious minorities.<\/p> <p>  The recommendations to our own Government are as follows.  We recommend that the Minster for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, would publicly express concern at the dramatic upsurge of violence against Christians in India and to encourage the Government of India to combat the attackers, protect the victims and promote religious freedom.  We also ask the Minister to raise the matter with the Indian Ambassador to Ireland.  We ask that the Government ensure that the Irish Embassy in India is fully briefed on the situation of freedom of religion or belief in India.  This is outlined in the 2013 EU guidelines on the promotion and protection of freedom of religion or belief.  More immediately, we ask that this matter is raised as a priority issue in the next session of EU-India human rights dialogue.<\/p> <p>  We ask that the joint committee arrange a meeting to discuss the dramatic upsurge of violence against Christians in India either as a single issue or as part of a wider issue of the ongoing persecution of Christians worldwide.  This was last discussed by the committee in 2015.  Lastly, we ask that the Indian Ambassador to Ireland, Mrs. Vijay Thakur Singh, be invited to attend a meeting of the joint committee to respond to the serious situation that is outlined in this briefing document.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018032900002#N01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Pamela Coulter"},{"type":"speech","time":1522312800,"counter":963,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Coulter.

They seem to carry a lot of influence in each area.  Who has access to the governors to raise these issues?  There is safety in numbers and it seems that if there was an organisation that was able to make these representations it would be better rather than people doing so individually.  I noted in the briefing the role of the UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief.

We need to acknowledge that we do not have to go far to note the rise in sectarianism.  We only have to look in our own country and what is happening in Ireland today.  It is the 21st century, yet discrimination in class, colour or creed continues in many countries across the world.  The witnesses referred to 24 of 29 states.  It is clearly a huge problem which India needs to address.  I wonder about the seeds of the sectarianism.  Some say it goes back to British rule which fomented sectarianism, and set different religions against each other in an effort to control the population.  We have seen that in other countries too.  I agree that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade should contact his Indian counterpart to state his deep concern about the attacks on religious freedom by the right-wing sectarian Hindu militias, not only against Christians but also against Muslims and Sikhs and other religious minorities.<\/p> <p>  According to the witnesses, 20% of all reported attacks took place in the state of Uttar Pradesh.  Why is there such a high percentage of attacks in that particular area?  What are the triggers?  From our own history, we know that there have been attacks on minority populations as a consequence of inflammatory speeches by political parties or their leaders.  Is that a common factor?  In areas where attacks occur, do people of different religions live cheek by jowl or do they reside in separate areas?  Are there economic reasons behind the attacks?  Is there a perception that one group is better off than the other?  The witnesses mentioned people of the Muslim faith may be involved in a particular trade.  Is that a trigger?  That has been something used as a reason for religious attacks across the world.  Is it stoked by people of wealth, privilege or power?<\/p> <p>  I return to asking about the role played by political parties.  The witnesses referred to the role of social media.  Is this being used to stoke these attacks?  There is a growing middle class in India and there is increasing wealth and an increased use of social media.  Have companies such as Facebook or Google been approached on this matter?<\/p><p> On the issue of complaints being made to the police but not being followed up on, is there need for a separate structure within the policing service in India?  What demands should we be making of the Indian Government?  On the anti-conversion laws, perhaps the witnesses would elaborate on what is involved.<\/p><p> Like many of my colleagues, I have a good relationship with the Indian community in Ireland.  We attend many of the Indian festivals and so on.  What is being done to make the Indian community here more aware of these attacks on the religious minority groups?  The people from India who I meet in Ireland would be horrified to hear what is going on in their country.  Perhaps this voice needs to be used to garner support for what we are trying to do to stop these attacks on religious groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018032900002#N01300","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522312800,"counter":967,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Turner to respond at this point, following which I will allow more questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018032900002#O00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1522312800,"counter":968,"content":"<p>I will be as brief as possible.

I will ask Pastor Baiju George to respond to the question on the State governors.<\/p> <p>  On the EU human rights dialogue, I am not sure of the next date for that dialogue.  My inquiries did not reveal if a date has been set but I am sure the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would know it.  When we approach the Government here on taking an initiative about any country, the response is often that it works better in consultation with its EU partners.  If this is to be the case, issues such as this should be included in the EU human rights dialogue.  This can only happen if States raise the issue.  If Ireland raises it, there is a very good chance it will be discussed.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Crowe's question regarding social media, social media is being used by the attackers.  They seem to revel in recording such attacks and broadcasting them through social media channels.  I am not sure whether the channels used are the international ones such as Facebook and so on.  There is video footage available of people burning Bibles and abusing churches.  Those involved are quite happy to do this.

I thank the Chairman for the actions that he and his committee propose to take, which are exactly what my organisation has sought.  It has been mentioned that the matter has not received much publicity.  In many ways it is convenient for everyone to ignore these issues.  It can be convenient for governments that trade with India or any other country to ignore human rights issues.  That is why we thought it best to put the facts before the committee and call on the committee to take some action.<\/p> <p>  In terms of church leaders here in Ireland, we have had mixed responses to the reports that we have raised.  There might be two main reasons for the mixed responses.  First, in many countries around the world, very often those who face the most severe persecution are those who are members of churches that are outside mainstream churches.  In addition, those who have left another faith to become Christians often receive the most direct persecution.  That would be one reason for a lukewarm response by church leaders in Ireland. <\/p> <p>  Second, there is a misplaced position on the relationship between churches here in Ireland and other religious groups.  Interfaith groups are very important in Ireland.  Some church leaders are reluctant to talk about issues, as evidence suggests that the adherence of other religions are responsible for sectarian attacks against Christians.  Some church leaders might be a little afraid that if they raise such issues it will upset interfaith dialogue in Ireland.  Church in Chains fully supports interfaith dialogue and the freedom of all to live in peace and harmony in this country but it is vital that interfaith dialogue takes note of what truly happens in different places around the world.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Crowe that the core issue is for police to take action at a local level, and I wish the matter could be resolved.

I will briefly outline the work of my Department and its proposed 2018 Estimate, as well as outlining the proposed 2018 Estimate allocations for the President&rsquo;s Establishment, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  While I have certain responsibilities to the Oireachtas in respect of administrative matters in these offices, they operate independently of my Department.  My colleague, the Minister of State and Government Chief Whip, Deputy McHugh, will outline the 2018 Estimate allocation for the Central Statistics Office and will take any questions relevant to that Vote following the committee&rsquo;s consideration of the other Votes in my group.  I am joined by Mr. Martin Fraser, Secretary General of the Department, Ms Mary Keenan, head of corporate affairs, and Ms Geraldine Butler, finance officer.<\/p> <p>  The 2018 Revised Estimate for the President&rsquo;s Establishment is &euro;4.32 million.  This includes some &euro;3 million for pay and administration, with the balance to fund the centenarians&rsquo; bounty.  It is estimated that approximately 450 centenarians will receive the bounty in 2018.<\/p> <p>  The 2018 Revised Estimate for my Department is &euro;35.9 million, which includes &euro;24.9 million for administration costs.  Following the recent review of the work of the strategic communications unit, I am reducing the 2018 funding allocation by &euro;2.5 million to &euro;2.5 million, &euro;2.2 million of which has already been spent.  I am requesting, therefore, that the committee approve a 2018 Estimate for my Department of &euro;33.4 million, which is a 9% reduction on my Department&rsquo;s 2017 Revised Estimate.<\/p> <p>  I will now briefly outline for the committee the progress made by my Department on key priorities in 2017 and indicate where we are focusing our efforts in 2018 and beyond.  The primary role of my Department is to support me in my executive functions as Taoiseach, to support the Government and to oversee implementation of the programme for Government.  It also supports the four Ministers of State assigned to the Department in full or in part.  These are the Government Chief Whip; the Minister of State with responsibility for defence; the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs and the Minister of State with responsibility for data protection, who is also assigned to a number of other Departments, as I mentioned.  In addition to supporting my work as Taoiseach and that of the Government, the Department&rsquo;s strategic priorities are: a sustainable economy; a better and fairer society; strong relationships in Europe and in the world; Brexit; leading Government and ensuring it acts in a joined-up way in terms of policy implementation and communications.<\/p> <p>  The Department is also responsible for a range of other issues, such as State protocol, including commemorations, constitutional issues, relations with the office of the President, relations with the Oireachtas, Government press and communications, the National Economic and Social Council, the Creative Ireland programme, the Citizens' Assembly and the Dublin north-east inner city initiative.  The Department funds a number of inquiries from its Vote, including the Moriarty tribunal, the Cregan commission on Siteserv and other matters and the Cooke commission on Project Eagle.  An important part of my Department's work is providing a secretariat for meetings of the Government and of Cabinet committees.  The Government has established Cabinet committees on: the economy; social policy and public services; the European Union, including Brexit; infrastructure, which covers housing; health; national security; and justice issues.<\/p> <p>  Ireland continues to experience sustainable and balanced economic growth.  Employment continues to increase and now stands at 2.2 million working in the State.<\/p><p>Unemployment was down to 6% in February, the lowest since August 2008 and well below the euro area average.  The Government's focus now is on achieving full employment and ensuring that the jobs created are quality jobs.  By this I mean jobs that raise living standards and reward employees, not just in terms of salary but also with good working conditions, work-life balance and benefits, including adequate pension coverage on retirement.<\/p><p> That is why on 28 February, together with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, I launched a five-year roadmap for pension reform.  It outlines a range of reforms across the pension system which will ensure that it is sustainable in the face of an ageing population.  In particular, it includes the introduction of an auto-enrolment pension scheme for private sector workers, with first enrolments in 2022.<\/p><p> Earlier this month, the Action Plan for Jobs 2018 was launched.  This year's plan is a more strategic and streamlined document reflecting the key risks and opportunities facing the economy.  It outlines 55 actions to be delivered, with a target of creating approximately 50,000 additional jobs.  My Department will oversee implementation of the Action Plan for Jobs and the delivery of the Government's other economic priorities through its support for Cabinet committee A and its related senior officials' groups.<\/p><p> The Government is keen to ensure that every sector of society - as well as every region - feels the benefits of our recovering and growing economy.  We must continue to ensure policies and services not only protect the most vulnerable in society but provide opportunities equally for all citizens to learn, work and prosper irrespective of gender, race, social status or sexual orientation.  My Department supports the work of shaping and reforming key public services, especially those requiring a cross-Government response through Cabinet committee B.  On 20 March, Ireland's ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was deposited with the United Nations.  This is a significant landmark for Ireland and its commitment to people with disabilities who have waited more than ten years for successive Governments to deliver.<\/p><p> I have signalled my intention to advance a set of measures to improve gender equality.  These measures will promote wage transparency in businesses and correct the imbalance at board level, where only 17% of board members of Ireland's top-listed companies are female.  Last year, 52% of appointees to State boards were female.  The State is now in a position to tell business to do better.  The Government is looking at options to extend paid parental leave in the first year of a child's life. The Government is keen to make child care more affordable for parents.  The initial reforms put in place in 2017, including the universal subsidy for children between six months and three years, have ensured parents of 67,000 children have benefited from enhanced payments.  In 2018, the Government expects to make significant progress in terms of enacting the required legislation and supporting IT infrastructure to deliver the new affordable child care scheme.<\/p><p> I recently visited Dublin's north-east inner city - I have been there on several occasions - to witness, at first hand, the work under way to revitalise and support the local community.  Significant work is now being done by the programme implementation board established last June to oversee the implementation of actions recommended in the Mulvey report.  This involves a strong collaborative effort between the statutory, community and business sectors and is working effectively to date.  My Department continues to support the work of the board, which recently published its progress report for 2017.<\/p><p> Increased investment in the health service must happen in tandem with reform and productivity gains.  My Department oversees the health reform agenda through its support for Cabinet committee E and the related senior officials' group.  Budget 2018 provided a record allocation of funding for health, including &euro;55 million for the National Treatment Purchase Fund to reduce long waiting times for treatment.  Significant steps have been taken following the publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare report by the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, including a commitment to early engagement with general practitioner, GP, representatives on the reform of the GP contract to support primary care improvements.  A negotiating mandate in this regard was given to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, at Cabinet this week.  An independent group, under the chairmanship of Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir, to examine the impact of removing private practice from public hospitals is up and running and is expected to report later this year.  A recruitment process for an executive director of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme office has been undertaken.  The final interviews for that are being held this week.<\/p><p> The publication of the health service capacity review in January and the commitment of &euro;10.9 billion in the National Development Plan Project Ireland 2040 are significant in supporting necessary changes to models of care and to meet ever-increasing demand due to a rising population and the availability of new treatments.  A significant new hospital building programme is under way with three new hospitals under construction, in addition to new wings and departments across the country.<\/p><p> Housing and homelessness remain a Government priority.  We are committed to delivering an increased supply of affordable, quality and accessible housing.  In 2017, under Rebuilding Ireland, the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, 26,000 households had their housing needs met, which is 100 households being housed every day by the State.  Up to 4,000 individuals exited homelessness, 18 family hubs began operations and there was a 33% increase in construction commencement notices.  To date the Rebuilding Ireland home loan and the enhanced long-term social housing lease scheme have been launched.  The affordable purchase scheme has been announced while the affordable rental scheme is being piloted.  Improvements have been made to the repair and leasing scheme.  New planning regulations have been introduced and new guidelines on design standards for new apartments are being finalised.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is leading implementation of the plan, but this is a whole-of-Government effort which is overseen through meetings of Cabinet committee D and associated senior officials' groups.<\/p><p> My Department supports me in an extensive programme of international engagement.  The focus of the programme is on advancing Ireland's strategic interests, developing bilateral and multilateral relations, enhancing Ireland's international reputation and promoting trade, tourism and investment.  In 2020, Ireland is seeking election to the UN Security Council.  Our candidature reflects Ireland's continuing engagement on issues of international importance and the centrality of the UN to our foreign policy.<\/p><p> The Government is committed to further strengthening Ireland's capacity to represent ourselves effectively on the international stage.  In four cities in the United States over St. Patrick's week, I had an extensive set of meetings and engagements with political, business and civil society representatives.  This included meetings with the US President and Vice President, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Senate Majority Leader, the Senate Minority Leader and the Friends of Ireland on Capitol Hill.  I also met with the governors of Oklahoma, Texas and New York, as well as the mayor of New York.  My main focus was on advancing Ireland's economic and political interests in the US, including reaffirming our strong commitment to membership of the European Union; outlining our priorities in the context of Brexit and the importance we place, in that context, on two-way transatlantic trade and investment; promoting Ireland as a location for jobs, trade, tourism and investment; and continuing to make the case for US immigration reform.<\/p><p> Last week, I had a fruitful bilateral meeting with the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, in advance of the March European Council.  She reiterated her strong support for our unique concerns arising from Brexit.  In the past few weeks, I have also had good bilateral meetings with the Dutch and the Luxembourg Prime Ministers, as well as with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk.  I have also invited the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, to visit Ireland in the coming months.<\/p><p> On becoming Taoiseach, in order to ensure an effective, whole-of-Government response to the challenges ahead, I assigned lead responsibility for Brexit to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I have also re-organised the structure of Cabinet committees, with Cabinet committee C dealing with European Union issues including Brexit.  My Department maintains strategic oversight of Ireland's response to Brexit, which is a crucial and cross-cutting issue.  This work is led by the Second Secretary General, John Callinan, who acts as my Sherpa, and the international, EU and Northern Ireland division.   The work of this division includes supporting me in my role as a member of the European Council and in my engagements with other Heads of State and Government and senior figures in the European institutions, as well as preparing for the work of Cabinet committee C and its supporting group of senior officials.<\/p><p> The work led by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade includes the ongoing detailed preparations for the negotiations at EU level; engagement with the administrations in Belfast and London; and the co-ordination of planning around the economic impacts of Brexit.  Across the Government, relevant Departments, agencies and overseas missions are also being further strengthened to deal with Brexit.  The objective of this ongoing work is to ensure Ireland achieves the best possible outcomes across all four priorities identified by the Government.  These are trade and the economy, the peace process, the common travel area and the future of the European Union with Ireland as a committed member.<\/p><p> We are also working to help maintain peace and develop relationships on the island of Ireland, and between Britain and Ireland, especially in light of the challenges posed by Brexit.  The European Council provides overall guidance and maintains close political oversight of the negotiations with the UK.  The European Commission task force on Article 50 negotiations with the United Kingdom, led by Michel Barnier, with which we are in constant contact, represents the EU 27 in the ongoing negotiations.<\/p><p> Last December, the European Council agreed that sufficient progress had been achieved on the phase 1 withdrawal issues to allow us to move negotiations to the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  Acknowledging the progress in subsequent discussions between the EU and the UK on a draft withdrawal agreement, the March European Council adopted a set of guidelines for discussions on the framework.  The guidelines confirm the conditional agreement on an orderly transition period dependent on progress on the outstanding issues in the draft withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and the backstop option on the Border.  The European Council will review progress on all these issues in June.<\/p><p> Ireland will, of course, remain a member of the European Union.  It is, therefore, crucial that we are active in the debate about its future and that we focus more on what we want to achieve rather than on things we want to block.  With the support of my Department and the T&aacute;naiste, I have been engaged in many bilateral contacts with the leaders of other EU member states and the EU institutions with a view to exchanging views on the priorities of the future of Europe.  These bilateral contacts are vital to defend and promote Ireland's interests, which include a strong, stable, prosperous and more integrated European Union.  I delivered a speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg in January that highlighted the need for a forward-looking agenda for the Union with ambition and direction.<\/p><p> I have tasked the Minister of State with responsibility for European Union affairs, Deputy Helen McEntee, with leading a domestic engagement on the future of Europe so that Irish citizens can have their say on what they want for the EU of the future.  I launched this engagement process, known as the citizens' dialogue, last November.  The process is due to conclude on Europe Day, which is 9 May.<\/p><p> My Department works closely with colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Northern Ireland matters.  It is disappointing that we have not yet been able to secure agreement on the re-establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement as we approach its 20th anniversary.  The T&aacute;naiste and I will continue to work closely with the British Government and all the parties in Northern Ireland to try to make progress in the coming months.<\/p><p> In August, my Department published National Risk Assessment 2017 &ndash; Overview of Strategic Risks.  The document highlighted the intensification of risks arising from Brexit as well as a more general perception of increased geopolitical instability in the world; risks around climate change; human capital and skills needs; technological risks arising from potential cyber attacks or data fraud and theft; continued housing supply constraints; changing demographics; and potentially unrealistic expectations for public expenditure.<\/p><p> Work on this year's national risk assessment has begun and we intend to publish the 2018 report early in the third quarter.  The most important actions that the Government can take to mitigate risks, including risks associated with Brexit, and seize future opportunities is to vigorously implement the substantial plans set out in Project Ireland 2040.  That will be a significant focus of our attention during the year.<\/p><p> The national digital strategy will be developed during 2018 and will provide for an overarching long-term vision of the impacts of digital developments on Ireland.  In a related area of work, my Department continues to play a supporting role in data protection policy by seeking to ensure that the Data Protection Commissioner continues to have the resources she needs and to ensure that Ireland continues to be a leader internationally on digital and data issues.<\/p><p> Finally, my Department supports the National Economic and Social Council in providing forward-looking strategic advice on economic, social and sustainable development issues.  The current NESC work programme includes jobless households and the quality of supportive services; climate change and governance for the transition to the low-carbon economy; and land use, land value and urban development.  The Secretary General and an assistant secretary, Liz Canavan, serve as chairperson and deputy chairperson of the NESC respectively.  The council is meeting today, as Deputies are aware.<\/p><p> I have outlined some of the main outputs of my Department in 2017 and some of the priorities we are working on to make progress in 2018 and beyond.  There are of course always new challenges and the Department must be flexible and adaptable.  Looking ahead to later this year, for example, the successful organisation of the papal visit will be a significant objective for the Department and will require considerable work by the protocol section in particular.<\/p><p> I will comment briefly on the other Votes.  Vote 3 relates to the Office of the Attorney General.  The 2018 Revised Estimate for the Office of the Attorney General is &euro;15.32 million.  The majority of administrative expenditure relates to staff salaries, which cost &euro;11.7 million this year.  The largest expenditure item is a grant of a little under &euro;2.3 million to the Law Reform Commission.  Vote 4 relates to the Central Statistics Office.  As I mentioned previously, the Government Chief Whip will present the 2018 Revised Estimate for the CSO to the committee.  Vote 5 relates to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The Revised Estimate for the office is &euro;43.5 million.  This represents a 6% increase, or &euro;2.4 million, in the budget for the DPP.  The increase is designed to cover salary costs and an increase in the provision for general law expenses.  Vote 6 relates to Chief State Solicitor's Office.  The 2018 Revised Estimate for the Chief State Solicitor's Office is a little under &euro;33.7 million.  Salaries, wages and allowances account for &euro;17.37 million out of a total administrative budget of a little over &euro;19.68 million.  The remaining &euro;2.3 million is attributable to the general running costs of the office.  A provision of &euro;15.1 million is allocated for the payment of legal fees incurred.  This comprises &euro;13.5 million for counsel and &euro;1.4 million for general law expenses, which includes items such as expert witnesses and stenographers.  The balance is to be used to pay external solicitors.<\/p><p> I thank committee members for their attention and I commend the Revised Estimates to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#A00900","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1003,"content":"<p>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m an Taoiseach agus a chomhghleacaithe chuig an choiste.<\/p> <p>  I will begin by asking the Taoiseach about a comment in his opening statement.  How can the committee take the Taoiseach seriously in his claim that homelessness remains a Government priority, given the level of homelessness we have seen under his reign?  Since the last general election, homelessness for children has increased by 100%.  Last night, a total of 3,755 children were sleeping in emergency accommodation in hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation and family hubs.  In the past 12 months, child homelessness has increased by 50%, yet we are expected to believe somehow that this is a Government priority.  If it is a Government priority, does the Taoiseach acknowledge that he and his Cabinet colleagues are failing miserably?  I say as much given the unprecedented level of homelessness, in particular child homelessness, that we now have in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#C00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1004,"content":"<p>Are you taking the questions in groups, Chairman?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#C00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1005,"content":"<p>No, Taoiseach.

Deputy Doherty can take us seriously is several ways on that point.  First, a new Department has been dedicated mainly to housing, planning and local government.  This change involved taking functions out of that Department and moving them to another Department so that the new Department could focus on housing.<\/p> <p>  A total of &euro;140 million has been spent on emergency accommodation, which represents a major increase on spending on such accommodation.  This is taxpayers' money that we would not be spending if this was not an emergency that required spending on emergency accommodation.  That is why we do it.<\/p> <p>  Committee members can see in Project Ireland 2040 a money-backed commitment to build 110,000 social houses, including new homes and new houses over the next ten years.  Committee members will have seen our commitment to establish a State development agency, a new State body that will acquire or buy State lands and build on them.<\/p> <p>  If commitment is down to the amount of work we are doing and the amount of money we are spending, then I do not think anyone can doubt the level of Government commitment to this issue.  What we are not seeing is the kind of results we would like to see.  That is unbelievably frustrating, most of all for people who are affected by homelessness but also for those who are trying to solve the problem and assist people who are in homelessness.<\/p> <p>  I saw figures yesterday that indicate a big reduction in the number of people who are rough sleeping.  That is welcome and is, in large part, down to the additional bed spaces made available and the additional funding for the agencies.  It seems there has been a small reduction in individual homeless but a big and disturbing increase in the number of families who are in emergency accommodation.  Certainly, more are becoming homeless every month than we can get out of homelessness and that is extremely disturbing.  It is very frustrating that we have not seen sufficient progress to date, but it is certainly not down to lack of prioritisation, funding, effort or commitment from Government.  We need to drill down into that and understand better why the policies that we have put into effect thus far have not had the results that we would have hoped for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#C00500","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1007,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach mentioned that it is deeply frustrating for those working to resolve this crisis.  That applies to none more than those working on the front line.  I imagine the Taoiseach is aware of the comments made by Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy, the founder of Focus Ireland, this morning.  She said she has \"lost all confidence\" in the Government's ability to solve this crisis.<\/p><p>Fr. Peter McVerry has said that the Government's housing plan is deeply flawed and that it was presented with a stack of press releases aimed primarily at presenting a positive picture.  That is what people on the ground are saying.  Reconfiguration of a Department or more and more press releases on this, that and the other will not solve this crisis.  Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that under his leadership, the buck stops with him?  He is not a commentator, but the Taoiseach of this State, and under his leadership child homelessness figures have increased significantly.  This is not just a matter of statistics or percentages.  It is a disservice to those families with children to talk about a 100% increase or a 50% increase as we sometimes do when talking about figures.  These are citizens, living in this country who have found that they are homeless as a result of policies the Taoiseach has introduced or refused to introduce, such as real rent certainty and the Focus Ireland amendment, which the Government together with their Fianna F&aacute;il Party colleagues voted against.  These are matters that have resulted in the astronomical figures we have today, where, as we speak, almost 10,000 people are homeless in our State.  <\/p><p> What does the Taoiseach say to those on the front line who do not have a political axe to grind, but are articulating that the Government's plans to deal with the housing crisis are deeply flawed and that they have lost confidence in the Government to resolve this crisis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#C00600","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1009,"content":"<p>I did not mention anything about press releases or statistics; it is Deputy Doherty who brought that up.  One thing I am absolutely certain will not solve our housing crisis or the challenge we face in dealing with homelessness is political point scoring.  It will not provide a house for anyone or bring down anybody's rent or make it easier for anyone to get a mortgage or find a home.  Political point scoring will achieve nothing in solving people's real problems.  I do not think it is the kind of issue that one should try to exploit politically.<\/p> <p>  I did not mention press releases, rather I mentioned the concrete things the Government is doing, including the significant increase in spending on housing, ranging from emergency housing which we provide for people and the increasing amount of social housing that is being built.  Only a few hundred social housing units were being built a couple of years ago and now it is up in the thousands.  We expect that up to 4,000 homes will be built this year and the change to the planning regulations will make it more affordable to build apartments.<\/p> <p>  A point made by Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy this morning that struck me, and she made a very valid point, was that we are seeing all over Dublin, and other cities as well, student accommodation being built.  I see cranes all over Dublin and in other cities where commercial property, hotels and student accommodation is being built.  All of this is welcome but we need to ask ourselves the fundamental question as to why we are seeing a significant level of construction but not the construction of residential property.  There is some residential development and the figures show that 40% more homes were built in February 2018 compared to February 2017, but it is not ramping up enough.  It seems to be economic and profitable to build student accommodation, hotels and commercial property and we need to try to work out in the next couple of week why it is not as profitable to build residential property.<\/p> <p>  We need to be very careful that any policy interventions by Government do not inadvertently make the situation worse.

McVerry said it was presented with a stack of press statements aimed primarily at presenting a positive picture.  On the day when figures emerge that 10,000 people are in emergency accommodation, and children are waking up this morning to go to school from hubs, bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels, the Taoiseach is saying we need to ask ourselves the question as to why this is the case.  That is shocking.  The Taoiseach has been in Government for seven years.  This did not happen overnight.  We have seen the homeless figures increase steadily under the stewardship of the Taoiseach's Cabinet but also while he was a Minister sitting at the Cabinet table.  He tells the families who are in emergency accommodation that we need to start asking why this is the case.<\/p> <p>  We need clear actions.  This is not political point scoring.  Are we supposed to ignore the fact that we have a housing crisis, yet the Government still does not deem it an emergency?  Are we to ignore the fact that on five separate occasions our party put to the Taoiseach a proposal on real rent certainty, which he, together with the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, opposed?  Are we supposed to ignore the fact that the Focus Ireland amendment, which was simple and stated that one should not evict people into homelessness, was opposed by the Government and colleagues who have entered a confidence and supply agreement?  These are some of the reasons that we are seeing the rise in homelessness in the monthly figures.

It is simply not good enough.<\/p> <p>  I did not intend to raise this issue today but the Taoiseach in his opening statement mentioned it as a priority.  Obviously, if it is a priority, it is failing dramatically when those on the front line state that the Government's plans are flawed.  The Government needs to revisit some of the proposals that are being put forward by the Opposition and stop rejecting them simply because they come from the Opposition.

We would not be spending &euro;140 million a year providing emergency accommodation in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation and family hubs for 10,000 people if it was not an emergency.  It is an emergency, but declaring it an emergency does not solve the problem and does not allow us to build houses or apartments more quickly or to provide one more house more quickly for any family.  I am happy to declare it an emergency, but that is rhetorical.  That will not solve the problem and make things better for any citizen in the State.<\/p> <p>  The reason that we do not support some of the proposals being put forward by the Opposition is not because they come from the Opposition, but because we believe they would make a bad situation worse.  If the Opposition was in charge of this problem, it would make a bad situation much worse.  Imposing very hard rent caps, for example, would mean that there would be fewer rental properties built.  There would be fewer people willing to rent out their properties and to enter the buy-to-let market.  That would have the effect of freezing the market.  One might protect a certain number of people from rent increases, but it would make it virtually impossible for new people to rent.  Similarly, the effect of other proposals made by the Opposition would cause us to have less supply in the housing market.  My contention is that this is an emergency and the Government is acting, but we are not getting the results we need so we need to do more.  I am, however, absolutely convinced that if we were to accept the Opposition proposals, such as the ones that Deputy Doherty put forward, we would make a bad situation much worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#D00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1012,"content":"<p>We could debate this issue all day, but I must say that the Taoiseach has some cheek.  On a day when under the Taoiseach's stewardship there are 10,000 people in emergency accommodation, the best he can offer is that if the Opposition was in Government, it would be worse because we would introduce a measure that one could not evict a family into homelessness.  Let us think about the proposal that Focus Ireland is putting forward, and what we in the Sinn F&eacute;in Party have put forward, which is the Focus Ireland amendment, where a landlord who has been supported through the tax net, which means he or she got beneficial treatment in terms of tax because he or she was a landlord, cannot evict a family into homelessness.  We say that is an appropriate measure but the Taoiseach states the family can be evicted into homelessness, yet he tells us this is a priority.  This is why a large section of those 10,000 people are in homeless accommodation today and this is why I cannot take what the Taoiseach says on this issue seriously because he will not take the steps that will prevent this emergency.<\/p> <p>  By calling the housing crisis an emergency, it means we can take emergency actions.  We can have follow up and a fire in the belly to deal with this issue.  We understand the pain, suffering and damage, both psychological and emotional, that is being done as a result of the situation in which many people find themselves today.  There is no fire in the belly of those in Government in regard to the housing crisis, and instead they state how many millions are being spent on dealing with it.  The Opposition supports the simple proposal not to evict tenants into homelessness.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach does not agree with the proposal and believes it is fine to do so, which is what is happening now.  I am dealing with a constituent who is facing being evicted into homelessness for a second time because the Government will not deal with the issue.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach spoke of hard rent caps and rent certainty.  Rent certainty is about tagging rent increases to inflation to ensure we do not have further increases in rent such as those that have occurred under the Government, including double-digit increases in certain areas.  Rent increases have resulted in people who belong to the \"barely getting by\" class finding themselves unable to get by and having to present as homeless to local authorities.  Solutions to the current emergency have been proposed and the Government must implement them and get a grip on the problem.  It must not allow more families to become homeless and then deal with them as emergency cases. <\/p><p> Last week, as other members will attest, representatives of a State-owned bank informed this committee that it had 1,000 properties lying empty.  The Taoiseach has tried to convince me that the Government considers this matter an emergency or a priority.  The figure of 1,000 empty properties relates to only one bank.  There are many others, for example, the Housing Agency offered more than 1,000 properties, of which only 400 were taken up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#D00500","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1014,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time is about to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#E00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1015,"content":"<p>I wish to raise a number of other points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#E00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>The Deputy will not have time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#E00400","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>I will make one further point on the strategic communications unit, SCU, and the Taoiseach's opening statement.

It is the view of the Residential Tenancies Board, as opposed to my view, that rent increases are slowing.  The Sinn F&eacute;in policy would effectively place a cap on rent because inflation is virtually zero.  While that would certainly protect many people who are currently renting from rent increases, it would also freeze out of the market new people, including young people, those looking for properties for the first time and people moving to this country, because it would reduce the number of people who are willing to enter the buy-to-let market and rent out their properties.

It would be useful to look at the percentage of people in family homelessness who were evicted as it is by no means the majority.  We intend to amend the law to strengthen the protections for people with families who face eviction.  We will do so on foot of proposals made by the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Moran.  We will strengthen the hand of the courts in respect of evictions by empowering them not to evict families into homelessness.  However, one must bear in mind that there are circumstance in which people who can pay the rent do not do so.  These are individual cases, which is the reason cases of this nature are dealt with in the courts, as they should be because the courts are generally sympathetic.  The percentage of evictions in Ireland compared with other countries is relatively low because our courts take a very sympathetic view of families. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#E00800","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1021,"content":"<p>To be helpful to the Taoiseach, the point I was making related to the notice to quit for landlords as opposed to evictions from houses that are to be repossessed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#E00900","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1022,"content":"<p>That is a fair point.<\/p> <p>  On the strategic communications unit, the SCU has 15 members of staff, seven of whom worked previously in communications in the Department and were seconded from the press office or Government Information Service to the new unit.

It will, therefore, be a matter for human resources to decide what will happen to these staff.  While I do not propose to discuss what will happen to individual staff and I know the Deputy does not want me to do so, it is certainly intended that some of them will be redeployed.  Some may well be approaching retirement and will retire, while others are seeking promotion and may be moved to other sections of the Department or other parts of the public service.  These are matters for the individuals in question.<\/p> <p>  One of my greatest regrets in the whole debate concerning the strategic communications unit is the extent to which 15 decent civil and public servants were brought into a public debate and had allegations made against them - perhaps not by Deputy Doherty but by others - that they were doing political work and favouring one political party.  That is not true, is not backed up by the evidence and was very unfair to them.  Those of us who are involved in politics sign up for this and, to a certain extent, we sign our families and friends up for it.  However, these are civil and public servants and they should not have to go home to their children to answer questions as to whether daddy or mummy has done something wrong.  However, that is the position in which they were placed as a result of the highly personalised and unfair commentary made against public and civil servants working in the unit.

Problems in politics and with policy that have one cause are easier to solve than those that are multi-factorial and have a complex phenomenology.  This is obviously a country with a rising population and increased household formation.  Every year in Ireland more housing is needed, unlike in other countries where the population is dropping or there are fewer households.  There is also a lack of supply, but it is not as simple as that.  It was probably best explained to me by somebody whose name I cannot remember.  I went out before Christmas with a group, the name of which I cannot remember.  I think it was Streetwise, or perhaps it was the group of doctors who visit people who are sleeping rough.  I spent the evening meeting people who were on the streets or living in tents and talking to those who worked with them.  The way she described it was this and in some ways it best explained the problem to me.  In a normal scenario, were it not for the boom and bust cycle, about 30,000 new homes would be built in Ireland every year.  The figure would be in that ball park.  In Ireland, because of the financial crisis and the economic crash, there was a seven-year period in which virtually no homes were built.  The Government and the local authorities did not have the funds to build homes; the banks were bust and the construction sector was destroyed.  During that period about 200,000 or 210,000 houses would ordinarily have been built, but they were not.  As a result about 200,000 households which in the past would have bought a home are now renting.  As a result, another 200,000 households have been pushed down, some of which have been pushed out of the rental market altogether and fallen off the ladder.  That is the best simple explanation that has been given to me for the worsening homelessness problem and housing crisis.<\/p> <p>  We are going to have to catch up.  Not only will we have to get supply to equilibrium, that is, provide what is needed to meet the natural increased demand every year of about 30,000 houses, we have a catch-up figure of about 200,000 to achieve.  That is not going to be done quickly.  It will take us quite a number of years to get back to building 30,000 houses a year, which is where we need to be, and then catch up on the 200,000 that were not built during the last decade.  In the meantime, we are going to have to do lots of things to treat the symptoms of the problem.  If I were to apply my medical expertise, there is an underlying problem which we need to solve - a fundamental lack of supply.  While we fix that problem we will have to treat the symptoms.  That will involve doing some of the things we are doing - providing emergency accommodation; focusing on prevention in order that people will not fall into homelessness; allowing the uplifts in the housing assistance payment; and identifying people early before they lose their home.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Michael McGrath asked a straight question.  Yes, the position is getting worse.

He has acknowledged that the problem is getting worse and states he intends to give more time to dealing with it in the period ahead.  The problems are obvious.  Some of them were touched on, but it remains the case that there is very significant land hoarding in Ireland.  As long as it is more profitable to hold or trade land than to build on it, there is going to be a problem.  That remains the case.  Banks, including the State-owned banks, receivers, vulture funds and private landowners are sitting on land that could be developed.  In many cases, the land has been zoned and is located where services are actually available.  This happens because it is more profitable to sit on the land and rely on the expectation that its value will grow.  I do not know what the Government is planning to do about this using tax measures.  Will they actually be implemented next year?<\/p> <p>  We have been promised a report on the cost of building housing.  We still hear from many builders and developers that it is not viable to build in certain parts of the country.  That remains a problem, but I have not seen any such report from the Government to tackle the cost of building housing.  It seems to take local authorities forever to get schemes off the ground, even where they have been sanctioned.  That obviously is an issue.  There are also issues with funding.  It was announced in the budget last October that a new &euro;750 million fund would be made available for house building.  That has not yet happened.<\/p><p>However, builders and developers are having to borrow at very expensive rates from international funds at perhaps 12% or 14%.  It is pushing up the cost of housing with the result being a growing affordability gap and a structural shift in our society where fewer and fewer people into the future will be able to afford a home.  This is the reality of what is happening out there.  From the work I do at constituency level, and every Deputy does a lot of constituency work, I can tell the Taoiseach that it is getting worse.  I have seen a very dramatic uplift in the number of housing-related queries in recent weeks.  Far from being confident that the Government is getting on top of this, I think it will get worse.  Nothing said by the Taoiseach or the Minister of State will give people confidence that the tide is actually turning because time and again, the Taoiseach has said it will get better and the Government is getting on top of it but the figures get worse at an accelerated pace so something is very badly wrong in the Government's approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#F01300","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1040,"content":"<p>I would contend that at the very least, we are seeing some improvement in some areas.

We know from the RTB figures that the increase in rents is starting to slow but certainly I have no argument with the Deputy and I will not contend that homelessness is not getting worse.  That is evident.  There are more families in emergency accommodation than there were before and the number is continuing to rise.

The Deputy mentioned land hoarding, which is certainly part of the picture.  It is definitely part of the problem.  We brought in the derelict sites tax or levy, whatever one wants to call it.  This will take effect from 2019.  We have announced the establishment of Home Building Finance Ireland, which will be funded from this year.  ISIF already provides finance to building so it is not as if it is not being done already.  It is but Home Building Finance Ireland will provide more of that.  As part of Project Ireland 2040, we have made a commitment to establish a State development land agency - essentially a State developer - that will be able to acquire and develop land.  This is one of the things that will form part of the solution.

Actually the debate at the time was very similar.  There were conspiracy theories and allegations, as well as paranoia, except that the shoe was on the other foot and it was people in my party who were saying the kind of things members of the Deputy's party are now saying.

It is not particular to the Department of the Taoiseach; it is true across the Civil Service and the public service.  It is always a safer option to do things in the way they have always been done.  One of the jokes in the public service is that the safe thing to do is to give the contract to IBM, not to a new or an innovative firm because if one does things as they have always been done, one will not be criticised, but if one innovates and tries to do things differently, one leaves oneself open to criticism.

Decisions on how the advertorials would look and what photographs would be included in them were left to local editors.  It would have been advisable for us to say from the outset that the SCU would sign off on the editorial content.

It is obviously a slogan the Taoiseach used in the course of his campaign in Fine Gael to become leader of the party and, subsequently, Taoiseach.  It is a slogan which is associated very much with Fine Gael.  Does the Taoiseach accept that those emails and the fact that the discussion happened confirms the point about a blurring of the lines between Fine Gael and the Government?  Relatedly, other emails which came out include correspondence from the Taoiseach to, I think, Mr. John Concannon talking about how the child care initiative should be a Government initiative as opposed to being seen as a Department of Children and Youth Affairs one.  Was that about the Taoiseach's Government, him in particular, or Fine Gael getting the benefit and credit for the initiative as opposed to an Independent Minister, Deputy Zappone?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#K01200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1144,"content":"<p>The short answer to that is \"No\".  It was about the Government getting credit for it rather than a particular Department or agency.  The Government is much wider than any political party or even the Independents who are in it.  The Government includes Departments and it is a wider concept.  My view for a long time has been and remains that Government is too siloised and that Departments and agencies operate very often as independent republics that do their own thing too much.  I see part of my role as Taoiseach as being to bring about joined-up Government and to bring together Government policies, implementation and communications.  There is a tendency sometimes on the part of Departments and agencies to engage in a lot of self-promotion, quite frankly.  From the public's point of view, this is all the Government.  The public does not really want to know which Department or agency it is.  People want to know what the system is doing for them.<\/p> <p>  I thought one of the best campaigns co-ordinated by the strategic communications unit related to the self-employed and the rights and benefits we were extending to them, including paternity benefit, treatment benefit and invalidity pension for the first time.  When Government is broken up into so many silos and agencies, however, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, for example, only sees people who are self-employed in terms of PRSI S-class contributions.  That is how the Department sees it.  It thinks of self-employed people as PRSI S-class payers for which they get certain benefits.  The Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners only see self-employed people as those who pay self-employed tax and who get certain credits.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation only sees people who are self-employed through the prism of entrepreneurship, which leads to a very fragmented message, very fragmented policy-making and poor implementation.  Part of my job as Taoiseach and of my Department is to join up Government and to bring together policy, implementation and communications.  That is why we did it as a package when we decided to do something for the self-employed.  We improved their social benefits, increased their tax credit and improved entrepreneurship supports.  We had joined-up policy and implementation and we communicated it as a single campaign on what the Government of Ireland was doing to improve things for the self-employed.  The old way was to have three Departments doing three different things without talking to each other or being joined-up at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#K01300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1145,"content":"<p>What about the \"republic of opportunity\" question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#K01400","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1146,"content":"<p>I would have to look at that again as I do not remember in my own mind when I started using \"republic of opportunity\" as a term.

When the Government brings forward legislation, it goes through a particular process.  There is permission by the Government to draft a general scheme.  The heads of the legislation are brought to the Government and published.  Very often they are referred to a committee for scrutiny.  The legislation is then drafted, a process which involves the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It is then published.  Two weeks later it enters the D&aacute;il or the Seanad to be discussed on Second Stage.  What we have with a Private Members' Bill from Opposition or Government backbenchers is a Bill that can be written on Monday or Tuesday, published on Wednesday, tabled for debate on Thursday and complete Second Stage the following week.

I refer to his statement to the effect that he encourages all parties to keep in mind the cost of tribunals.  That is okay with me.  However, we have to look at the reasons for some of the tribunals.  The total failure of the State to deal with particular problems is the reason for some of them.  Some of these have come from whistleblowers and the Taoiseach has been very supportive of them.  By all means control the cost of tribunals but someone needs to examine the functions of Government and bring about the reforms that are necessary whereby we can learn from our mistakes.  I refer to where we attempt to put in place processes and procedures that eliminate such mistakes as much as is possible.  There will always be mistakes.  As long as we have humans, we are going to have mistakes.  However, at least minimise them.  It is almost depressing to see, every single week, the Committee of Public Accounts or this committee dealing with some failure of the State that has happened in some other guise down through the years.  It just trundles on relentlessly.  There is no change.  There is the usual spoof from some Departments in respect of their responses to particular issues but no real gain for the State out of it.  I ask the Taoiseach to look at that as well.<\/p> <p>  In that context, I want to come to the work of this committee.  Permanent TSB and AIB are proposing to sell a huge tranche of mortgages.  The Permanent TSB sale involves home loans, split mortgages and all sorts of things.  AIB is centred on businesses, including small businesses, farms and that kind of thing.  Something has to be done about that.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to find a mechanism to prevent these fire sales to vulture funds because they will create massive social problems in the future relative to housing and families.  I have seen, at first hand through the courts, the type of trauma and difficulties caused.  I am not talking about those who will not pay or have it and will not pay.  I am talking about those who are caught in a bind with the banks.<\/p> <p>  The banks will say that they work with the customers.  They do not; at lease not effectively.  There is one bank that certainly has drilled down, worked with every single customer and has said it will not sell to vulture funds.  That is Bank of Ireland.  However, the others seem to be preparing a sale which I believe the Government should stop.  I am making that point because, while we deal with the banks here, the vulture funds have refused to come before us.  They are not regulated.  The agents that are regulated, who are as bad as the vulture funds, will not come before us either.  They will not participate in the democratic process of being transparent and honest with the people we represent.  It is deeply frustrating and annoying to see these people, who are in difficulty and cannot sort out their problems, coming to us while the vulture funds are giving us the two fingers.  They will not come near us.  It is not right.<\/p> <p>  The national housing co-operative and fair mortgage bill is with the Ceann Comhairle's office and the Bill's Office at the moment.  Mr. Edmund Honohan has been highlighting it.  Again, this is an issue in respect of which the Taoiseach and the Cabinet, for example, could take an initiative whereby ethical funds - and they are there - rather than the vultures would be the preferred buyers of these loans.  There is no place for vulture funds in Ireland now.  It is a point I am bringing to the Taoiseach's attention.  If he wants to comment on it, fair enough.  I ask him to consider it.  Perhaps he could send some message to the vulture funds and their agents that this is where they are made accountable and this is where they should come.  A strong word from the Taoiseach would certainly change the mindset of these people who are blackguarding innocent individuals throughout the country.  They are refusing to deal with those to whom I refer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#M02200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1201,"content":"<p>People and bodies corporate invited to testify before the Oireachtas should do so.

I am not up to date on the engagement between the Deputy and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohue.  I believe we are making progress towards enacting that legislation.  That may change the market and change the picture.  I agree with the Chairman that we need to make a big distinction between people who can pay and will not and those who will never be able to pay.

There are examples of solutions that are being held up by the system itself.<\/p> <p>  The Taoiseach talked about health.  FreeStyle Libre is a treatment for diabetes.  A second treatment is Vimizim.  Is there no resolution to what are now long-standing issues in terms of new treatments the Department of Health can bring forward?  The Taoiseach mentioned the cost of the various health services and the new remedies and treatments in his opening statement.  I am bringing to his attention the fact that those are issues that affect the lives of young people and I would like to see a resolution in those areas.<\/p> <p>  On social housing, we have county councils all over the country that have established their housing lists.  In Kilkenny, if one counts everything it is 3,500.  They were the housing authorities of the past and they are now working as housing authorities, and in conjunction with the voluntary sector, but there is such a blockage there that it is another area where reform is necessary.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that it is the fact that councils are not doing the work that they should be doing, in conjunction with the Department and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, that is causing some of the logjam.  One is faced with a further question about reform in the system in order to deliver what citizens are looking for.  It is amazing to think that in the 1950s and 1960s massive amounts of local authority houses were built.  Wonderful communities were created and large families were reared yet here we are now, with much more than we ever had in the 1950s and 1960s, and the numbers cannot be delivered.  I suggest again that it is because of the bureaucratic nightmare that exists all around those issues now and having to have many things cleared by the Departments.  I am asking the Taoiseach those questions in terms of reform but also the future of the confidence and supply agreement.  Would he like to comment on that?  Does he have any views on that?

The Central Statistics Office, CSO, is responsible for the collection, processing and publication of official statistics on economic, social and general conditions in Ireland.  Alongside satisfying the statistical requirements of the Government, the information published by the CSO is also used by an extensive variety of public bodies, businesses, universities, research institutes and the general public.<\/p> <p>  There is a significant international dimension to the work of the CSO.  The EU institutions, the IMF, the OECD and other international bodies are all important users of official statistics.  Those bodies also have a significant role in defining and monitoring standards for the compilation of comparable information; and the CSO subscribes to the standards set out in the UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics and the European statistics code of practice.<\/p> <p>  The net allocation for 2018 is &euro;48.746 million which compares with &euro;48,584 million in 2017.  The allocation provides funding for core outputs and for some additional work including preparatory work for the 2021 census of population.<\/p> <p>  The CSO is also implementing a long-term programme of change in how it organises household surveys so that it can meet future information needs as efficiently as possible.  The first public output in this regard, the labour force survey quarter 3 of 2017, was published on 16 January 2018.<\/p> <p>  During 2018 the CSO will publish about 300 releases and publications.  All of these statistics are published online.  Members of the public are increasingly aware of, and able to access, statistics and indicators on the social, economic and environmental issues which affect their daily lives and the online channel is the office's primary publication method.<\/p> <p>  The CSO's Statement of Strategy 2017 to 2019 gives priority to delivering the core statistics needed for policy, while keeping a strong focus on cost management.  The office continues to meet all of its commitments under the public service reform programme and is implementing a programme of reform and continuous business process improvement in the collection and processing of statistics.  The report from the economic statistics review group convened by the CSO was published, along with the CSO's response, on 3 February 2017.  The recommendations in the group's report focus on how best to provide insight for users into domestic activity given the highly globalised Irish economy.  The CSO has been implementing the recommendations incrementally from mid-2017 and that will continue during 2018.<\/p> <p>  The CSO is leading the development of the Irish statistical system, ISS, by working closely with other Departments and the wider public sector that are involved in the collection, processing, compilation or dissemination of official statistics, to promote a more coherent approach to meeting data needs.  It has developed a code of practice for the Irish statistical system, under which the first body is expected to be certified very shortly.  It is also strongly promoting the development of a national data infrastructure, NDI, which will provide for better co-ordination and greater exploitation of the varied data sources available across the Irish public sector.  It will also lead to greater understanding of the importance of data in supporting policy and decision-making and delivering efficiencies in public service provision.<\/p> <p>  Making better use of data throughout the public sector is an important part of public service reform and will contribute to more evidence-informed decision-making and better measurement of policy outcomes.  Better co-ordination and greater use of administrative data also contributes to reducing the burden on data providers.  Since 2008, the CSO has continued to reduce the response burden of its non-agricultural business surveys, as measured through the response burden barometer.  A decrease of 38.6% was measured between 2008 and 2016, exceeding the target reduction of 25% over this timeframe.<\/p> <p>  The CSO Vote for 2018 provides for a total of 801 staff.  This represents an increase from 755 in 2017 and reflects the cyclical nature of the work of the office, in particular the census.  The CSO makes an important contribution to Ireland's public policy, by providing a high quality and, most important, an independent statistical service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#N01900","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1225,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, and his officials.

The CSO produces motor insurance premium changes on a monthly basis.  That is very useful in terms of informing public policy decisions and has fed into the cost of insurance working group and so on but we do not have comparable data for the cost of insurance, not just to businesses but to voluntary bodies, sporting clubs and community organisations.  It is an area I would like the CSO to examine to ascertain whether it could start compiling statistics on the cost of insurance.  It may well compile such data on an aggregate basis but I mean in a way whereby it could be broken down in order that we could see the anecdotal evidence we are hearing from businesses about public liability and employment liability.  Is that coming through by way of the overall statistics?  I do not expect an answer here and now from the Minister of State but if the CSO could examine that to see if it was possible to start compiling and reporting that on a monthly basis, it would be very useful in terms of public policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#O00700","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1233,"content":"<p>That will be relayed back to the officials in the CSO.  Something that was emphasised by officials in the CSO at my very first meeting was the independent nature of it but that does not preclude people from making observations or meeting CSO officials.  If people have ideas, there is an openness within the CSO in that regard.  A Private Members' motion was tabled that looked at conduits through the Oireachtas but having learned a good deal about it and looking at the way the CSO works, that independence is critical.  However, there are opportunities to meet with stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#O00800","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1234,"content":"<p>The CSO might send a note to the committee on that particular issue to see if it can be examined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#O00900","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1235,"content":"<p>Yes.
