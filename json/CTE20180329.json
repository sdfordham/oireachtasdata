We will deal with matters arising as we discuss the work programme.<\/p> <p>  We will now deal with correspondence received.  First, we will deal with category A, briefing documents and opening statements in respect of today's meetings.  Correspondence No. 1206A was received from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General, Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  This is her opening statement.  We will note and publish that.  Correspondence No. 1117 is the briefing document also from Ms Licken which we received.  We will note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  We now move to correspondence from category B, which is correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers and follow-up to PAC meetings and other items for publication.  The first is No. 1185B from Mr. Neil McDermott, System Funding, The Higher Education Authority, providing an update in relation to St. Angela's College Sligo Limited and its incorporation with NUI Galway.  We will note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  No. 1186B is from Professor Brian Norton, president, Dublin Institute of Technology, dated 20 March 2018.  The item provides details requested by the committee on &euro;3.16 million of non-compliant procurement which came to light when we were looking at DIT's annual accounts.  If nobody has any question on that we can note it and move on.  We will note that.<\/p> <p>  No. 1192B is from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, dated 22 March 2018.

A note is included on EU rulings in relation to landfill sites and an update on the number of landfill sites and their remediation status.  It has been several months since the information was requested.  We will put the information up on the screen.  A document was to be attached.  Did we get an attachment?  Perhaps I missed it.

There will be only two landfill sites available from next year in addition to the incinerator.  Waste is also shipped abroad.  It seems there is not serious control on this whole area.  There is control over unlicensed landfill sites but quite a lot of public money is likely to come into play in terms of landfill sites that might be in private hands where money needs to be recouped, as in the case where the site then went out of business.  Is that an area that could require particular attention?

It charged fees so it recovered its own costs and therefore there is not an Exchequer funding for it.<\/p> <p>  There is a limit to the extent I can get involved in that, but it is something we encourage the relevant Departments to look at in terms of the potential costs, the contingent liabilities, that are associated with cleaning up illegal sites or sites that need remediation.  One way of accessing it from the committee's point of view is the environment fund, which is a fund under the current Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I think the account for 2016 was presented relatively recently so it could be something for the committee to examine.

It is taxpayers' money and public money.  In autumn we found an illegal site with 70,000 tonnes, which will take 15 months to remediate at a cost of &euro;6 million.  There is a wider issue here.  We have heard the warnings about people just putting waste outside for it to be collected and thinking there is no consequence to these unregulated illegal collections.  The consequence is &euro;6 million of public money being spent to remediate illegal sites.

Mr. Watt said he will consider this and on page 2 of his letter, he states, \"The committee may wish to note that my Department intends to initiate a review of Department of Finance [25\/2000] Official Entertainment Circular\".  He intends to do that this year.  He enclosed a copy of the circular that was issued 18 years ago, in 2000.  We need a new circular on hospitality and entertainment where it involves taxpayers' money directly.  We will acknowledge it and write back and ask if there is a timetable for the new circular and ask that we be provided with a copy as soon as it is ready.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#C00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>The letter quotes all sorts of bits and pieces but it does not deal with the elephant in the room.

Will there be action taken against the college?  There is no way any existing circular, however much it is in need of being replaced by a new circular, sanctioned &euro;13,000 for a bash with ice sculptures and so on no matter how important the person.  He is not really telling us anything.  There are three pages here that can be summed up in one sentence, namely, \"We do not have adequate measures in place, we plan to have adequate measures in place and we will let you know at some stage.\"  The key point is there is still no sanction.  Is someone divvying up this &euro;13,000 in Cork?  That is the issue.  It is the issue with everything we do in here.  When we identify things, it is not our role to determine what a sanction might be, as the Chairman said at the report launch yesterday.  What are we doing it for?  Is it just to highlight stuff, give copies to the media and then nothing happens?

Sometimes there are changes and the Comptroller and Auditor General will alert us to positive changes in accounting practices and how accounts are presented and so on.  In terms of wrongdoing, there is no sanction whatsoever and it is a slap on the wrist or a shrug of the shoulders from the Accounting Officer.  This letter is exactly that.

My instinct is our main challenge would be to the board of directors or governance of any State body.  Our sanctions should not involve any cuts to services down the line, whether it is in the HSE, health, social or education sector.  Our sanctions should be directed at board level because they are the people who are responsible for running the organisations.  Our sanctions should be directed at that level.  They are the people responsible for corporate governance, not the staff down the line.  That is a thought.  We will come back to it on another day.

The level of hospitality spending in organisations is generally a function of the culture.  It may not be a lot of money in itself but it tells one a little bit about how governance is managed in an organisation.  We examine expenditure on hospitality as part of a set of propriety tests we do every year.  That process in itself acts as a control over the level of spending.  However, sometimes we find something that looks to us to be excessive and in a situation like that we push for publication.  With the revision of the code of practice, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has required organisations to publish where there is any significant level of hospitality.<\/p> <p>  They have got to declare what the spend has been.  Questions then can be asked here by the committee or others who look at the financial statements, because it can clearly be seen what the level of spending is and justification can be sought.  While there is not a provision for a direct sanction, the fact that the committee takes it seriously and regularly raises it has an effect of adding to that control that is exercised.  Most public sector organisations are very careful about not spending in an extravagant way because this committee and our office are interested in it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I disagree, respectfully, with that.

Are benchmarks set initially and then checked to see if they have been met?  Has there been any comparison with the post-project reviews in this State and how they are carried out internationally?  It is all very well to have post-project reviews but if they are internal, they may do what we want them to do or they may not; we do not know because we have not seen them before.

Some people ask what actually happens as a result of our meeting.  We had the meeting here last year.  As long as any of us have been here, we have never seen a post-project review of a public private partnership project.  It has not happened.  We had quite a stand-off here last week when we threatened to close down the meeting and went into private session to discuss it.  We came back and said that we were not happy.  It was said in the meeting that they would be produced.<\/p><p>In response to the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendation in his report last year, a commitment was given that the post-project reviews would be published and it was being worked on.  Six months elapsed and the Department was here last Thursday.  We asked when was that going to happen.  As a result, a circular, dated 26 March, has been issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to all Departments since our meeting last Thursday.  We have had an instant success on this.  I said I wanted to hold over the circular.  It is only a page and a half.  There are two paragraphs I want to read, where the Secretary General refers to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report last year.  He states &quot;The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform also accepted the recommendation that such post project reviews should be published, and indicated that a requirement to this effect (subject to redaction of any commercially sensitive information) will be included in a revision of the Public Spending Code which is currently underway and in revised PPP guidance to be issued in the near future.<\/p><p>Paragraph No. 5 of this circular, which has been issued to all heads of Departments and Government offices, states: <\/p><blockquote>However, in advance of completion of the updated Public Spending Code and PPP Guidance, I wish to advise all Departments and Offices that this policy on publication of post project reviews for all public investment projects, including PPPs, is now being implemented with immediate effect.  Accordingly, any post project reviews undertaken from this date should be published at the earliest possible opportunity, following completion.<\/blockquote> <p>That is a complete success for the Committee of Public Accounts here last Thursday.  We are achieving something in respect of the publication of these reports that has never happened.  As a result of last Thursday's meeting, the circular was issued within a matter of days stating such reports should be published and to get on with it.  They are to be published at the earliest opportunity.<\/p><p>We look forward to receiving them.  I want to note this is an example of the Committee of Public Accounts achieving something that is across the entire public sector.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has been calling for it year in, year out and the meeting last week has brought about this positive result.  We will wait to see it happening, but a circular has gone out and that is a positive result.  It is an achievement as a result of people appearing before the committee.  We welcome the note and look forward to seeing the reports.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1205B is from Mr. Michael Nolan, CEO of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, providing follow up to our meeting on 8 March 2018 on motorway maintenance contracts.  We note and publish it.  People will find it interesting and should work on it as they see fit.<\/p><p> Correspondence category C is from private individuals and any other correspondence.  Correspondence No. 1162C was held over from last week.  This item is from Mr. Tadhg Daly, CEO of Nursing Homes Ireland, dated 6 March 2018, on the cost of care in HSE nursing homes.  We agreed to discuss this as part of the work programme, which we deferred last week.  We will discuss the work programme in a few minutes.  The correspondence is noted.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1176C was held over from last week and is from an individual alleging that a number of Departments are misclassifying employees as self-employed in order for some employers to evade PRSI obligations.  This is a large document and at first glance it appears to be related to a matter considered by the committee in some depth before.  I propose in the first instance that we write back to the individual to request a summary of which Departments are involved and to specify how the misclassification is being done.  It is an extensive document and we will ask for the person's assistance because he or she must have quite a bit of knowledge, so we can narrow the focus and then deal with it.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1188C is anonymous correspondence regarding alleged misuse of public moneys in relation to the children's hospital in Crumlin.  There is no evidence presented so we will just note the document.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1189C is from an individual in relation to the racing industry.  He is calling for an investigation into the industry to ensure that it is tax compliant and employees are treated fairly.  It is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners to ensure all businesses are tax compliant and if employees are treated unfairly they have recourse to the mechanisms of the Workplace Relations Commission.  I propose that we note the item and our consideration of the matter is closed.  The tax affairs of employees in an individual sector is not something we can specifically get into.  Perhaps we will forward the letter to the Revenue Commissioners for their attention and with regard to any action they deem appropriate.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1193C is from an individual, dated 22 March 2018, in relation to the wards of court funds.  We forwarded correspondence from the Courts Service to the individual.  I propose we note the correspondence for now.  We dealt with this last week and the correspondent is not happy with the response that was considered here at the meeting last week.  We have sent the documentation and I know this matter will come up again.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1195C, dated 21 March 2018, is from a specific individual in relation to the non-payment of 2017 farm grants for the GLAS and organic schemes.  I propose, with the individual's permission, that we forward the item to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for its attention and request to be updated on how the case is being addressed.  We will forward it directly to the Department and ask it to keep us informed.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1196C is an anonymous piece of correspondence in relation to Inland Fisheries Ireland.  We have had similar issues raised with us and we received a response from Inland Fisheries Ireland.  I propose we note this correspondence.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1197C is from Professor Patrick O'Shea, the president of University College Cork, dated 23 March 2018, providing information as requested by the committee on UCC's partnership with Cork Opera House.  Deputy Kelly raised this matter and we will hold it over to our next meeting because he is not here today.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1198C from Ms Catherine Colman, from the estimates section in the finance division of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, dated 23 March 2018, enclosing an information note on swimming pools.

This is the first time it has really been opened up since.  It is there in theory, but I wonder about the good use of public money.  It has to be there in practice, but the amount of grant aid is not sufficient to build a swimming pool.  It requires matching funds.  Swimming pools do not make money; they are expensive to run and the energy efficiency side of it is very important from this point of view.  Many of the pools do not materialise, and it strikes me it is a terrible waste of money to give the impression a scheme is available but we do not actually see new swimming pools emerging in some cases, or it takes years for them to be built because they must find the matching funding.  I absolutely support the need, but I question the value of this approach because if the local authority will not put up matching funding then we will not get the swimming pool.  There is a constant round of disappointment because there are announcements without follow through.  Areas most affected by this are those which do not have facilities to begin with that can be expanded on, such as my area and the areas of the Chairman and Deputy Cassells, which are growing areas.  If we are going to look at some of these initiatives, can we look at them from the point of view of whether what is being proposed is viable, or is this something that really should be looked at from another committee's perspective?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#E00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>The Deputy is talking about the viability of future projects and the line Department is the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.

It is an unfortunate reality that the viability of these projects is called into question.  I have a legacy community based swimming pool in an affluent suburb, which has required consistent and continuous funding from local government and national Government to keep it going, and now we are proposing to put pools into communities which, quite frankly, really require them because there are no private facilities that offer the same service at a reasonable cost.  However, the ongoing maintenance and the energy and environmental side of things have to be taken into consideration.  I am all for these projects, but the reality from the perspective of the Committee of Public Accounts is we are spending huge amounts of money on projects and there are no criteria that I can see in terms of a capacity of a community to support it or a capacity of a community to have a sufficient number of residents within a reasonable distance to access the facility.  I question the viability of continuing funding for projects such as these based on good value for money and taxpayers' money being put into projects.<\/p> <p>  Of course, I am all for these projects, but we really need an injection of reality into the conversation as to whether they can be funded.  If we look at other community facilities that have been built, there is one, for instance, in Donabate which required &euro;600,000 of taxpayers' money to keep it from going under a few years back, and that was before the crash I might point out.  There are some serious questions that have to be asked as to whether the State can afford to run these projects and whether we might be better looking at public private partnership as an option to keep them running.  This is not an ideological thing, it just relates to whether or not it is possible to afford these things.  It is something I would certainly like to weigh in on, and I accept it would be a matter, in terms of policy direction, for the line committee and the Minister to look at, but we as a body have a responsibility to look at whether it represents good value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#E00400","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I suspect there would be no money in it for public private partnerships so I do not expect that is a likely route.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#E00500","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>It is just a suggestion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#E00600","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>There have been instances where there was public funding for a number of pools in the same location.

We might as well not have a national standard if we do not have the means and do not recognise that we need to provide sufficient money because carrying a debt in a situation that is very finely tuned means that we are into a difficulty from day one.

Dr. O'Connor provides a breakdown of consultancy and legal fees and copies of minutes from board meetings where key decisions were made relating to the merger with Institute of Technology Tralee.  An explanation for the higher costs and effects on student services is provided.  Can we note and publish this documentation?

I know that in the case of Waterford and Carlow, they are way behind the Munster one, for example.

It talks about corporate procurement plans and the national public procurement policy framework introduced in 2005.  Then there is a voluntary code of practice.  It goes back to what we said last week.  All this seems to be on a voluntary basis, not on a statutory basis.  There are guidelines, but that is all they are.

The committee and the HEA feel it is necessary, and that is where it rests.  Notwithstanding that, this university has not even given the accounts parallel with its own accounts.  The issue of foundations and who controls what is huge.  When NUI Galway, NUIG, appeared before us, it very proudly told the committee it had no control over it, so therefore there was no need to do this.  Again, that office is on the campus site.  It does not pay rent or anything.  In fact, the question of why it would pay rent was laughed at.  <\/p> <p>  There is a huge blurring of boundaries here that is not under scrutiny.  That is of extreme concern to me.  If the university does not control the foundation, it begs questions as to whether the foundation controls the university, the direction in which it is going or the nature of the buildings.  Notwithstanding that very good things could come out of a foundation, it has to be done in an open and accountable way.  In my view, that has not been done.  If the president of a university says the university has no control over it and yet the president and the bursar of that university sits on its board, then there are serious issues.  If there is a separate board in America, for example, with the president on that board as well, there are questions that have to be asked if we are to hold a system to account and achieve value for money, in particular when it came across repeatedly that more and more money was coming from the foundations, so the universities were not happy to have them scrutinised.  The universities maintained that the foundations were entirely separate.  They did not recognise that the universities are what they are because of public money.  For the record, it is something I will be keeping a close eye on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#G01700","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy want the committee to include that issue in the letter to UCC and for it to give us its rationale?

We have the NTMA, National Treasury Management Agency, listed on 21 June to deal with its accounts and financial statements.

Under the new licence they are supposed to be used for the promotion of the national lottery and special draws, but there is no oversight of that.  That is the role of regulator.  The regulator has written to PLI asking for the figure and was told by PLI that it does not have to give the figure.  I raised it last week with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and he is refusing to state what the figure is or what oversight there is in terms of the role of regulator in ensuring that unclaimed prize money is being used as it is supposed to be used under the licence.

I do not think the latter is the appropriate body to manage this fund.  We now have a State Claims Agency that manages these types of funds.  We will include discussion of this issue in the work programme.  Long-term, we should not have a particular body managing the wards of court fund given the expertise in the NTMA to manage it, which we are told is the best in the world.

As per the schedule, we are due to meet the Tax Appeals Commission on Thursday, 28 June at 9 a.m. and the Revenue Commissioners in the afternoon.  I am suggesting that we ask those agencies to attend the meeting with the Department of Finance on 19 April.  We had already decided that we could deal with the Tax Appeals Commission in a two-hour meeting in any event and we have already had some discussion with the Revenue Commissioners on corporation tax so I think we would be able to move quickly through the second half of Revenue Commissioners' business.  The issues for discussion with the Department of Finance include Government debt, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council are routine items to note.  We will try to combine our discussions with the Department of Finance, the Tax Appeals Commission and the Revenue Commissioners to one meeting on 19 April in an effort to free-up space for other hearings.  We will communicate with the Department of Finance, the Tax Appeals Commission and the Revenue Commissioners in this regard.  There is no point in our meeting only with the Department of Finance and concluding our business with it by lunch time if we can complete the work with the other organisations in the afternoon.

This was distributed across five expenditure programmes, as indicated in the figure on screen.  The largest programme was in relation to arts, culture and film, accounting for expenditure of just under &euro;174 million or 47% of the total for the year.  This included grants of &euro;60 million to the Arts Council and &euro;15.6 million to the Irish Film Board.  Funding of almost &euro;42 million was provided towards the general expenses of State museums and art galleries, with &euro;21 million spent on cultural activities, including funding of &euro;5.5 million provided to Culture Ireland.  A total of &euro;28.4 million was spent in 2016 on the programme for the Decade of Centenaries 1912 &ndash; 1922.<\/p> <p>  Chaith an Roinn &euro;53.3 milli&uacute;n ar a cl&aacute;r ar son na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus na nOile&aacute;n.

Waterways Ireland received &euro;26.6 million from Vote 33, while the Language Body received &euro;13.2 million.  I audit these and five other cross-Border bodies jointly with my counterpart in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The final programme funded under Vote 33 in 2016 related to regional development and rural affairs.  Responsibility for the programme transferred into Vote 33 as part of the restructuring of portfolios following Government formation in June 2016.  Under a further reconfiguration in July 2017, responsibility for regional development and rural affairs transferred again to the newly formed Department of Rural and Community Affairs.  Vote 33 was then renamed \"culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht\".<\/p> <p>  While responsibility for the programme was transferred into the Vote only at mid-year, the account presents the full-year Estimate and outturn for the programme in line with transfer of responsibility rules.  As shown in the account, expenditure under the rural development programme in 2016 amounted to &euro;51.7 million.  The largest elements of expenditure were just under &euro;25 million spent on national rural development schemes, &euro;10 million spent on the Leader rural economy programme and &euro;9.9 million spent on town and village regeneration.  For comparison purposes, note 6.7 showing the change from year to year has been provided.  It is not on the face of the appropriation accounts.  I have also provided a diagram for members, which aims to summarise the public bodies within the Department's aegis.  Members should note that the Western Development Commission has been under the aegis of the Department of Rural and Community Development since 2017.<\/p> <p>  I have given a clear audit opinion on the appropriation account.  However, I draw attention in the audit report to non-compliant procurement disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control and to chapters 7 and 15 of my report on the accounts of the public services for 2016.  Chapter 7 refers to the dormant account fund which was examined by the committee on 8 February.  As noted then, oversight of that fund is now the responsibility of the Department of Rural and Community Development.<\/p> <p>  Turning now to the chapter, the report before the committee this morning concerns the administration and management of the provision of &euro;8.4 million in public funds over many years to assist in the development of an art house cinema in Galway city.  The largest funding contributions came from the Department, with a final contribution of &euro;3.5 million, while Galway City Council contributed &euro;2.4 million and the Irish Film Board contributed &euro;1.1 million.<\/p> <p>  In 2006, the Department launched the second arts and culture capital enhancement support scheme, which is generally referred to as ACCESS II.  The aim of the scheme was to provide cultural and arts organisations with funding to build new cultural infrastructure and develop existing facilities.  A private company called Solas\/Galway Picture Palace Teoranta applied for funding in 2006 under the ACCESS II scheme to establish a specialist art house cinema in Galway city.  By May 2007, the total committed or projected public investment for the project amounted to &euro;6.3 million, including a &euro;2 million ACCESS ll grant.  In 2008, Galway City Council purchased a site for just under &euro;2 million and made it available to Solas under a 99 year lease.  Solas applied for and received planning permission for a 360 seat cinema complex, which represented a 30% increase in capacity relative to the original proposal.<\/p> <p>  In July 2009, following a tender competition, Solas awarded a contract for the construction of the cinema and the project commenced in the months that followed.  The project experienced significant difficulties and by June 2010, it became evident that an adjoining property was physically at risk and the work was stopped.  Following negotiations, Solas agreed to demolish and rebuild the adjoining property in October 2010.  In March 2011, the Department received notification from Solas that the building contractor was terminating the contract, citing poor ground conditions and design inadequacies.<\/p> <p>  A second construction contract was awarded by Solas in March 2012 for the remaining works.  The Department stated this was done without its knowledge or consent.  The first phase of the works covered by the second contract finished in early 2014.  No further construction or fit-out followed until, in July 2016, agreement was reached for a private investor to be granted a 30 year lease to manage and operate the cinema in return for a contribution of funds.  In July 2017, Solas entered liquidation.  I understand the cinema has been recently completed and has now commenced operations, albeit some nine years later than originally planned.<\/p> <p>  While the project was developed by a private entity with grant and other funding assistance from public funds, in practice, the State bore the project and financial risks.  There was no overall oversight arrangement in place for this project at the outset, despite the planned involvement of a variety of public agencies in funding it.  When Solas ran into difficulties, Galway City Council stepped in to take over responsibility for the project and charges on the property were registered to safeguard the State's interests.  I thank the Acting Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":207,"content":"<p>We should give the Comptroller and Auditor General a gold star for his use of Connemara Irish.

I am very pleased to have this opportunity to address the committee at what I believe is a very significant period in time for the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.<\/p> <p>  The recently announced Project Ireland 2040 sets out a roadmap for delivering on key strategic outcomes for the country, including strengthening rural economies and communities, and enhancing amenity and heritage in both urban and rural settings.  The Department will play a critical role in delivering on these strategic outcomes.<\/p> <p>  As part of Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan provides for significant and much-needed investment in our cultural infrastructure throughout the country making sure that opportunities to participate in arts and culture are available wherever one lives, not just in the cities.  It is also clear on our responsibility to protect our built and natural heritage and to enhance our visitor facilities so that more people from Ireland and abroad can experience our unique heritage tourism assets.<\/p> <p>  The sectors the Department represents are diverse and far reaching, and it is vital that we ensure the investment will be spread across all three of the Department&rsquo;s divisions - culture, heritage and Gaeltacht - so that all of the Department&rsquo;s stakeholders will see investment in their area over the lifetime of the plan. <\/p> <p>  The significant scale of the investment proposed over the ten years &ndash; approximately &euro;1.2 billion &ndash; means that it is critical that the Department develop the required capacity to deliver on the full extent of the proposed investment in the most efficient and cost-effective manner, delivering for our stakeholders across society while at the same time ensuring value for money for the Irish taxpayer.  All of the proposed investment will be underpinned by robust evaluation and appraisal methodologies, complying with the public spending code and ensuring that all investments deliver demonstrable benefits to citizens, communities and businesses across Ireland. <\/p> <p>  As Accounting Officer for the Department, I am determined to learn from any issues that have arisen in the past with a view to ensuring this programme of investment and existing programmes of investment provide the optimum value for money to the benefit of all taxpayers and communities we serve.  The Comptroller and Auditor General and this committee have an important role to play in identifying issues and in challenging and supporting the Department in addressing issues as they arise.  This is in addition to the controls and processes that are already in place within the Department.  We have worked very constructively in recent years with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, seeking its advice and input where issues arise, and taking on board its recommendations for improvements in how we govern expenditure and the management of risk within the Department. <\/p> <p>  With regard to my appearance here today, the briefing note provided to the committee outlines: the key achievements of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in 2016 by programme area; and the programme priorities of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for 2017-18 and the future.  The briefing note also provides some detail on the Galway art house cinema project which is the subject of Chapter 15 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 2016 and which opened to the public last week. <\/p> <p>  The committee will be aware that in June 2016, as part of the restructuring of Departments announced by the Taoiseach, a new Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was established.  It essentially brought together all of the functions from the then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, together with regional development and rural related functions from the then Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.<\/p> <p>  Responsibility for the regional and rural affairs functions, along with certain community functions that were previously dealt with by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, formally transferred to the new Department of Rural and Community Development with effect from 27 July 2017.  The Department was renamed the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht with effect from 1 August 2017.<\/p> <p>  The year 2016 was a very significant one for the Department as we celebrated the centenary of the Easter Rising of 1916.  The Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme was a whole-of-Government initiative, led by the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to provide the nation with the opportunity to remember and reflect on this pivotal event in our history.<\/p> <p>  There was an extensive and diverse programme of State ceremonial and public events.  An array of community-led projects was delivered throughout the country in conjunction with local authorities.  An extensive education programme was delivered across all levels, and a number of significant capital projects were completed under the permanent reminders component of the programme, including the GPO Witness History Centre, Richmond Barracks, the Kevin Barry rooms at the National Concert Hall and Ionad Cult&uacute;rtha an Phiarsaigh in Rosmuc. <\/p> <p>  As the Irish language was central to the 1916 ideal of an independent sovereign Ireland, the language was interwoven throughout the programme of events, while a distinctive range of events and activities through Irish was delivered as part of An Teanga Bheo &ndash; the living language strand of the programme.  The entire programme was underpinned by five intersecting and overlapping themes: remembering, reconciling, presenting, imagining and celebrating.<\/p> <p>  The response to the programme was a year of extraordinary participation, by all walks of life, across all of the components, ranging from concerts and exhibitions at our national cultural institutions, to schools&rsquo; activities, flag-raising ceremonies, events to remember the role of women in 1916 and, indeed, to remember the children who lost their lives during the Rising and a whole range of other shared community, historical and cultural events.  This remarkable level of participation was in many ways epitomised by the crowds of more than one million people on the streets of Dublin on Easter weekend 2016. <\/p> <p>  In December 2016 Creative Ireland was launched as the Government&rsquo;s legacy programme from the Ireland 2016 initiative and as the main implementation vehicle for the ambition set out in Culture 2025 - &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach, Ireland&rsquo;s first national cultural policy developed on foot of an extensive consultation process with stakeholders throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s proposed programme of investment under Project Ireland 2040 prioritises strategic and sustainable projects that demonstrate clear public benefits as committed to under the Cl&aacute;r &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach, the Creative Ireland programme, and goes beyond this to deliver much-needed investment in our national parks, monuments, built and natural heritage, language and islands. <\/p> <p>  Ensuring that we take the lessons from the past as we move towards a 10 year investment programme in culture and heritage is critically important and I therefore welcome the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General as outlined in Chapter 15 of the 2016 report.  That chapter examined the administration and management of the Galway art house cinema project, including funding and payments made by the Department and other public bodies related to the new cinema.  There were two recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General on foot of this detailed examination, both of which I have accepted in full in my capacity as Accounting Officer for the Department. <\/p> <p>  The first recommendation was that the Department should review its approach to the projects that are being grant aided, in particular where the key project risks are carried by the State.  Where projects do not progress as expected or serious shortcomings are identified with the project sponsor, early action needs to be taken, including formal reviews of the project viability, in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s public spending code requirements. <\/p> <p>  I can assure the committee that the Department is fully committed to ensuring that all projects are effectively managed in accordance with the public spending code and relevant grant circulars.  Measures are in place to ensure that staff are appropriately trained and supported in the appraisal and oversight of grant-aided projects as part of the Department&rsquo;s annual quality assurance process, and the Department held a number of training sessions around the appraisal and management of capital projects in 2016 and, as promised to the Comptroller and Auditor General, in 2017, and as recently as March 2018. <\/p> <p>  The second recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General was that particular care should be exercised by lead funders to ensure adequate formal oversight mechanisms are in place and operated where a variety of funding agencies are involved. <\/p> <p>  Once again, I reiterate my commitment as Accounting Officer to ensure that all projects are managed in accordance with the provisions of the public spending code and relevant circulars.  The training provided to staff in the past two years has emphasised the importance of the early establishment of performance metrics to be used as a signal for action during the implementation phase, the need for regular management reports to be provided and reviewed, and how best to deal with project challenges. <\/p> <p>  In addition, I wish to advise the committee that the Department is participating in an organisational capability review, to be conducted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform later this year.  The purpose of these reviews, which are being rolled out across all Departments under the Civil Service renewal programme, are to embed a culture of regular and objective assessments of the capacity and capability of the Department to achieve its objectives.  While only a small number of Departments or agencies have been reviewed to date, I had actively sought to have an early review of this Department, and I believe this will prepare us well to deal with the challenges that lie ahead as we move towards implementation of a ten-year capital investment programme.<\/p><p> I am establishing an advisory group within the Department to contribute to both the preparatory work and the delivery phases of the review, which is due to commence in the second half of 2018, and will ensure that the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts will be taken into account in the review process.  I am confident that this review will facilitate the Department in building the required capacity for the effective evaluation, appraisal and management of capital projects.  It will identify the skills, structures, processes and personnel needed on top of what we already have, and determine whether such structures need to be put in place to deliver effectively for all our stakeholders, which include the taxpayer.  I am happy to expand on any of these areas, or explore any other areas as the committee wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Katherine Licken","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I thank the witness for that comprehensive opening statement.

I cannot think of a more inappropriate name in light of the history of this.  I have to declare that I was on the council for a period of time and this is a difficult topic.  Despite the word \"Solas\", there was an absence of light in the way this was handled.  I will ask a few quick questions on it.  As a councillor, I, along with a number of other councillors, struggled to ask questions about this.  I will be coming back to this later in regard to Foras na Gaeilge and other projects.  This is a small country, with small cities.  Very often asking questions is not rewarded, which is what we have seen here at the Committee of Public Accounts.  However, it is extremely important to ask questions.<\/p> <p>  In regard to art, which I will come back to, there is a perception that one is a philistine if one questions it.

The figure of &euro;593,000 was to be paid for the first 15 years and for the next 15 years &euro;63,000 a year would be taken off that for refurbishment costs at four quarterly repayments.

To me it looks like a calamity of errors from 2006 to 2018.  I will not go over it all again because the witnesses have answered enough questions on it.  I cannot understand how that could have happened given that professional people were brought in and four site investigations were carried out with architects and engineers.  Ground conditions seem to have been the problem.  There was water logging.  Ground works were carried out and then a neighbouring property was damaged and that had to be rebuilt.  To me, that is laughable.  Professional people were involved who were supposed to have degrees and accreditation to carry out site visits and yet we see what happened.  That does not make sense.  It does not add up.  It is poor project management.  Who is paying for it?  The taxpayer.  A total of &euro;8.4 million was spent.  I will not say it has gone down the Swanee because at least we have a cinema there.  It took a private operator to come in and finish the project.  Questions must be asked all around.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for his analysis today and what was presented.  It shows that there was something seriously wrong.  Why are there not better systems in place to stop that happening?  It took 12 years for the project to come to a conclusion.

If there are two, the tender competitions potentially put one out of business for five years during the term of the contract.  Therefore, anything to do with island transport services is extremely emotive and gets island communities extremely exercised.  That does not detract from the fact that there are no exemptions for us from using public tendering procedures.  That can create a difficulty.  The other difficulty is that when one is dealing with a very small market, one has to leave the tender conditions and the conditions to be complied with as open as possible in order to encourage competition.  If we were to have specified that a vessel could not be older than ten years, for example, the likelihood is that we would have got no tenders for that service.  Where would we have been left then given our obligation to provide what is a lifeline service to the islands?  We have to take these points into account.

The committee has been supplied with a detailed briefing document on the various Votes.  I will briefly outline the work of my Department and its proposed 2018 Estimate, as well as outlining the proposed 2018 Estimate allocations for the President&rsquo;s Establishment, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  While I have certain responsibilities to the Oireachtas in respect of administrative matters in these offices, they operate independently of my Department.  My colleague, the Minister of State and Government Chief Whip, Deputy McHugh, will outline the 2018 Estimate allocation for the Central Statistics Office and will take any questions relevant to that Vote following the committee&rsquo;s consideration of the other Votes in my group.  I am joined by Mr. Martin Fraser, Secretary General of the Department, Ms Mary Keenan, head of corporate affairs, and Ms Geraldine Butler, finance officer.<\/p> <p>  The 2018 Revised Estimate for the President&rsquo;s Establishment is &euro;4.32 million.  This includes some &euro;3 million for pay and administration, with the balance to fund the centenarians&rsquo; bounty.  It is estimated that approximately 450 centenarians will receive the bounty in 2018.<\/p> <p>  The 2018 Revised Estimate for my Department is &euro;35.9 million, which includes &euro;24.9 million for administration costs.  Following the recent review of the work of the strategic communications unit, I am reducing the 2018 funding allocation by &euro;2.5 million to &euro;2.5 million, &euro;2.2 million of which has already been spent.  I am requesting, therefore, that the committee approve a 2018 Estimate for my Department of &euro;33.4 million, which is a 9% reduction on my Department&rsquo;s 2017 Revised Estimate.<\/p> <p>  I will now briefly outline for the committee the progress made by my Department on key priorities in 2017 and indicate where we are focusing our efforts in 2018 and beyond.  The primary role of my Department is to support me in my executive functions as Taoiseach, to support the Government and to oversee implementation of the programme for Government.  It also supports the four Ministers of State assigned to the Department in full or in part.  These are the Government Chief Whip; the Minister of State with responsibility for defence; the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs and the Minister of State with responsibility for data protection, who is also assigned to a number of other Departments, as I mentioned.  In addition to supporting my work as Taoiseach and that of the Government, the Department&rsquo;s strategic priorities are: a sustainable economy; a better and fairer society; strong relationships in Europe and in the world; Brexit; leading Government and ensuring it acts in a joined-up way in terms of policy implementation and communications.<\/p> <p>  The Department is also responsible for a range of other issues, such as State protocol, including commemorations, constitutional issues, relations with the office of the President, relations with the Oireachtas, Government press and communications, the National Economic and Social Council, the Creative Ireland programme, the Citizens' Assembly and the Dublin north-east inner city initiative.  The Department funds a number of inquiries from its Vote, including the Moriarty tribunal, the Cregan commission on Siteserv and other matters and the Cooke commission on Project Eagle.  An important part of my Department's work is providing a secretariat for meetings of the Government and of Cabinet committees.  The Government has established Cabinet committees on: the economy; social policy and public services; the European Union, including Brexit; infrastructure, which covers housing; health; national security; and justice issues.<\/p> <p>  Ireland continues to experience sustainable and balanced economic growth.  Employment continues to increase and now stands at 2.2 million working in the State.<\/p><p>Unemployment was down to 6% in February, the lowest since August 2008 and well below the euro area average.  The Government's focus now is on achieving full employment and ensuring that the jobs created are quality jobs.  By this I mean jobs that raise living standards and reward employees, not just in terms of salary but also with good working conditions, work-life balance and benefits, including adequate pension coverage on retirement.<\/p><p> That is why on 28 February, together with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, I launched a five-year roadmap for pension reform.  It outlines a range of reforms across the pension system which will ensure that it is sustainable in the face of an ageing population.  In particular, it includes the introduction of an auto-enrolment pension scheme for private sector workers, with first enrolments in 2022.<\/p><p> Earlier this month, the Action Plan for Jobs 2018 was launched.  This year's plan is a more strategic and streamlined document reflecting the key risks and opportunities facing the economy.  It outlines 55 actions to be delivered, with a target of creating approximately 50,000 additional jobs.  My Department will oversee implementation of the Action Plan for Jobs and the delivery of the Government's other economic priorities through its support for Cabinet committee A and its related senior officials' groups.<\/p><p> The Government is keen to ensure that every sector of society - as well as every region - feels the benefits of our recovering and growing economy.  We must continue to ensure policies and services not only protect the most vulnerable in society but provide opportunities equally for all citizens to learn, work and prosper irrespective of gender, race, social status or sexual orientation.  My Department supports the work of shaping and reforming key public services, especially those requiring a cross-Government response through Cabinet committee B.  On 20 March, Ireland's ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was deposited with the United Nations.  This is a significant landmark for Ireland and its commitment to people with disabilities who have waited more than ten years for successive Governments to deliver.<\/p><p> I have signalled my intention to advance a set of measures to improve gender equality.  These measures will promote wage transparency in businesses and correct the imbalance at board level, where only 17% of board members of Ireland's top-listed companies are female.  Last year, 52% of appointees to State boards were female.  The State is now in a position to tell business to do better.  The Government is looking at options to extend paid parental leave in the first year of a child's life. The Government is keen to make child care more affordable for parents.  The initial reforms put in place in 2017, including the universal subsidy for children between six months and three years, have ensured parents of 67,000 children have benefited from enhanced payments.  In 2018, the Government expects to make significant progress in terms of enacting the required legislation and supporting IT infrastructure to deliver the new affordable child care scheme.<\/p><p> I recently visited Dublin's north-east inner city - I have been there on several occasions - to witness, at first hand, the work under way to revitalise and support the local community.  Significant work is now being done by the programme implementation board established last June to oversee the implementation of actions recommended in the Mulvey report.  This involves a strong collaborative effort between the statutory, community and business sectors and is working effectively to date.  My Department continues to support the work of the board, which recently published its progress report for 2017.<\/p><p> Increased investment in the health service must happen in tandem with reform and productivity gains.  My Department oversees the health reform agenda through its support for Cabinet committee E and the related senior officials' group.  Budget 2018 provided a record allocation of funding for health, including &euro;55 million for the National Treatment Purchase Fund to reduce long waiting times for treatment.  Significant steps have been taken following the publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare report by the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, including a commitment to early engagement with general practitioner, GP, representatives on the reform of the GP contract to support primary care improvements.  A negotiating mandate in this regard was given to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, at Cabinet this week.  An independent group, under the chairmanship of Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir, to examine the impact of removing private practice from public hospitals is up and running and is expected to report later this year.  A recruitment process for an executive director of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme office has been undertaken.  The final interviews for that are being held this week.<\/p><p> The publication of the health service capacity review in January and the commitment of &euro;10.9 billion in the National Development Plan Project Ireland 2040 are significant in supporting necessary changes to models of care and to meet ever-increasing demand due to a rising population and the availability of new treatments.  A significant new hospital building programme is under way with three new hospitals under construction, in addition to new wings and departments across the country.<\/p><p> Housing and homelessness remain a Government priority.  We are committed to delivering an increased supply of affordable, quality and accessible housing.  In 2017, under Rebuilding Ireland, the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, 26,000 households had their housing needs met, which is 100 households being housed every day by the State.  Up to 4,000 individuals exited homelessness, 18 family hubs began operations and there was a 33% increase in construction commencement notices.  To date the Rebuilding Ireland home loan and the enhanced long-term social housing lease scheme have been launched.  The affordable purchase scheme has been announced while the affordable rental scheme is being piloted.  Improvements have been made to the repair and leasing scheme.  New planning regulations have been introduced and new guidelines on design standards for new apartments are being finalised.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is leading implementation of the plan, but this is a whole-of-Government effort which is overseen through meetings of Cabinet committee D and associated senior officials' groups.<\/p><p> My Department supports me in an extensive programme of international engagement.  The focus of the programme is on advancing Ireland's strategic interests, developing bilateral and multilateral relations, enhancing Ireland's international reputation and promoting trade, tourism and investment.  In 2020, Ireland is seeking election to the UN Security Council.  Our candidature reflects Ireland's continuing engagement on issues of international importance and the centrality of the UN to our foreign policy.<\/p><p> The Government is committed to further strengthening Ireland's capacity to represent ourselves effectively on the international stage.  In four cities in the United States over St. Patrick's week, I had an extensive set of meetings and engagements with political, business and civil society representatives.  This included meetings with the US President and Vice President, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Senate Majority Leader, the Senate Minority Leader and the Friends of Ireland on Capitol Hill.  I also met with the governors of Oklahoma, Texas and New York, as well as the mayor of New York.  My main focus was on advancing Ireland's economic and political interests in the US, including reaffirming our strong commitment to membership of the European Union; outlining our priorities in the context of Brexit and the importance we place, in that context, on two-way transatlantic trade and investment; promoting Ireland as a location for jobs, trade, tourism and investment; and continuing to make the case for US immigration reform.<\/p><p> Last week, I had a fruitful bilateral meeting with the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, in advance of the March European Council.  She reiterated her strong support for our unique concerns arising from Brexit.  In the past few weeks, I have also had good bilateral meetings with the Dutch and the Luxembourg Prime Ministers, as well as with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk.  I have also invited the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, to visit Ireland in the coming months.<\/p><p> On becoming Taoiseach, in order to ensure an effective, whole-of-Government response to the challenges ahead, I assigned lead responsibility for Brexit to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I have also re-organised the structure of Cabinet committees, with Cabinet committee C dealing with European Union issues including Brexit.  My Department maintains strategic oversight of Ireland's response to Brexit, which is a crucial and cross-cutting issue.  This work is led by the Second Secretary General, John Callinan, who acts as my Sherpa, and the international, EU and Northern Ireland division.   The work of this division includes supporting me in my role as a member of the European Council and in my engagements with other Heads of State and Government and senior figures in the European institutions, as well as preparing for the work of Cabinet committee C and its supporting group of senior officials.<\/p><p> The work led by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade includes the ongoing detailed preparations for the negotiations at EU level; engagement with the administrations in Belfast and London; and the co-ordination of planning around the economic impacts of Brexit.  Across the Government, relevant Departments, agencies and overseas missions are also being further strengthened to deal with Brexit.  The objective of this ongoing work is to ensure Ireland achieves the best possible outcomes across all four priorities identified by the Government.  These are trade and the economy, the peace process, the common travel area and the future of the European Union with Ireland as a committed member.<\/p><p> We are also working to help maintain peace and develop relationships on the island of Ireland, and between Britain and Ireland, especially in light of the challenges posed by Brexit.  The European Council provides overall guidance and maintains close political oversight of the negotiations with the UK.  The European Commission task force on Article 50 negotiations with the United Kingdom, led by Michel Barnier, with which we are in constant contact, represents the EU 27 in the ongoing negotiations.<\/p><p> Last December, the European Council agreed that sufficient progress had been achieved on the phase 1 withdrawal issues to allow us to move negotiations to the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  Acknowledging the progress in subsequent discussions between the EU and the UK on a draft withdrawal agreement, the March European Council adopted a set of guidelines for discussions on the framework.  The guidelines confirm the conditional agreement on an orderly transition period dependent on progress on the outstanding issues in the draft withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and the backstop option on the Border.  The European Council will review progress on all these issues in June.<\/p><p> Ireland will, of course, remain a member of the European Union.  It is, therefore, crucial that we are active in the debate about its future and that we focus more on what we want to achieve rather than on things we want to block.  With the support of my Department and the T&aacute;naiste, I have been engaged in many bilateral contacts with the leaders of other EU member states and the EU institutions with a view to exchanging views on the priorities of the future of Europe.  These bilateral contacts are vital to defend and promote Ireland's interests, which include a strong, stable, prosperous and more integrated European Union.  I delivered a speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg in January that highlighted the need for a forward-looking agenda for the Union with ambition and direction.<\/p><p> I have tasked the Minister of State with responsibility for European Union affairs, Deputy Helen McEntee, with leading a domestic engagement on the future of Europe so that Irish citizens can have their say on what they want for the EU of the future.  I launched this engagement process, known as the citizens' dialogue, last November.  The process is due to conclude on Europe Day, which is 9 May.<\/p><p> My Department works closely with colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Northern Ireland matters.  It is disappointing that we have not yet been able to secure agreement on the re-establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement as we approach its 20th anniversary.  The T&aacute;naiste and I will continue to work closely with the British Government and all the parties in Northern Ireland to try to make progress in the coming months.<\/p><p> In August, my Department published National Risk Assessment 2017 &ndash; Overview of Strategic Risks.  The document highlighted the intensification of risks arising from Brexit as well as a more general perception of increased geopolitical instability in the world; risks around climate change; human capital and skills needs; technological risks arising from potential cyber attacks or data fraud and theft; continued housing supply constraints; changing demographics; and potentially unrealistic expectations for public expenditure.<\/p><p> Work on this year's national risk assessment has begun and we intend to publish the 2018 report early in the third quarter.  The most important actions that the Government can take to mitigate risks, including risks associated with Brexit, and seize future opportunities is to vigorously implement the substantial plans set out in Project Ireland 2040.  That will be a significant focus of our attention during the year.<\/p><p> The national digital strategy will be developed during 2018 and will provide for an overarching long-term vision of the impacts of digital developments on Ireland.  In a related area of work, my Department continues to play a supporting role in data protection policy by seeking to ensure that the Data Protection Commissioner continues to have the resources she needs and to ensure that Ireland continues to be a leader internationally on digital and data issues.<\/p><p> Finally, my Department supports the National Economic and Social Council in providing forward-looking strategic advice on economic, social and sustainable development issues.  The current NESC work programme includes jobless households and the quality of supportive services; climate change and governance for the transition to the low-carbon economy; and land use, land value and urban development.  The Secretary General and an assistant secretary, Liz Canavan, serve as chairperson and deputy chairperson of the NESC respectively.  The council is meeting today, as Deputies are aware.<\/p><p> I have outlined some of the main outputs of my Department in 2017 and some of the priorities we are working on to make progress in 2018 and beyond.  There are of course always new challenges and the Department must be flexible and adaptable.  Looking ahead to later this year, for example, the successful organisation of the papal visit will be a significant objective for the Department and will require considerable work by the protocol section in particular.<\/p><p> I will comment briefly on the other Votes.  Vote 3 relates to the Office of the Attorney General.  The 2018 Revised Estimate for the Office of the Attorney General is &euro;15.32 million.  The majority of administrative expenditure relates to staff salaries, which cost &euro;11.7 million this year.  The largest expenditure item is a grant of a little under &euro;2.3 million to the Law Reform Commission.  Vote 4 relates to the Central Statistics Office.  As I mentioned previously, the Government Chief Whip will present the 2018 Revised Estimate for the CSO to the committee.  Vote 5 relates to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The Revised Estimate for the office is &euro;43.5 million.  This represents a 6% increase, or &euro;2.4 million, in the budget for the DPP.  The increase is designed to cover salary costs and an increase in the provision for general law expenses.  Vote 6 relates to Chief State Solicitor's Office.  The 2018 Revised Estimate for the Chief State Solicitor's Office is a little under &euro;33.7 million.  Salaries, wages and allowances account for &euro;17.37 million out of a total administrative budget of a little over &euro;19.68 million.  The remaining &euro;2.3 million is attributable to the general running costs of the office.  A provision of &euro;15.1 million is allocated for the payment of legal fees incurred.  This comprises &euro;13.5 million for counsel and &euro;1.4 million for general law expenses, which includes items such as expert witnesses and stenographers.  The balance is to be used to pay external solicitors.<\/p><p> I thank committee members for their attention and I commend the Revised Estimates to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#A00900","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":815,"content":"<p>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m an Taoiseach agus a chomhghleacaithe chuig an choiste.<\/p> <p>  I will begin by asking the Taoiseach about a comment in his opening statement.  How can the committee take the Taoiseach seriously in his claim that homelessness remains a Government priority, given the level of homelessness we have seen under his reign?  Since the last general election, homelessness for children has increased by 100%.  Last night, a total of 3,755 children were sleeping in emergency accommodation in hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation and family hubs.  In the past 12 months, child homelessness has increased by 50%, yet we are expected to believe somehow that this is a Government priority.  If it is a Government priority, does the Taoiseach acknowledge that he and his Cabinet colleagues are failing miserably?  I say as much given the unprecedented level of homelessness, in particular child homelessness, that we now have in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#C00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":816,"content":"<p>Are you taking the questions in groups, Chairman?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#C00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":817,"content":"<p>No, Taoiseach.

Deputy Doherty can take us seriously is several ways on that point.  First, a new Department has been dedicated mainly to housing, planning and local government.  This change involved taking functions out of that Department and moving them to another Department so that the new Department could focus on housing.<\/p> <p>  A total of &euro;140 million has been spent on emergency accommodation, which represents a major increase on spending on such accommodation.  This is taxpayers' money that we would not be spending if this was not an emergency that required spending on emergency accommodation.  That is why we do it.<\/p> <p>  Committee members can see in Project Ireland 2040 a money-backed commitment to build 110,000 social houses, including new homes and new houses over the next ten years.  Committee members will have seen our commitment to establish a State development agency, a new State body that will acquire or buy State lands and build on them.<\/p> <p>  If commitment is down to the amount of work we are doing and the amount of money we are spending, then I do not think anyone can doubt the level of Government commitment to this issue.  What we are not seeing is the kind of results we would like to see.  That is unbelievably frustrating, most of all for people who are affected by homelessness but also for those who are trying to solve the problem and assist people who are in homelessness.<\/p> <p>  I saw figures yesterday that indicate a big reduction in the number of people who are rough sleeping.  That is welcome and is, in large part, down to the additional bed spaces made available and the additional funding for the agencies.  It seems there has been a small reduction in individual homeless but a big and disturbing increase in the number of families who are in emergency accommodation.  Certainly, more are becoming homeless every month than we can get out of homelessness and that is extremely disturbing.  It is very frustrating that we have not seen sufficient progress to date, but it is certainly not down to lack of prioritisation, funding, effort or commitment from Government.  We need to drill down into that and understand better why the policies that we have put into effect thus far have not had the results that we would have hoped for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#C00500","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":819,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach mentioned that it is deeply frustrating for those working to resolve this crisis.  That applies to none more than those working on the front line.  I imagine the Taoiseach is aware of the comments made by Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy, the founder of Focus Ireland, this morning.  She said she has \"lost all confidence\" in the Government's ability to solve this crisis.<\/p><p>Fr. Peter McVerry has said that the Government's housing plan is deeply flawed and that it was presented with a stack of press releases aimed primarily at presenting a positive picture.  That is what people on the ground are saying.  Reconfiguration of a Department or more and more press releases on this, that and the other will not solve this crisis.  Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that under his leadership, the buck stops with him?  He is not a commentator, but the Taoiseach of this State, and under his leadership child homelessness figures have increased significantly.  This is not just a matter of statistics or percentages.  It is a disservice to those families with children to talk about a 100% increase or a 50% increase as we sometimes do when talking about figures.  These are citizens, living in this country who have found that they are homeless as a result of policies the Taoiseach has introduced or refused to introduce, such as real rent certainty and the Focus Ireland amendment, which the Government together with their Fianna F&aacute;il Party colleagues voted against.  These are matters that have resulted in the astronomical figures we have today, where, as we speak, almost 10,000 people are homeless in our State.  <\/p><p> What does the Taoiseach say to those on the front line who do not have a political axe to grind, but are articulating that the Government's plans to deal with the housing crisis are deeply flawed and that they have lost confidence in the Government to resolve this crisis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#C00600","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":821,"content":"<p>I did not mention anything about press releases or statistics; it is Deputy Doherty who brought that up.

It will not provide a house for anyone or bring down anybody's rent or make it easier for anyone to get a mortgage or find a home.  Political point scoring will achieve nothing in solving people's real problems.  I do not think it is the kind of issue that one should try to exploit politically.<\/p> <p>  I did not mention press releases, rather I mentioned the concrete things the Government is doing, including the significant increase in spending on housing, ranging from emergency housing which we provide for people and the increasing amount of social housing that is being built.  Only a few hundred social housing units were being built a couple of years ago and now it is up in the thousands.  We expect that up to 4,000 homes will be built this year and the change to the planning regulations will make it more affordable to build apartments.<\/p> <p>  A point made by Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy this morning that struck me, and she made a very valid point, was that we are seeing all over Dublin, and other cities as well, student accommodation being built.  I see cranes all over Dublin and in other cities where commercial property, hotels and student accommodation is being built.  All of this is welcome but we need to ask ourselves the fundamental question as to why we are seeing a significant level of construction but not the construction of residential property.  There is some residential development and the figures show that 40% more homes were built in February 2018 compared to February 2017, but it is not ramping up enough.  It seems to be economic and profitable to build student accommodation, hotels and commercial property and we need to try to work out in the next couple of week why it is not as profitable to build residential property.<\/p> <p>  We need to be very careful that any policy interventions by Government do not inadvertently make the situation worse.  We must consider the possibility that some of the Opposition proposals might do that or perhaps some of the things that Government has done in the past, while well intentioned may have actually been counterproductive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#D00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":822,"content":"<p>I did not say the Taoiseach mentioned press releases; it was Fr. Peter McVerry who referred to press releases when describing the Government's plan to tackle the housing crisis as deeply flawed.  Fr. McVerry said it was presented with a stack of press statements aimed primarily at presenting a positive picture.  On the day when figures emerge that 10,000 people are in emergency accommodation, and children are waking up this morning to go to school from hubs, bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels, the Taoiseach is saying we need to ask ourselves the question as to why this is the case.  That is shocking.  The Taoiseach has been in Government for seven years.  This did not happen overnight.  We have seen the homeless figures increase steadily under the stewardship of the Taoiseach's Cabinet but also while he was a Minister sitting at the Cabinet table.  He tells the families who are in emergency accommodation that we need to start asking why this is the case.<\/p> <p>  We need clear actions.  This is not political point scoring.  Are we supposed to ignore the fact that we have a housing crisis, yet the Government still does not deem it an emergency?  Are we to ignore the fact that on five separate occasions our party put to the Taoiseach a proposal on real rent certainty, which he, together with the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, opposed?  Are we supposed to ignore the fact that the Focus Ireland amendment, which was simple and stated that one should not evict people into homelessness, was opposed by the Government and colleagues who have entered a confidence and supply agreement?  These are some of the reasons that we are seeing the rise in homelessness in the monthly figures.  I hear nothing from the Taoiseach on the concrete actions of how he will deal with the issue, bar more commentary about why this and that is happening.  It is simply not good enough.<\/p> <p>  I did not intend to raise this issue today but the Taoiseach in his opening statement mentioned it as a priority.  Obviously, if it is a priority, it is failing dramatically when those on the front line state that the Government's plans are flawed.  The Government needs to revisit some of the proposals that are being put forward by the Opposition and stop rejecting them simply because they come from the Opposition.

We would not be spending &euro;140 million a year providing emergency accommodation in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation and family hubs for 10,000 people if it was not an emergency.  It is an emergency, but declaring it an emergency does not solve the problem and does not allow us to build houses or apartments more quickly or to provide one more house more quickly for any family.  I am happy to declare it an emergency, but that is rhetorical.  That will not solve the problem and make things better for any citizen in the State.<\/p> <p>  The reason that we do not support some of the proposals being put forward by the Opposition is not because they come from the Opposition, but because we believe they would make a bad situation worse.  If the Opposition was in charge of this problem, it would make a bad situation much worse.  Imposing very hard rent caps, for example, would mean that there would be fewer rental properties built.  There would be fewer people willing to rent out their properties and to enter the buy-to-let market.  That would have the effect of freezing the market.  One might protect a certain number of people from rent increases, but it would make it virtually impossible for new people to rent.  Similarly, the effect of other proposals made by the Opposition would cause us to have less supply in the housing market.  My contention is that this is an emergency and the Government is acting, but we are not getting the results we need so we need to do more.

On a day when under the Taoiseach's stewardship there are 10,000 people in emergency accommodation, the best he can offer is that if the Opposition was in Government, it would be worse because we would introduce a measure that one could not evict a family into homelessness.  Let us think about the proposal that Focus Ireland is putting forward, and what we in the Sinn F&eacute;in Party have put forward, which is the Focus Ireland amendment, where a landlord who has been supported through the tax net, which means he or she got beneficial treatment in terms of tax because he or she was a landlord, cannot evict a family into homelessness.  We say that is an appropriate measure but the Taoiseach states the family can be evicted into homelessness, yet he tells us this is a priority.  This is why a large section of those 10,000 people are in homeless accommodation today and this is why I cannot take what the Taoiseach says on this issue seriously because he will not take the steps that will prevent this emergency.<\/p> <p>  By calling the housing crisis an emergency, it means we can take emergency actions.  We can have follow up and a fire in the belly to deal with this issue.  We understand the pain, suffering and damage, both psychological and emotional, that is being done as a result of the situation in which many people find themselves today.  There is no fire in the belly of those in Government in regard to the housing crisis, and instead they state how many millions are being spent on dealing with it.  The Opposition supports the simple proposal not to evict tenants into homelessness.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach does not agree with the proposal and believes it is fine to do so, which is what is happening now.  I am dealing with a constituent who is facing being evicted into homelessness for a second time because the Government will not deal with the issue.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach spoke of hard rent caps and rent certainty.  Rent certainty is about tagging rent increases to inflation to ensure we do not have further increases in rent such as those that have occurred under the Government, including double-digit increases in certain areas.  Rent increases have resulted in people who belong to the \"barely getting by\" class finding themselves unable to get by and having to present as homeless to local authorities.  Solutions to the current emergency have been proposed and the Government must implement them and get a grip on the problem.  It must not allow more families to become homeless and then deal with them as emergency cases. <\/p><p> Last week, as other members will attest, representatives of a State-owned bank informed this committee that it had 1,000 properties lying empty.  The Taoiseach has tried to convince me that the Government considers this matter an emergency or a priority.  The figure of 1,000 empty properties relates to only one bank.  There are many others, for example, the Housing Agency offered more than 1,000 properties, of which only 400 were taken up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#D00500","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":826,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time is about to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#E00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":827,"content":"<p>I wish to raise a number of other points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#E00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":828,"content":"<p>The Deputy will not have time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#E00400","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":829,"content":"<p>I will make one further point on the strategic communications unit, SCU, and the Taoiseach's opening statement.

While that would certainly protect many people who are currently renting from rent increases, it would also freeze out of the market new people, including young people, those looking for properties for the first time and people moving to this country, because it would reduce the number of people who are willing to enter the buy-to-let market and rent out their properties.

We intend to amend the law to strengthen the protections for people with families who face eviction.  We will do so on foot of proposals made by the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Moran.  We will strengthen the hand of the courts in respect of evictions by empowering them not to evict families into homelessness.  However, one must bear in mind that there are circumstance in which people who can pay the rent do not do so.  These are individual cases, which is the reason cases of this nature are dealt with in the courts, as they should be because the courts are generally sympathetic.

It will, therefore, be a matter for human resources to decide what will happen to these staff.

That is not true, is not backed up by the evidence and was very unfair to them.  Those of us who are involved in politics sign up for this and, to a certain extent, we sign our families and friends up for it.  However, these are civil and public servants and they should not have to go home to their children to answer questions as to whether daddy or mummy has done something wrong.

Problems in politics and with policy that have one cause are easier to solve than those that are multi-factorial and have a complex phenomenology.  This is obviously a country with a rising population and increased household formation.  Every year in Ireland more housing is needed, unlike in other countries where the population is dropping or there are fewer households.  There is also a lack of supply, but it is not as simple as that.  It was probably best explained to me by somebody whose name I cannot remember.  I went out before Christmas with a group, the name of which I cannot remember.  I think it was Streetwise, or perhaps it was the group of doctors who visit people who are sleeping rough.  I spent the evening meeting people who were on the streets or living in tents and talking to those who worked with them.  The way she described it was this and in some ways it best explained the problem to me.  In a normal scenario, were it not for the boom and bust cycle, about 30,000 new homes would be built in Ireland every year.  The figure would be in that ball park.  In Ireland, because of the financial crisis and the economic crash, there was a seven-year period in which virtually no homes were built.  The Government and the local authorities did not have the funds to build homes; the banks were bust and the construction sector was destroyed.  During that period about 200,000 or 210,000 houses would ordinarily have been built, but they were not.  As a result about 200,000 households which in the past would have bought a home are now renting.  As a result, another 200,000 households have been pushed down, some of which have been pushed out of the rental market altogether and fallen off the ladder.  That is the best simple explanation that has been given to me for the worsening homelessness problem and housing crisis.<\/p> <p>  We are going to have to catch up.  Not only will we have to get supply to equilibrium, that is, provide what is needed to meet the natural increased demand every year of about 30,000 houses, we have a catch-up figure of about 200,000 to achieve.  That is not going to be done quickly.  It will take us quite a number of years to get back to building 30,000 houses a year, which is where we need to be, and then catch up on the 200,000 that were not built during the last decade.  In the meantime, we are going to have to do lots of things to treat the symptoms of the problem.  If I were to apply my medical expertise, there is an underlying problem which we need to solve - a fundamental lack of supply.  While we fix that problem we will have to treat the symptoms.  That will involve doing some of the things we are doing - providing emergency accommodation; focusing on prevention in order that people will not fall into homelessness; allowing the uplifts in the housing assistance payment; and identifying people early before they lose their home.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Michael McGrath asked a straight question.

I, too, will be perfectly honest.  I do not get the sense that the Taoiseach and the Government are on top of this issue.  The reality is that promise after promise has been broken.

When he was Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the T&aacute;naiste pledged that hotels would no longer be used by July 2017.

The amount of resources and D&aacute;il time we have allocated to housing has been very substantial.  The Taoiseach needs to acknowledge that.  He has acknowledged that the problem is getting worse and states he intends to give more time to dealing with it in the period ahead.  The problems are obvious.  Some of them were touched on, but it remains the case that there is very significant land hoarding in Ireland.  As long as it is more profitable to hold or trade land than to build on it, there is going to be a problem.  That remains the case.  Banks, including the State-owned banks, receivers, vulture funds and private landowners are sitting on land that could be developed.  In many cases, the land has been zoned and is located where services are actually available.  This happens because it is more profitable to sit on the land and rely on the expectation that its value will grow.  I do not know what the Government is planning to do about this using tax measures.  Will they actually be implemented next year?<\/p> <p>  We have been promised a report on the cost of building housing.  We still hear from many builders and developers that it is not viable to build in certain parts of the country.  That remains a problem, but I have not seen any such report from the Government to tackle the cost of building housing.  It seems to take local authorities forever to get schemes off the ground, even where they have been sanctioned.  That obviously is an issue.  There are also issues with funding.  It was announced in the budget last October that a new &euro;750 million fund would be made available for house building.  That has not yet happened.<\/p><p>However, builders and developers are having to borrow at very expensive rates from international funds at perhaps 12% or 14%.  It is pushing up the cost of housing with the result being a growing affordability gap and a structural shift in our society where fewer and fewer people into the future will be able to afford a home.  This is the reality of what is happening out there.  From the work I do at constituency level, and every Deputy does a lot of constituency work, I can tell the Taoiseach that it is getting worse.  I have seen a very dramatic uplift in the number of housing-related queries in recent weeks.  Far from being confident that the Government is getting on top of this, I think it will get worse.  Nothing said by the Taoiseach or the Minister of State will give people confidence that the tide is actually turning because time and again, the Taoiseach has said it will get better and the Government is getting on top of it but the figures get worse at an accelerated pace so something is very badly wrong in the Government's approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#F01300","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":852,"content":"<p>I would contend that at the very least, we are seeing some improvement in some areas.  Rough sleeping is certainly down.  The initial count indicates that rough sleeping is down significantly from the last count.  I think people will have seen to a certain extent with their own eyes over the past couple of months that rough sleeping is down.  We know from the RTB figures that the increase in rents is starting to slow but certainly I have no argument with the Deputy and I will not contend that homelessness is not getting worse.  That is evident.  There are more families in emergency accommodation than there were before and the number is continuing to rise.  I would not take any one month's figures as a trend but certainly the trend has been in the wrong direction over the past couple of months.<\/p> <p>  We should be talking about solutions here and lots of people want us to focus on solutions, not on the politics of it.  The Deputy mentioned land hoarding, which is certainly part of the picture.  It is definitely part of the problem.  We brought in the derelict sites tax or levy, whatever one wants to call it.  This will take effect from 2019.  We have announced the establishment of Home Building Finance Ireland, which will be funded from this year.  ISIF already provides finance to building so it is not as if it is not being done already.  It is but Home Building Finance Ireland will provide more of that.  As part of Project Ireland 2040, we have made a commitment to establish a State development land agency - essentially a State developer - that will be able to acquire and develop land.  This is one of the things that will form part of the solution.  We must bear in mind that even if there is land hoarding, building is also taking place as well but this building is generally not residential.  It is commercial property, student accommodation and things like hotels.  It is not residential so even in the context of land hoarding, that development is happening but not in residential and not in sufficient numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#G00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":853,"content":"<p>Does the Taoiseach have an adviser who specialises in housing?

Actually the debate at the time was very similar.  There were conspiracy theories and allegations, as well as paranoia, except that the shoe was on the other foot and it was people in my party who were saying the kind of things members of the Deputy's party are now saying.  I think the lesson is that any time one tries to do anything new, particularly in the communications and media space, it will generate a degree of political paranoia, controversy and conspiracy theories.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#H01600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":898,"content":"<p>Does the Taoiseach think that is the only lesson to be learned?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#H01700","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":899,"content":"<p>No; I think it is one lesson.  A second lesson - an unfortunate one - is that the Civil Service and the public service can come under attack unfairly, as I have mentioned.  One of the difficulties in the Civil Service and the public service is that it does tend to be risk averse because that is always the safe option.  It is not particular to the Department of the Taoiseach; it is true across the Civil Service and the public service.  It is always a safer option to do things in the way they have always been done.  One of the jokes in the public service is that the safe thing to do is to give the contract to IBM, not to a new or an innovative firm because if one does things as they have always been done, one will not be criticised, but if one innovates and tries to do things differently, one leaves oneself open to criticism.

First, I accept that there is a lesson about controls that could have been put in place in advance.  Second, I issued a guideline on the matter, but, on reflection, I should have done so earlier.  If I had known more about these things, it was about the requirement for all editorial content to be signed off on by the SCU and the Department in advance and as part of the media partnerships.  Decisions on how the advertorials would look and what photographs would be included in them were left to local editors.  It would have been advisable for us to say from the outset that the SCU would sign off on the editorial content.  While it was the case that 100% of the advertorials were clearly marked as being in partnership with Project Ireland 2040 and the Government, we could have been much more prescriptive in how that should appear. <\/p> <p>  A number of weeks ago I made five points on what could have been done better.

Some of the information included correspondence between the Taoiseach's chief of staff and Mr. John Concannon on the idea of turning \"republic of opportunity\" from a slogan to a charter.  It is obviously a slogan the Taoiseach used in the course of his campaign in Fine Gael to become leader of the party and, subsequently, Taoiseach.  It is a slogan which is associated very much with Fine Gael.  Does the Taoiseach accept that those emails and the fact that the discussion happened confirms the point about a blurring of the lines between Fine Gael and the Government?  Relatedly, other emails which came out include correspondence from the Taoiseach to, I think, Mr. John Concannon talking about how the child care initiative should be a Government initiative as opposed to being seen as a Department of Children and Youth Affairs one.  Was that about the Taoiseach's Government, him in particular, or Fine Gael getting the benefit and credit for the initiative as opposed to an Independent Minister, Deputy Zappone?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#K01200","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":956,"content":"<p>The short answer to that is \"No\".  It was about the Government getting credit for it rather than a particular Department or agency.  The Government is much wider than any political party or even the Independents who are in it.  The Government includes Departments and it is a wider concept.  My view for a long time has been and remains that Government is too siloised and that Departments and agencies operate very often as independent republics that do their own thing too much.  I see part of my role as Taoiseach as being to bring about joined-up Government and to bring together Government policies, implementation and communications.  There is a tendency sometimes on the part of Departments and agencies to engage in a lot of self-promotion, quite frankly.  From the public's point of view, this is all the Government.  The public does not really want to know which Department or agency it is.  People want to know what the system is doing for them.<\/p> <p>  I thought one of the best campaigns co-ordinated by the strategic communications unit related to the self-employed and the rights and benefits we were extending to them, including paternity benefit, treatment benefit and invalidity pension for the first time.  When Government is broken up into so many silos and agencies, however, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, for example, only sees people who are self-employed in terms of PRSI S-class contributions.  That is how the Department sees it.  It thinks of self-employed people as PRSI S-class payers for which they get certain benefits.  The Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners only see self-employed people as those who pay self-employed tax and who get certain credits.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation only sees people who are self-employed through the prism of entrepreneurship, which leads to a very fragmented message, very fragmented policy-making and poor implementation.  Part of my job as Taoiseach and of my Department is to join up Government and to bring together policy, implementation and communications.  That is why we did it as a package when we decided to do something for the self-employed.  We improved their social benefits, increased their tax credit and improved entrepreneurship supports.  We had joined-up policy and implementation and we communicated it as a single campaign on what the Government of Ireland was doing to improve things for the self-employed.  The old way was to have three Departments doing three different things without talking to each other or being joined-up at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#K01300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":957,"content":"<p>What about the \"republic of opportunity\" question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#K01400","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":958,"content":"<p>I would have to look at that again as I do not remember in my own mind when I started using \"republic of opportunity\" as a term.

I refer to his statement to the effect that he encourages all parties to keep in mind the cost of tribunals.  That is okay with me.  However, we have to look at the reasons for some of the tribunals.  The total failure of the State to deal with particular problems is the reason for some of them.  Some of these have come from whistleblowers and the Taoiseach has been very supportive of them.  By all means control the cost of tribunals but someone needs to examine the functions of Government and bring about the reforms that are necessary whereby we can learn from our mistakes.  I refer to where we attempt to put in place processes and procedures that eliminate such mistakes as much as is possible.  There will always be mistakes.  As long as we have humans, we are going to have mistakes.  However, at least minimise them.  It is almost depressing to see, every single week, the Committee of Public Accounts or this committee dealing with some failure of the State that has happened in some other guise down through the years.  It just trundles on relentlessly.  There is no change.  There is the usual spoof from some Departments in respect of their responses to particular issues but no real gain for the State out of it.  I ask the Taoiseach to look at that as well.<\/p> <p>  In that context, I want to come to the work of this committee.  Permanent TSB and AIB are proposing to sell a huge tranche of mortgages.  The Permanent TSB sale involves home loans, split mortgages and all sorts of things.  AIB is centred on businesses, including small businesses, farms and that kind of thing.  Something has to be done about that.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to find a mechanism to prevent these fire sales to vulture funds because they will create massive social problems in the future relative to housing and families.  I have seen, at first hand through the courts, the type of trauma and difficulties caused.  I am not talking about those who will not pay or have it and will not pay.  I am talking about those who are caught in a bind with the banks.<\/p> <p>  The banks will say that they work with the customers.  They do not; at lease not effectively.  There is one bank that certainly has drilled down, worked with every single customer and has said it will not sell to vulture funds.  That is Bank of Ireland.  However, the others seem to be preparing a sale which I believe the Government should stop.  I am making that point because, while we deal with the banks here, the vulture funds have refused to come before us.  They are not regulated.  The agents that are regulated, who are as bad as the vulture funds, will not come before us either.  They will not participate in the democratic process of being transparent and honest with the people we represent.  It is deeply frustrating and annoying to see these people, who are in difficulty and cannot sort out their problems, coming to us while the vulture funds are giving us the two fingers.  They will not come near us.  It is not right.<\/p> <p>  The national housing co-operative and fair mortgage bill is with the Ceann Comhairle's office and the Bill's Office at the moment.  Mr. Edmund Honohan has been highlighting it.  Again, this is an issue in respect of which the Taoiseach and the Cabinet, for example, could take an initiative whereby ethical funds - and they are there - rather than the vultures would be the preferred buyers of these loans.  There is no place for vulture funds in Ireland now.  It is a point I am bringing to the Taoiseach's attention.  If he wants to comment on it, fair enough.  I ask him to consider it.  Perhaps he could send some message to the vulture funds and their agents that this is where they are made accountable and this is where they should come.  A strong word from the Taoiseach would certainly change the mindset of these people who are blackguarding innocent individuals throughout the country.  They are refusing to deal with those to whom I refer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#M02200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1013,"content":"<p>People and bodies corporate invited to testify before the Oireachtas should do so.

I am not up to date on the engagement between the Deputy and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohue.  I believe we are making progress towards enacting that legislation.  That may change the market and change the picture.  I agree with the Chairman that we need to make a big distinction between people who can pay and will not and those who will never be able to pay.

There are examples of solutions that are being held up by the system itself.<\/p> <p>  The Taoiseach talked about health.  FreeStyle Libre is a treatment for diabetes.  A second treatment is Vimizim.  Is there no resolution to what are now long-standing issues in terms of new treatments the Department of Health can bring forward?  The Taoiseach mentioned the cost of the various health services and the new remedies and treatments in his opening statement.  I am bringing to his attention the fact that those are issues that affect the lives of young people and I would like to see a resolution in those areas.<\/p> <p>  On social housing, we have county councils all over the country that have established their housing lists.  In Kilkenny, if one counts everything it is 3,500.  They were the housing authorities of the past and they are now working as housing authorities, and in conjunction with the voluntary sector, but there is such a blockage there that it is another area where reform is necessary.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that it is the fact that councils are not doing the work that they should be doing, in conjunction with the Department and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, that is causing some of the logjam.  One is faced with a further question about reform in the system in order to deliver what citizens are looking for.  It is amazing to think that in the 1950s and 1960s massive amounts of local authority houses were built.  Wonderful communities were created and large families were reared yet here we are now, with much more than we ever had in the 1950s and 1960s, and the numbers cannot be delivered.  I suggest again that it is because of the bureaucratic nightmare that exists all around those issues now and having to have many things cleared by the Departments.  I am asking the Taoiseach those questions in terms of reform but also the future of the confidence and supply agreement.  Would he like to comment on that?  Does he have any views on that?

Members of the public are increasingly aware of, and able to access, statistics and indicators on the social, economic and environmental issues which affect their daily lives and the online channel is the office's primary publication method.<\/p> <p>  The CSO's Statement of Strategy 2017 to 2019 gives priority to delivering the core statistics needed for policy, while keeping a strong focus on cost management.  The office continues to meet all of its commitments under the public service reform programme and is implementing a programme of reform and continuous business process improvement in the collection and processing of statistics.  The report from the economic statistics review group convened by the CSO was published, along with the CSO's response, on 3 February 2017.  The recommendations in the group's report focus on how best to provide insight for users into domestic activity given the highly globalised Irish economy.  The CSO has been implementing the recommendations incrementally from mid-2017 and that will continue during 2018.<\/p> <p>  The CSO is leading the development of the Irish statistical system, ISS, by working closely with other Departments and the wider public sector that are involved in the collection, processing, compilation or dissemination of official statistics, to promote a more coherent approach to meeting data needs.  It has developed a code of practice for the Irish statistical system, under which the first body is expected to be certified very shortly.  It is also strongly promoting the development of a national data infrastructure, NDI, which will provide for better co-ordination and greater exploitation of the varied data sources available across the Irish public sector.  It will also lead to greater understanding of the importance of data in supporting policy and decision-making and delivering efficiencies in public service provision.<\/p> <p>  Making better use of data throughout the public sector is an important part of public service reform and will contribute to more evidence-informed decision-making and better measurement of policy outcomes.  Better co-ordination and greater use of administrative data also contributes to reducing the burden on data providers.  Since 2008, the CSO has continued to reduce the response burden of its non-agricultural business surveys, as measured through the response burden barometer.  A decrease of 38.6% was measured between 2008 and 2016, exceeding the target reduction of 25% over this timeframe.<\/p> <p>  The CSO Vote for 2018 provides for a total of 801 staff.  This represents an increase from 755 in 2017 and reflects the cyclical nature of the work of the office, in particular the census.  The CSO makes an important contribution to Ireland's public policy, by providing a high quality and, most important, an independent statistical service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#N01900","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1037,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, and his officials.

Even across the board, without mentioning any private sector company - we all know the particular company that would be interested in statisticians - there has been a demand in the private sector for statisticians.  Hiring people with the required skill set, that is, statisticians was one of the weaknesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#O00400","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1042,"content":"<p>I should commend the CSO as an organisation with its headquarters in my constituency in Cork.

The CSO produces motor insurance premium changes on a monthly basis.  That is very useful in terms of informing public policy decisions and has fed into the cost of insurance working group and so on but we do not have comparable data for the cost of insurance, not just to businesses but to voluntary bodies, sporting clubs and community organisations.  It is an area I would like the CSO to examine to ascertain whether it could start compiling statistics on the cost of insurance.  It may well compile such data on an aggregate basis but I mean in a way whereby it could be broken down in order that we could see the anecdotal evidence we are hearing from businesses about public liability and employment liability.  Is that coming through by way of the overall statistics?  I do not expect an answer here and now from the Minister of State but if the CSO could examine that to see if it was possible to start compiling and reporting that on a monthly basis, it would be very useful in terms of public policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018032900002#O00700","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1522314000,"counter":1045,"content":"<p>That will be relayed back to the officials in the CSO.
