We will deal with matters arising as we discuss the work programme.<\/p> <p>  We will now deal with correspondence received.  First, we will deal with category A, briefing documents and opening statements in respect of today's meetings.  Correspondence No. 1206A was received from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General, Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  This is her opening statement.  We will note and publish that.  Correspondence No. 1117 is the briefing document also from Ms Licken which we received.  We will note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  We now move to correspondence from category B, which is correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers and follow-up to PAC meetings and other items for publication.  The first is No. 1185B from Mr. Neil McDermott, System Funding, The Higher Education Authority, providing an update in relation to St. Angela's College Sligo Limited and its incorporation with NUI Galway.  We will note and publish that.<\/p> <p>  No. 1186B is from Professor Brian Norton, president, Dublin Institute of Technology, dated 20 March 2018.  The item provides details requested by the committee on &euro;3.16 million of non-compliant procurement which came to light when we were looking at DIT's annual accounts.  If nobody has any question on that we can note it and move on.  We will note that.<\/p> <p>  No. 1192B is from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, dated 22 March 2018.

A note is included on EU rulings in relation to landfill sites and an update on the number of landfill sites and their remediation status.  It has been several months since the information was requested.  We will put the information up on the screen.  A document was to be attached.  Did we get an attachment?  Perhaps I missed it.

There will be only two landfill sites available from next year in addition to the incinerator.  Waste is also shipped abroad.  It seems there is not serious control on this whole area.  There is control over unlicensed landfill sites but quite a lot of public money is likely to come into play in terms of landfill sites that might be in private hands where money needs to be recouped, as in the case where the site then went out of business.  Is that an area that could require particular attention?

It charged fees so it recovered its own costs and therefore there is not an Exchequer funding for it.<\/p> <p>  There is a limit to the extent I can get involved in that, but it is something we encourage the relevant Departments to look at in terms of the potential costs, the contingent liabilities, that are associated with cleaning up illegal sites or sites that need remediation.  One way of accessing it from the committee's point of view is the environment fund, which is a fund under the current Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I think the account for 2016 was presented relatively recently so it could be something for the committee to examine.

It is taxpayers' money and public money.  In autumn we found an illegal site with 70,000 tonnes, which will take 15 months to remediate at a cost of &euro;6 million.  There is a wider issue here.  We have heard the warnings about people just putting waste outside for it to be collected and thinking there is no consequence to these unregulated illegal collections.  The consequence is &euro;6 million of public money being spent to remediate illegal sites.

Mr. Watt said he will consider this and on page 2 of his letter, he states, \"The committee may wish to note that my Department intends to initiate a review of Department of Finance [25\/2000] Official Entertainment Circular\".  He intends to do that this year.  He enclosed a copy of the circular that was issued 18 years ago, in 2000.  We need a new circular on hospitality and entertainment where it involves taxpayers' money directly.  We will acknowledge it and write back and ask if there is a timetable for the new circular and ask that we be provided with a copy as soon as it is ready.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#C00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>The letter quotes all sorts of bits and pieces but it does not deal with the elephant in the room.

Will there be action taken against the college?  There is no way any existing circular, however much it is in need of being replaced by a new circular, sanctioned &euro;13,000 for a bash with ice sculptures and so on no matter how important the person.  He is not really telling us anything.  There are three pages here that can be summed up in one sentence, namely, \"We do not have adequate measures in place, we plan to have adequate measures in place and we will let you know at some stage.\"  The key point is there is still no sanction.  Is someone divvying up this &euro;13,000 in Cork?  That is the issue.  It is the issue with everything we do in here.  When we identify things, it is not our role to determine what a sanction might be, as the Chairman said at the report launch yesterday.  What are we doing it for?  Is it just to highlight stuff, give copies to the media and then nothing happens?

Sometimes there are changes and the Comptroller and Auditor General will alert us to positive changes in accounting practices and how accounts are presented and so on.  In terms of wrongdoing, there is no sanction whatsoever and it is a slap on the wrist or a shrug of the shoulders from the Accounting Officer.  This letter is exactly that.

My instinct is our main challenge would be to the board of directors or governance of any State body.  Our sanctions should not involve any cuts to services down the line, whether it is in the HSE, health, social or education sector.  Our sanctions should be directed at board level because they are the people who are responsible for running the organisations.  Our sanctions should be directed at that level.  They are the people responsible for corporate governance, not the staff down the line.  That is a thought.  We will come back to it on another day.

The level of hospitality spending in organisations is generally a function of the culture.  It may not be a lot of money in itself but it tells one a little bit about how governance is managed in an organisation.  We examine expenditure on hospitality as part of a set of propriety tests we do every year.  That process in itself acts as a control over the level of spending.  However, sometimes we find something that looks to us to be excessive and in a situation like that we push for publication.  With the revision of the code of practice, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has required organisations to publish where there is any significant level of hospitality.<\/p> <p>  They have got to declare what the spend has been.  Questions then can be asked here by the committee or others who look at the financial statements, because it can clearly be seen what the level of spending is and justification can be sought.  While there is not a provision for a direct sanction, the fact that the committee takes it seriously and regularly raises it has an effect of adding to that control that is exercised.  Most public sector organisations are very careful about not spending in an extravagant way because this committee and our office are interested in it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I disagree, respectfully, with that.

Are benchmarks set initially and then checked to see if they have been met?  Has there been any comparison with the post-project reviews in this State and how they are carried out internationally?  It is all very well to have post-project reviews but if they are internal, they may do what we want them to do or they may not; we do not know because we have not seen them before.

Some people ask what actually happens as a result of our meeting.  We had the meeting here last year.  As long as any of us have been here, we have never seen a post-project review of a public private partnership project.  It has not happened.  We had quite a stand-off here last week when we threatened to close down the meeting and went into private session to discuss it.  We came back and said that we were not happy.  It was said in the meeting that they would be produced.<\/p><p>In response to the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendation in his report last year, a commitment was given that the post-project reviews would be published and it was being worked on.  Six months elapsed and the Department was here last Thursday.  We asked when was that going to happen.  As a result, a circular, dated 26 March, has been issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to all Departments since our meeting last Thursday.  We have had an instant success on this.  I said I wanted to hold over the circular.  It is only a page and a half.  There are two paragraphs I want to read, where the Secretary General refers to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report last year.  He states &quot;The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform also accepted the recommendation that such post project reviews should be published, and indicated that a requirement to this effect (subject to redaction of any commercially sensitive information) will be included in a revision of the Public Spending Code which is currently underway and in revised PPP guidance to be issued in the near future.<\/p><p>Paragraph No. 5 of this circular, which has been issued to all heads of Departments and Government offices, states: <\/p><blockquote>However, in advance of completion of the updated Public Spending Code and PPP Guidance, I wish to advise all Departments and Offices that this policy on publication of post project reviews for all public investment projects, including PPPs, is now being implemented with immediate effect.  Accordingly, any post project reviews undertaken from this date should be published at the earliest possible opportunity, following completion.<\/blockquote> <p>That is a complete success for the Committee of Public Accounts here last Thursday.  We are achieving something in respect of the publication of these reports that has never happened.  As a result of last Thursday's meeting, the circular was issued within a matter of days stating such reports should be published and to get on with it.  They are to be published at the earliest opportunity.<\/p><p>We look forward to receiving them.  I want to note this is an example of the Committee of Public Accounts achieving something that is across the entire public sector.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has been calling for it year in, year out and the meeting last week has brought about this positive result.  We will wait to see it happening, but a circular has gone out and that is a positive result.  It is an achievement as a result of people appearing before the committee.  We welcome the note and look forward to seeing the reports.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1205B is from Mr. Michael Nolan, CEO of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, providing follow up to our meeting on 8 March 2018 on motorway maintenance contracts.  We note and publish it.  People will find it interesting and should work on it as they see fit.<\/p><p> Correspondence category C is from private individuals and any other correspondence.  Correspondence No. 1162C was held over from last week.  This item is from Mr. Tadhg Daly, CEO of Nursing Homes Ireland, dated 6 March 2018, on the cost of care in HSE nursing homes.  We agreed to discuss this as part of the work programme, which we deferred last week.  We will discuss the work programme in a few minutes.  The correspondence is noted.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1176C was held over from last week and is from an individual alleging that a number of Departments are misclassifying employees as self-employed in order for some employers to evade PRSI obligations.  This is a large document and at first glance it appears to be related to a matter considered by the committee in some depth before.  I propose in the first instance that we write back to the individual to request a summary of which Departments are involved and to specify how the misclassification is being done.  It is an extensive document and we will ask for the person's assistance because he or she must have quite a bit of knowledge, so we can narrow the focus and then deal with it.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1188C is anonymous correspondence regarding alleged misuse of public moneys in relation to the children's hospital in Crumlin.  There is no evidence presented so we will just note the document.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1189C is from an individual in relation to the racing industry.  He is calling for an investigation into the industry to ensure that it is tax compliant and employees are treated fairly.  It is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners to ensure all businesses are tax compliant and if employees are treated unfairly they have recourse to the mechanisms of the Workplace Relations Commission.  I propose that we note the item and our consideration of the matter is closed.  The tax affairs of employees in an individual sector is not something we can specifically get into.  Perhaps we will forward the letter to the Revenue Commissioners for their attention and with regard to any action they deem appropriate.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1193C is from an individual, dated 22 March 2018, in relation to the wards of court funds.  We forwarded correspondence from the Courts Service to the individual.  I propose we note the correspondence for now.  We dealt with this last week and the correspondent is not happy with the response that was considered here at the meeting last week.  We have sent the documentation and I know this matter will come up again.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1195C, dated 21 March 2018, is from a specific individual in relation to the non-payment of 2017 farm grants for the GLAS and organic schemes.  I propose, with the individual's permission, that we forward the item to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for its attention and request to be updated on how the case is being addressed.  We will forward it directly to the Department and ask it to keep us informed.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1196C is an anonymous piece of correspondence in relation to Inland Fisheries Ireland.  We have had similar issues raised with us and we received a response from Inland Fisheries Ireland.  I propose we note this correspondence.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1197C is from Professor Patrick O'Shea, the president of University College Cork, dated 23 March 2018, providing information as requested by the committee on UCC's partnership with Cork Opera House.  Deputy Kelly raised this matter and we will hold it over to our next meeting because he is not here today.<\/p><p> Correspondence No. 1198C from Ms Catherine Colman, from the estimates section in the finance division of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, dated 23 March 2018, enclosing an information note on swimming pools.

This is the first time it has really been opened up since.  It is there in theory, but I wonder about the good use of public money.  It has to be there in practice, but the amount of grant aid is not sufficient to build a swimming pool.  It requires matching funds.  Swimming pools do not make money; they are expensive to run and the energy efficiency side of it is very important from this point of view.  Many of the pools do not materialise, and it strikes me it is a terrible waste of money to give the impression a scheme is available but we do not actually see new swimming pools emerging in some cases, or it takes years for them to be built because they must find the matching funding.  I absolutely support the need, but I question the value of this approach because if the local authority will not put up matching funding then we will not get the swimming pool.  There is a constant round of disappointment because there are announcements without follow through.  Areas most affected by this are those which do not have facilities to begin with that can be expanded on, such as my area and the areas of the Chairman and Deputy Cassells, which are growing areas.  If we are going to look at some of these initiatives, can we look at them from the point of view of whether what is being proposed is viable, or is this something that really should be looked at from another committee's perspective?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#E00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>The Deputy is talking about the viability of future projects and the line Department is the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.

It is an unfortunate reality that the viability of these projects is called into question.  I have a legacy community based swimming pool in an affluent suburb, which has required consistent and continuous funding from local government and national Government to keep it going, and now we are proposing to put pools into communities which, quite frankly, really require them because there are no private facilities that offer the same service at a reasonable cost.  However, the ongoing maintenance and the energy and environmental side of things have to be taken into consideration.  I am all for these projects, but the reality from the perspective of the Committee of Public Accounts is we are spending huge amounts of money on projects and there are no criteria that I can see in terms of a capacity of a community to support it or a capacity of a community to have a sufficient number of residents within a reasonable distance to access the facility.  I question the viability of continuing funding for projects such as these based on good value for money and taxpayers' money being put into projects.<\/p> <p>  Of course, I am all for these projects, but we really need an injection of reality into the conversation as to whether they can be funded.  If we look at other community facilities that have been built, there is one, for instance, in Donabate which required &euro;600,000 of taxpayers' money to keep it from going under a few years back, and that was before the crash I might point out.  There are some serious questions that have to be asked as to whether the State can afford to run these projects and whether we might be better looking at public private partnership as an option to keep them running.  This is not an ideological thing, it just relates to whether or not it is possible to afford these things.  It is something I would certainly like to weigh in on, and I accept it would be a matter, in terms of policy direction, for the line committee and the Minister to look at, but we as a body have a responsibility to look at whether it represents good value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#E00400","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I suspect there would be no money in it for public private partnerships so I do not expect that is a likely route.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#E00500","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>It is just a suggestion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#E00600","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>There have been instances where there was public funding for a number of pools in the same location.

We might as well not have a national standard if we do not have the means and do not recognise that we need to provide sufficient money because carrying a debt in a situation that is very finely tuned means that we are into a difficulty from day one.

Dr. O'Connor provides a breakdown of consultancy and legal fees and copies of minutes from board meetings where key decisions were made relating to the merger with Institute of Technology Tralee.  An explanation for the higher costs and effects on student services is provided.  Can we note and publish this documentation?

I know that in the case of Waterford and Carlow, they are way behind the Munster one, for example.

It talks about corporate procurement plans and the national public procurement policy framework introduced in 2005.  Then there is a voluntary code of practice.  It goes back to what we said last week.  All this seems to be on a voluntary basis, not on a statutory basis.  There are guidelines, but that is all they are.

The committee and the HEA feel it is necessary, and that is where it rests.  Notwithstanding that, this university has not even given the accounts parallel with its own accounts.  The issue of foundations and who controls what is huge.  When NUI Galway, NUIG, appeared before us, it very proudly told the committee it had no control over it, so therefore there was no need to do this.  Again, that office is on the campus site.  It does not pay rent or anything.  In fact, the question of why it would pay rent was laughed at.  <\/p> <p>  There is a huge blurring of boundaries here that is not under scrutiny.  That is of extreme concern to me.  If the university does not control the foundation, it begs questions as to whether the foundation controls the university, the direction in which it is going or the nature of the buildings.  Notwithstanding that very good things could come out of a foundation, it has to be done in an open and accountable way.  In my view, that has not been done.  If the president of a university says the university has no control over it and yet the president and the bursar of that university sits on its board, then there are serious issues.  If there is a separate board in America, for example, with the president on that board as well, there are questions that have to be asked if we are to hold a system to account and achieve value for money, in particular when it came across repeatedly that more and more money was coming from the foundations, so the universities were not happy to have them scrutinised.  The universities maintained that the foundations were entirely separate.  They did not recognise that the universities are what they are because of public money.  For the record, it is something I will be keeping a close eye on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#G01700","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy want the committee to include that issue in the letter to UCC and for it to give us its rationale?

We have the NTMA, National Treasury Management Agency, listed on 21 June to deal with its accounts and financial statements.

Under the new licence they are supposed to be used for the promotion of the national lottery and special draws, but there is no oversight of that.  That is the role of regulator.  The regulator has written to PLI asking for the figure and was told by PLI that it does not have to give the figure.  I raised it last week with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and he is refusing to state what the figure is or what oversight there is in terms of the role of regulator in ensuring that unclaimed prize money is being used as it is supposed to be used under the licence.

I do not think the latter is the appropriate body to manage this fund.  We now have a State Claims Agency that manages these types of funds.  We will include discussion of this issue in the work programme.  Long-term, we should not have a particular body managing the wards of court fund given the expertise in the NTMA to manage it, which we are told is the best in the world.

As per the schedule, we are due to meet the Tax Appeals Commission on Thursday, 28 June at 9 a.m. and the Revenue Commissioners in the afternoon.  I am suggesting that we ask those agencies to attend the meeting with the Department of Finance on 19 April.  We had already decided that we could deal with the Tax Appeals Commission in a two-hour meeting in any event and we have already had some discussion with the Revenue Commissioners on corporation tax so I think we would be able to move quickly through the second half of Revenue Commissioners' business.  The issues for discussion with the Department of Finance include Government debt, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council are routine items to note.  We will try to combine our discussions with the Department of Finance, the Tax Appeals Commission and the Revenue Commissioners to one meeting on 19 April in an effort to free-up space for other hearings.  We will communicate with the Department of Finance, the Tax Appeals Commission and the Revenue Commissioners in this regard.  There is no point in our meeting only with the Department of Finance and concluding our business with it by lunch time if we can complete the work with the other organisations in the afternoon.

This was distributed across five expenditure programmes, as indicated in the figure on screen.  The largest programme was in relation to arts, culture and film, accounting for expenditure of just under &euro;174 million or 47% of the total for the year.  This included grants of &euro;60 million to the Arts Council and &euro;15.6 million to the Irish Film Board.  Funding of almost &euro;42 million was provided towards the general expenses of State museums and art galleries, with &euro;21 million spent on cultural activities, including funding of &euro;5.5 million provided to Culture Ireland.  A total of &euro;28.4 million was spent in 2016 on the programme for the Decade of Centenaries 1912 &ndash; 1922.<\/p> <p>  Chaith an Roinn &euro;53.3 milli&uacute;n ar a cl&aacute;r ar son na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus na nOile&aacute;n.

Waterways Ireland received &euro;26.6 million from Vote 33, while the Language Body received &euro;13.2 million.  I audit these and five other cross-Border bodies jointly with my counterpart in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The final programme funded under Vote 33 in 2016 related to regional development and rural affairs.  Responsibility for the programme transferred into Vote 33 as part of the restructuring of portfolios following Government formation in June 2016.  Under a further reconfiguration in July 2017, responsibility for regional development and rural affairs transferred again to the newly formed Department of Rural and Community Affairs.  Vote 33 was then renamed \"culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht\".<\/p> <p>  While responsibility for the programme was transferred into the Vote only at mid-year, the account presents the full-year Estimate and outturn for the programme in line with transfer of responsibility rules.  As shown in the account, expenditure under the rural development programme in 2016 amounted to &euro;51.7 million.  The largest elements of expenditure were just under &euro;25 million spent on national rural development schemes, &euro;10 million spent on the Leader rural economy programme and &euro;9.9 million spent on town and village regeneration.  For comparison purposes, note 6.7 showing the change from year to year has been provided.  It is not on the face of the appropriation accounts.  I have also provided a diagram for members, which aims to summarise the public bodies within the Department's aegis.  Members should note that the Western Development Commission has been under the aegis of the Department of Rural and Community Development since 2017.<\/p> <p>  I have given a clear audit opinion on the appropriation account.  However, I draw attention in the audit report to non-compliant procurement disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control and to chapters 7 and 15 of my report on the accounts of the public services for 2016.  Chapter 7 refers to the dormant account fund which was examined by the committee on 8 February.  As noted then, oversight of that fund is now the responsibility of the Department of Rural and Community Development.<\/p> <p>  Turning now to the chapter, the report before the committee this morning concerns the administration and management of the provision of &euro;8.4 million in public funds over many years to assist in the development of an art house cinema in Galway city.  The largest funding contributions came from the Department, with a final contribution of &euro;3.5 million, while Galway City Council contributed &euro;2.4 million and the Irish Film Board contributed &euro;1.1 million.<\/p> <p>  In 2006, the Department launched the second arts and culture capital enhancement support scheme, which is generally referred to as ACCESS II.  The aim of the scheme was to provide cultural and arts organisations with funding to build new cultural infrastructure and develop existing facilities.  A private company called Solas\/Galway Picture Palace Teoranta applied for funding in 2006 under the ACCESS II scheme to establish a specialist art house cinema in Galway city.  By May 2007, the total committed or projected public investment for the project amounted to &euro;6.3 million, including a &euro;2 million ACCESS ll grant.  In 2008, Galway City Council purchased a site for just under &euro;2 million and made it available to Solas under a 99 year lease.  Solas applied for and received planning permission for a 360 seat cinema complex, which represented a 30% increase in capacity relative to the original proposal.<\/p> <p>  In July 2009, following a tender competition, Solas awarded a contract for the construction of the cinema and the project commenced in the months that followed.  The project experienced significant difficulties and by June 2010, it became evident that an adjoining property was physically at risk and the work was stopped.  Following negotiations, Solas agreed to demolish and rebuild the adjoining property in October 2010.  In March 2011, the Department received notification from Solas that the building contractor was terminating the contract, citing poor ground conditions and design inadequacies.<\/p> <p>  A second construction contract was awarded by Solas in March 2012 for the remaining works.  The Department stated this was done without its knowledge or consent.  The first phase of the works covered by the second contract finished in early 2014.  No further construction or fit-out followed until, in July 2016, agreement was reached for a private investor to be granted a 30 year lease to manage and operate the cinema in return for a contribution of funds.  In July 2017, Solas entered liquidation.  I understand the cinema has been recently completed and has now commenced operations, albeit some nine years later than originally planned.<\/p> <p>  While the project was developed by a private entity with grant and other funding assistance from public funds, in practice, the State bore the project and financial risks.  There was no overall oversight arrangement in place for this project at the outset, despite the planned involvement of a variety of public agencies in funding it.  When Solas ran into difficulties, Galway City Council stepped in to take over responsibility for the project and charges on the property were registered to safeguard the State's interests.  I thank the Acting Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":207,"content":"<p>We should give the Comptroller and Auditor General a gold star for his use of Connemara Irish.

I am very pleased to have this opportunity to address the committee at what I believe is a very significant period in time for the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.<\/p> <p>  The recently announced Project Ireland 2040 sets out a roadmap for delivering on key strategic outcomes for the country, including strengthening rural economies and communities, and enhancing amenity and heritage in both urban and rural settings.  The Department will play a critical role in delivering on these strategic outcomes.<\/p> <p>  As part of Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan provides for significant and much-needed investment in our cultural infrastructure throughout the country making sure that opportunities to participate in arts and culture are available wherever one lives, not just in the cities.  It is also clear on our responsibility to protect our built and natural heritage and to enhance our visitor facilities so that more people from Ireland and abroad can experience our unique heritage tourism assets.<\/p> <p>  The sectors the Department represents are diverse and far reaching, and it is vital that we ensure the investment will be spread across all three of the Department&rsquo;s divisions - culture, heritage and Gaeltacht - so that all of the Department&rsquo;s stakeholders will see investment in their area over the lifetime of the plan. <\/p> <p>  The significant scale of the investment proposed over the ten years &ndash; approximately &euro;1.2 billion &ndash; means that it is critical that the Department develop the required capacity to deliver on the full extent of the proposed investment in the most efficient and cost-effective manner, delivering for our stakeholders across society while at the same time ensuring value for money for the Irish taxpayer.  All of the proposed investment will be underpinned by robust evaluation and appraisal methodologies, complying with the public spending code and ensuring that all investments deliver demonstrable benefits to citizens, communities and businesses across Ireland. <\/p> <p>  As Accounting Officer for the Department, I am determined to learn from any issues that have arisen in the past with a view to ensuring this programme of investment and existing programmes of investment provide the optimum value for money to the benefit of all taxpayers and communities we serve.  The Comptroller and Auditor General and this committee have an important role to play in identifying issues and in challenging and supporting the Department in addressing issues as they arise.  This is in addition to the controls and processes that are already in place within the Department.  We have worked very constructively in recent years with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, seeking its advice and input where issues arise, and taking on board its recommendations for improvements in how we govern expenditure and the management of risk within the Department. <\/p> <p>  With regard to my appearance here today, the briefing note provided to the committee outlines: the key achievements of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in 2016 by programme area; and the programme priorities of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for 2017-18 and the future.  The briefing note also provides some detail on the Galway art house cinema project which is the subject of Chapter 15 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 2016 and which opened to the public last week. <\/p> <p>  The committee will be aware that in June 2016, as part of the restructuring of Departments announced by the Taoiseach, a new Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was established.  It essentially brought together all of the functions from the then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, together with regional development and rural related functions from the then Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.<\/p> <p>  Responsibility for the regional and rural affairs functions, along with certain community functions that were previously dealt with by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, formally transferred to the new Department of Rural and Community Development with effect from 27 July 2017.  The Department was renamed the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht with effect from 1 August 2017.<\/p> <p>  The year 2016 was a very significant one for the Department as we celebrated the centenary of the Easter Rising of 1916.  The Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme was a whole-of-Government initiative, led by the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to provide the nation with the opportunity to remember and reflect on this pivotal event in our history.<\/p> <p>  There was an extensive and diverse programme of State ceremonial and public events.  An array of community-led projects was delivered throughout the country in conjunction with local authorities.  An extensive education programme was delivered across all levels, and a number of significant capital projects were completed under the permanent reminders component of the programme, including the GPO Witness History Centre, Richmond Barracks, the Kevin Barry rooms at the National Concert Hall and Ionad Cult&uacute;rtha an Phiarsaigh in Rosmuc. <\/p> <p>  As the Irish language was central to the 1916 ideal of an independent sovereign Ireland, the language was interwoven throughout the programme of events, while a distinctive range of events and activities through Irish was delivered as part of An Teanga Bheo &ndash; the living language strand of the programme.  The entire programme was underpinned by five intersecting and overlapping themes: remembering, reconciling, presenting, imagining and celebrating.<\/p> <p>  The response to the programme was a year of extraordinary participation, by all walks of life, across all of the components, ranging from concerts and exhibitions at our national cultural institutions, to schools&rsquo; activities, flag-raising ceremonies, events to remember the role of women in 1916 and, indeed, to remember the children who lost their lives during the Rising and a whole range of other shared community, historical and cultural events.  This remarkable level of participation was in many ways epitomised by the crowds of more than one million people on the streets of Dublin on Easter weekend 2016. <\/p> <p>  In December 2016 Creative Ireland was launched as the Government&rsquo;s legacy programme from the Ireland 2016 initiative and as the main implementation vehicle for the ambition set out in Culture 2025 - &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach, Ireland&rsquo;s first national cultural policy developed on foot of an extensive consultation process with stakeholders throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s proposed programme of investment under Project Ireland 2040 prioritises strategic and sustainable projects that demonstrate clear public benefits as committed to under the Cl&aacute;r &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach, the Creative Ireland programme, and goes beyond this to deliver much-needed investment in our national parks, monuments, built and natural heritage, language and islands. <\/p> <p>  Ensuring that we take the lessons from the past as we move towards a 10 year investment programme in culture and heritage is critically important and I therefore welcome the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General as outlined in Chapter 15 of the 2016 report.  That chapter examined the administration and management of the Galway art house cinema project, including funding and payments made by the Department and other public bodies related to the new cinema.  There were two recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General on foot of this detailed examination, both of which I have accepted in full in my capacity as Accounting Officer for the Department. <\/p> <p>  The first recommendation was that the Department should review its approach to the projects that are being grant aided, in particular where the key project risks are carried by the State.  Where projects do not progress as expected or serious shortcomings are identified with the project sponsor, early action needs to be taken, including formal reviews of the project viability, in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s public spending code requirements. <\/p> <p>  I can assure the committee that the Department is fully committed to ensuring that all projects are effectively managed in accordance with the public spending code and relevant grant circulars.  Measures are in place to ensure that staff are appropriately trained and supported in the appraisal and oversight of grant-aided projects as part of the Department&rsquo;s annual quality assurance process, and the Department held a number of training sessions around the appraisal and management of capital projects in 2016 and, as promised to the Comptroller and Auditor General, in 2017, and as recently as March 2018. <\/p> <p>  The second recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General was that particular care should be exercised by lead funders to ensure adequate formal oversight mechanisms are in place and operated where a variety of funding agencies are involved. <\/p> <p>  Once again, I reiterate my commitment as Accounting Officer to ensure that all projects are managed in accordance with the provisions of the public spending code and relevant circulars.  The training provided to staff in the past two years has emphasised the importance of the early establishment of performance metrics to be used as a signal for action during the implementation phase, the need for regular management reports to be provided and reviewed, and how best to deal with project challenges. <\/p> <p>  In addition, I wish to advise the committee that the Department is participating in an organisational capability review, to be conducted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform later this year.  The purpose of these reviews, which are being rolled out across all Departments under the Civil Service renewal programme, are to embed a culture of regular and objective assessments of the capacity and capability of the Department to achieve its objectives.  While only a small number of Departments or agencies have been reviewed to date, I had actively sought to have an early review of this Department, and I believe this will prepare us well to deal with the challenges that lie ahead as we move towards implementation of a ten-year capital investment programme.<\/p><p> I am establishing an advisory group within the Department to contribute to both the preparatory work and the delivery phases of the review, which is due to commence in the second half of 2018, and will ensure that the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts will be taken into account in the review process.  I am confident that this review will facilitate the Department in building the required capacity for the effective evaluation, appraisal and management of capital projects.  It will identify the skills, structures, processes and personnel needed on top of what we already have, and determine whether such structures need to be put in place to deliver effectively for all our stakeholders, which include the taxpayer.  I am happy to expand on any of these areas, or explore any other areas as the committee wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Katherine Licken","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I thank the witness for that comprehensive opening statement.

I cannot think of a more inappropriate name in light of the history of this.  I have to declare that I was on the council for a period of time and this is a difficult topic.  Despite the word \"Solas\", there was an absence of light in the way this was handled.  I will ask a few quick questions on it.  As a councillor, I, along with a number of other councillors, struggled to ask questions about this.  I will be coming back to this later in regard to Foras na Gaeilge and other projects.  This is a small country, with small cities.  Very often asking questions is not rewarded, which is what we have seen here at the Committee of Public Accounts.  However, it is extremely important to ask questions.<\/p> <p>  In regard to art, which I will come back to, there is a perception that one is a philistine if one questions it.

The figure of &euro;593,000 was to be paid for the first 15 years and for the next 15 years &euro;63,000 a year would be taken off that for refurbishment costs at four quarterly repayments.

To me it looks like a calamity of errors from 2006 to 2018.  I will not go over it all again because the witnesses have answered enough questions on it.  I cannot understand how that could have happened given that professional people were brought in and four site investigations were carried out with architects and engineers.  Ground conditions seem to have been the problem.  There was water logging.  Ground works were carried out and then a neighbouring property was damaged and that had to be rebuilt.  To me, that is laughable.  Professional people were involved who were supposed to have degrees and accreditation to carry out site visits and yet we see what happened.  That does not make sense.  It does not add up.  It is poor project management.  Who is paying for it?  The taxpayer.  A total of &euro;8.4 million was spent.  I will not say it has gone down the Swanee because at least we have a cinema there.  It took a private operator to come in and finish the project.  Questions must be asked all around.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for his analysis today and what was presented.  It shows that there was something seriously wrong.  Why are there not better systems in place to stop that happening?  It took 12 years for the project to come to a conclusion.

If there are two, the tender competitions potentially put one out of business for five years during the term of the contract.  Therefore, anything to do with island transport services is extremely emotive and gets island communities extremely exercised.  That does not detract from the fact that there are no exemptions for us from using public tendering procedures.  That can create a difficulty.  The other difficulty is that when one is dealing with a very small market, one has to leave the tender conditions and the conditions to be complied with as open as possible in order to encourage competition.  If we were to have specified that a vessel could not be older than ten years, for example, the likelihood is that we would have got no tenders for that service.  Where would we have been left then given our obligation to provide what is a lifeline service to the islands?  We have to take these points into account.

The buildings, Nos. 14 to 17, are owned by the Department.  They have been declared as a national monument.  We are still technically within the period of appeal in the Court of Appeal so, in fairness, I cannot really comment on costs at this point but I know that Hammerson, which is the developer for the rest of the site that comprises Moore Street to O'Connell Street, is meeting today the advisory committee the Minister established to go through its plans for the entire area.  Once we are out of the appeal period in the court case, we then have to look at our plans for the buildings, Nos. 14 to 17.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018032900002#BB02900","nonspeaker":"Ms Katherine Licken","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1522310400,"counter":797,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Committee of Public Accounts, I thank all our witnesses from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for participating in the meeting and for the material they have supplied.
