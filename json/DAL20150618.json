What we are looking at is a situation in which, to meet the ongoing demand for about &euro;1 million per annum, it has been decided to sell, if not the family silver, art works which were intended to be retained at Russborough House.  There is a lot of public confusion about what the position is between the Alfred Beit Foundation and the State.  It would useful, therefore, if in the course of this debate we were to clarify for the public that the 17 masterpieces bequeathed to the National Gallery of Ireland are in it and secure.

That was the first time I met the chairperson of the foundation, several months after it had entered into an agreement with Christie's to have the paintings sold.  During my meeting with the chairperson on Tuesday evening I made it clear that it would have been preferable if the trustees had come to me before making their decision to sell the paintings.  The fact that they are now in an auction house in London makes this, as I said, a very difficult situation to unravel.  Regardless of this, the fact remains that the Alfred Beit Foundation is an independent trust and I cannot instruct it on how it should do its business.  I draw the Deputy's attention to what it stated in a press release yesterday:<blockquote>The Alfred Beit Foundation (ABF) is the owner of the relevant paintings at the centre of the current sales; these paintings were not left to the State by the Beits ...

There may well be a link between at least some of the burning and other clearance of vegetation to ensure land is eligible for the basic payment scheme beginning this year.  The scheme is administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  While land eligibility is primarily a matter for that Department, my Department has raised concerns about ecological and other risks posed by inappropriate burning arising from eligibility issues under the basic payment scheme.

Before I answer his question, I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the late Bill O'Herlihy.

He was utterly committed to the role and had so many ideas and suggestions for the industry.  We travelled together to the film festival in Cannes, where we met Pinewood Studios and discussed plans for Ireland.  Bill was so looking forward to an exciting future for the Irish film industry.  His presence will be greatly missed.  I will personally miss him as a source of sound advice and would like to express my sympathies to his wife, Hilary, and to his daughters and all of his family.<\/p>  <p>  The Government recognises the value of the audiovisual industry in its contribution to the economy and to employment and will continue to take measures to support the industry.  Primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland, in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions, lies with the Irish Film Board.  This includes assistance with locations for the making of films.  In 2015, I approved a provision of &euro;14.6 million for the film board, which maintained its funding at the same level as in 2014.  The allocation of resources from within that provision is a matter for the film board, as the statutorily independent agency responsible for the promotion and development of the Irish film industry.<\/p>  <p>  The other primary mechanism by which the Government supports the film industry is through section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 - the film tax relief scheme.  This scheme has undergone a number of improvements which took effect in January this year.  These changes have been very well-received and were developed following consultations between my Department, the Irish Film Board, the Department of Finance and the audiovisual industry.  The intention is to ensure Ireland remains competitive in attracting film projects.  The film tax relief scheme has been extended to the end of 2020 and I am confident this will increase the attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for film investment and allow the audiovisual production sector to maintain existing jobs and create new ones.  In this regard, Departments and public agencies are often key in assisting film companies in providing locations and other supports for film-making.<\/p>  <p>  An interdepartmental group comprising officials from my Department and other relevant Departments and agencies was also established recently to examine and report on recommendations to increase foreign and domestic investment in Ireland&rsquo;s film and TV sound stage studio infrastructure in the face of growing demand for audiovisual content across multiple platforms.

While the relocation has become a priority under this Government's term, is it not the case that the only successful relocations to date have resulted from the facilitative work of a former Deputy, Mr. Paul Connaughton Snr.-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800008#F00900","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1434619200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800008#F01000","speaker":"973"},{"type":"speech","time":1434619200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>-----and that the Minister's Department and its senior officials have singularly failed to achieve any scale of relocation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800008#F01100","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1434619200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>This Government has put in place more resources and made greater efforts to resolve the issue of protecting Ireland's SAC raised bogs than any previous government.

Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas will be aware that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission came into being on 1 January 2004 under the terms of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act of 2003.  The commission is the governing board which oversees the provision of services to the Houses of the Oireachtas and its Members by the parliamentary administration, the Houses of the Oireachtas Service.<\/p><p>The commission has a very extensive range of responsibilities.  They include the payment of the salaries of Deputies and Senators, the salaries of Irish Members of the European Parliament and the salaries of the staff of the Oireachtas Service.  The commission is also responsible for the payment of the salaries of the secretarial assistants working for non-officeholding Members, the travel allowances for which Members are eligible and the payment of pensions to former Members.  <br\/><br\/>Since its establishment, the commission has overseen the smooth running of services to both Houses and introduced a number of significant improvements in the services provided for Members and the wider public, including arranging for the televising of proceedings of both Houses and committees.  The commission is a statutory corporate body and independent in the performance of its functions.  It is accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas and has responsibility for ensuring value for money is achieved.  It considers and determines policy on the Oireachtas Service and oversees the implementation of that policy by the Secretary General of the service.<br\/><br\/>The commission is composed of 11 members under the chairmanship of the Ceann Comhairle.  The Cathaoirleach of the Seanad is an <i>ex officio<\/i>member.  There are also seven ordinary members, four from the D&aacute;il and three from the Seanad who are appointed by the Members of each House, and one representative of the Minister, who would be a Member of one of the Houses.  The final position on the commission is allocated to the person who, as stipulated in the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Act 2009, &quot;for the time being holds the office of the Clerk of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and (who) may also be referred to as the Secretary General of the (Oireachtas) Service&quot;.  The Act states the Secretary General is to be the chief executive of the Oireachtas Commission and the officer accountable for the accounts of the commission for the purposes of the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts, 1866 to 1998.<br\/><br\/>The Clerk of the D&aacute;il post encompasses functions as set out in D&aacute;il Standing Orders, as well as specified functions as set out under the electoral Acts and related legislation.  The Clerk of the D&aacute;il is the chief procedural adviser to the House and the Ceann Comhairle and the registrar of political parties.  He or she is required to carry out specific functions related to the D&aacute;il, Seanad, presidential and European election process and is <i>ex officio <\/i>a member of the Constituency Commission, the Referendum Commission and the Standards in Public Office Commission.  Under section 15 of the commission Acts, the person who holds the position of Clerk of the D&aacute;il is also Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas Service.  He or she has been specifically allocated a very extensive range of administrative duties under the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission legislation.  These duties include the following: managing and controlling the staff and administration of the Oireachtas Service; implementing and monitoring the policies of the Oireachtas Commission appropriate to that service and delivering outputs as determined by the commission; providing advice for the Oireachtas Commission and the Ceann Comhairle on the performance of their legislative functions under the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Acts; providing advice for the commission on any matter connected with the responsibilities of the Oireachtas which would give rise to expenditure on the Oireachtas accounts; examining and developing means that will improve the provision by the Oireachtas Service of cost effective services; subject to the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956 and the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004, managing matters related to appointments, performance, discipline and dismissals of staff below the grade of principal officer, or the equivalent, in the Oireachtas Service; assigning responsibility for the performance of the functions for which the Secretary General is responsible to members of the staff of the Oireachtas Service of an appropriate grade or rank in order to ensure coherence of policy across the service; and ensuring appropriate arrangements are put in place to facilitate an effective response to matters pertaining to both the service and other branches of the public service.<br\/><br\/>Under the commission Acts, the Secretary General is the chief executive of the commission.  Acting in all capacities represents a formidable series of procedural, electoral, administrative and governance tasks for the leading official of the Oireachtas Service.  Certainly, the service and the Oireachtas as a whole were very fortunate to have been served by the outgoing Clerk of the D&aacute;il, Mr. Kieran Coughlan.  Kieran, with whom I worked very closely, was appointed Clerk of the D&aacute;il in the early 1990s, having already served in the Oireachtas Service for some considerable period before that.  He was able to provide a hugely valuable source of knowledge and experience during the years, especially during the bedding down of the commission following its establishment under the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act, 2003.  His tenure came to an end in 2013 and it was necessary for detailed consideration to be given to how the resultant vacancy should be filled.<br\/><br\/>Under the current legislative arrangements, the Clerk of the D&aacute;il is appointed by the Taoiseach on the recommendation of the Ceann Comhairle, following consultation with the Oireachtas Commission.  Where the Ceann Comhairle, following such consultation, is satisfied that no member of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas is suitable for appointment, he or she may recommend for appointment a person who is not on the staff of the Houses.  If the Ceann Comhairle, after consultation with the commission, fails to recommend a person for appointment, the Taoiseach has the power to nominate a person from within the staff of the Houses for appointment and, with the concurrence of the D&aacute;il, appoint that person.  Where the Taoiseach is satisfied that no member of the staff of the Houses is suitable, he or she may nominate a person who is not on the staff of the Houses.  It can be seen from this arrangement that, in the first instance at least, eligibility for appointment as Clerk of the D&aacute;il is confined to existing staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas and that other persons are excluded from the process, unless no member of the staff of the Houses is considered suitable.  <br\/><br\/>The previous Government had indicated its desire to change this arrangement.  On Second Stage of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill in 2009 the then Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who was piloting the Bill stated the following:<blockquote>The distinct role of the Civil Service staff and senior management structures of the Oireachtas is specifically recognised in the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act, 1959.  These structures have served both Houses extremely well and remained in place following the establishment of the commission in 2003.  However, significant changes in Civil Service management systems have taken place in the 50 years since the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act, 1959 came into force and it is accepted that the configuration in that Act, particularly in terms of senior management structures, needs to be modernised.  In that regard, the Minister is committed to ensuring, in co-operation with the commission, that the administrative structures of the Oireachtas do not become out of step with Civil Service norms in terms of adapting flexibly to the needs and demands of modern management practices.<\/blockquote>The Government is in full accord with that viewpoint.  It agrees that the current arrangements for the appointment of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il are out of kilter with the general arrangements for the system for senior appointments, notably the TLAC system.  This system incorporates nomination by boards comprising a majority of members from the private sector with specific skills in management and human resources and provides opportunities for new blood to be introduced into public service organisations.  This is the way the appointment of all Secretaries General and senior appointments are now made across the Civil Service.  The Government is of the view that the Clerk of the D&aacute;il should be appointed through a professionally organised and independent competitive selection mechanism, as that in place in the wider public service, to ensure the best possible person is selected from as broad as possible a pool of talent to lead the Oireachtas Service into the future.  This stance is in complete accordance with the thrust of Government policy in recent years and, particularly, contents of the Civil Service renewal plan published by the Government last year.  That plan referred to the need for continuous improvement and adaptation to change on the part of the State's administrative system.  It indicated that public service organisations needed, in an era of increased demand for services and reduced staff numbers, to maximise performance levels, keep structures and processes up to date and be continually open to external ideas and trends.<br\/><br\/>In the context of the Oireachtas Service, the drive to attain such goals will be a major responsibility for the incoming Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  The new postholder will be expected to play a key role in providing procedural advice and expertise for the Ceann Comhairle and Members of the D&aacute;il; overseeing the sittings of the D&aacute;il, in particular the provision of critical support services for the D&aacute;il; dealing with parliamentary reform and ongoing procedural developments; managing staff performance and underperformance; raising morale and productivity among staff; creating opportunities for staff to develop their talents; strengthening strategic planning capacity; assigning the appropriate staff to the right areas in order that they can encourage and develop excellence and drive the modernisation process in the Oireachtas Service and, overall, ensuring the Oireachtas Service has a strong culture of leadership, excellence and continuous development.<\/p><p>In that light, the Government decided that heads of a Bill should be prepared to provide for the appointment of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il by the Oireachtas Commission on the recommendation of the Ceann Comhairle following an open competition organised by the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, which will make recommendations for appointment to the Ceann Comhairle.  At the same time, in the context of the relationship between the Executive and the Legislature, the Government was most anxious that due weight would be given to the views of the Oireachtas as a whole on what was being proposed.  Accordingly, in the course of last year, I referred this proposal to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform for its consideration.  In due course, the committee reverted to the Government, indicating that it did not wish to record conclusions or recommendations on the draft heads.  On that basis, the Government has proceeded on the lines set out in the draft Bill.  I would be very happy, of course, to hear, as I say, with a very open mind, the views of others of these matters which are within the purview of the Houses as opposed to the Government.  I will take careful note of views expressed. <br\/><br\/>I will go through the Bill very quickly.  The first section deals with amendments to the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act, 1959.  The first subsection defines the 1959 Act.  The second provides that the Clerk of the D&aacute;il shall be appointed by the Oireachtas Commission on the recommendation of the Ceann Comhairle; this recommendation shall be made by the Ceann Comhairle from among the persons selected by the Top Level Appointments Committee; and the selection shall be based on an open competition, that is to say, one not confined to persons who are civil servants.  The subsection also provides for a similar arrangement to be used in the event of the TLAC system being replaced at some time in the future by another system.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il post, the Government proposes that arrangements following the enactment of the Bill for the filling of three other posts in the Oireachtas Service - the Clerk of the Seanad, the Clerk Assistant of the D&aacute;il and the Clerk Assistant of the Seanad - be altered.  The rank of the officers concerned, not more than the equivalent of principal officer, is appreciably lower than that of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and the involvement of the TLAC, therefore, would not be appropriate.  Rather, under the third subsection, the appointment will be made by the Oireachtas Commission on the recommendation of the Ceann Comhairle or the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, as the case may be.  It is envisaged that the Clerk of the D&aacute;il will have a crucial input into the deliberative process before the recommendation of either the Ceann Comhairle or the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad is made.  This is in norm in what happens in Departments, where there is normally an input from the Secretary General in appointments below him in the Department. <br\/><br\/>Section 1(4) provides for the imposition of a time limit on the tenure for persons appointed to the posts of Clerk of the D&aacute;il, Clerk of the Seanad, Clerk Assistant of the D&aacute;il and Clerk Assistant of the Seanad following the enactment of this legislation.  Subsection (5) provides for the exemption of existing postholders from the arrangements which I have outlined.  The posts of Clerk of the Seanad and the Clerk Assistants of both Houses are filled.<br\/><br\/>This constitutes the major part of what is a short Bill.  There are a number of other items included in it which I wish to bring to the attention of the House.  <br\/><br\/>Section 2 is a technical provision which amends section 13(3)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act, 2003 which provides that a statement of Estimates of the commission shall be furnished by the Secretary General to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform not later than 30 days before the presentation by the Minister to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Estimates of the receipts and expenditure for that year.  It is proposed that the 30 day provision be removed to allow time for the Oireachtas Service to submit Estimates much closer to the budget in the light of the reduced interval between the end of the summer recess and an earlier budget day which now must, in accordance with the European semester, be in mid-October.  In 2013 and 2014 the changing of the date of the budget from early December to mid-October compelled the Oireachtas Service to finalise the next year's Estimate during the summer, in advance of the half-yearly figures becoming available.  It made a strong case to me in that regard.  The service will, therefore, benefit from the opportunity to finalise its figures in September-October, when current year expenditure trends are much clearer.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Section 3 provides for the performance by a designated official of the duties of the Secretary General of the Oireachtas Commission in his or her absence or when the post is vacant.  This fills a lacuna in the existing legislation, where such statutory power is not provided.  <br\/><br\/>Section 4 provides for the repeal of the provision in the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004 which excluded the TLAC as an element of the appointment process to appoint the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  I advise the House that this section will be the subject of a technical amendment on Committee Stage.  <br\/><br\/>Section 5 contains standard provisions dealing with the Short Title, construction and citations.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800010#H01700","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434621600,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba mhaith liom leithsc&eacute;al a ghabh&aacute;il ar son an Teachta Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Pl&eacute;amonn.  Eisean an saineola&iacute; ar an &aacute;bhar agus ar an reachta&iacute;ocht seo ach n&iacute; f&eacute;idir leis bheith i l&aacute;thair.  I wish to make it very clear that anything we may have to say about this legislation in no way reflects on the Ceann Comhairle or the previous or acting Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  The Minister referred to the former Clerk of the D&aacute;il, Mr. Kieran Coughlan, who in my estimation was one of the finest public servants I had ever met and who gave this House very distinguished service for many years in a quiet, calm and collected way.  Equally, it has to be said that since his departure Mr. Peter Finnegan and Mr. Michael Errity and all of the Clerk Assistants have distinguished themselves in the quality of the work they do in a quiet and dignified manner.<\/p><p>Over two years ago, on 15 May, a Topical Issue was raised by Fianna F&aacute;il in this House on the need to amend the legislation governing the appointment of senior management in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In that debate the points were made that there was serious concern about the delay in bringing forward amending legislation to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act to modernise the senior management structures in the Houses of the Oireachtas, in particular, the method of appointment of staff.  Modernising legislation was promised as far back, as the Minister said, as 2009 and also in 2012.  In his initial reply the Minister agreed and made a commitment.  He said, &quot;I believe the objective in filling top posts in the Houses of the Oireachtas Service should be to employ professionally organised and independent competitive selection mechanisms such as those that exist throughout the wider Civil Service to ensure the best possible person is selected from as wide a pool of talent as possible to lead the parliamentary service in future.&quot;  At the time, it became clear that there was a different opinion on how this position should be filled.  In his final reply the Minister gave an indication as to why the legislation would be delayed for more than two years when he said:<blockquote>I am old-fashioned in these matters.  As a matter of courtesy I believe I should explain my position.  It has been the subject of discussions between services in the Department of Finance, as was, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as is, and the official services here.  I have held preliminary discussions with the Ceann Comhairle.  I wish to conclude that process and then bring legislation to Government and, I hope, to the Houses speedily.  I imagine it will not be challenging legislation.  <\/blockquote>We all know that there was then a stand-off, which was reported widely in the press.  The Minister finally published draft heads of the Bill in February 2012 which were considered by the Joint Committee on Public Expenditure and Reform in March 2015, as the Minister said.  The draft heads, however, remain unchanged and are the same as those included in the Bill before the House.  The submissions to the committee were not taken on board and they included the recommendations made by the interdepartmental group consisting of the Minister's officials and Oireachtas Service officials, to which he made reference when replying to the Topical Issues debate in 2013.  The group recommended a flexible approach in order that the Clerk of the D&aacute;il role could still be combined with the chief executive officer functions or kept separate, depending on need.  Fundamentally, the top position should be filled on a CEO skills set basis and through an open competition.<\/p><p>The 1959 officers of the House category should also be removed to allow for full mobility and integration among senior management, while retaining Clerk functions on a more flexible basis of assignment.  The Bill is unchanged and minimalist, and is not fit for purpose for a parliamentary administration for the 21st century.  It keeps the 1959 appointments structure where the officer of the House positions are now in the gift of the chairman of each House, except for the Clerk of the D&aacute;il position, which now goes to the top level appointments committee, TLAC.  The Bill does not include the integrated senior management structure as proposed in the interdepartmental parliamentary services reform group, PSRG.  It is not very reforming and is disappointing in its under-achievement.<br\/><br\/>The key question is why the chairman of each House has been given the power to appoint officers of the House, other than the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, without a competitive process, thereby creating two streams of advancement for a civil servant in the Oireachtas, one by competition and one by favour of the chairman.  Why has the Ceann Comhairle been given such a prominent role in both the nomination and appointment process of the top civil servant in the Oireachtas service, the Clerk of the D&aacute;il?  Would the best practice espoused by the Commission for Public Service Appointments, which has the Ceann Comhairle as <i>ex officio<\/i>chair, not dictate that there should be clear water between the nomination and appointment processes?  Such a potential conflict was thought unwise when the 1959 Act was going through the Houses, so why has that wisdom been abandoned at this point when it has served us well over the years?<br\/><br\/>Why is there no provision in the Bill to cater for disagreement on the nomination or appointment of a candidate?  Even the 1959 Act had such a provision.  What happens if the Ceann Comhairle does not agree with any of the recommendations made by the TLAC board, refuses to nominate any of them and the appointment process is stalled?  Why have party and group leaders been excluded from being consulted in the appointment of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il?  There was an informal arrangement under the 1959 Act, but Members are excluded under this Bill.  Given the issues raised, how will the recruitment of a Clerk of the D&aacute;il provided for under the Bill meet the Minister's commitment to &quot;have the chief executive of the service selected from as wide a pool as possible in line with top level appointments in the Civil Service generally&quot;?<br\/><br\/>We have a common purpose here.  We all want to see the best person appointed to this role in the future.  What is at issue is the methodology to be used to achieve that objective.  In the past, those appointed to the role have distinguished themselves in the quality of the service they have given.  We share a common objective to have people appointed in a fair, open and transparent manner so the honourable service of the past can be continued with distinction into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800012#K00300","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434622200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, labhr&oacute;idh m&eacute; beag&aacute;n faoin duine a bh&iacute; sa phost roimhe seo, an tUasal Kieran Coughlan.  We remember the work Kieran did in his quiet, mild manner.  When we were first elected to the House one of the first people we met was the then Clerk of the D&aacute;il and a relationship with him grew.  It was not political in any sense.  He was a classic civil servant and I still do not know what his political views are.  In many ways, what the Minister is asking us to do today is to put in place an appointments system which will put somebody like him in that position in the future, somebody who can rise above the party political rows and arguments we have and the party political demands we will make and work according to the rules that are set out.<\/p><p>The Minister outlined the responsibilities of those who take up the role of Clerk of the D&aacute;il and Clerk Assistant.  It is an onerous job.  What we are discussing today is ensuring that we have a mechanism in the future that we can stand over and that is not party political in any sense.  That is where some of my problems with the Bill lie.  The intention is to ensure that it will never be in the gift of a political party in the future to appoint somebody of such importance.  The job is important.  The Minister listed a number of the duties involved.  I will not repeat them but the tasks we are giving are onerous.  The Minister only listed seven of them, but there are many more and I will refer to some of them later.  The advantage Kieran had, as well as those who have undertaken his role since then without being appointed to it, is that it cannot be said that any of them is political.  One could not do one's job if somebody in that position was partisan.<\/p><p>The problem I have is that a large onus is now being put on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  I have argued with the Minister, as I argued in the last D&aacute;il, that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission does not fully reflect the membership of the D&aacute;il or Seanad.  It also does not fully reflect the services of the House.  I have tabled amendments to deal with this.  The staff should be represented, even in an <i>ex officio<\/i>role.  The political parties should be reflected in the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  For example, my party does not have a representative on the commission, nor does the Technical Group.  More than half of the Opposition in the Chamber is not represented on it, so we do not have a role or voice in this matter, in the duties that have been given or in everything else the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission must do.<\/p><p>When I see an appointment that is party political, I am happy to point that out and have done so in the past.  Given the role we are discussing, I do not believe that will ever happen again.  Ireland has grown up and we will ensure that the holders of the four positions listed in the Bill are reflective of Kieran, that is, proper civil servants who do not reflect their political views, regardless of what they are, in their daily work and the onerous tasks they undertake.  They are chief executives or Secretaries General of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.<\/p><p>It is strange that they can appoint their second in command, the Clerk Assistant.  It might be appropriate that this appointment should be through the same process as the process for appointing the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, rather than the Clerk appointing whoever is to replace him or her if they are out sick.  The Clerk Assistant's job is take on the full role in the event of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il being indisposed.  It is an onerous position.<\/p><p>We have changed the way in which the Houses of the Oireachtas are run.<\/p><p>The experiment of setting up the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission as a separate company with chief executives is working well, albeit that there are major problems associated with the running of the Houses.  There are staff and cost issues.  We need to get it across to the public that this building or institution costs money, whether they like it or not.  If one wishes to have a democracy, one has to invest.  One must invest in the best possible equipment required to carry out one's duties.  The number of duties has been increasing.<\/p> <p> When I first became a Member, most of the mail that came to me was in an envelope.  I am not here that long but most of the mail I get now is e-mail.  This represents a change.  I am thankful that the Houses of the Oireachtas have managed to keep step but sometimes naysayers on the outside say those within are looking after themselves, with new computers or by spending money on Oireachtas TV, for example.  I am not one of those who will ever shy away from ensuring the vast majority of the public can gain access to information on what is happening in the Houses as quickly as possible.  We should allow as much access as possible, although I sometimes complain about too much public access to Members by the public.  One would probably prefer never to see some of the e-mails one gets.<\/p> <p> We all have a job.  Ultimately, when we enter this Chamber on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, and nowadays on Friday, we want it to work well.  The person taking this on will be the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  I find it strange that there are other very highly paid personnel in the Houses whose functions I do not fully know to this day.  If one were to stick by the list of duties and responsibilities of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, one would believe they would be out of a job.  The Minister turned around and said the duties are to manage and control staff - I believed that was the superintendent's job - in addition to administration, providing advice and managing staff performance and underperformance.  I am not taking away from the duties.  They reflect how onerous the position is.  There is a list of nine key duties, but there are more, including creating opportunities for staff.  These duties are onerous, which means the Clerk should have the overall running of this institution in the palm of his or her hand.  The Clerk must ensure he or she delivers a functioning Parliament.  This is not just an institution; it is a Parliament.  We have to have the tools required to deliver the legislation that is required and reflects the issues that arise in modern society, both at home and abroad.  Staff should have a comfortable workplace and their hours should not be too onerous.  There are occasions when we, as politicians, demand that they be here at the drop of a hat.  We might have signed up to that.  They might have signed up to it but sometimes I doubt that they understood fully that they had to be here at 12 o'clock at night or whatever.  Thus far, I have not heard of major chaos arising but there are problems.  I hope problems can be managed through the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission with gusto when the Clerk of the D&aacute;il is appointed.  There is a greater demand on us, as I stated.<\/p> <p> We need to ensure the process of appointment to the position is as robust as possible.  I do not have an alternative to the Ceann Comhairle being the final---<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800013#L00200","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434622800,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Recommender.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800014#M00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1434622800,"counter":111,"content":"<p>One might consider the committee or Minister in this regard but, wherever one looks, somebody will contradict one.  There needs to be some reflection on all the various components of the Houses of the Oireachtas in the making of the appointment.  Nothing would be worse than having someone's disgruntlement with an appointment causing tensions that should never arise between a Clerk and Oireachtas Members.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, I would argue with the Minister.  Maybe he can reflect on it.  If there is future legislation to change the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, the Minister should ensure its members reflect the party composition of the Houses.  In the past, it was argued there is a cost.  I am a firm believer there should not be a major cost associated with having Oireachtas Members on a committee.  Many of us are on several committees and there is no major remuneration, if any.  It is part of our duties.  In this regard, parties with more than a certain number of Members get paid.  We are recognised in terms of leaders' allowances.  In some ways, one is already paid in that part of one's duty is to service institutions in which one is serving.  Perhaps we could increase the membership on the commission by three to five people, or perhaps not.  However, at the very least, the composition should reflect the party membership.  In theory, the members are directors of a company.  Anybody who understands company law will understand directors of a company are not serving their own interests but those of the company primarily.  In theory, one leaves one's politics at the door of a commission meeting and serves the company.  This might need to be reflected in any changes made to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  The commission works well, and did in the past in terms of some of the committees.  We work collegially on most of the committees.  It is really only on legislation that Members divide on party grounds.  Some of the Labour Party Members have been more forceful in arguing with the Minister on social protection than I have been.  However, when there is legislation, they are whipped in a certain way.  By contrast, in a company or the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, the directors are not whipped in a certain way.  The issue before the commission members is the running of the Houses and we must determine the best possible arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  My main gripe is that this matter is out of our hands in some ways.  It is a pity the legislation has taken this long because a very capable person has been in a position for too long without having had the opportunity to put his name forward for the full position.  He might not wish to do so.  There are others who are sitting in the background waiting.  It should not have taken this long.  It is not major legislation and we should have been able to pass it much quicker.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800014#M00300","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1434622800,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Finian McGrath.<\/p>  <p>  I am in two minds about this Bill.  It is laudable that it is intended to have an open competition for the position of Clerk but the essence of the Bill represents a missed opportunity, more of the same and a failure to modernise.  I wish to preface my remarks by joining previous speakers in saying that anything I say about the appointment to positions in the Civil Service, particularly the position of Clerk, in the past, present or future, in no way reflects on any individuals.<\/p><p>As was the case with the two previous speakers, I did not get an opportunity when he was leaving to pay tribute to the previous Clerk of the D&aacute;il for the extraordinary work he did.  I knew him better during his period as Clerk of the Seanad when he was an extraordinarily able, very helpful, Member-friendly but firm guide to people when they needed help.  I remember how on one occasion I looked to him for sympathy after I was kicked out of the Seanad and got none, which was perfectly justifiable in the circumstances as I was out of order.  I realised at the time that he was utterly fair and he was certainly the finest civil servant I have come across in my 35 years here in terms of knowledge, experience and impartiality.  He served taoisigh and Members well, which is an extraordinary combination.  The unanimous support for that is a tribute to him here today.<\/p> <p> My problem with the Bill is that it was the opportunity we expected for some modernisation of appointments in the Civil Service, particularly in this House.  Perhaps it is because we do not have time to investigate it but during my time here, I have always been completely boggle-eyed by how appointments are made.  I still do not know how the appointments of the Superintendent, the middle grades in the Library and Research Service or the ushers are made.  I am not saying that anything is wrong.  I just do not know.  There is no process.  People are not told.  They just happen.  They appear and go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800014#M00400","speaker":"953","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434623400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Open competition through the Public Appointments Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800015#N00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1434623400,"counter":115,"content":"<p>That may be the case.  It is something that should be far more transparent because when it is shrouded in this sort of mystery, one wonders how the appointments are made.  This Bill is certainly underwhelming in that it does not fulfil the promises made to make appointments in this House more transparent, radical and modern.  The very odd two-year delay in making these appointments and bringing this Bill forward makes one wonder whether there was some strange, behind-the-scenes political tussle about who made the appointment of the Clerk.  This should have happened automatically and immediately.  Certainly, the fact that there was a vacancy for so long is a reflection of the kind of paralysis that seizes politicians and the tensions that arise when such a key appointment is to be made.<\/p>  <p>  Whereas there is obviously an aspiration, intention and achievement in the appointment of the Clerk, the other appointments dealt with in this Bill leave much to be desired and do not address the difficulty of having a two-tier system.  There is no radical reform in this Bill and presumably, the radical reform of the way appointments are made in this House has now been buried.  Having promised so much in the D&aacute;il in May 2013 and even more expansively in correspondence to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, the Minister has failed in this Bill to deliver his commitment to \"ensure the modernisation of the senior management structures of the Houses of the Oireachtas Service\".  Instead, we have a sticking plaster to an outmoded structure of Clerks and Clerk-Assistant appointments under the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act 1959, with which the Minister will be familiar.  As he promised in May 2013, the Minister should have repealed the 1959 Act and taken the opportunity to put in place a more flexible, modern and integrated management structure to ensure the Houses of the Oireachtas service can meet the challenges of supporting Parliament in the 21st century.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has claimed that this Bill strengthens the independence of Parliament as the Taoiseach, in effect, the Government, is removed from the appointments process.  While any proposal that furthers the independence of Parliament would be welcome, especially as it would be so rare, the Minister knows full well that this will not be achieved in this Bill regardless of the spin that is put on it.  For the first time ever, the Chairman of each House will have a dual key role in both nominating and appointing candidates to the Clerk and Clerk-Assistant positions in either House.  The Minister knows that allowing the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to formally carry out the appointment is not as transparent or accountable as he would like us to believe in that the Ceann Comhairle is the Chair and the Cathaoirleach is the Deputy Chair of that body.  In effect, the appointment process will amount to no more than a rubber-stamping of the appointment of the Ceann Comhairle or Cathaoirleach's nominee.  Surely this is unheard of in terms of public service recruitment.  Why should the Houses of the Oireachtas service be unique in the public service in that a senior public appointment can be made by a politician without any competition, as will be the case under this Bill in the case of the positions of Clerk-Assistant of the D&aacute;il and Clerk and Clerk-Assistant in the Seanad?  What does this say to us about how the Minister would like this place administered?  The fact that the Clerk's position is embedded within an open competition in this Bill clouds the fact that those other positions will still be appointed in a totally unacceptable way.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill creates twin-track promotion, one by the standard public service competition and the other on a nod from the Chairman of either House without any requirement to have a competition on merit.  How will such a twin-track system motivate hard-working officials here in the Houses of the Oireachtas service and talented people outside that the Minister wants to attract to come to work in Leinster House when these senior jobs could be open to the old-style political favouritism of an officeholder?<\/p>  <p>  Retaining appointments of officers of the Houses under the 1959 Act means that an integrated management system, which is standard best practice in any modern public service organisation, is near to impossible.  What is the point in having a CEO if half the senior staff are not open to being moved by him or her to another position on a need and skills basis?  In effect, the Bill has turned the public service management system on its head rather uniquely for the Houses of the Oireachtas service but not elsewhere where the Minister espouses modernisation, flexibility and mobility.  The Minister compounds this lack of flexibility and mobility by retaining the mandatory link between the more senior position of Clerk of the D&aacute;il and CEO-Secretary General functions.  In doing so, the Bill has binned the flexibility approach, as recommended by the interparliamentary group consisting of officials from his Department and the Houses of the Oireachtas service, which proposed that the most senior position be recruited on the basis of a CEO skill set and competencies.  The Ceann Comhairle of the day could assign Clerk functions to that of CEO or not as the case may be, allowing for flexibility without requiring further primary legislation to change the management structure.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, the lack of transparency and accountability in having the same officeholder involved in both nomination and appointment of candidates, the twin-track promotion retaining 1959 positions, not breaking the mandatory link between the Clerk and the CEO and the inherent of lack of flexibility and mobility at the most senior level all make the Houses of the Oireachtas service more beholden to politicians than it ever should be.  Leinster House is the one place above all others where there should be clear water and distance between the Oireachtas administration and the political world of the Members.  Neither is too well served if the lines of demarcation are blurred.  An unhealthy culture can result leading to lack of professionalism and below optimum levels of performance.  The Minister's Bill means that the Houses of the Oireachtas service is seriously out of kilter with other public service bodies which have that independence and proper accountability for administrative matters that is enshrined in the Public Service Management Act 1997, which is some considerable time ago and is reflected in Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Acts but which will be rendered almost toothless under this Bill.<\/p><p> It is most regrettable that the opportunity has been lost in the Bill to put in place a modern, progressive organisation and build on the modernisation programmes under the auspices of earlier commissions, under which the appointment to the top post of the CEO was seen as the culmination.  The Bill, if implemented in its current narrow form, will represent a lost opportunity and a sad reflection on the Minister's claim to be reforming which I am sure he made genuinely at the time.  I know that there have been political difficulties which have involved a political compromise which should not be the motivation behind a Bill such as this.  The Bill will not do it and the Minister has turned his back on modernisation of the Oireachtas under the fig leaf that he is strengthening the independence of Parliament by removing the Taoiseach from the appointment process and providing for open recruitment at the top level by the Top Level Appointments Commission, TLAC, which was involved in the appointment of the previous Clerk of the D&aacute;il in 1990.  There is no great innovation.  The only real change is that persons outside Leinster House can be recruited and the flawed appointment system under the Bill means that that must be a very remote possibility as it would be unattractive to do so.  There is one benefit, but the system has not been tackled; the old ways are still being followed.<\/p> <p> The Bill should be amended on Committee Stage to break the mandatory link between the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and the Secretary General and CEO functions and to repeal the 1959 Act, as originally proposed and accepted by the Minister.  If he insists on retaining that structure and the politicisation  - with a small 'p' - consequent on it for appointments to these posts, at the very minimum, the nomination of a clerk of either House should be on foot of a competition based on merit to ensure standard recruitment practices to fill the senior positions in Leinster House across the board.  The Bill is selective as its benefits only apply to one post and one person.  It should not have been selective but should have attacked the gamut of appointments across the board in Leinster House and used the same worthy principles used in the headline to the Bill.  <\/p> <p> Members are entitled to be assured that the Oireachtas Service is a modern, flexible organisation which is more than capable of responding to challenges that we, as Members, face and that this institution is relevant in this republic in the 21st century.  I echo the sentiments of Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh.  I am not qualified to say whether the Oireachtas Commission is doing a good job because I do not know enough about its meetings.  I have never been to one of them.  I regret deeply that the consultation process on the running of this House and the appointment of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il does not include the smaller parties or any member of the Independent group.  The appointments should be independent and non-political.  Let us not pretend that the commission is non-political because anywhere one finds a group of politicians together, one will find political decisions being made.  There may be no Whip, but, in effect, political decisions are made.  It is a great pity that in the making of these appointments there will not be at least an input from and consideration given to a large body of Members to give them the stamp of independence.  It would certainly be worthwhile trying to include those parties in political opposition because we all wish to see the House being run properly and well and not politically at Civil Service level.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to table an amendment to the Bill which he has said is subject to amendment to include those who have the interests of the House at heart, even if they have political differences with the parties in power, in the consultation process for the making of appointments which are so important to the running of the House.  I would extend this beyond the running of the House to include the entire Houses of the Oireachtas.  Those of us who are Members should be consulted because the appointments should not in any way be political.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800015#N00300","speaker":"953","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434624000,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak about this legislation.  I welcome the debate which is part of the broader debate on D&aacute;il reform.  There is an urgent need for the Oireachtas to become more relevant to the people, as well as more modern and efficient.  In the past four years, in particular, the people have been looking for leadership on this issue, as part of the overall reform of the Oireachtas, politics and the country generally.  It is important that we all become involved in this task.  The bottom line is that it is not enough to talk about reform and introduce legislation, we also have to ensure we will see action, accountability and, in the context of this legislation, a quality public service.<\/p>  <p>  The main objective of the Bill is to ensure the Clerk of the D&aacute;il or Secretary General will be appointed through an open competition rather than internally.  That is welcome as a positive statement of intent and a worthy part of the reform agenda.  Under the existing legislation, an external candidate may only be appointed if no internal candidate is deemed suitable.  This is at variance with the TLAC system for senior appointments which incorporates nomination by boards comprising a majority of members from the private sector with specific skills in management and human resources.  The Bill also provides for the appointment of the Clerk of the Seanad and the Clerk Assistants of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad by the Oireachtas Commission on the recommendation of the Ceann Comhairle or the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, as appropriate.  We must ensure these decisions are implemented quickly and efficiently.  <\/p>  <p>  I have been very annoyed by the slow progress of reform generally and at the delay in the appointment of a Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  We have some excellent people working here.  I take the opportunity to pay tribute to the fantastic work done by the former Clerk of the D&aacute;il, Mr. Kieran Coughlan, and his team.  He was Clerk of the D&aacute;il when I came into the House in 2002 and both he and his staff provided very professional support and advice for many years.  I also commend Mr. Peter Finnegan and Mr. Michael Errity and the current staff for their valuable work in recent years and keeping the show on the road.  <\/p>  <p>  On the issue of reform, several Deputies have referred to the fact that members of the Technical Group and Sinn F&eacute;in are not part of the Oireachtas Commission.  This should be changed immediately and at least one or two members of these groups should be members of the commission.  Irish politics has changed and that change must be reflected in Parliament.  The consultation process should be developed further to ensure we will have inclusion when appointing public servants.  <\/p>  <p>  I am very supportive of the Bill's objective to ensure the Secretary General or Clerk of the D&aacute;il will be appointed by way of an open competition.  There have been significant developments in the efficiency and modernisation of the public service in the past four years.  I have my disagreements with the Minister on many issues, but I agree with him strongly on the issue of reform of the public service.  Many very positive reforms have taken place, although wider society seems to believe nothing has changed.  I am fed up listening to derogatory comments about public servants and claims that there has been no change in the public service in the past four years.  There has been an unprecedented level of reform in the workplace in the public sector in recent years.  Productivity has been boosted by providing for additional working hours, but this is rarely mentioned.  We have seen new shared services being developed and the redeployment of staff, as well as a 10% reduction in staff numbers.  There have also been major reforms of the sick leave and annual leave regimes.<\/p><p>That reality is never reflected in the broader society.  The attacks on the public service are appalling and unacceptable.  From my political point of view I will stand by public servants and the public service.  Equally, I encourage all to join in the reform agenda.<\/p> <p> Up to now, the duties of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, who is also the Secretary General of Houses of the Oireachtas Service, were managing and controlling the staff and administration of Oireachtas services; providing services to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission; providing advice to the commission with respect to any matter connected with responsibilities of the service; examining and developing means that will improve the provision of cost-effective services; and dealing with the to the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956 and the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.  There was also work on appointments, performance and discipline.  The new Secretary General will be expected to play a role in providing advice and expertise to the Ceann Comhairle and Members of the D&aacute;il; overseeing the sittings of the D&aacute;il; dealing with parliamentary reform and ongoing procedures; managing staff; raising morale; creating opportunities; strengthening the planning capacity; and ensuring the Houses of the Oireachtas Service has a strong culture of leadership.  That is what is on the agenda.  That is a very difficult and important position.  It can play a crucial role in Irish society on this issue.  That is why I strongly support the idea of getting someone of the highest standard.  There are people in the public service with the requisite skill and expertise.  We need to get the best person for the job and let him or her get on with it.  However, it is frustrating that over the past four years we have not got on with it.<\/p> <p> I would strongly support any amendments.  If people have constructive amendments, they should table them and let us see what they are about.  We have a mandate from the people from the 2011 general election when we all knocked on the doors promising change and reform.  We need to be part of that process.<\/p> <p> I welcome the debate.  There are very positive aspects to the legislation and I look forward to amendments being tabled.  The bottom line is that we need to fill these positions and do so openly and transparently.  We need to ensure they are very efficient and the right person gets the job so that they can get on with running the Houses of the Oireachtas and make an important contribution to modern Irish society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800016#O00200","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434624600,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Timmins who has 20 minutes if he wants.

I join the previous speakers in paying tribute to the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Sometimes I wonder how they can bear to sit in the Chamber and listen to the utterances of many Members of the House.<\/p>  <p>  I know we are all familiar with the left and right hand side of the brain, but here obviously the left ear takes in all the things being proposed and the right ear takes in all the reasons it should not happen.  I often wonder if we should switch the position of the Cathaoirleach over to this side of the House so that he or she can get both sides of the brain working.  I commend them on sitting there.  Sometimes I find it very difficult to listen here to some of the speeches on some aspects of legislation.  On the side I am on now it is in the negative and on the far side it is the positive.  When the roles are reversed the same thing happens.<\/p>  <p>  This brings me to the issue of appointments in general.  Notwithstanding that Fianna F&aacute;il has been in power for the greater part of the State's history, no political party has been immune from interfering with political appointments, cronyism or whatever.  It is important to have mechanisms to allow people to see that appointments are open and fair.  A number of years ago in a previous appointment I had, I was sitting on an interview board for the position of general operative in the Department of Defence.  There were more than 20 applicants, every one of whom was suitable for the job.  However, in order to ensure we got the two people we were recommending we had to identify approximately 20 as unsuitable and only two as suitable because historically, we had learned that if we identified them all as suitable, the Minister of the day would end up picking the individuals, which was okay for the people who were selected, but very unfair for people who might have been more suitable for the job.<\/p>  <p>  We have evolved and developed.  However, it is important to have accountability at every level of Government.  While we have the Top Level Appointments Committee, I am concerned we do not have the transparency we should have, with regard to top-level appointments or any appointments.  I am a great believer in ministerial accountability.  The public must have transparency and be able to point the finger at someone.  We can appoint people to all the bodies, including bodies such as the NRA and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, and take control away from this House.  By taking control away from the House we are taking away answerability to the public.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen a classic example in recent days.  There is great disquiet among the public and indeed in Government over what is happening with the sale of the Alfred Beit Foundation assets.  We cannot get the full details.  There is an onus on the Government to protect our culture and heritage, yet we have no accountability over the sale of a gift that was left to the State.  It is important to ensure we always have accountability.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Top Level Appointments Committee being involved here, but I am not sure we need a Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I believe the two-pronged approach of an administrative CEO to oversee the administration of it and an operational Clerk of the D&aacute;il to look after that side would have been satisfactory.  It is also important that they can work in conjunction with the Ceann Comhairle.  While this is no reflection on the current Ceann Comhairle, I believe the Ceann Comhairle should be elected by secret ballot.<\/p>  <p>  There is a separate issue that I had not intended raising on the floor of the House relating to role of the commission in the administration of the Houses.  When I was a member of a political party I did not pay much attention to this because I was looked after, so to speak.  The Minister previously dealt with legislation on the allocation of funding for people who had resigned the party Whip which remains with Government parties which I believe is inherently unfair.  The Minister did not accept an amendment for whatever reason.<\/p>  <p>  However, there is a matter that I find disturbing.  I have raised it privately and it was not my intention to raise it on the floor of the House.  I refer to the administration of office accommodation in the Houses, which comes under the control of the Government Chief Whip.  I will table a Report Stage amendment given that I cannot do it on Committee Stage because I do not have any representative to table it for me unless the Committee Stage is held here on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  I will propose that the control of office accommodation should go to the Ceann Comhairle.  It is not my desire to demonstrate how people in this House - some of whom are former members of the Minister's party - have been treated unfairly.<\/p>  <p>  The first half of this year was dominated by two political issues - water charges and equality.  I am a strong advocate for and supporter of equality.  Within this House, some Members are being actively discriminated against by the Government.  It is a small issue and not one about which the public would be concerned.  I will be tabling an amendment so that the control of office accommodation in the Houses should lie with the Ceann Comhairle.  When I move and speak in support of that amendment if the Minister wants me to demonstrate how I believe we have been treated unfairly, I will be happy to do so but I do not have a desire to do it.  I can send on the information privately.<\/p>  <p>  I pay tribute to Mr. Kieran Coughlan, the former Clerk, and to all the staff.  Notwithstanding all the talk about openness and transparency in these various bodies, appointments commissions for senior civil servants and whatever, in the final analysis we must have ministerial accountability.  Everything needs to be open to the public through raising the issue with the Minister on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  I ask the Minister to look at the issue.  I would rather not have to table an amendment to give control of office accommodation to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  I would prefer the Minister to do it or look after it.  However, if he does not, we will table an amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800017#P00500","speaker":"1184"},{"type":"speech","time":1434624600,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I want to give due regard to all the speakers and thank all the speakers.

This represents a bad deal for farmers.  Lest the T&aacute;naiste is not aware of it, it is being talked about across all counties in the country as a bad deal for farmers.  There is serious concern about the current structure of the programme, which has serious implications for productive farmers, many of whom have told me that this scheme is unworkable and needs to be changed.  Farmers continue to highlight that the scheme is over-complicated and will impose excessive costs on participants and that the conditions attached to the scheme are turning away potential applicants.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, has put in place a rule that will bar any new applicants to the scheme following the close of applications, even if desirable changes are made to the scheme in the future.  The draconian rule which provides that all payments made over the lifetime of the programme will be clawed back should a farmer withdraw from the scheme is totally unreasonable and will have a negative impact on farmers who are forced to withdraw from the scheme due to a change in personal circumstances.  Farmers should also be allowed to make application to the scheme based on the size of their suckler cow herd this year rather than for 2014, as proposed, as this places an unnecessary limit on those who want to expand their herd size into the future.<\/p>  <p>  The outstanding issues in regard to the six-year rule, the star ratings and the overly bureaucratic nature of the scheme need to be urgently addressed.

I realise, with all the changes taking place within farming, particularly for young farmers who have large investments and big commitments, either in terms of the acreage they own or acreage they may be leasing or renting, that there are big decisions facing family farms and farm companies.  It is important that the Minister engages fully with farmers and addresses their concerns and that is what he is doing.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the changes that came into effect this year in the farming sector and future changes in terms of how these issues are dealt with, anybody who reads the farming press in detail will know how complex an area this is.

Their suggestions have already been made.  I would have thought the T&aacute;naiste, as a member of Government, would be aware of those suggestions and that she might have been privy to conversations at the Cabinet table in regard to this issue, if there were any.

All parties in the House have called on the British Government to open the files on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  The T&aacute;naiste tells us that the Taoiseach has raised this issue with the British Government but that it is not for turning.

His family has since been failed by the sheer apathy of those in power in this state.  However, thanks to the tireless efforts of his family, we now know that an RUC special branch car took his killers across the Border that night.  We also know that two of the guns used in the massacres at Castlerock and Greysteel were used in the murder of Eddie Fullerton.

The family of Councillor Fullerton and all other families on both sides in the Troubles deserve nothing less.  The Government has consistently called on the British Government to face up to its responsibilities in regard to what happened in the past.<\/p><p>The Deputy mentioned Weston Park which dates back to 2004.  He knows the history of what has happened since.  A framework for achieving what we are talking about is contained in the Stormont House Agreement.  The leader of Sinn F&eacute;in and the Deputy First Minister were present at the Stormont House discussions and I believe that Agreement provides a framework for us.  The Smithwick report dealt with issues of Garda collusion with the IRA, for example, in the deaths of two RUC officers.  When that report was published, my predecessor, the then T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, took a leadership role in dealing with the past.  We all need to be careful in making attempts to rewrite the past.  The debate on collusion in the Assembly earlier this week and in these Houses on Tuesday shows that we need to look at this as a conflict which involved two sides and address what paramilitaries on both sides did.

That is the responsibility of the Government which is co-guarantor of all of the Agreements, from the Good Friday Agreement through to the Stormont House Agreement.  Therefore, it is its responsibility.  Can the T&aacute;naiste imagine any other European jurisdiction where if a much loved elected representative was murdered by agents of another state, the government would pretty much sit on its hands for 24 years and accept it, despite the overwhelming evidence?  Again, will the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach meet the family of Councillor Eddie Fullerton, listen to the latest update on their investigations and serious concerns and act on them?  Furthermore, will they look at the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the case of Pat Finucane?  Will they tell the British Government it must take full responsibility for its part in the conflict?  Other groups have accepted responsibility and apologised for the hurt and pain they inflicted during those terrible years.  The one party that is missing from the equation is the British Government.

Instead of the conservative option that the Government took, of restricting and criminalising women, it could have allowed a referendum to repeal the eight amendment on the grounds of being necessary to protect women&rsquo;s health.  In the light of the fantastic vote on marriage equality, the overwhelming desire is for social progress in this country.  Will the T&aacute;naiste do what she can in this regard?  She cannot guarantee being in a future Government, but the Government could hold a referendum on this issue in the autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800020#S00300","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1434626400,"counter":174,"content":"<p>On Amnesty International's report, I had an opportunity to meet at length in my office its secretary general, Mr. Salil Shetty, together with its officials, including the head of Amnesty International in this country, Mr. Colm O&rsquo;Gorman.  They presented the report to me, which I understand they also presented to a number of other members of the Government, including the Minister for Health.  The report is extensive and the Deputy will be aware that it contains a number of recommendations.  However, she must bear in mind that it seeks to address an issue everyone would like to see addressed, namely, fatal foetal abnormalities, in order that women who are carrying a much loved baby but who have been advised that the baby will not survive pregnancy would have an option of dealing with the issue.  Many women who find themselves in this situation may wish to carry the baby to full term, while others will not.  It is important that women have choices in that regard.  That formed a significant part of the report.<\/p>  <p>  Amnesty International also presented the report to the D&aacute;il.  There is less understanding internationally and the fact must be respected that the Irish people in a free vote, as was the case in all recent referenda, chose in their wisdom, whether the Deputy agrees with it, to insert the eight amendment into the Constitution.  Therefore, the legal advice to the Government is that when the people express their view in a referendum, as they chose to do, the majority position prevails.  I believe the Deputy disagrees with the legal advice, from what she said previously.  She should remember that in the previous referendum on gay marriage 62% voted in favour, but there were also many people who expressed their disagreement with the proposition, as was their right.  That is called democracy.  If there is to be any change in the matters which fall within the remit of the eight amendment, it must be done by way of a further constitutional referendum to be put to the people.  In that event, we must clearly set out, in a way that takes into account the best interests of women and babies, the framework with which we wish to replace it.  Unlike the marriage equality referendum, this is not about inserting extra words into the Constitution but about removing from it a particular framework which was included by the people in their wisdom 30 years ago and replacing it with an alternative framework.<\/p>  <p>  It is going to take a great deal of detailed work in the Labour Party.  Speaking as leader of the Labour Party, we have had extensive discussions within the party and an extensive motion at conference dealing with the issue, but in terms of the medical and legal experts with whom we have spoken, including Dr. Boylan and other eminent doctors, we have a lot more work to do.  However, it is an issue we are committed to addressing, as per our conference motion.

This Bill is designed to amend the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 to make provision for a partial exemption of property tax payable by a relevant owner whose property is located in a managed estate on which the owner of the said property is liable to the payment of management fees and to provide for related matters.<\/p><p>Essentially, we are talking about managed estates and many people are familiar with this issue.  It concerns estates where there is a management company and where the management fee has been paid.  I must stress that aspect at the outset because there are many disputes about the payment of fees in many estates where there is a management company.  I am proposing that this Bill should only apply to owner-occupier dwellings or housing units in estates where there is a management company.  Where the management fee has been paid in full, such a person should be exempt from having to pay part of their local property tax in the relevant year.  The amount would be equal to one third of the management fee, or &euro;300, or one third of the local property tax, whichever is the lower.<\/p><p>In the Dublin area, I would estimate the average local property tax at &euro;350.  In the majority of situations, this might provide a relief of &euro;100, &euro;110, &euro;120 or &euro;130.  It is not big money but it is a recognition for people who are paying management fees, so they will not be caught and have to pay double.  The CSO estimates that there are probably 177,000 homeowners in this category.  The maximum possible cost of this legislation would be &euro;15 million out of the local property tax.  In most cases, it could be over &euro;100.  There might be exceptional cases depending on the management fee and the value of the local property tax in a particular area where it could be higher, but the figures I quoted would cater for the average situation.  This would grant recognition to people in estates who are now paying on the double.  That is because in such estates - many of which include apartments, housing units or a combination of both - it was regularly a condition of the planning permission granted for such a development that there would be a management company in place.<\/p><p>The management company manages the estate, including the public areas such as roads, footpaths and lights.  It is not just concerned with green areas, including flowers and other landscaping issues, but also shores, drains and surface water drainage.  If these matters were not dealt with by a management company and the State took charge through a local authority, the council would have to pay for such work to be carried out.  Therefore that work is being paid for by tenants or residents in those areas through the management company.  They are paying the full local property tax so in this case there is an element whereby people are paying twice.<\/p><p>In these situations, people who sold housing units in those areas got the money but the developer might choose to have a permanent stream of income from that development.  He or she might have set up a management company to oversee that and collect the money to have a permanent stream of income.  That should be recognised and people should not have to pay twice for that work.  This creates an incentive for some management companies and the people who own them not to have their estate taken in charge because they will lose that line of income if the local authority takes over the estate.  In some cases, therefore, there is a financial incentive to maintain management companies in an area.  As I said earlier, it can also be a condition of the original planning application which people have to follow.<\/p><p>This Bill represents one small measure concerning the local property tax.  The legislation was rushed so I would also like to see the proposed revaluation date for next year being abolished.<\/p><p>We have introduced the tax.  There was much disquiet about it, but it seems to be operating and has a high compliance rate, primarily because of the Revenue powers.  I believe the Government will frighten people and put them off if it starts to discuss a revaluation date next year or the following year.  We should let the tax bed-in for a long number of years before we revisit that area.<\/p> <p> This is a small step for a particularly unfair burden for a particular group of people.  We have included in our legislation people whose houses and properties were affected by pyrite.  They should also have an exemption along the lines I have just mentioned, that is, up to one third of the local property tax, until such time as all the remedial work has been completed.  After that they should pay the full rate.  This is a small measure recognising the double payment in these cases.  I call on Members to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800023#V00200","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434628200,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800024#W00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1434628200,"counter":230,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800024#W00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434628200,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1434628200,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800024#W00500","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1434628200,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800024#W00600","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1434628200,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2015: First Stage","time":1434628200,"counter":235,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800024#W00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1434628200,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for paid bereavement leave.<\/blockquote>Cuirim an Bille seo os comhair na D&aacute;la.  Cuirfidh m&eacute; in i&uacute;l don Teach na sonra&iacute; at&aacute; sa Bhille.  As the Minister is aware, there is no legislative provision for bereavement leave.  While the public sector provides for such leave and employers in the private sector often take a compassionate approach when a member of staff loses a family member, there remains a grey area in law.  This is not helpful to the employee or employer.  It appears that employers who provide bereavement leave do so on the basis of the <i>force majeure<\/i>provision in the Parental Leave Act.  <i>Force majeure<\/i>provides an entitlement to specified and limited leave in the event of a family crisis but does not give an entitlement to leave following the death of a family member.<\/p><p>Few greater crises can arise in a person's life than the loss of a family member.  When a death occurs employees are understandably unsure of what their leave entitlements are, particularly in employments in the casual or temporary sectors.  This is a deeply unjust position to place employees in during what is, for most people, a deeply distressing and difficult time in their lives.  To my mind, providing for limited paid bereavement leave is the compassionate and responsible measure for legislators to take.  It also re-balances the equilibrium of rights and responsibilities of employees and employers.  It is wrong that such a basic entitlement should be within the gift of individual employers.  Employees who have lost a family member should not have to negotiate a short number of days for bereavement leave.<\/p><p>Ireland's employment market is becoming increasingly casualised and there are employers who do not give bereavement leave.  Moreover, when it is given, in some instances it can remain unpaid.  My Bill provides for leave on the grounds of bereavement.  An employee would be entitled to leave with pay from his or her employment owing to the death of a spouse, child, parent, grandparent, brother, sister, a person in respect of whom the employee is <i>in loco parentis<\/i>or persons in other classes already prescribed under <i>force majeure<\/i>provisions.  The Bill will provide that when an employee takes bereavement leave he or she shall, as soon as is reasonably practicable thereafter, confirm that he or she has taken such leave and the notice shall specify the dates on which it was taken.  It will contain a statement of the facts entitling the employee to bereavement leave.  Bereavement leave shall not exceed three days in any period of 12 consecutive months or five days in any period of 36 consecutive months.<\/p><p>It appears that private sector employers are already taking a steer from the <i>force majeure<\/i>provisions in the Parental Leave Act.  I have simply replicated the provision with the intent that providing a statutory right to paid bereavement leave will be in step with responsible employers and raise the bar for those who do not currently give paid bereavement leave to their staff.  This legislation seeks to formalise a practice that is already in place in many sectors and an entitlement that employees should have.<\/p><p>Is am n&oacute; tr&eacute;imhse uaf&aacute;sach deacair &eacute; d'aon chlann, n&oacute; i saol aon duine, nuair a chailleann siad duine a bh&iacute; siad m&oacute;r leo, go h&aacute;irithe duine den chlann.

I welcome Deputy Fleming to the House.  I know that he was unavoidably delayed and that Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l made the Fianna F&aacute;il presentation.  I wish to respond to the Deputies who spoke - I thank them for their contributions.<\/p>  <p>  As everyone who spoke has said, this is not an earth-shattering Bill.  In essence, it simply seeks to ensure that the prime administrator of the offices of the Houses of the Oireachtas would be selected through the normal Top Level Appointments Committee process.  I know that some Members are keen for us to go further.  I have said that I have an open mind in respect of how that could be accomplished.  There are also those in the House who argue that we should go a different way.  In a way I do not believe this should be enforced upon the Houses of the Oireachtas by the Executive.  That is why I wanted debate on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Although I have been criticised for delay, I wanted the opportunity for people to reflect on the Bill I published.  I sent it to the Oireachtas joint committee.  It was interesting that a number of Deputies made reference to the fact that the joint Oireachtas committee submitted reports to me.  In fact, the committee made no recommendations but sent me all the submissions that it had received.  That was not particularly helpful in my deliberations in understanding the cross-party views of the committee.  There is a difference between simply being a post box for submissions received and analysing the submissions, coming to a view, if that were possible, and making recommendations to me.  In the absence of any recommendations I have proceeded on the basis of the draft Bill that I submitted to the joint Oireachtas committee.<\/p>  <p>  Everyone who spoke this morning made positive mention of Kieran Coughlan.  I have already said that he was a very fine, outstanding public servant.  I continue to wish him well in his retirement.<\/p>  <p>  The Clerk of the D&aacute;il appointment is one of the appointments captured by this Bill.  I have said this should be done through the TLAC process.  Some Members referred to what that TLAC process involved and were critical of the role - saving your presence, a Cheann Comhairle, but since Members talked about the role of the Ceann Comhairle I have to do so by way of reply as well.<\/p>  <p>  The role I envisage for the Ceann Comhairle is no different to the role currently carried out by any member of the Government in respect of the appointment of the Secretary General of his Department.<\/p><p>The TLAC takes on all applications, does the interviews, makes the recommendations and shortlists a panel as it deems appropriate.  It submits that to the relevant Minister, who goes to Cabinet which makes the decision.  The Minister is obviously in Cabinet and so is both nominator and part of the decision-making process.  I envisage a mirroring of that situation for the Ceann Comhairle.  The shortlist from the TLAC of those deemed appropriate for appointment would go to the Ceann Comhairle, who would make the recommendation to the commission and, naturally, he would be part of the decision-making of the commission as well.  There is no difference, in that sense, in the role envisaged for the Ceann Comhairle in this appointment mechanism and the role given to the Minister in any event.<\/p> <p> Some Members thought we should leave it to the Taoiseach and I have spoken to the Taoiseach on this.  The Taoiseach has a nominating role right now but he feels it is more appropriate that that role should be the Ceann Comhairle's, as opposed to the head of the Executive.  We can, however, tease these matters out on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l and others spoke about the fact that the only TLAC appointment I envisage under this proposal is for the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  The other three appointments captured by this legislation, the Clerk Assistant, the Clerk of the Seanad and the Clerk Assistant of the Seanad, would be appointments made within the Houses of the Oireachtas in the normal way.  On balance that is the right thing to do as it gives the flexibility about which Members have spoken.  If there is a strong view in the Opposition that they should also be TLAC appointments, I am willing to debate that.  Many Members, particularly Deputy Timmins, argued for flexibility to enable the Houses of the Oireachtas to move people around while being respectful of their roles.  The Houses of the Oireachtas are not an exact replication of a Department, however.  There are, also, two Houses of the Oireachtas, not one, and the people have determined that they should remain two Houses and not one.  The role of the Clerk of the Seanad involves a unique set of responsibilities and the Clerk is not just another officer of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In trying to balance all these matters I determined to recommend in the legislation that they would not be TLAC appointments but made by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission on the nomination of the appropriate persons, namely, the Ceann Comhairle in relation to the Clerk Assistant of the D&aacute;il and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad in relation to officers of the Seanad.<\/p> <p> A number of Deputies made a strong point on the structure of the commission.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said the Oireachtas Commission was not representative of all shades of opinion in the House and that is a point which needs to be addressed.  There are now 11 members and, while I would not make it too big, I accept the point that it needs to be reflective of as many discernible views in the House as it is possible to be, contingent on being a manageable decision-making body.  We might deal with it in further legislation.   The Deputy rightly made the point that the appointment process has to be above politics and the TLAC is that.  He was also open to consideration of whether the TLAC should be the appointing body for the other, secondary posts.  I do not think there is a black and white answer to that but if Deputies table amendments on Committee Stage, I am willing to discuss the matter.<\/p> <p> Deputy Ross, who is unfortunately not present, talked about the failure to modernise and to bring about radical reform.  I am open to any suggestions for radical reform that Deputy Ross wishes to table.  For clarity, normal officials of the Houses of the Oireachtas service, just as officials in any Department, are subject to the normal open competition and the Public Appointments Service system.  The Deputy also said the Clerk of the D&aacute;il should be allowed to move staff around as appropriate, but the problem with that is that there is a discernible standing of officers in each House and that has to be respected.<\/p> <p> I thank Deputy Finian McGrath for supporting the process and the proposals.  He thinks the TLAC is the right way to go, while making a robust defence of public service reform and the productivity that has been delivered, which is a point I would echo.  Deputy Timmins was very complimentary of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the work they have done.  He made a point about the allocation of offices, which is well beyond the scope of this legislation.  I am sure the Government Whip heard his point and would robustly defend his role but it is a matter for a different forum and a different Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800024#W01800","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434628800,"counter":247,"content":"<p>They are related matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800025#X00200","speaker":"1184"},{"type":"speech","time":1434628800,"counter":248,"content":"<p>It would not be an appropriate amendment for this legislation but the Deputy has made his point.

We finally get to speak on it after all the delayed starts over the past two days.  The original principle underpinning the Children Act 2001 was that detention should always be a last resort for children.  As society has evolved over recent years and the past decade, practices that were once acceptable are no longer acceptable.  I welcome the Minister's finishing up with the remark that this is about ensuring there is a child care model in detention centres for children under 18.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact the main purpose of this proposed legislation is to enable the amalgamation of the three children detention schools - Trinity House, Oberstown Boys School and Oberstown Girls School - into one central campus, namely, Oberstown, and to provide for the necessary legal changes required to end the detention of children in adult detention facilities.  That is very important, worthwhile and right.  I acknowledge the work this Government has done in bringing this to where we are today.  Responsibility for 16 year old boys was transferred from the Irish Prison Service to the children detention facilities in Oberstown in May 2012.  Boys aged 17 and remanded in custody to St. Patrick's Institution remained the responsibility of the Irish Prison Service pending the completion of the building project at the children's detention facilities at Oberstown and the preparation of the necessary legal instruments to transfer responsibility for this category of offender to Oberstown.  The Oberstown campus commenced taking 17 year old males, newly remanded in custody, since Monday, 30 March 2015, which is another positive development.<\/p>  <p>  We welcome the further work that needs to be carried out for young offenders, including facilitating Red Cross training in Wheatfield Place of Detention, focusing on rehabilitative resettlement of young offenders under supervision and delivering victim empathy group programmes in both Wheatfield and the children detention schools.  Much of this would not have been possible were it not for the success of the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Fitzgerald, in securing the necessary capital funding to build this new purpose-built facility back in 2012, which I acknowledge.<\/p>  <p>  Before I get into the contents of the Bill, in his own address yesterday, the Minister made remarks in respect of a number of positive steps that have taken place to meet the programme for Government commitments.  One of them was: \"A first recruitment process for care staff to work in Oberstown was completed in 2014, and further recruitment steps are ongoing\".  Will the Minister, in his wrap up, elaborate further on this remark in terms of the number of staff that have been through the process and the timeframe for their recruitment?  This is something which I find quite frustrating.  It is not just now and it is not just this Government's fault, but the length of time it takes people to be hired in the public service is quite frustrating.  Will the Minister confirm that we will always have the necessary staff in place to man these facilities?<\/p>  <p>  The issue of remission is important in the context of a recent judgment.  The Prisons Act 2007 provides for the remission of 20%, and up to one third, of a prisoner's sentence for good behaviour.  This also applies to detention facilities in juvenile criminal justice systems, such as St. Patrick's Institution.  No explicit provision was ever made in law for such remission at the children's detention school at Oberstown in County Dublin.  In the case, the applicant maintained that the lack of remission at Oberstown amounted to a form of discrimination contrary to Article 40.1 of the Constitution, which states: \"All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.\"  The case centred on whether young offenders detained at Oberstown were entitled to remission in the same fashion as other prisoners and young offenders who are detained at St. Patrick's Institution.  The judgment stated that the failure to afford young offenders in Oberstown detention school with the benefit of statutory remission rules amounted to a plain breach of the constitutional command of equality before the law.<\/p><p>The Minister has taken that on board in this legislation.  That will ensure equality of treatment between children in children's detention schools and adults in prisons.  The Bill makes provision for remission in children's detention schools, incorporating a new disciplinary process and an appeals process where the sanction imposed is forfeiture of remission.<\/p> <p> Regarding the provision relating to the period of detention imposed by the court, the Bill provides that a child who is convicted of an offence cannot receive a period of detention that would be greater than the period of imprisonment an adult could receive for the same offence.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust commented that while it is noted that the purpose of the section is to give consideration to the principle of equality of treatment between children in detention schools and adults in the prison system, and given the importance of the principle that detention should be a last resort for children, the trust recommends that the provision be amended to reflect more closely the spirit and wording of section 96 of the Children Act 2001, which provides that where a child is convicted of an offence and a period of detention is imposed on the child by a court the period of detention shall not exceed the term of detention or imprisonment that the court could have imposed on a person of full age and capacity who is convicted of such an offence, and may be less.  It also recommends that the court should have regard to the age, level of maturity, the best interests of the child and the principle of imprisonment as a last resort in determining the nature of any penalty involved.<\/p> <p> Our focus should always be on the use of detention as the last resort.  We should channel our resources and efforts into trying to keep children and teenagers away from a life of criminality and anti-social behaviour.  When children and young adults get involved in the justice system it is sometimes very hard to disentangle them from it.  When young offenders become involved in the justice system they are often on an irreversible spiral that sometimes ends in Mountjoy Prison.  There is a need for greater inter-agency co-operation.  I again plead with the Minister to prioritise the final implementation of the Children First legislation and make inter-agency co-operation mandatory.<\/p> <p> We should not talk about sending children to detention facilities and holding children on remand without also focusing on the lack of supports that are currently available in terms of social workers.  Many of our social workers are seriously overloaded with work.  Often the children who end up in detention facilities come from marginalised parts of society and vulnerable backgrounds.  They are children who do not get the supports they require to have a full and productive engagement in society.  We have seen the reports from Tusla, the new agency charged with responsibility for supporting children in vulnerable situations, and heard its new chief executive officer speak about under-resourcing.  Every child does not have a social worker or dedicated care plan.  Without the required social workers and dedicated care plan, the child can embark on risky behaviour and often on a life of crime.<\/p> <p> This legislation is extremely welcome with regard to amalgamating the services that are currently in place.  I acknowledge the work the Government has done to bring Oberstown to the current standard.  What was good enough one or two decades ago is no longer suitable.  I also acknowledge its commitment to the provision of care for under 18 year olds in the detention facilities.  However, the issue is to get things right before that and to keep children away from a life of crime.  Children in the detention school system will often have experienced the care system, with many under HSE care at the time of their committal and some coming directly into the detention system from secure care.  This is one of the most vulnerable groups of children in Ireland and many of the traumatic factors which led to the children being taken into care in the first place are also at the root of their offending behaviour.  The children detention school system invests its resources in addressing the challenges and what can be extremely challenging behaviour of these young people.<\/p> <p> We have a duty to support young people leaving detention in their efforts to desist from offending behaviour through the provision of after-care, safe housing and support and to ensure that they do not return to the chaotic conditions which gave rise to the offending behaviour in the first place.  It could change their lives and lead in turn to safer communities for everybody.  In accordance with international human rights standards and particularly in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, custody for children should only be used in the last resort and for the minimum required period of time.  International law stipulates that all efforts should be made to apply alternatives to detention to ensure that such a measure is only used in exceptional circumstances.<\/p> <p> We must ensure there are adequate supports in place for children who are in care and for children who are at the margins of society.  Often that means they are living in families that are living in difficult areas in our communities.  They are not getting the necessary supports, including social welfare supports, and educational opportunities, and their parents are not getting job opportunities.  One of the best things we can do to lift people out of poverty is help parents back into the workforce.  The challenge in that regard, however, particularly for women and low income families, is the high cost of child care.  That is something the Minister must address.  If he can support families in securing economic stability, he will help to prevent many children taking to a life of crime or engaging in anti-social behaviour.<\/p> <p> With regard to the appeals procedure for sanction, this section provides that a child on whom a sanction was imposed may petition the Minister, within seven days of being informed of the finding and sanction, concerning the finding or sanction or both.  The Minister can confirm, modify, suspend or revoke the sanction and will notify the child accordingly.<\/p><p>The Irish Penal Reform Trust makes the valid point that it is unclear why the petition should be to the Minister rather than a child-friendly independent tribunal - for example, the Ombudsman for Children.  Perhaps the Minister could examine this as the Bill progresses through its various Stages in the Oireachtas.  We will have an opportunity to table specific amendments.  I hope the Minister will scrutinise them according to the spirit in which they will be tabled to try to improve the legislation.  As I stated, we welcome the legislation and acknowledge the work done on it but there is still a lot more work to be done to ensure the detention is the very last resort for children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800026#Y00300","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434630600,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes this Bill, the aim of which is to ensure that children of 18 years and under will no longer be detained in the adult prison system in order to end the practice of sending them to St. Patrick's Institution.  The Bill also allows for the amalgamation of child detention schools into one school at Oberstown, with the aim of capitalising on existing reforms in the system.  Irish NGOs, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Irish Penal Reform Trust and many international organisations, including the United Nations, have been calling for many years for the closure of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and an end to the detention of children in adult prisons.  There is unanimous agreement across the child protection and criminal justice spectrum on the importance and significance of ending the practice of detaining children in adult prisons.<\/p><p>The Irish Penal Reform Trust has pointed out repeatedly how adult prisons are completely unsuitable to meet the particular needs of young offenders.  This sentiment was echoed by the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, who stated rehabilitation must be a paramount consideration in the detention of young people.  Both the Ombudsman for Children and the Irish Penal Reform Trust agree that Oberstown is the most appropriate environment for the small number of young people for whom detention is necessary.  However, both entities have expressed concern over the findings of a report by HIQA, published on 23 February 2015, concerning two inspections it carried out on the Oberstown centre in October and November 2014.  HIQA found that, of a total of ten standards, the children detention schools met just one in full, that of education.  Six standards were found to require improvement, and the failure to meet three standards was found by HIQA to present &quot;significant risk&quot;.  These were in the areas of single separation, the management of medication, and staffing and training issues.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust is particularly concerned over reports that single separation was used due to staff shortages.  Concerns about insufficient staffing, staff training and high levels of staff absenteeism are also detailed in the inspection report.<\/p><p>In a 12-month period, more than 700 cases of single separation were recorded at , with one child spending more than 83 hours in isolation over a four-day period.  An incident also occurred where up to seven staff members were involved in restraining a child in a manner that involved the use of handcuffs.  The inspection of Oberstown detention campus by HIQA took place in autumn last year, and reference was made to the young person&rsquo;s physical strength in a plan that mentioned the handcuffing incident.  The head of care told inspectors that there was no formal review of the incident but that CCTV was reviewed, that five to seven staff were involved and that the restraint was &ldquo;all over the place&rdquo;.  The head of care said that handcuffs should not be used within the campus.  HIQA said at the time that it was not clear whether the service took any lesson from the incident to prevent it happening again and improve the safety and quality of the service.  Some 30% of staff at that point had not received up-to-date training in behaviour management.  It must be asked whether these are the standards deemed acceptable.  The inspection also found that children were &ldquo;not always safe&rdquo; because best practice was not always implemented and that single separation was not a facility used as a last resort.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill and that, finally, critical issues affecting young people in detention are being addressed.  However, we must acknowledge the past failures regarding children in custody and vow to do all in our power to avoid a recurrence of such unnecessary traumatic experiences.  The effects of single separation on children can cause lasting psychological impacts.  Protection rooms were used in Trinity House, where a child was locked in small room without natural light, while in other units children spent time in single separation in locked time-out rooms, in their bedrooms or in activity rooms.  It is inhumane to put a minor through such treatment.  Apparently, there was a variety of reasons for the use of single separation, including threats of suicide, being under the influence of drugs or concerns relating to threatening behaviour.<\/p><p>One child was locked in a room for 83 hours and 45 minutes over four days.  Another spent 23 hours and 30 minutes over a two-day period in single separation, excluding sleeping time, because staff were concerned the young person had prohibited items and would not give them to staff.  Shorter periods of single separation were also recorded, such as periods of 30 minutes when a child was smoking in school.  Ms Jennifer Gargan, the director of Empowering People in Care, EPIC, an independent association that works with and for children and young people living in care, said at the time that the use of single separation of young people is &ldquo;deeply concerning&rdquo;.  The group stated the report&rsquo;s findings were &ldquo;shocking&rdquo; and that it was clear young people were not being given the opportunity to address their offending behaviour.<\/p><p>Under the Children Act 2001, the detention of children must be used only as a sanction of last resort.  Therefore, the under-18s detained at Oberstown, and in the adult prison system, should, by definition and legislation, be those who have committed the most serious crimes and who present with the most challenging behaviour.  However, according to the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance Report Card 2015, of the 96 children detained during 2014, only 27% received a detention order on conviction.  This startling figure has led the Irish Penal Reform Trust to suggest detention is not being used as a last resort and the Ombudsman for Children to express concern that child detention is being used for welfare purposes.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in believe more frequent inspections and the regular publication of reports are needed if progress is to be monitored.  This should be done to ensure the detention school is meeting its objectives.<\/p><p>Another aspect to child detention that must be considered is the lack of adequate procedures and supports in place for those coming to the notice of garda&iacute;.  It has been proven that in areas where supports do exist for minors who are exposed to violence or trouble in their communities, the effects of having those in place significantly reduce the number of children proceeding to getting into trouble with the law.  We must start discussing the issues of early intervention and prevention.  If we were to focus energy and resources on preventive measures and on providing support for our young people within our communities, the need for reactive measures would not be so great.  The thinking and attitude must change with regard to how we treat young people.  While I acknowledge that much good work has been done in some areas, quality community Garda schemes and Garda liaison officers need to be part of that change.<\/p><p>Recently I attended the launch of Picture Your Rights: A Report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child from Children Living in Ireland.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, was also present.  The excellent report was researched by children and it was from their viewpoint and for children.  Its intention is to inform the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on the very real issues affecting children in Ireland today.  It was compiled by children of all ages and supported by the Children's Rights Alliance and UNICEF Ireland.  The views and concerns are representative of a wide range of young people from different backgrounds.  The report pointed towards the fact that the 1,148,687 children in this State make up 25% of the total population and that we now have the highest proportion of children in the European Union.  One in every four citizens is a child.  These figures further emphasise the importance of investing in children for the future.<\/p><p>One spotlight area raised by children themselves was the desire for increased respect of our teens and their needs, especially within more disadvantaged communities.  This leads me back to my point regarding the need for prevention and early intervention.<\/p><p>We must address the heart of the issue here.  Young people feel disenfranchised and under-protected.  The series of interviews conducted for the report evidenced young people's sense of abandonment in communities.  One young person said: <blockquote>It feels like the police are there to harass, not to protect you.  Most trouble happens because there is nothing to do - we just hang around on a wall.  In richer areas teens have more to do, more money and more space in their houses.  The Guards are afraid of their parents.  The Guards feel like they can get away with everything and they overuse their power.  We need to get enough of us to tell them to stop abusing their power and understand that we have rights too.<\/blockquote>We must listen to what these young people are saying.  Government must pay attention to the loud and clear signals being sent.  Today, we are discussing the effects and repercussions of children being held in detention and how best to deal with that reality but while going through this legislative process, we must keep at the forefront of our minds the fact that these citizens are under the age of 18 and that rather than treating them as criminals, we need to treat them like valued beings who have the potential to better themselves and reintegrate themselves into their communities if they are given the a fair opportunity to change.  I was particularly affected by the following statement of another young person in the report which, again, further emphasises the need for Government to listen.<blockquote>You can't just throw us in the back of a van.  They left me in a big concrete cell, freezing with only a pair of football shorts on.  I want to ask the Minister, does she really know what goes on in our community, that some of us are being treated badly and verbally and physically abused.  Do you care about the community or just your pay check? Juvenile Liaison Officers say they&rsquo;ll help but they don't.  That all affects you when you&rsquo;re older; people look at you and think 'he wasn&rsquo;t a good kid' and don't give you a job.  Ever since I was a kid I had a bad temper but it's increased rapidly since the Guards started bothering us.  I find it harder to control and it keeps building.<\/blockquote>In the context of what we are discussing regarding the Children (Amendment) Bill today, these young people's comments are particularly poignant. <br\/><br\/>There are certain parts of the Bill we believe could be strengthened.  We note that section 8 of the Bill amends section 149 of the Children Act 2001 and provides that where a child is convicted of an offence, the period of detention imposed on a child should not exceed that which the court would have imposed on an adult.  While it is noted that the purpose of the section is to give consideration to the principle of equality of treatment between children in detention schools and adults in the prison system, considering the importance of the principle that detention should be a last resort for children, we recommend that this provision be amended to more closely reflect the spirit and wording of section 96 of the Children Act 2001.<br\/><br\/>Section 8 of the Bill also provides that where a period of detention greater than three years is imposed on a child, a court must give its reasons for doing so in open court.  It is noted that before it was amended by the 2006 Act, the original Children Act 2001 provision contained an upper limit and did not permit a court to impose a sentence on a child that was in excess of three years.  Therefore, we suggest that the proposed provision be amended.  It is vital to ensure that the procedures that children encounter in detention settings are accessible to them in light of their age and vulnerability and often their literacy difficulties.  While sections 17 and 18 make provision for the Director of Oberstown Campus to hold an inquiry into an alleged breach of discipline and to inform the child of the breach and the time and date of that inquiry, it makes no provision for the right of the child to be heard in such a situation but leaves it to ministerial regulations to prescribe the procedure.  Given that forfeiture of up to 14 days remission, which is an effective loss of liberty, is potentially at stake, the underpinning principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child - to participate and to be heard - would require that the child must be given an opportunity to be heard and to respond to any such allegations in the first instance. <br\/><br\/>While section 17 does provide that the procedure relating to an inquiry may be prescribed by the Minister, we believe the opportunity to be heard is of such importance, both in terms of child rights and due process rights, that it should be included in the Children (Amendment) Bill 2015 itself.  Where the sanction imposed is one of loss of remission, the reasons for the imposition of such a sanction should be recorded in writing and communicated to the child in ordinary language.  The current section 201(2) of the Children Act 2001 includes an important prohibition on certain forms of discipline including corporal punishment or any other form of physical violence; deprivation of food or drink; treatment that could reasonably be expected to be detrimental to physical, psychological or emotional well-being; or treatment that is cruel, inhuman or degrading.  Given the concerns expressed through the recent HIQA report as previously outlined regarding the management of challenging behaviour and particularly the use of single separation, it is unclear as to why this important provision which prohibits certain treatment has not been retained as part of the new section 201.  New section 201B sets out a right of petition by the child to the Minister against either the finding or the sanction or both.  It is unclear why this petition is to the Minister rather than a child-friendly independent tribunal, for example the Ombudsman for Children.While this is in line with the Prison Act 2007 in respect of adults, it does not take into account the potential vulnerabilities of children and the challenges which a formal petition process might pose for them.Given the existing remit of the Ombudsman for Children in respect of complaints of children in detention, it seems that a right of petition to the Ombudsman for Children may be more appropriate than a right of petition to the Minister.  <br\/><br\/>Sinn F&eacute;in wants this legislation to move through the Houses of the Oireachtas and to be passed into law as soon as possible but we must get it right.  It is vital the focus is on the welfare and well-being of the children and that this legislation is child-centred and makes the rights of the child a priority.  We must create a system which is humane and progressive - a rehabilitation process which encourages all children to reach their full potential rather than a system which negatively impacts our future generations for life. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800028#AA00200","speaker":"981","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434631200,"counter":262,"content":"<p>The next slot is for the Technical Group.

Peter McVerry once said:<blockquote>When I was working in an Inner City Parish, we priests used to say that we could predict, with 90% accuracy, which children would end up in prison when we were baptising them.  The prison system is the only publicly-funded service available to the poor for which there is no waiting list!<\/blockquote>Statistics from the Irish Penal Reform Trust show that prisoners in Ireland are 25 times more likely to come from and return to a seriously deprived area.  Children in detention are particularly vulnerable with many having experienced childhood violence or abuse, family difficulty, poverty, mental health issues or learning difficulties.  In fact, 40% of those under 16 in custodial remand have a learning disability.  <\/p><p>There are some very welcome provisions in today's Bill, in particular, those relating to the amalgamation of the detention schools into one legal entity, the removal of references to St Patrick's Institution and the legal framework on remission for minors.  The fundamental issues, however, is that we need to radically rethink the entire imprisonment or detention system in Ireland.  The &quot;last resort&quot; principle, which is outlined in the Children Act 2001, is key.  While it is enshrined in legislation, in practice, prisons and detention centres continue to pick up the tab for a wide range of social and health issues.  A report by the Office of the Ombudsman for Children in 2014 found that remands in custody have been made on welfare grounds.  In 2013, the annual cost per child in detention schools was &euro;314,000.  For many of these children, a more effective way of investing this money would be to direct towards community-based supports for health and social care.  <\/p><p>Advocacy groups such as Empowering People in Care and the Irish Penal Reform Trust, which work with children in detention, have found that the deprivation of liberty and the first-hand experience of the criminal justice system can have highly damaging effects on the well-being of an already vulnerable child and can maintain or aggravate existing trauma and other psychological conditions.  Security infrastructure can also be intimidating to children.  This is why it is so important that the principle of &quot;last resort&quot; is upheld in practice.  Another frightening statistic is that four out of ten people who arrive in prison previously attended some psychiatric service.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust indicated that of the 96 children held on remand in 2014, only 27% went on to receive a detention order.  Therefore, nearly three quarters of children who are detained are gaining unnecessary experience of the criminal justice system and we can add to this all the children who are in there for other care needs.  <\/p><p>HIQA's report published in February this year on inspections carried out at Oberstown in October and November 2014 found that out of a total of ten standards, just one, education, was met in full.  It also found serious gaps in child protection, training, health care and staffing.  In Fr. Peter McVerry's experience, in many cases we lock people up just to get rid of them.  We do not really care what happens to them once they are inside.  The idea of locking people away from their communities to punish and, I hope, rehabilitate them and keep society safe from crime is centuries old and well outdated.  It is interesting that this incarceration model has survived into modern times without any real engagement with the question of whether it actually is the best system for dealing with crime.  According to the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, Ireland systematically overuses imprisonment as a form of punishment.  While the prison population on any given day is close to the European average, the rates of committal to prison on sentence, in other words, the flow of prisoners through the system, mean that Ireland has one of the most punitive criminal justice systems in Europe.  I recommend Members read a book by the Jesuits entitled, <i>Re-Imagining Imprisonment in Europe<\/i>, which is really powerful and contains some wonderful ideas.  It would be great if the authorities here were to read it because there is a lot to be learned from it.  <br\/><br\/>In terms of reoffending, the figures in Ireland are startling, with 50% of those released back in prison within four years.  According to the IPRT, 18 to 21 year olds have the highest potential for reoffending but also for reform.  Once a child reaches the age of 18 years, he or she is no longer able to access the complaints mechanism of the Ombudsman for Children and actually has fewer supports.  Mental health supports are also difficult to access after leaving the detention system.  We have spoken in this House on numerous occasions about the fact that we have an enormous amount of work to do in the provision of mental health supports.  The solution does not lie within the confines of a prison but in community based supports and social policy, housing, education, employment and families.  It is the responsibility of the Government to develop policies that will tackle the cycle of poverty and crime.  In Ireland the majority of people who are locked up are serving short-term sentences for minor crimes.  What about the crimes that hurt all of society?  What about corruption, environmental policies that will destroy the planet and the passing of neoliberal legislation that will further deprive those who are already deprived?  One in eight children is now living in consistent poverty as a result of Government policies.  How many of these children will end up in a detention school or prison?  <br\/><br\/>Andrew Coyle, Professor of Prison Studies at London University, has called for the detention centres of the future to have strong links with the community in which they are based, with detainees having access to local resources and facilities which they would be able to continue using after their release, which would help their reintegration.  Above all, the focus must be on detention as a last resort.  According to Juliet Lyon, director of the Penal Reform Trust in the United Kingdom, &quot;we must make prisons smaller - smaller in our minds, and smaller in number and capacity.&quot;  On that point, many months ago the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, brought the issue of Cork Prison before the House.  He had some very progressive ideas on prisons and was stronger than most on the issue.  It was a huge disappointment when the single cell occupancy option was not chosen in the redevelopment of Cork Prison.  The argument was we did not have the money or the space to do so.  If we were progressive, we could spend the same amount of money and use the same space but only have half the number of cells.  It was not a progressive move to increase the number of cells in the prison.  We replaced a prison designed for 146 prisoners with one which could hold up to 310.  That is called penal expansion, not progression.  Research has shown that if we provide more prison spaces, we will fill them.  Prison numbers are more often dictated by policy rather than crime rates.  The most obvious result of building bigger prisons is that we create a bigger burden for the taxpayer.  That said, the position here is not nearly as bad as in the United States, for example, which has a prison population of over 2 million.  That is partly because the prison system in the United States was privatised and powerful vested interests are strongly motivated to increase the numbers in prison.  Large corporate business in America is lobbying for an increase in the prison population.  Thankfully, bad as we are, we are not as bad as that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800029#BB00300","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434631800,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the provisions included in this Bill which will bring about an amalgamation of detention schools and formally end the references to St. Patrick's Institution.  There is, however, a certain irony in this debate because we are welcoming something that we really believe should not be in place.  If we genuinely mean prison should be used as a last resort and that we should be striving towards a society where children are not detained anywhere, we have to step back and analyse how we have got to where we are and decide where we really want to go.  It would be most welcome if we had no children in detention.  We must learn from our past in this regard.  It has taken decades of recommendations and commitments by successive Governments to get to where we are.  I must point out that 30 years ago, in 1985, the Whitaker committee recommended the closure of St. Patrick's Institution, while 25 years ago Ireland signed up to the UN Rules for the Protection of Children Deprived of their Liberty.  Rule No. 29 reads as follows: \"In all detention facilities juveniles should be separated from adults, unless they are members of the same family\".  These are commitments that we have not abided by for decades and while Ireland is not a country that moves quickly on any issue, this must be a new record.  The trenchant and repeated criticism by a roll-call of international human rights bodies have pushed us to this point.  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the European Committee on Social Rights and the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights have all repeatedly said Ireland must stop the practice of detaining children in adult prisons.  It has taken us decades to get here because poor and marginalised children in trouble have never been high up the list of priorities.  If children are disadvantaged in their early years, that disadvantage will follow them throughout their lives.  We should mark it, given that we are approaching the 100th anniversary of the foundation of the State and the aspiration to treat all children of the nation equally.  Part of the problem has been identified by penal reformers.  If we really believe the goal should be prevention, we need a long-term strategy, with steady and sustained intervention throughout a child's life.  Unfortunately, a child's life does not neatly fit with the five year term of a Government, which is why thisissue has fallen off the list.  If we are saying it needs to be prioritised, an overarching strategy that deals with children's lives rather than one that fits with electoral and Government terms has to be developed.  <\/p>  <p>  The 2001 Children Act provided that children should be detained in detention schools up to the age of 16 years and in detention centres between the ages of 16 and 18.  Detention centres for children were to be places suitable for the detention of minors in that age category.  In that context, an adult prison could never be suitable, but we continued to place children there until March this year.<\/p><p>I am very glad that we have relatively recently ended the practice of remanding children to St. Patrick's Institution, but it has been a very long journey.  Why did it take that long to finish the work on the Oberstown facility?  The cost of the facility was about &euro;56 million, but it has taken since March 2008 to have it built.  I fully appreciate the blame does not lie on the shoulders of the Government alone, although the former Minister for Justice and Equality on his appointment after the general election put the project on hold.  However, it is good that we are where we are.  When talking about vulnerable young people at a stage in their lives that will leave deep scars, one day is too long, not to mention the fact that getting to where we are with the Oberstown facility has taken the best part of a decade.  It is about prioritising young people.  We have to analyse that issue.  It is a bit of a coincidence that the &euro;56 million it took to build the Oberstown facility is &euro;3 million less than the &euro;59 million the State paid out in claims to members of the public who were victims of Garda malpractice.  It took seven years to find &euro;56 million for this project, but we were able to find &euro;4 million overnight for the IBRC commission of investigation.  We were obviously very glad that the commission was set up, but it would not have been needed if the Minister for Finance had done his job and answered the questions he was asked in the first place.  Therefore, we can find money when we need to do so, but in other instances we cannot.  That is not good enough.  We need to learn from the lessons of the past.<\/p> <p> Other Deputies have mentioned that only 27% of children who had been on remand went on to be sentenced and placed in detention in 2013.  Sadly, that figure increased to 45% in 2014.  We need to step back and ask why they were detained.  The issue that has been highlighted of remanding children for breach of bail conditions needs serious review.  As the Irish Penal Reform Trust has pointed out, no support or supervision is provided for children while on bail.  Perhaps it is unsurprising, therefore, that many failed to comply with the bail conditions imposed.  When they fail to comply with these conditions, they end up being placed in detention on remand, often for lengthy pre-trial periods, which is a very serious issue.<\/p> <p> Even if we leave aside the issue of children over 17 years, Deputy Mick Wallace and others have pointed out that four in ten of the children under 16 in custody on remand have an intellectual disability.  The 2007 study of children in detention found that they most often came from families with at least one other member with a criminal conviction.  The majority present with a history of behavioural problems, mental health difficulties and often drug and other substance abuse since early childhood.  They are really vulnerable.  How have we treated vulnerable young people in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il?  The statistics show that poor children and single parents have been the biggest victims of the cuts.  We know about the cuts to the numbers of SNAs and special resource teachers who would help many of these children in their early developing years.  Barnardos pointed to the need to invest an extra &euro;100 million to ensure primary schools were genuinely free.  If we are serious about dealing with young people in detention, we must start with the conditions into which they are born and the education and health care services they receive to fulfil their potential.<\/p> <p> The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which we ratified in 1992 states the detention of children should be a last resort and for the shortest possible period of time.  Last year 132 children were sent to detention schools.  In Sweden which has a population twice the size of Ireland's only 119 individuals aged between 15 and 18 years were sent to a detention school in 2014.  Sweden does not allow anybody under the age of 15 years to be detained and in 2013 closed four of its prisons, even though there had been no reduction in crime.  We need to develop such an approach.<\/p> <p> I am concerned that the Bill removes the upper limit in the 2001 Act of three years in detention for children.  This provision must be removed.  As previous speakers mentioned, instead of providing more spaces in detention facilities or moving children from one detention facility to another, our focus should be on preventing children from being sent to detention centres in the first place.  As Deputy Mick Wallace highlighted, where the Irish system regards a person who receives a custodial sentence negatively as an offender, other countries emphasise that sentenced individuals are citizens who are primarily regarded as people with needs and who need to be helped.<\/p> <p> While we are all very glad that we are ending the practice of putting children in adult jails, we also need to end the practice of putting children in any form of detention centre.  We should move towards having far fewer adults incarcerated, except in very exceptional circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800030#CC00200","speaker":"1192","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434632400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this urgent and important debate on the Children (Amendment) Bill 2015.  I warmly welcome the debate because the protection of children, including those in detention, is a major issue for Irish society, particularly if we want a fairer and just society.  It is also linked closely with the equality issue and total respect for the rights of all children.  When we hear all the talk about recovery, my agenda is always fair recovery built on social justice; otherwise it is just hollow.<\/p>  <p>  When dealing with the issue of detention, we need to look in depth at poverty, educational disadvantage, dysfunctional families, violent families, alcohol and drug-fuelled families.  They are also key in this debate and on the future of people in detention.  The children of the families in question are often the ones who turn up in prisons and detention centres.  We need to face these realities.  Ignoring these factors leads to a flawed analysis of why so many children end up in detention.  This is something we often fail to do.  There is also a stronger link.  Children who come from violent and dysfunctional families are often the ones who are hurt and damaged between the ages of two and four years.  The damage has already been done and the seeds sown.  They are often the children who end up in detention.  I will deal with these issues in more detail.<\/p>  <p>  The Children (Amendment) Bill allows for the three children detention schools in Ireland to be managed on an integrated basis, which I welcome.  The Bill also allows for the amalgamation or closure of a children detention school.  It looks at the issue of remission for children in detention following a 2013 High Court decision, as well as disciplinary procedures and sanctions in children detention centres.  In discussing legislation we need to carry out an in-depth analysis.  We also need to focus on children living in poverty and dysfunctional families.  Some 138,000 children are living in poverty.  The level of consistent poverty has increased from 6.8% in 2008 to 11.7% today.  Some 37,000 children will be living in poverty in 2020.  A total of 1,054 children are homeless.  These are not out-of-control figures but ones we can target.  It is up to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to focus on these issues.  <\/p>  <p>  One of my colleagues spoke about prevention, a very important word when dealing with this issue.<\/p><p>The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which Deputy Stanton and I are members, is currently examining the affects on communities of gangland crime.  It is also examining, and has received submissions on, the impact of this on children.  The sad reality is that children are being used by criminal gangs to transport drugs and carry out criminal acts.  There is also massive intimidation of residents in some areas, with many families and children being forced out of their homes, many of which are burned down.  We regularly see on our television screens reports of shootings relating to gangland killings related, in the main, to the pursuit of drug debts.  If a person owes &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,500, it can cost him or her their life.  One can only imagine the impact of this on those children and how it will affect them into the future.  It is important in the context of our analysis of this legislation today that we focus on these types of issues.<\/p> <p> We also need to up our game in regard to the exploitation of children by modern society.  We must protect children and ensure they can live out their childhoods and are not pushed into adolescence too quickly by modern society.  Sadly, this is not the case.  Last night I attended a public meeting in my constituency in regard to the proposed location of a sex shop across the road from a local primary school in Drumcondra.  Many parents are concerned about this proposal and the increasing early sexualisation of children.  I raise this issue in the context of exploitation of children.  While the opening of this shop is not in contravention of existing planning laws, many people believe it is abhorrent that a retail unit of this nature can be sited at the end of a residential street and within view of a primary school.  This issue requires urgent assessment of the current planning laws that allow adult shops to be classified in the same way as any other retail outlet and allows for the location of such shops in residential areas.  The location of a sex shop across the road from a national school is unacceptable.  Young children will have to pass this shop on the way to school or on the way to the local playground.  Many parents are concerned that sexualisation of children is now happening at a very young age.  This issue is linked to the debate on the exploitation of children, which leads to children being hurt and damaged into the future.<\/p> <p> I welcome this legislation and believe it is a positive development.  It provides for the amalgamation of the three children detention schools into one entity and underpins the legal authority of the campus manager.  It will also allow for coherence in the direction and consistency of practices between the three children detention schools.  This amending Bill is vital to the successful integration of the three schools.  The removal of references to St. Patrick's institution are also welcome.  However, it is also vital to reiterate the principle that detention, including detention on remand, is a last resort for children and must never be used for care or welfare purposes.  It is important to stress that detention should always be a last resort.  This is a clear requirement of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and is reflected in sections 88(10) and 96 of the Children Act 2001, as amended.  It is important we also focus on these issues.<\/p> <p> Further, while the children detention schools are annually inspected by HIQA, the standards and criteria for children detention schools were issued in 2004, adopted in 2008 but have not been revised since.  Many people, including the Irish Penal Reform Trust, have recommended that these standards be reviewed to ensure they adhere to current best practice.  These are important issues to highlight in the context of debate on this Bill.<\/p> <p> In regard to the integrated campus, staff of children detention schools have raised concerns about the proposal to integrate 17 year old boys into the Oberstown school.  A 2012 report from the Irish Youth Justice Service outlined some of these concerns and responses from the management.  Sections 4 and 5, which relate to the extension of the relationship model of child care to all children under 18 years of age, was supported by the Irish Youth Justice Service and acknowledged as positive by the staff.  The single bedroom occupancy concept is supported by most people, particularly the Irish Youth Justice Service.  However, concern was expressed that the relationship model in the children detention schools could be changed or diluted as older boys came on stream.  Some staff believe that the increased number of 17 year olds could take up a lot of available resources, to the detriment of younger children.<\/p> <p> As I said, I welcome this legislation.  I ask the Minister to focus on the issues I have raised.  We need to focus on early intervention and to push this agenda and hammer it home.  In regard to the 138,000 children living in poverty, this issue must be prioritised in the context of the budget.  In seeking to prioritise it, the Minister will have my support and that of many Members of this House.  We need to face the reality in terms of the need to tackle educational disadvantage and poverty issues.  If we do not intervene earlier to address the issue of dysfunctional, violent families, we cannot expect four or five year olds from those families to have a normal childhood.  That is never going to happen.  Children from these families will end up in the detention centres about which we are now speaking if we do not intervene earlier to address their needs.<\/p> <p> I welcome this legislation which, as I said, is a positive development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800031#DD00200","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434633000,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important Bill.  I am very interested in this subject.  In my view, one of the most important Departments is the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in terms of its work and planning into the future in respect of children and young people.  It is important that Department is well resourced.<\/p>  <p>  I have listened to most of the debate on this Bill thus far.  Many previous speakers spoke about the need for prevention, early intervention and so on.  I do not think anyone could disagree with what has been said in this regard.  All our youth services, including Youth Work Ireland, For&oacute;ige and so on, need to be resourced and beefed up because, as they operate on the front line in this area, they can do a great deal in terms of early intervention to prevent young people getting into a life of crime and so on.<\/p>  <p>  I must also mention an issue with which some of my colleagues may not be in agreement.  A 17 year old out of control in a community can make life miserable for everyone, including himself, living in that community.  We must not forget the victims of the crimes of young people and how intimidating they can be for citizens, householders and communities.  Deputy Finian McGrath, who is no longer in the House, referred to that.  The State cannot sit back and allow this type of behaviour to carry on.  I accept we need to intervene at an earlier stage and prevent this type of behaviour, if we can.  Reference was made to children in detention.  Detention should be the last resort and the only alternative at a particular point in time taking into account the safety of citizens and the young people concerned.  There is need for balance in this debate.<\/p>  <p>  In 2012, the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs signed a ministerial order to bring prisons and places of detention within the remit of the Ombudsman for Children, thus enabling him or her to inspect and report on such institutions.  The Health Information and Quality Authority and Inspector of Prisons also inspects and reports on these institutions.  I accept that there are areas in respect of which we have to do better.  That the objective of this legislation is to move in that direction is welcome and positive.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly, is in charge of one of the most important Departments.  It is a Department with huge potential for the youth sector.  The Youth Work Act was passed in 2001.  It has not been developed at all.  The National Youth Work Development Plan 2006 has not been developed either.

This legislation will make three important changes that should improve our urban environment, increase the supply of much need housing and enhance the quality of life for citizens.  These changes are the introduction of a vacant site levy, reduced development contributions and changes to Part V provisions for social and affordable housing.<\/p>  <p>  At the height of the Fianna F&aacute;il housing bubble in 2006, almost 90,000 houses were built in a single year.  After the crash that inevitably followed the bubble, less than 10,000 houses are now being built each year, resulting in a considerable shortage.  We went from a situation where an unsustainable number of houses were being built, often in the wrong place and of the wrong type, to a situation where not enough houses are being built.  This legislation will help to address this situation and begin to return the housing market to a more stable footing. <\/p>  <p>  For too long, prime sites in our cities have been left as unproductive empty lots that attract dumping and anti-social behaviour.  These sites should be supporting economic activity that would benefit the local community and wider economy.  Instead, some owners have elected to leave these sites neglected in search of a bigger personal profit down the road, whatever the cost to the community.  This problem became more widespread in recent years when the bottom fell out of the property market and values decreased.  While there is no disincentive for an owner to leave a site vacant for many years, this has a negative impact on the local community and on the economic and social development of the city.   Dublin City Council has identified 151 vacant plots of land and 131 sites with derelict buildings that are zoned for development, but which have been left as a blot on the landscape.  Many of these sites are located in my Dublin Central constituency.  The introduction of a vacant site levy will encourage the owner to develop the site or to sell it to someone who is prepared to develop it.  That we are introducing legislation that will deal with this issue highlights the fact that legislation should be reviewed on a regular basis.  The original derelict sites levy legislation was introduced in 1990, a quarter of a century ago.  We need to examine such legislation on an ongoing basis to assess its effectiveness.  That legislation had not been effective over the past years and we now need to tighten up on the situation considerably.<\/p>  <p>  We currently have an enormous shortage of housing and we need developers to build more homes.  While the vacant site levy can be seen as a stick to encourage development, the changes to development contributions proposed in this Bill can be seen as a carrot to encourage developers to build houses.  It is essential that developers are required to pay development contributions towards the public infrastructure that benefits the development.  However, as we are now faced with an acute shortage in housing, it is appropriate to reduce this burden on the developer to facilitate the building of additional homes.  Many local authorities have already reduced development contributions for future planning applications, but this legislation will enable local authorities to apply the reduced development contributions to developments where planning permission has been granted but development or part of the development has not started.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the changes to the objectives of a development plan in respect of regeneration.  The new objective will provide that the development and renewal of areas in need of regeneration should be for the explicit purposes of preventing adverse effects on existing amenities; urban blight and decay; anti-social behaviour; and a shortage of habitable houses or of land suitable for residential use or a mixture of residential and other uses.  There are a number of areas in Dublin Central and many other parts of Dublin City in need of regeneration.  One of these areas is the docklands.  Under the urban renewal programme set up following the 1986 legislation, under the existing Custom House Docks Development Authority at the time, later the  Dublin Docklands Development Authority, there was to be regeneration of an economic and social nature.  However, the social nature was not provided.  It is vital that when we have regeneration, we do not allow it to be simply economic regeneration.  That is what has happened in the docklands to date and that is why we have major problems of social deprivation in areas such as Sheriff Street.<\/p><p>Part V provisions were supposed to provide social and affordable housing as a requirement of planning permission for housing developments.  It is important there is wider community benefit from these developments as it is the community infrastructure and the granting of planning permission that gives these sites their value.  However, while Part V provided 5,721 units between 2002 and 2011, a nine or ten-year period, its potential was never fully realised.  Hundreds of thousands of houses were built yet that is all Part V was able to deliver.  It was a meagre response, and it is clear the developers were running a coach and four through the provision.  This legislation will remove the option for developers of making cash payments instead of providing social and affordable housing units, which is extremely important.<\/p> <p> While the legislation maintains the legal provision for affordable housing, it cannot be implemented without a further ministerial directive.  I appreciate the prioritisation of social housing, but there remains a significant number of people who are not eligible for social housing who cannot afford their own home.  It would be preferable to include affordable housing as an option at this time, even if the majority of the houses provided are for social housing.  We have reduced the requirement from 20% to 10%.  The legislation will also reduce the amount of social and affordable housing to be provided in developments from 20% to 10%.  The great strength of that is the provision of certainty.  There will not be an exemption and cash payments in lieu will not be an option, which was a provision of which the developers availed previously.  At the same time, it will result in a reduction in the quantity of social and affordable housing.  It might have been more desirable for the reduction in affordable housing to be 5% and to retain an element of affordable housing as well.<\/p> <p> We should not forget that there is an entire category of people that can be easily lost between social housing and those who are in a position to purchase their homes themselves.  The local authorities and the Government were always cognisant of that fact, and always put in support mechanisms to ensure that cohort of people would be supported in order to enable them to purchase their own homes.  That was done in the past either through affordable housing, shared ownership, the provision of a grant by the Department and the local authority providing mortgages.  It is almost impossible to get a local authority mortgage at present and it is very much a last resort.  We must not forget that particular cohort of people as well, because if we do, we will create a situation whereby the number of people looking for social housing will increase because they do not have the supports to get on the property ladder.  With the imposition of a cap on the deposit requirement it is extremely difficult for young couples in particular to get a deposit together in order to get a step on the property ladder, acquire a mortgage and engage in the purchase of their own home.<\/p> <p> In the past we saw how developers did as much as they could to avoid either providing affordable housing in the first place or having it in a prominent location.  As in London, they did their best to use the \"poor door&rdquo; whereby affordable housing is tucked away in a corner and is out of sight and out of mind.  Worse again, as we have seen in the docklands, the affordable and social housing element of developments were put on the long finger until the project neared completion and then did not happen at all either due to a lack of funding or ability to complete the project.  All of those factors have resulted in the current situation whereby there is an acute shortage of social housing.  We must always be cognisant that whatever measures are put in place to protect the delivery of social housing are effective and in operation because the one thing of which we can be sure is that developers will do their damnedest to get around those mechanisms if they possibly can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800033#JJ00300","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434633900,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is primarily focused on addressing housing supply-related issues with a view to facilitating increased activity in the housing construction sector, especially in the Dublin area where the housing supply shortage is particularly acute.  As a Dublin Deputy I am very much aware of that on a daily basis.  By targeting empty sites urban regeneration will become more common and instead of the blight of wasteland in our communities, we will instead see positive developments adding to our communities.<\/p>  <p>  The main provisions of the Bill are the revision of the Part V arrangements on social and affordable housing as well as retrospective application of reduced development contribution charges, which is being done following the changes to the economy which made the previous charges unrealistic.  I very much welcome the introduction of a vacant site levy to incentivise urban regeneration and the provision of housing in central urban areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill gives effect to a number of actions outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Construction 2020 strategy which require legislative underpinning.  The Bill will enable planning authorities to adopt measures to incentivise the use and development of vacant sites in urban areas.  The Bill provides that from 1 January 2019, planning authorities will be empowered to apply an annual vacant site levy of 3% of the market value of vacant sites exceeding 0.1 ha, which in the planning authority&rsquo;s opinion were vacant in the preceding year, in areas identified by the planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential development or regeneration development.<\/p>  <p>  Part 2 of the legislation concerns the vacant site levy.  Section 5 provides for the definition of a vacant site.  In the case of residential land it means a site in an area where there is a need for housing, the site is suitable for provision of housing and is vacant.  In the case of regeneration land it means a site that is vacant and has an adverse effect on existing amenities including a diminution in the amenity.  A site is any area of land exceeding 0.1 ha but does not include a structure that is a person&rsquo;s home.<\/p>  <p>  There is also provision for the establishment and maintenance of a vacant sites register from 2017 onwards, which I welcome.  It will ensure that vacant sites are known and the existence of a list should provide a baseline for action to be taken in terms of levies, which should in turn incentivise work to be progressed on vacant sites.<\/p>  <p>  This part of the legislation outlines specific criteria to be used by the planning authority, or An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeal, for determining whether or not, first, there was a need for housing in an area, second, a site was suitable for housing, and third, the site being vacant had adverse effects on existing amenities in the area or on the character of the area.  That is very important as it provides a socially oriented framework for deciding what is a vacant site and what is not, and this ensures the levy is not all about land parcels and their financial value.  In that way we are seeing a turn away from the Celtic tiger model of money and land running roughshod over social cohesion and community need.<\/p>  <p>  With effect from 1 January 2019 and every year thereafter, a planning authority shall, in respect of the preceding year, charge a vacant site levy on the market value of a site on the owner of each site included in its vacant site register.  The levy shall be payable, in arrears, on demand or by instalments if agreed by the planning authority.  I hope the levy will be collected.  I am aware from reports from Dublin City Council that vacant site levies are already outstanding.  The names of some well known former developers are on the list of those who owe money.  In some cases the outstanding sums of money are as much as &euro;20,000 and &euro;30,000.  The levy shall continue to be payable annually until the site is developed or brought into use at which time the site will be removed from the register.<\/p>  <p>  Where An Bord Plean&aacute;la determines that a site was not a vacant site, it shall notify the planning authority concerned, which shall remove the relevant entry from the register and cancel the demand made.  An owner of a site may also appeal on the grounds that the amount of the levy has been incorrectly calculated.  In addition, where An Bord Plean&aacute;la determines the amount of the levy has been incorrectly calculated, it shall notify the correct amount to the planning authority concerned, which shall revise their records accordingly.<\/p><p> I refer to the amendments in this legislation that are being made to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 which deals with social and affordable housing.  Informed by a recent review of the Part V provisions, the Bill provides that, in future, the focus of Part V will be on the delivery of social housing, with a requirement for up to 10% social housing in developments in excess of nine units.  In the operation of these revised arrangements, the priority will be to secure social housing units on site.  The making of cash payments in lieu of social housing is to be discontinued and I very much welcome this.  In the past, some local authorities, particularly in parts of the Fingal area, accepted a sum of money in place of housing, which has left housing shortages in parts of Baldoyle and Howth.  I am glad the policy is to be discontinued.  The point of Part V is to deliver social housing.  The old approach of developers effectively buying their way out of this requirement was not helpful, especially during the Celtic tiger era.<\/p> <p> Under the legislation, a planning authority, in preparing its housing strategy, will be required to consult approved housing bodies in its functional area and to have regard to relevant housing policies of the Government or any Minister.  It also halves to 10% the percentage of land zoned for residential use, or for a mixture of residential and other uses, that must be provided for social and affordable housing.  Retaining the legal provision regarding affordable housing provides a robust and constitutionally tested legislative mechanism for the future provision of affordable housing.<\/p> <p> Previous affordable housing schemes have all been stood down since 2011, and although there is no plan to provide any scheme, I hope they will be returned to in the future.  It is understandable that due to the need for social housing provision, the focus of Part V is entirely on providing social housing output.  We have to get more houses built.  The housing crisis in Dublin, including in my Dublin North-East constituency and elsewhere, is very severe and must be tackled as a priority by the Government and local authorities including Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council.  It is intended to issue a statutory ministerial policy directive under section 29 of the Act to planning authorities directing that, until the issue of a further ministerial directive, developers should fulfil their Part V obligation in the form of social housing only.<\/p> <p> Part V of the legislation amends section 95 of the Act of 2000 by requiring a planning authority to have regard to the overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area of the development plan when ensuring sufficient and suitable land is zoned for residential use, or for a mixture of residential and other uses, and I support this.  Planning authorities need to ensure the communities within their remit are well balanced and to factor in the needs of those communities.  The transfer of completed units on other land not subject to the planning permission is also provided for.  This allows social housing units to be delivered in another location, in the event that the development that is the subject of the planning permission does not meet the social housing or mixed tenure needs of the local authority.  Provision is also made for the Part V obligation to be fulfilled by developers through long-term leasing of properties and rental accommodation availability agreements.  These latter Part V options reflect amendments that were provided in section 38 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010, but had not commenced.<\/p> <p> The Labour Party in government is addressing the housing crisis by providing massive resources for constructing new units, which will start to come on stream in the next couple of years.  Unfortunately, it takes a year to a year and a half to see the end result.  However, the important thing is that the resources are being provided, priority has been set and the local authorities have been given the task of dealing with it and coming up with solutions quickly.  I am glad to support the legislation and I commend the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, on their hard work in the area.  Given the scale of the housing crisis, the legislation must be supported.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800034#KK00200","speaker":"1021","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434634500,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I oppose the Bill.  Once again, it is satisfying the developer.  This is a dangerous path, and we have already seen the results of tinkering with Part V.  Part V was introduced to try to force developers to deliver social housing for cities in particular.  It has not worked and was never going to work in the way it was introduced, and it needs to be tightened and strengthened.  Instead, the Government, in this Bill, is trying to let former developers, and the vulture funds which have bought many development sites in this city and elsewhere, off their duty to provide social housing.  Some of it is to compensate for the State's failure to deliver social housing in terms of local authority building.  As a consequence of the Bill, we will have more of the same.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will underwrite the policy of this and previous Governments to subsidise social housing through supporting private landlords.  This is very evident in the proposal in the legislation to allow for the social leasing, or whatever it is called, as an opportunity for developers in the future in order that the local authorities do not have the right to purchase.  Sometimes, people forget that the 20% social housing provision is an option, not a grant by a developer of a house or an apartment.  During the height of the boom, local authorities found it very difficult to take up the options that were available to them.  We can discuss whether it was good or bad in terms of houses, for example, whether it was preferable to take the money from a developer rather than an option on houses in Castleknock.<\/p>  <p>  The Government thinking on social housing has been wrong for a number of years and this is the source of some of the chaos in social housing.  I will return to the regeneration schemes.  We have not delivered social housing in the way society understands it.  Local authorities, in the main, stopped building a number of years ago before the boom times when money for social housing began to dry up.  Of late, money for social housing has been drying up substantially, given that most of the money has been diverted to one of the 200 social housing bodies which can get access to other forms off the Statute Book, whereas if the local authorities were granted the money, it would be seen as a loan or support for local authorities, in which this and the previous Governments were not keen to invest.<\/p>  <p>  I continually refer to history which teaches that unless we change, we are condemned to repeat the mistakes of the past.  At the very least, in this State in times of housing crises, major social housing programs were developed.  They did not all end up in chaos with people demanding regeneration in Ballymun, Dolphin House or Fatima Mansions.  Although the programme of social housing from the 1920s to the 1950s might have provided rough, crude houses, they have settled down over time and, in some cases, are much sought after.  Fairview, The Tenters and most of Dublin 12, including Crumlin, Drimnagh and Walkinstown, are much sought after by people who would love to live in those areas.  Those social housing schemes were built at a time when the State had very little money but understood the need to invest in and provide for the needs of its citizens.<\/p><p>What was formerly regarded as an investment in a social service for the future is seen instead as current expenditure.  The motivation is profit instead of service provision.<\/p> <p> This Bill falls into the trap set by speculators and landlords.  I do not refer to the one-off landlords who bought a house in boom times and are now struggling with the mortgage on their second homes.  The problem is caused by the big landlords who are holding onto sites in the hope of increasing their profit margins.  The lands in Dublin owned by local authorities or the Government are for the most part serviced by roads and other infrastructure.  An investment in building houses on these lands would help to meet the social housing needs of our population.  Rather than take this approach, however, the Government is encouraging private landlords to get involved in social leasing through the housing assistance payment scheme, the rent assistance supplement and rent allowance.  The local authorities are leasing properties when they should be building social housing themselves.<\/p> <p> The reduction in the Part V provisions on social housing from 20% to 10% is a retrograde step.  We should be ring-fencing 20% and councils should be allowed to purchase houses even if it means taking an arm's length approach.  Certain councils in England which were prevented from building houses instead established bodies operating at an arm's length from the councils to enable them to draw down funds from the Government and the private sector.  However, this ethos suggests that local authorities should operate primarily as corporate entities rather than service providers.  Councils should also be able to accept money if it means building two houses in an alternative location rather than one on the development site.  I recall a discussion on whether it would be beneficial to construct social housing on Shrewsbury Road given that the council might construct five to ten houses in Ballyfermot or Crumlin for the price of one on Shrewsbury Road.  However, this approach to addressing housing needs is part of the reason for the chaos that now exists.<\/p> <p> The regeneration plans for my area were severely hit by the downturn.  The redevelopment of St. Theresa's Gardens is proceeding in a minimal way.  Regeneration of Dolphin House has been promised for I do not know how long and it will now proceed in a piecemeal manner.  The social housing programme for St. Michael's Estate was partially completed last year but the remainder of the estate is an empty field.  Local representatives held a meeting last Friday with the regeneration board for St. Michael's Estate.  The local authority, the regeneration board and local residents are in favour of using the part of the site ring fenced for private development for social housing.  I understand this will involve site 1B, which is adjacent to Thornton Heights.  This development would help to address the housing needs of senior citizens in the area and thereby free up existing family homes.<\/p> <p> However, the proposal is encountering obstacles due to bureaucracy and a failed regeneration model.  A considerable number of regeneration programmes have failed around the country but some of the biggest failures were in large-scale regeneration of flat complexes.   Even the regeneration of Fatima Mansions, which was a success in some ways, has had a knock-on effect on local authority housing lists because many of the previous local authority flats were not replaced in the same numbers on site or elsewhere.  This skewed the local authority housing list in those areas.  It is likely that residents in the first two blocks in Dolphin House will be housed before people who are on the homeless list because while the redevelopment of that complex is going to proceed, it will not deliver the same number of replacement social houses.  Dublin City Council's housing stock has collapsed because of its regeneration programme.  In Chamber Street three blocks of flats were demolished and we were left with an empty field.  Nothing is being build in Cherry Orchard and the local authority is now putting the land up for sale in the hope that it can extract money from one of the vulture funds in order to build houses elsewhere.  The council is starved of funds to build badly needed houses and the only housing development in the area is being build by a voluntary housing body.<\/p> <p> Blame for this problem is not limited to the current Government.  The policy of successive governments was to move away from investing in local authority housing to a system of housing support through rent supplements and allowances.  Governments opted to subsidise private landlordism over public housing, and this Bill continues that trend.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coffey, recently criticised local authorities for setting standards for apartment dwellings that are higher than the national standards and suggested this was one of the reasons why private speculators are not developing sites in Dublin city.  Imagine criticising a council for setting a standard on which it had widely consulted.  The Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, might take the time to read the Dublin City Council's successful apartment living document, which is the basis for the council's decision to introduce higher standards.  The standards are aimed at moving people away from houses and into apartments.  The reason people did not want to move into apartments was because they were too small and not suitable for rearing families.  The new standards also address other issues, such as small pocket parks, services and access to transport.<\/p><p>All of that is in the document, so it is wrong to ask a council to move away from the position it has taken, just because the speculators are saying it is too costly to build houses.<\/p> <p> It is not too costly because the price of building houses in Dublin has dropped in recent years.  The cost of building apartments is still below the price for which houses are being sold today on the open market.  We have seen the headlines in recent times about some developers looking for standards to be dropped.  They are trying to ensure they can squeeze the biggest profit from sites they already hold.  They might then open them up and start building.  <\/p> <p> Increased house prices and private rents are adding to the problems that ordinary decent workers face in Dublin and elsewhere in the State.  Higher rents mean that people are ending up on local authority lists, yet those councils cannot help them.  If they are on social welfare they cannot get rent allowance, but they cannot afford to rent privately.  The reason developments are not happening is that most of the lands previously held by NAMA are now held by a different type of speculator offshore which has a profit margin in mind, be it 50% or 100%, which is well above the normal margin of 20%.<\/p> <p> The normal cost of building a house in Dublin, including land costs, would be &euro;200,000 yet I have seen houses for sale in Crumlin for nearly &euro;300,000, which is a huge profit.  They are not spectacular houses, they are basic model homes which are being sold to make a substantial profit for the developer.  Fair dues to him in some ways, but at the end of the day the provisions in the Bill will contribute to an increase in house prices.  They will also contribute to a dependency on private landlords by the State into the future, whether it is through local authorities under the housing assistance payment or HAP scheme, or directly because they are not building enough social housing.  The Minister of State should substantially reconsider this Bill.<\/p> <p> I welcome the derelict sites levy but there is a problem with it.  Dublin City Council has a derelict sites tax and can compulsorily purchase vacant land, but only if it has the money to do so.  If the council is starved of funding it will not have the money to buy derelict land.  Even if it was bought, the council would probably have to sell it because the Government is not encouraging local authorities to build housing, so there is a problem.<\/p> <p> There is enough serviced land already in this State, it is just that people are sitting on it in the hope that the price of housing in the capital will go back up to boom-time levels.  It is already moving in that direction.  In some areas of Dublin the price of housing has doubled, while in other areas it has risen by only 50%.  Nowhere in the city, however, will a person be able to buy a house for the same price it was sold for three years ago.  The substantial increase in house prices will cause problems in the future but this Bill will not address that.  This is a cash cow for many developers who are currently sitting on land that could be developed.  Others cannot develop it even if they wished because they do not have access to funds.  That is something else that needs to be addressed.  <\/p> <p> This Government and the previous one have not invested in local authority housing as they should have.  It has been proven that if one goes down the road proposed in this Bill one will end up contributing further to the housing crisis that we already have, both in Dublin and elsewhere in this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800035#LL00200","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434635700,"counter":281,"content":"<p>Deputy Derek Nolan is sharing time with Deputies Dowds, Kehoe and Creed.

It is fair to say that we are in the midst of a housing crisis, particularly in Galway city where I live and which I represent along with the county.  No facet of society is unaffected by housing, be they young couples trying to buy a house, tenants watching rents rise, retired people wishing to downsize, or the thousands in Galway city on local authority waiting lists.  Every aspect of the market, both private and in social provision, is being squeezed.<\/p>  <p>  We are recovering from a severe shock to the market which failed because it was not properly regulated.  The market has shown that if it is left to its own devices, it is not capable of supporting or providing the social good that we expect to come from it.  Housing problems are interlinked and all stem from a lack of availability.  Dozens of construction companies collapsed in the crash, along with housing output.  In addition, development sites were in lock-down when Namafied, and construction activity stopped. <\/p>  <p>  As economic growth returned and activity was regenerated, the available stock was easily gobbled up.  In Galway we have been particularly hit because the city never overbuilt and never had ghost estates.  There was only one ghost estate in Galway and it has since been sorted.  We are thus at the crunch end of the market.  As a result, rents are going through the roof because it is not only a university city but also has an institute of technology.  House prices are also going through the roof.  About four years ago, a three-bedroom semi-detached house in Galway cost &euro;175,000 or &euro;180,000 while it is now &euro;230,000.  That is a massive price jump.  <\/p>  <p>  Meanwhile, waiting lists continue to grow because there has not been an increase in supply.  That growth has put pressure on rent caps and leasing arrangements.  Landlords who were previously in local authority leasing arrangements can now get better value in the private market.  They are therefore turfing out tenants, sometimes callously, with no regard for individuals or families in those houses.  <\/p>  <p>  This Bill will go some way towards alleviating the situation but it is a medium-term gain that we will see.  It will affect Part V when houses are built in three or four years time.  It will also affect vacant sites in two or three years time when the register kicks in.  A longer-term plan is needed to get Construction 2020 to work, get people building houses, and get the social housing programme up and running.<\/p>  <p>  I would take issue with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh because &euro;3.8 billion has been allocated, which is the biggest investment in social housing construction in the history of the State.  It was announced last year but will take time to implement and come on stream.  It will also take time for local authorities to get planning permissions and building contracts in place, as well as having those units constructed for people to live in them.  <\/p>  <p>  We have failed to grasp that if we have a social and private housing market we should be directing it towards a goal.  I am not saying that we should nationalise the housing market but we should certainly be using the levers of State to influence the outcome.  We need a policy goal to determine what an average person should have to pay for a home of their own.  When we know whether it should be three or four times their income in order to obtain a mortgage, we can direct housing supply, loan financing and rent controls towards that policy.  We must decide what people, who do all they can through their own endeavours to provide for themselves, should be able to do to own their home.<\/p><p>Once we have made that decision, everything else fills out around it.  Then we can say to those who cannot work or cannot get by that we will help them out either with the rent supplement or by providing a local authority house.  However, if we do not have a policy that rewards those who can and do work and get up every morning to do so, we will be unable to stand over a policy that, first, realises a social market and not only a private market and, second, is a policy that we can define, follow and implement.  At the moment we are chasing the market, developers, banks, rent increases and supply as opposed to leading and sticking to a policy for which we are fighting, pushing forward and directing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800037#NN00300","speaker":"1045","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434636300,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I never realised Deputy Nolan was so influenced by his spell in Germany until I heard him speak today and earlier in the week.  He wants to put order on everything.  In the case of the housing situation, he is absolutely correct.<\/p><p>In welcoming this Bill I see it as an essential part of a major job that must be done.  There are some important steps in that job.  In respect of Part V provisions for social and affordable housing, it is absolutely essential that there is an obligation on developers to provide the 10% social housing commitment.  In a sense I would prefer if it was even more, but if we could get that into operation, it would be a big step forward.  It is important to set out why that is a good development.  It is a good development because it will put people in social housing in a better position to access work in many cases and to be nearer their place of work.  Let us consider planning in this city in the past.  Out along by Morehampton Road there are posh houses on both sides of the road.  Behind those houses are smaller artisan dwellings.  This is because in the past the people who lived in those houses worked for the wealthy.  As a Labour Party Deputy I favour as much as possible a move towards equality in society.  Enabling people in social housing to live mixed with people who live in private housing is a positive development for all kinds of reasons.<\/p><p>Reference has been made to the application of reduced development contribution charges.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could go through the reasons for this again in his reply.  As I understand it, the purpose is to try to get some development going and reduce the cost of housing.  This is something we need to keep an eye on.<\/p><p>The third issue is the vacant site levy.  After I got elected to the House I was involved with five other Labour Party Deputies in work on aspects of the housing question.  One of the things we looked at in considerable detail was the idea of a vacant site levy.  I am pleased to see the levy as part of the legislation.  There are far too many places in this city, Galway, Cork and the towns of Ireland where there are vacant or empty sites and they are causing blight on the centre of the towns or cities.  I hope the vacant site levy of 3% will go towards addressing this issue and providing housing in areas which for the most part already have decent services.  This would be beneficial in a number of ways, in particular in terms of filling in ugly empty sites and placing people adjacent to services, whether buses, shops, schools, churches and so on.  I see considerable positivity in that.  It is long past time that we had the sort of pressure to get those sites occupied, especially given the appalling housing crisis we are dealing with.<\/p><p>It is vital we try to address the housing issue on as many fronts as possible.  Part of the question is social and part of it is private.  We probably need to look at ways of developing our rental market to get away from the <i>ad hoc<\/i>situation which many people have been subjected to and from which many people suffer at the moment.  I am pleased to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800038#OO00200","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speech","time":1434636300,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for bringing forward this important Bill.  It is a major step in addressing a current problem, a fact accepted by people on all sides of the House.  This Fine Gael-led Government, including the Labour Party, was elected a little over four years ago to fix a broken economy and country.  Today is another step forward in fixing what has been a major problem for us as a Government and as a country in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's Construction 2020 strategy, published in May 2014, was one of the steps taken to help the economy to recover.  It contains a comprehensive range of actions designed to increase activity in the construction sector as well as help to economic recovery, job creation and the re-birth of the construction sector in a more sustainable way.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will address housing supply issues by helping to increase housing construction activity, particularly in the Dublin area, where it is a major problem.  In my constituency of Wexford it is a major problem as well.  Wexford is like any other county in the country where there is a major housing shortage.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of the economic collapse under the previous Government the number of housing units constructed in Ireland fell by a mere 8,300 nationally in 2013, with only 1,360 of these in Dublin, while the number of house completions increased to 11,000 units in 2014, including almost 3,000 in Dublin.  More needs to be done in this area and I believe the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, recognise this.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that in years to come we will need to build approximately 25,000 units nationally each year to meet the projected housing demand, with more than 8,000 of these units in Dublin.  This tells us the extent of the problem we are facing.  The Bill provides for a range of measures which will help to address the issues, including the amendment of the Part V provisions of the Planning and Development Acts to support the provision of social housing, the introduction of the revised arrangements relating to the application of development contributions by planning authorities and the introduction of a new measure, a vacant site levy, to incentivise the development of vacant and unutilised sites in urban areas for housing and regeneration purposes.<\/p>  <p>  We have a major problem in towns throughout Ireland.  A major Irish retail business, Dunnes Stores, opened up several new stores a number of years ago on the edges of towns and left our urban centres.  This has left stores in the centre of our urban areas closed, vacant and empty.  This is causing major blight in towns and cities throughout Ireland.  Dunnes Stores has an onus to act because the people in each of the towns where it has premises have been supporting Dunnes Stores for many years.  It is about time Dunnes Stores went about renting out these vacant properties in urban areas.  Specifically I have in mind Main Street in my town of Enniscorthy where there is a huge vacant store.  It is a blight on that street.  This absolutely infuriates the rest of the retailers and traders in and around the town.<\/p><p>Towns have been under major pressure in the past few years and doing their best to keep their shops open.  If we are to reinvigorate town centres, people should rent out their vacant stores because plenty of others are interested in them.  They should not be afraid of competition in the area.  <\/p> <p> The Bill will introduce a vacant site levy to incentivise the development of vacant sites in urban areas.  This will help the supply of housing and incentivise regeneration in areas where this is much needed.  In the past few years the presence of vacant sites in towns has caused a huge problem.  The Bill further provides for reduced development contribution charges, a measure which has been adopted by local authorities since 2013 and which can have retrospective effect for planning permissions granted prior to that date, with the provision that the cost saving can be passed on to developments for which planning permission was granted prior to that date.<\/p> <p> There is a lot more to say about the Bill, but we are under time pressure.  I very much welcome the Bill and hope it will solve the huge housing crisis.  Every family should have the opportunity to own a house, but there are many people who are unable to buy and invest in a house.  As a Government, we have to give them an opportunity to own their own house.  The Bill will help these families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800038#OO00300","speaker":"1098","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434636900,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me the opportunity to say a few brief words about this legislation and, perhaps, to bring a different perspective to it. It largely looks at urban-based issues, but the housing crisis is the same for a family which lives in Ballyhea as it is for one which lives in Ballincollig.  Ballyhea is a smaller village at one end of my constituency, while Ballincollig is the biggest town in County Cork and at the other end of my constituency.  For individual families it does not matter.  There is a crisis everywhere from Malin Head to Mizen Head and all points in between.  Legislation is important and will tackle some of the issues, but of itself is not the answer.  I am glad to note the Government is committing substantial funds to address the housing crisis.  I saw some research findings that stated that, despite building nearly 100,000 houses per year during the madness of the boom, we needed to build at least 25,000 a year just to catch up.  It is a significant ask to get the construction industry up to that level of activity and the jobs that will come from it.<\/p>  <p>  Is there not an enormous irony that while we have perhaps 100,000 families on social housing waiting lists or being dealt with through various social housing initiatives, there are various reports suggesting there are at least 200,000 vacant houses in the country, while a report of Deutsche Bank in 2012 suggested there were nearly 300,000.  There is an enormous mismatch of resources and we really need to be able to think outside the box in how we can address it.  The map of those vacant houses shows they are substantially in rural Ireland, many of them along the west coast.  My guesstimate is that a lot of them are old housing stock on the streetscapes of towns and villages.  We need a contract between the State and these communities, whereby we will commit, as a state, to reinvest in these villages by providing playgrounds, footpaths and ramps at low cost.  The State, through social housing and local authority initiatives, might get involved in acquiring some of these houses and retrofitting them, insulating, rewiring and replumbing them to current standards.  There is an enormous opportunity because there is great value in acquiring these houses at extremely affordable prices and using them to deal with the problem.  We should insist on local authorities availing of 1,000 units per annum out of this enormous resource of vacant houses the length and breadth of the country.  We should also see some relaxation of building standards as there is no point in acquiring these houses at affordable prices and then having to spend the equivalent cost of building a new council house to retrofit them.  We have seen very good examples of what architects can do to redesign houses, but it should not be at the cost of the alternative, namely, building a new three bedroom house on the outskirts of the village and tearing the heart out of these communities.  <\/p>  <p>  We should also look at giving incentives to those who want to house themselves and would buy a house in Ballingeary, Ballyhea or Inchigeelagh if the State was to give them some incentive, in the form of a substantial grant, to refit it.  We would bring life back to these villages.  I was fortunate enough to go to school in Inchigeelagh, where my mother had a shop, and there was life in such villages.  After school, children played on the streets, but now people cannot get out of villages fast enough when the school closes.  They hightail it back to wherever they live.  The challenge is to match the two resources, vacant houses with nearly 100,000 people on social housing waiting lists to solve the problem.  The State needs to step up to the plate to put in place the infrastructure required, playgrounds, ramps and footpaths, in order that people can live safely and should then acquire these houses or incentivise the private sector to acquire them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800039#PP00200","speaker":"986"},{"type":"speech","time":1434636900,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Thomas Pringle.  <\/p>  <p>  I rather like the way people continuously talk about the \"construction industry\" in this House and elsewhere as though it is some large identifiable group.  It is like the way people talk about business, saying it has a voice which wants this, that and the other.  The construction industry contains a large number of groups, large builders and developers, small builders and small developers, just like the business sector has big and small businesses, which is also shorthand and could be dissected in a more sophisticated way.  I have come to the conclusion over many years - the Bill addresses this issue - that there are more cowboys involved in big business than in small business because they are big and can bully people and abuse the system.  Similarly, there are more cowboys among big developers than among small developers.  I can see the fine motives behind the Bill to attempt to address the issue of developers who are cowboys and speculators and who are not builders but who are trying to flip land quickly at a large profit.  This begs the following questions.  What is it that makes a developer?  What does he or she have to do to be a developer and what qualifications does he or she need?  What restrictions are there on anyone becoming a developer?  These are like the question of what the restrictions are on anybody becoming a banker.  What worries me is that in recent months and years, since the collapse of the economy, not only have the big bankers been rehabilitated, the big developers have also been rehabilitated and it has happened very quickly.  The familiar names that bore a heavy responsibility for what happened in and prior to 2007 in the development world are reappearing and being encouraged by at least one agency of the State, NAMA, to use what it calls their \"expertise\" - God only knows what that was - and being paid to resurrect somehow the companies and the areas they ruined.<\/p><p>The Bill does not address that issue.  Even in the banking world there is a little test.  To be directors of banks, people have to be approved by the Central Bank.  I do not believe for one moment that the test is adequate, given some of the people who got through the net, but in the world of developers there is nothing to stop those who have so conspicuously damaged the economy from re-emerging very quickly in the same position.  That is what is happening and some of them are being paid by the State.  Where the Bill may have missed a trick is that it does not distinguish between developers who should no longer be allowed to develop because of their failures in the past and the damage they did and developers who are undoubtedly good and constructive and want to make a mild profit but who also can be depended on not to breach the rules and etiquette and damage the communities which we hope, at least, they would house and encourage.    <\/p> <p> I should address briefly the vacant site levy.  The levy is a good idea in principle because it is being introduced to force what I call bad developers and pure speculators to sell, build on or develop land one way or the other.  That is a noble motive which has, in certain circumstances, great merit.  It will also punish those who are sitting on land banks purely and simply for speculative purposes.  However, I have heard of many instances of sites which have not been developed because they are not viable.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State addressed this issue also.  It does happen; they are not developed because they are simply not viable.  In these situations will the person who owns the site and the person who intended to develop it be punished?  In the years of the Celtic Tiger, one could develop almost any site.  One could bend all rules and this  would be encouraged because everything was selling.  Now there are sites which cannot be developed and are not commercially viable.  Good developers are looking at them and may now find themselves in a situation where a levy - I cannot remember what it is; I think it is 3% of the value - is imposed on these sites.  Will this encourage a developer?  It will not.  All it will do is make it a less valuable site, one which is less likely to be developed because it carries that charge.  <\/p> <p> The charge, under section 90, will, of course, be carried on.  If it is owed on the site and remains a charge on the land, the plot will be made less attractive.  It may be that, in the case of certain vacant sites which have been levied, the levy will tip a particular site over the edge and make it marginally less attractive to develop and, therefore, not commercially viable.  We have to look at that issue because some developers are not the cowboys we are used to.  They would be willing to develop these sites, but will be prohibited from doing so by the large charge on them.  Surely one of the answers to this problem would be to dezone a site rather than shoving a levy on it, which might have a freezing or paralysing effect in a marginal case.  Why could it not be dezoned after, say, three years?  If the charge had been levied for three years and it had not been developed, why could it not be dezoned and freed up in order that other sites could then be developed?  The effect of the levy can and may be detrimental.  I can see certain circumstances where it will work, but it is a crude instrument.  <\/p> <p> Under section 23, the site levy money is to be used by the local authority to develop sites.  Will this work?  If it is not going to work in the case of someone who is a genuine developer, what will happen?  We have a genuine developer who is not sitting on a site but who also cannot make it work.  How is the local authority going to be able to make it work by using the money on the site?  We are not distinguishing between the vacant site which has potential but which is marginal and being held by someone who has genuine motives and the one held by someone who has motives simply to flip it for a quick profit.  I cannot see how the local authority will be able to make it work if a genuine developer cannot do so.  <\/p> <p> Section 28 relates to reduced planning contributions.  This clause will, undoubtedly, be welcomed by developers because it will reduce their overheads and obligations when developing areas.  However, various areas have been cited to me where the infrastructure for an estate has been utterly and totally inadequate.  I have a particular case in County Cork in mind.  This could happen and already has happened.  The houses were built, but the money supposedly levied for infrastructure has been so inadequate that nothing has been done in that respect.  It will be a serious problem.  The Government should look again at the reduction of planning contributions if this is going to be the effect of such a reduction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800039#PP00400","speaker":"953","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434637500,"counter":290,"content":"<p>This Bill, although targeting the urban housing crisis, reflects the greater nationwide housing crisis.  The housing crisis is multidimensional and involves not just the issue of construction and housing supply but also market prices, landlord-tenant relationships, the availability of appropriate housing and the maintenance of existing social housing.  The Bill will do little in addressing the housing issue in County Donegal.  It is intended to target large urban areas such as Dublin and Cork, although certain aspects of it may be applicable to rural counties also.  It is vital to note that the housing crisis was foreseen a long time ago, but the Government refused to act on it before it became the nationwide crisis we are experiencing.  It is at the stage where it will probably take a generation to solve it.  I am in no doubt that it will become the hallmark of the Government which has become reactionary as opposed to progressive.<\/p>  <p>  I will focus on the situation in County Donegal, in particular, the consequences of the lack of real investment in rural Ireland during the years and the slow attempt to develop these areas.  Even though the homelessness crisis is not visible, as experienced in Dublin and Cork and other major urban areas, owing to the unique housing problem in rural counties such as my own, fundamental housing issues still need to be addressed.  The situation in County Donegal is quite different from that seen in Dublin and Cork.  In Donegal there is a large number of vacant housing units in rural parts of the county because the demand for housing in rural areas has dropped significantly.  People have been migrating steadily to the larger towns and urban centres such as Letterkenny to work.  The urban-focused strategy of IDA Ireland is much to blame for this internal migration, alongside a consistent lack of rural development, including, for example, access to high speed broadband.<\/p>  <p>  When we look at the issue of broadband, we find we are not investing in rural communities.  The Government has made it unsustainable to live in rural Ireland.  While 36,000 premises in the north west, including counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim, have access to high speed broadband to date, 85,900 premises have to rely on the national broadband scheme to provide services for them.  Building of the network will not begin until possibly late 2016 and it will take another three to five years to complete.  People in some areas in County Donegal may have to wait until 2021 or 2022 to secure access to high speed broadband.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015061800040#QQ00200","speaker":"1001"}]
