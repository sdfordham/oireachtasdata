","asker":"1182","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":105,"content":"<p>The existence of the State pension (transition) is historical and relates to the qualifying age for State pension (contributory) which, up until the early 1970s, was 70 years of age. State pension transition (known then as the Retirement Pension) was introduced at that time to bridge the gap for employees who had to retire at 65. The qualifying age for State pension (contributory) was subsequently reduced over time to 66 years, which left State pension (transition) effective for just one year. <\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years. This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available at 65, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years. State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of these changes is to make the pension system sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy. With increases in life expectancy, more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement. The period for which an average pension will be paid will be greater than the period for which a pension is paid at present. The number of pensions is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually as a result of demographic change. This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  In 2013, despite reforms introduced in 2012, the Department had to make provision for an additional &euro;190 million, and further increases are required year-on-year to keep pace with this demographic change. <\/p>  <p>  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical to protect older people from poverty.  Following on from its analysis of its award figures for State pension (transition) in 2011 and 2012 in order to establish the impact of the abolition of State pension (transition), the Department noted that only approximately 12.5 % came from employment, with over 50% coming from another social welfare payment, and the remainder coming from a combination of people already retired, paying credits or self-employed.  This would indicate that a significant number of people have left employment well in advance of pension age.  It also reflects the fact that there is no statutory retirement age in Ireland. Responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer\/employee relationship and the contract of employment.  As a result, people can retire before or after State pension age. <\/p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137.27 million. It is estimated that the net saving resulting from its abolition, when taking into account that many people were instead in receipt of other payments at the lower rates applicable to those under 66, amounted to &euro;33.5m in 2014 (as the scheme wound down over the 12 months) and will amount to some &euro;66 million in 2015.  There is also the impact of the additional PRSI and tax paid by those people choosing to work 12 months longer as a result of its abolition, and so the net cost to the Exchequer and Social Insurance Fund would be very significant if it was re-introduced.<\/p>  <p>  The average weekly payment of the State pension (transition) in 2013 amounted to &euro;235, although this varied depending on the circumstances of the pensioner.  The maximum personal rate was &euro;230.30, the increase for a Qualified Adult was &euro;153.50 (under 65) or &euro;206.30 (65 or over), and qualified children attracted an increase of &euro;29.80 each.<\/p>  <p>  It is hoped that, where appropriate, workers will choose and be able to work to pension age (and beyond if that is there choice) and in such cases they will have a higher income than they would have from their pension.  However, it is recognised that for some this is not viable and there are measures to support them in such circumstances. All short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66.  The rate of such payments will vary from case to case, depending on the scheme they are paid under, and their dependants.  For example, the personal rate for jobseekers benefit is &euro;188, with an increase of &euro;124.80 for a Qualified Adult and &euro;29.80 for qualified children.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically, in relation to jobseekers benefit and jobseekers allowance, there are a number of transitioning provisions applying in the case of people who are aged between 65 and 66. These include the following &ndash;<\/p>  <p>  (a)  Jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66.  <\/p>  <p>  (b)  Where a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claim spans two benefit years, a new Governing Contribution Year requirement is not applied to the second benefit year of a claimant aged 65 (effectively this means that they may receive payment in both years based upon eligibility in the first year).<\/p>  <p>  (c)  A further provision states that 3 waiting days do not have to be served for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance purposes in the case of certain people aged between 65 and 66 years who have been in receipt of JB within the past year.<\/p>  <p>  Beyond the above measures, there are no plans to introduce a new payment as the demographic reasons for the change remain.  Social welfare supports will continue to be available to those who need it most and where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200054#WRC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Numbers","counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200054#WRC01050"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[18133\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200054#WRC01100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the estimated number of claimants for all State pension payments; the associated total estimated cost for the years 2015 to 2020; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

In 2009, the cost of this payment amounted to &euro;1.0 billion (97,798 recipients), whereas by 2013 this had declined to &euro;952 million (95,801 recipients), and this reduction is expected to continue as the numbers qualifying for the contributory pension increases. It is, of course, significantly less than the increase in the State pension (contributory).<\/p><p>The increase in the expenditure projected for the contributory pension would be expected to increase future shortfalls in the SIF, and in time become unsustainable without pension reform.  In order to provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life, a number of significant reforms to State pensions have been introduced in recent years:<\/p><p>-  The standardisation of State pension age to age 66 began in 2014.  While the current State pension age of 66 remains, the State pension (transition) which applied for one year, for persons of age 65, ceased from 1<sup>st<\/sup>January 2014.<\/p><p>-  State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.<\/p><p>-  With effect from April 2012, and as provided for in legislation in 1997, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions.<\/p><p>-  As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension were introduced. These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.<\/p><p>Following considerable policy analysis, it is planned to introduce a &lsquo;total contribution approach&rsquo;.  Under this reform, the level of state pension (contributory) paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.  The proposed date for the introduction of a move to a total contributions approach is 2020, but this may be subject to change.  However, it is planned to finalise details and publicise them well in advance of its introduction, to facilitate retirement planning by those workers who may be affected by this change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200054#WRC01200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Live Register Data","counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200054#WRC01250"},{"type":"question","counter":110,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[18134\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200054#WRC01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the Government projections for the estimated number of persons on the live register in the years 2015 to 2020; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

One of the key messages of the review is that rent supplement continues to play a vital role in housing families and individuals, with the scheme supporting 69,000 people this year at a cost of over &euro;298 million.<\/p><p>Between the rent supplement scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the State accounts for a third of the private rented market.  The State is therefore a very significant player in the sector which has a responsibility not alone to rent supplement recipients but also to the market as a whole, including all those in private accommodation.  The review finds that increasing rent limits at this time could potentially add to further rental inflation in an already distressed market, affecting not alone rent supplement recipients, but lower-income workers and students. Increasing limits at a time of constrained supply will yield only a very marginal increase in available supply for rent supplement recipients, with the only certainty that raising limits will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to new recipients.<\/p><p>In light of the review's findings, the Department will instead continue to allow for flexibility in assessing customers' accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework.  Under this approach, each tenant's circumstances is considered on a case-by-case basis and rents can be increased above prescribed limits as appropriate.  I am satisfied that this is the appropriate response at this time which has assisted in excess of 1,500 rent supplement recipients throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation. <\/p><p>In addition, the Department in conjunction with Threshold operates a Tenancy Sustainment Protocol in the Dublin and Cork city areas where supply is most acute.  The primary objective of the Protocol is to ensure a speedy intervention to ensure that families at immediate risk of losing their tenancy get rapid assistance.  Of the 1,500 cases referred to above, some 560 Dublin households were supported as a result of the Protocol and 14 in Cork city.<\/p><p>The review clearly points out that the main cause of difficulty for persons renting or seeking to rent at this time is the much reduced availability of affordable private rented accommodation.  The issue of supply is being addressed by Government through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy.

As Minister for Finance I can only respond in relation to the recommendations made in relation to my own Department.<\/p><p>The tribunal pointed out problems to be addressed in our system of financial regulation.\u00a0 Poor supervision, an overly-deferential attitude by regulators, poor assessment of risks and a lack of follow-through on enforcement, all played a part in the financial crisis.\u00a0 This Government has undertaken a number of significant reforms since the financial crisis towards building a strengthened regulatory framework for the Irish financial services sector and to respond to the shortcomings identified.\u00a0 In 2011 the new Fitness and Probity regime was rolled out by the Central Bank in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010. The regime provides for new powers to be exercised by the Central Bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers and of key office-holders within those providers. Following on from the Central Bank Reform Act, 2010, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 enhances the Central Bank's regulatory powers, drawing on the lessons of the recent past in Ireland and abroad. It strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions.\u00a0 The Act also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and underpins the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice. The reforms introduced under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 are complemented by a number of strategically important reforms at EU level in financial services. Under our presidency, agreement was reached on the single supervisory mechanism, one of the main cornerstones of Banking Union which will provide for the European Central Bank to act as supervisor for systemic important banks throughout the Union. Agreement was also reached on the Capital Requirements package which will ensure that European banks hold enough good quality capital to withstand future economic and financial shocks. These legislative reforms have been supplemented by a significant increase in regulatory activity by the Central Bank with a corresponding increase in staff numbers and skill levels. The Central Bank of Ireland's Enforcement Priorities for 2015 highlight the importance of enforcement within its risk-based regulatory framework (PRISM). PRISM represents a challenging and proportionate risk-based system of supervision for all financial institutions operating in Ireland. The Central Bank's Strategic Plan 2013 2015 also sets out a strategy of assertive risk-based supervision underpinned by a credible threat of enforcement.<\/p><p>In response to the Tribunal recommendations I have considered the provision of tax relief for donations to political parties and have decided against introducing such relief. The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 provided for changes to the Electoral Act, 1997 and imposed new limits for donations. Donations to individuals exceeding &euro;600 must be declared and donations exceeding &euro;1,000 in any one year may not be accepted. Political party donations greater than &euro;1,500 must be declared and donations greater than &euro;2,500 in any one year may not be accepted. These limits, in themselves, should act to deter any attempts by wealthy individuals to influence political activity.<\/p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners have provided me with the following information in relation to Revenue issues raised in the recommendations of the Moriarty Tribunal.<\/p><p><b>Recommendation: Independence of the Revenue Commissioners<\/b>- <\/p><p>Section 101 of the Minister and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 has placed on a statutory basis the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the exercise by the Commissioners of their statutory functions under the various taxation and customs enactments.

Our approach towards expenditure management\u00a0enabled\u00a0Ireland\u00a0to\u00a0regain its fiscal credibility, restore its international reputation, and reach a\u00a0position as Europe's fastest growing economy.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the funding of strategic infrastructure requirements, my Department has been undertaking a review of the public capital programme. \u00a0The purpose of the review was to assess all areas of public capital investment and to refresh the existing investment strategy and multi-annual envelopes.\u00a0 This is to help ensure that they are in line with emerging Government priorities and that our resources are focussed on the areas that can best underpin continued economic growth. The report of the capital review is currently being finalised and will set out the capital envelope to 2020.\u00a0 I intend to publish the report in June.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, managing the delivery of public services within agreed budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and Department to ensure that Vote-level allocations are adhered to while at the same time ensuring that they continue to provide essential services and respond appropriately to increasing demands. \u00a0My Department continually monitors voted expenditure throughout the year to compare drawdown of funds from the Exchequer against published expenditure profiles.

Those protections include the Protection of Employment Acts 1977-2007, which provide for a process of information and consultation between the employer and the employee representatives in circumstances where a collective redundancy is proposed, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2005, which give employees entitlements to specified notice periods or payment in lieu of notice and the Redundancy Payments Acts which are administered by the Minister for Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Protection of Employment Acts, a collective redundancy situation exists where, during a period of 30 consecutive days, an employer proposes to make a certain proportion of the workforce redundant.  These proportions are (1) at least 5 employees redundant in an establishment normally employing between 20 and 49 employees, or (2) at least 10 employees redundant in an establishment employing between 50 and 100 employees, or (3) at least 10% of the employees where between 100 and 299 are employed or (4) at least 30 employees where more than 300 are employed.<\/p>  <p>  In certain circumstances, the provisions of the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 may apply. It provides that all the rights and obligations of an employer arising from a contract of employment, other than pension rights, existing on the date of a transfer (as defined in the Regulations), are transferred to the new employer on the transfer of the business or part thereof.  A complaint that an employer has contravened these Regulations in relation to an employee may be presented to a Rights Commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) is mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation.  NERA&rsquo;s Workplace Relations Customer Service Section provides information in relation to employment, equality and industrial relations rights and obligations and how to obtain redress where appropriate.  <\/p>  <p>  Workplace Relations Customer Services staff are available to meet the Cadbury workforce to provide information and answer any questions they may have with regard to their present situation. <\/p>  <p>  The State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery is available, if required, to assist the parties concerned. I know that in similar situations in the past, the parties have facilitated access to commercially sensitive information such as company accounts. It is a matter for the parties in each dispute to decide however.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, whether in redundancy or other collective disputes, rests with the employer, the workers and their representatives.  The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement to support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences.<\/p>  <p>  Even what often appears to be the most intractable of disputes is capable of resolution where both sides engage constructively and in good faith in this voluntary process. The principle of good faith implies that both sides in a dispute make every effort to reach an agreement and endeavor, through genuine and constructive negotiations, to resolve their differences. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the management and employee representatives are in discussions on the above issues and a variety of other issues.<\/p>  <p>  I continue to monitor this situation very closely.  Enterprise Ireland has had meetings with the company&rsquo;s management on a weekly basis since the announcement of the proposed job losses.

The Regulations governing the operation of the National Reserve also include an optional provision whereby Member States may use the National Reserve to allocate new entitlements or give a top-up on the value of existing entitlements for persons who suffer from a &lsquo;Specific Disadvantage&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Following my Department&rsquo;s consultation with the EU Commission, I announced in March 2015 that the group commonly known as &ldquo;Old Young Farmers&rdquo;, who established their holding between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2009, and who, due to the timeframe of setting up their holding did not benefit from either the Installation Aid, which closed for applications in October 2008, or the Young Farmer category of the National Reserve, can be considered as a &lsquo;group suffering from specific disadvantage&rsquo;. The result is that this group is eligible to apply to the National Reserve under Phase 2 which opened for applications on 1st April 2015. Successful applicants under the National Reserve will be eligible for an allocation of entitlements at the National Average value on land for which they hold no entitlements (on the basis of 1 entitlement for 1 hectare of eligible land declared). In respect of existing entitlements with a value below the National Average, they will receive a top-up to the National Average value. The allocation of entitlements and top-up to the value of existing entitlements is subject to a maximum of 90.<\/p>  <p>  The person named has been in correspondence with my Department regarding his application under the National Reserve. He had initially applied for the &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; priority category of the National Reserve but subsequently contacted my Department regarding the &lsquo;Old Young Farmer&rsquo; category for young farmers who established their holdings in 2008 and 2009. My Department issued the Terms and Conditions for the &lsquo;Old Young Farmer&rsquo; scheme to the person named and also notified him that his request to have his application amended has been accepted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200061#WRK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":459,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200061#WRK01650"},{"type":"question","counter":460,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[18232\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200061#WRK01700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"to outline the position regarding outstanding payments under the disadvantaged areas scheme and the single payment scheme in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":461,"content":"<p>An application for 2014 Single Farm Payment\/Disadvantage Areas&rsquo; scheme was received from the estate of the person named on 6 May 2014.

","asker":"945","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":523,"content":"<p>Planning in overall terms, and specifically in terms of marketing activities for the post quota period in relation to efforts to increase exports has been ongoing for a number of years. Developing a unique selling point for Irish dairy produce is a critically important element of the national strategy for the development of the sector, particularly in the context of the need to maximise market returns for significantly increased production in competitive markets world-wide. It remains clearly evident, from engagement with potential customers for Irish dairy products that the sustainability message inherent to the sector in Ireland has a strong resonance.  Irish dairy co-operatives and PLCs export their produce to some 130 countries and of course, some 60% of Irish dairy output is marketed through a joint co-operative venture &ldquo;The Irish Dairy Board&rdquo; which has recently rebranded itself as &ldquo;Ornua&rdquo;. These companies have already proven their capability on international markets and I am confident they will continue to do so in the quota free environment. <\/p>  <p>  As a support to this effort, in 2012 I announced a proposal for a new national sustainability programme for the dairy sector. This programme, the Bord Bia Sustainable Dairy Assurance Scheme (SDAS) was launched in December 2013 and is a key element in Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for marketing and promotion of dairy products on international markets, particularly in the context of expanded milk output following the abolition of milk quotas in April of this year.   <\/p>  <p>  The Bord Bia Sustainable Dairy Assurance Scheme was developed in cooperation with milk producers, processors and regulatory authorities. It has been designed to assist in securing new and existing markets for Irish dairy produce as farmers look to increase milk production in a post quota era.   <\/p>  <p>  This SDAS programme is independently verified and establishes a point of differentiation that sets our dairy products apart in world markets. The carbon footprint element is pivotal in demonstrating the strong climate change credentials of Ireland&rsquo;s dairy sector, and indeed it has already been established that Ireland&rsquo;s GHG emissions from the dairy sector are the joint lowest in the EU. To date there have been 6,405 audits completed with 5,667 farms certified. Another 684 farms are currently pending audit.   <\/p>  <p>  The scheme facilitates Bord Bia in conjunction with the dairy industry in positioning the Irish dairy sector globally as a source of verifiably sustainable dairy production. The SDAS programme, including audits, are funded directly by industry and managed by Bord Bia. To promote the SDAS to customers of Irish dairy, the industry provides a promotional fund to Bord Bia and this will be focussed across 3 primary target regions, namely Europe, China and the Middle East at a business to business level.   <\/p>  <p>  Bord Bia also has a central budget from Government which is used, inter alia, for the promotional activities in relation to dairy through attendance at trade fairs, market research in developing markets and consumer research. This funding is set to increase by 14% in 2015, which includes funding for Bord Bia to assist in the marketing of Irish food and drink including dairy at this year&rsquo;s Expo in Milan. Taken together, I am satisfied that the foregoing measures as outlined reflect the strong ongoing commitment to making resources available to ensure developing and exciting markets in the dairy sector can be appropriately pursued.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200062#WRL02600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Imports","counter":524,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200062#WRL02650"},{"type":"question","counter":525,"qnumday":369,"qnumall":"[18594\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200062#WRL02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his Department's strategy for tackling the high level of imports of food products that can be produced here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"945","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":526,"content":"<p>My view is that the best way of reducing imports of food products that can be produced here is by producing safe and high-quality produce domestically that consumers trust and want. That is why this Government has invested heavily in the development of a rigorous program of food safety and traceability measures allowing us to trace from farm to fork. Not only do we implement EU legislative measures, but we go further with national food quality and controls systems to ensure that we are world leaders in food safety assurance.  Moreover, we are the only country in the world to have a national sustainability program in place for our food and drink industry, which includes additional food safety checks; and measurable and audited sustainability targets for each farm and food business. <\/p>  <p>  Of course there are sectors where imports comprise a greater proportion than we would like. One of these is the fruit and vegetables sector but the reality is that a high proportion of these imports occur at times when it would not be economically feasible to produce in Ireland, mainly during the winter months. To address this issue, my Department continues to provide grant aid for the sector to encourage innovation and to assist growers to compete with imports and to meet the high demands of the retail sector. In March of this year, approvals issued to 158 applicants involving grant aid of &euro;5.7million, and when fully drawn down, this will support grower investments to the value of over &euro;14million. <\/p>  <p>  The Department also continues to support two Producer Organisations in the sector both Teagasc and Bord Bia work closely with the industry to provide technical advice and marketing expertise. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200062#WRL02800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Poultry Industry","counter":527,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200062#WRL02850"},{"type":"question","counter":528,"qnumday":370,"qnumall":"[18597\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200062#WRL02900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the estimated value of the total poultry sector from 2011 to 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"945","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":529,"content":"<p>The poultry sector plays an important role within the Irish agricultural economy, accounting for approximately 2% of gross agricultural output. The poultry sector supports around 5,000 jobs, most of these in rural areas. The value of primary output for the total poultry sector, including eggs, has remained relatively static over the last five years. Output stood at &euro;177 million in 2011, &euro;189 million in 2012, &euro;183 million in 2013 and approximately &euro;186 million in 2014. Given that the forecast for consumer demand remains somewhat stable , estimates for 2015 stand at &euro;18 6 million.  Export values however have increased steadily over the same period from &euro;210m in 2011 to c. &euro;310m in 2014, growing by 20% alone in the last year as the value of trade was driven by increased shipments of processed products. Strong fundamentals supported demand in almost all regions of the world in 2014 and this is expected to continue in 2015, although some easing in global poultry prices is expected. Irish production is forecast to remain stable during 2015 as EU and international production is estimated to increase marginally. However, the impact of cereal price changes will influence output decisions by producers as the year progresses.<\/p><p>The new Rural Development programme 2014 &ndash; 2020 (RDP) will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector going forward, and will be of particular relevance to a number of key areas within agriculture, including the poultry sector.

In response to a request for a meeting with representatives of the Forgotten Farmers Group, officials from my Department met with a delegation from the group on 1 April 2015.  At this meeting the main request of the group was to increase the value of entitlements for farmers who are under 40 years to the National Average value of entitlements in 2015. It was estimated that this group would comprise of no more than 300 farmers.  Following the meeting my Department carried out analysis of the group of farmers involved.  It has been established that 3,900 farmers fulfil this criteria.  An estimation of the cost of increasing the value of existing entitlements to the National Average for these 3,900 farmers stands at &euro;12.288m.   <\/p>  <p>  EU Regulations governing the National Reserve stipulate that young farmers and new entrants must be given priority status in allocating funding from the National Reserve.  Under these Regulations a &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; is defined as a farmer less than 40 years of age who commenced their farming activity during the previous five years.  Given the number of applications under phase 1 of the National Reserve, it is not envisaged that there will be available resources to cater for this large additional group of farmers who did not commence their farming activity during the previous five years.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the farmers in this group will benefit from an increase in the value of their entitlements under the convergence process between 2015 and 2019.  Farmers who hold entitlements that have an Initial Unit Value that is below 90% of the Basic Payment Scheme national average will see the value of their entitlements increase gradually over the five years of the scheme.  By 2019, all entitlements for all farmers in Ireland will be at least 60% of the National Average value.   <\/p>  <p>  With regard to access under Pillar 2 to the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) for young farmers who established their holdings prior to 2008, I intend to prioritise their applications under TAMS, with grant-aid payable at 40%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200062#WRL03400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Communications","counter":537,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200063#WRM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":538,"qnumday":373,"qnumall":"[18670\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200063#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when information requested by the Department of Social Protection for the purpose of assessing eligibility for a State pension will be provided to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It forms part of the country&rsquo;s draft Rural Development Programme and will have a budget of approximately &euro;300m over a period of 6 years.  The cost related to genotyping will be approximately &euro;7 million or about 15% of the funds provided.  This is the same percentage of payments as under the 2014 scheme.  The BDGP will accelerate improvement in the crucial area of environmental sustainability in the national herd through the application of genomic technology and will bring about long-term strategic improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.  It will also position Ireland as a global forerunner in the application of genomics technology and confirm our reputation as one of the most important and renowned export focussed beef producing nations in the world.  Participants in the programme will receive a payment of &euro;142.50 per hectare for the first 6.66 payable hectares under the scheme, and &euro;120 per payable hectare after that.  Payment to scheme participants is on basis of costs incurred and income foregone for each of the actions undertaken.  All of the costs to the farmer, including in terms of time and effort, have been factored into the payment for the farmer as agreed with the European Commission.  The payment includes a cost associated with the tissue tag sample and subsequent processing, and this will be deducted at source from the farmer&rsquo;s payment. <\/p>  <p>  Costs associated with training and the advisor&rsquo;s costs associated with completing the carbon navigator are paid separately from the &euro;142.50 and &euro;120 per hectare payment the farmer will receive.  The cost of completing a carbon navigator in conjunction with an approved advisor will be covered separately and will not be deducted from the farmer&rsquo;s payment.  The farmer will also be provided with an additional &euro;166 to compensate for the time and travel costs associated with attending the training course.  As the deputy notes, the ICBF will have a key role to play in facilitating the scheme in the same way as my Department has collaborated with that organisation for the Beef Genomics Scheme and the Beef Data Programme in recent years.

I am informed that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Kildare Division as of 31 March was 299 Garda&iacute;, of which 73 were in the Leixlip District which includes Carbury Garda Station, where there were 5 Garda&iacute; assigned.  Two additional Garda&iacute; have recently been assigned to Carbury.  I am assured that the allocation of overall Garda resources is kept under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure these resources are put to the best possible use.<\/p>  <p>  I can also inform the Deputy that, thanks to the resumption of Garda recruitment, the Commissioner now has the capacity to deploy new Garda&iacute; for the first time since 2009 and five new probationer Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the Kildare Garda Division.  Similarly, investments are being made in vehicles and IT, and in the recruitment of specialist professional staff.  Policing and community safety in Kildare will undoubtedly benefit from this injection of resources, as it will in all other Garda Divisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200063#WRM05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Registration Authority","counter":590,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200064#WRN00200"},{"type":"question","counter":591,"qnumday":390,"qnumall":"[18194\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200064#WRN00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding a piece of vacant land to the rear of properties (details supplied) in Dublin 11, which is subject to a claim of first registration to the Property Registration Authority; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":592,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that under the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, the Property Registration Authority (PRA) was established as and from 4 November 2006.

It contains wide-ranging and complex proposals relating to the protection of children as well as enhancing the way in which the State manages sex offenders.  It is a very important piece of legislation and one which I have prioritised for publication during the current parliamentary session.<\/p>  <p>   I would be concerned that to attempt a comprehensive statutory definition of consent would be a complex undertaking.  There is a real danger that it might cause unintended problems without any obvious benefit as, at best, a statutory definition of consent is likely to mirror the  existing common law position.<\/p>  <p>  If a real problem with the existing position is identified, I am open to considering the position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200064#WRN04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Recruitment","counter":630,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200064#WRN04200"},{"type":"question","counter":631,"qnumday":404,"qnumall":"[18425\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200064#WRN04300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on a matter (details supplied) regarding Garda recruitment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":632,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the first intake since 2009 of 100 new recruits entered training at the Garda College, Templemore, on 15 September 2014.

It would be premature at present to commit to a date for the transfer of the scheme. <\/p><p><i>Family Mediation Service<\/i><\/p><p><sup><\/sup>In addition, the Board took on responsibility for the Family Mediation Service in November 2011 which had been under the auspices of the Family Support Agency up to that point.  A key reason for this transferring was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law). Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common.  There are very positive signs which include the initiative set up in 2011 operating from the District Court in Dolphin House involving a co-location of the Courts with a family mediation service and a law centre.  This has proved very successful and was put on a permanent footing in 2014. Similar initiatives are now operating from Cork, Naas, Limerick, Clonmel and Nenagh.  Integration of the Family Mediation Service into the Legal Aid Board has also meant an increase in the referrals from Law Centres to mediation in appropriate cases.<\/p><p><b>Merger of the Property Registration Authority, Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland<\/b><\/p><p>The merger of the Property Registration Authority (PRA), Valuation Office (VO) and Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSI) has been mandated by the Government under the Agency Rationalisation Programme.

It is anticipated that Ministerial responsibility for the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland will be transferred to the Minister for Justice and Equality in due course.  I can also advise that the General Scheme of the Tailte &Eacute;ireann Bill (which provides for the merger of the PRA, VO and OSI) was published on 22 January 2015 and has been forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General for formal drafting.

The Programme covers eighteen countries including major emerging tourism and business markets such as China and India.

The Scheme, which will supersede the Waiver Programme, allows visitors to travel to and around the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK, including the north and south of the island of Ireland, on a single visa.  A formal joint review of the Scheme with the UK is due to be carried out shortly and both Governments have committed to the worldwide rollout of the Scheme to be substantially completed by the end of this year.  I am confident that this Scheme will build on and expand the growth in visitor numbers resulting from the original Waiver Programme.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, a liberal multi-entry visa regime for business travellers and other regular visitors with a good visa history, has been implemented in the Irish Visa Offices in Beijing, Moscow, Abu Dhabi and New Delhi over the last few years.  This regime allows for the issue of multi-entry visas for up to five years' duration for applicants with a good previous visa history.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the existing visa regime continues to support and facilitate tourism growth from countries whose citizens are visa-required for travel to the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200065#WRO01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Independent Review Mechanism","counter":658,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200065#WRO01350"},{"type":"question","counter":659,"qnumday":413,"qnumall":"[18563\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200065#WRO01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the Independent Review Mechanism will complete its work; her views on establishing a commission of investigation into serious cases, which raise fundamental questions regarding the malpractice of certain members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":660,"content":"<p>There are currently 319 complaints being considered by the mechanism established by the Government for the independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which have been made to me as Minister for Justice and Equality, or the Taoiseach.

Each recommendation will be very carefully considered, but as a matter of general principle let me say quite clearly that, in coming to a decision in each case, I will be very strongly guided by the independent advice of counsel.  Quite clearly having engaged counsel for this review, it would be entirely appropriate to be guided by their advice.  In the event that recommendations arise in regard to a Commission of Investigation, consideration will be given to whether this could be achieved by way of amending the terms of reference of an existing commission or the establishment of a separate commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200065#WRO01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Strength","counter":661,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200065#WRO01550"},{"type":"question","counter":662,"qnumday":414,"qnumall":"[18576\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200065#WRO01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide for each of the years 2000, 2005 and 2010, and for 2015 to date, the Garda numbers for each of the Garda districts in Cork city and county; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

In 2015, funding of &euro;49.93m has been provided to my Department for these schemes.  Over the period 2012 to 2014, my Department, as with all Government departments was required to deliver substantial savings on all major funding programmes under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012 - 2014.  In line with these savings requirements the reduction in finding provision for the youth services over the period amounted to approximately 18.75%.  This takes into account an allocation of &euro;1m provided in Budget 2014 to offset the impact of the savings requirements on the youth services.  My Department in determining the annual allocations to youth programmes, while having regard to the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure savings requirements, sought to ensure that, as far as possible, the focus was maintained on the frontline youth services, particularly those for vulnerable young people.  <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that there has been no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015 which was a key priority for youth organisations.  An allocation of &euro;1.92m has been made for the provision of youth services in Co Waterford in 2015.

I, and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet regularly, with youth organisations and groups.  In January and February, officials of my Department met with the representatives of some 30 national and major regional youth organisations to discuss recent and upcoming developments and to hear their plans for the services in 2015.  My aim is to see how we can work together to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people, having regard to resources available to us and to ensure that the programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is developing a new National Youth Strategy.  It will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10-24 years and will have a particular focus on those young people who are most marginalised or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore who are most in need of support.

These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Child and Family Agency and the Ombudsman for Children's Office. <\/p>  <p>  Up to 31st December, 2013, my Department also funded the Family Support Agency (FSA) and the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB).  The Child and Family Agency, established on 1st January 2014 under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, has statutory responsibility for services previously provided by the NEWB and FSA. In addition, the Agency has responsibility for children and family services previously delivered by the HSE together with domestic and sexual violence services, certain psychological welfare services, and preschool inspection services.  The coming together under one Agency of such a range of services provides a platform for the delivery of more efficient and effective services to children and families.  The remit of the Agency will contribute to the achievement of its overall vision, which is seeking to bring about greater integration of services with a focus on early intervention and community engagement.<\/p>  <p>  As the new Agency subsumed all of the staff and functions of the NEWB and the FSA there have been no savings of any significance accruing.

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2015, funding of &euro;49.9m has been provided to my Department for these schemes.  There has been no reduction in the overall allocation for youth services in 2015.  This was an important priority for the voluntary youth organisations that have a key role in the provision of quality youth work services for young people. <\/p><p>Ongoing engagement and dialogue with the voluntary youth sector organisations and with young people themselves are priorities in the formulation of policies and provision of services to support young people&rsquo;s development and learning.  My Department works closely with the youth sector interests in various fora in developing key initiatives. <\/p><p>Three of the targeted funding schemes, the Special Projects for Youth scheme, the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund, and Local Drug Task Force projects scheme, were the subject of a recently completed <i>Value for Money and Policy Review.<\/i>The schemes support the provision of youth services for young people who are at risk of drugs, alcohol misuse, early school leaving, homelessness or who are living in disadvantaged communities. In 2012, expenditure on the schemes amounted to &euro;39.7m.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of a complex area to do with the impact youth service provision has in young people&rsquo;s lives.  Overall, the review found that the youth programmes can provide a significant contribution to improving outcomes for young people, and should be considered for on-going public funding. <\/p><p>The review makes a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead. It recommends that the three schemes be replaced with a single, targeted, evidence-based and outcomes focussed scheme designed to secure the optimal outcomes for young people and their communities.  It sets out guidance as to how services may be developed to better meet the needs of young people in the target cohort and how demographic information and CSO data about local areas should be part of the programme design. <\/p><p>My Department has undertaken a detailed consultation process with the youth sector and providers of youth services, including volunteers, about the review's findings and recommendations.  The consultation included regional meetings across the country.  All local services were invited to participate.  My Department is committed to working collaboratively with the voluntary youth sector, in the development and implementation of the new programme over the next two years.  Support for volunteers engaged in the provision of youth services is a priority for my Department in this context.  Supports in place include training and awareness programmes in child protection matters through the National Youth Council of Ireland, and support programmes for both staff and volunteer led youth services in implementing the quality standards initiatives in local youth services.  I intend that the reforms recommended in the review will be progressed in the context of the new National Youth Strategy, which is nearing completion.  The strategy will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10 to 24 years.  It will have a particular focus on the needs of young people who are at risk of experiencing the poorest outcomes.  It is anticipated that the new National Youth Strategy will be finalised in early Summer<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200066#WRP00900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":704,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200066#WRP00950"},{"type":"question","counter":705,"qnumday":428,"qnumall":"[18481\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200066#WRP01000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the State boards, bodies or committees on which vacancies exist or are anticipated up to and including 1 January 2016;\u00a0the number of vacancies in each case; when the vacancy arose or will arise; if the vacancy relates to a chair or member; if he will provide details of the appointment process in each case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1006","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":706,"content":"<p>I am responsible for appointment of members to the boards of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, the Child and Family Agency (Tusla), Gaisce and the Board of Management for the Children Detention Schools.

My overall objective over the period 2016 to 2021 will be to realise funding allocations that reflect expenditure policy priorities and demographic provision and that sufficient resources are directed towards those areas of greatest impact on children and young people. <\/p><p>Ireland is experiencing substantial demographic growth. For example, a report titled &ldquo;Primary and Post-Primary Education 2015-2030&rdquo; prepared by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (DPER) indicates that pupil numbers at primary and post primary level have increased by over 60,000 in the last 5 years.  The same report considers a likely increase of some 15,000 pupils in primary\/post primary schools in 2015 compared to the previous year, gradually rising to a peak of approximately 979,000 pupils in school in 2024, compared to 889,000 in 2014.  While this report was prepared in the context of the Education sector it is reasonable to extrapolate a similar increase in demographic demand in relation to services provided across the vote of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, in particular in the range of services provided by the Child and Family Agency, the youth sector and pre-school services. <\/p><p>There is an increasing demographic demand manifesting itself in child and family services.  The period since 2006 has seen an upward trend in child welfare and abuse referrals.  Since 2012 there has been a change and standardisation in the counting methodology used by the HSE\/Tusla for abuse and welfare referrals making it difficult to make direct comparisons with current figures.  However it is clear that the trend in referrals has been increasing, with totals reaching over 40,000 child welfare and abuse referrals per annum.  Following screening, the numbers of cases deemed as needing a social work service has not increased to the same degree.<\/p><p>While the overall number of children in care has increased, the number of children being admitted to state care has been decreasing steadily over the last number of years.  This fall is contrary to other key related figures: the rising child population, rising levels of referrals to Tusla, and the rising number of children in care.  The increase in the number of children in care overall is a feature of children not exiting care.  This is due to an increase in the number of children staying longer in care and, although the numbers entering care has decreased, it is still greater than the numbers leaving.  Introduction of standard business practices, the application of national thresholds and measures to address children&rsquo;s needs through other interventions (eg: Pathways\/Meitheal) are expected to provide better information for the management of services.<\/p><p>Therefore, it is vitally important that unavoidable costs due to demographic pressures are fully addressed in the annual estimates process and that the impact of demographic change in this regard for the costs of programmes and schemes administered by my Department are properly captured on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>The Deputy might also note that <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020 <\/i>was published and launched by Government in 2014.  The framework comprehends the continuum from infancy through early and middle childhood to adolescence and early adulthood.  It provides the overarching framework for the development and implementation of policy and services for children and young people.  The Framework brings together key policies instanced in the Programme for Government including those relating to prevention and early intervention initiatives, early childhood education, breaking the cycle of disadvantage, through area based approaches to address child poverty, aftercare provision and addressing issues around anti-social behaviour.  It also provides a means for cross departmental collaboration to promote the well-being of children and young people and a fresh impetus to a whole-of-government approach to current and emerging issues, including childhood obesity, healthy lifestyles, the impact of media and new technologies, the sexualisation of children and promoting pro-social behaviour.

The readiness and compatibility of the professions for designation under the 2005 Act also need to be determined.<\/p>  <p>  The Council's detailed report on the matter has been received in recent weeks and is being examined carefully in the Department with a view to deciding the next steps which, I envisage, will include a wider round of consultation involving the various professional bodies and other interested parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200067#WRQ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":769,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200067#WRQ02950"},{"type":"question","counter":770,"qnumday":449,"qnumall":"[18186\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200067#WRQ03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans for the development and future of Kilcreene Hospital in County Kilkenny; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1184","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":771,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

It was introduced on the 1st May 2015 as a means of encouraging more people to join the market at a younger age and provides for 'loading' based on the age of a person when they first purchase private health insurance.

Under the Regulations Irish Water must notify the EPA of drinking water non-compliances or risks to public health from a public water supply.<\/p><p>Irish Water and the local authority are responsible for taking the necessary steps to bring the public water supply back into compliance and for issuing information and advice to consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200071#WRU00800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":944,"content":"<p>Question No. 509 answered with Question No. 507.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Medical Certificates Applications","counter":945,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200071#WRU00950"},{"type":"question","counter":946,"qnumday":510,"qnumall":"[18637\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200071#WRU01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Longford was refused a primary medical certificate, which the person recently applied for, despite the person suffering from a very severe stroke, which has left the person completely paralysed on the right side, severely immobilised and in need of a modified car and electric wheelchair in order to get around; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Through this mechanism, which addresses the issues directly with the Colombian authorities and includes input from civil society groups, the EU and member states engage in a structured manner across the full range of human rights concerns, including as regards human rights defenders and the slow pace in the decrease of impunity.   The Human Rights Dialogue is an important forum in which the EU engages constructively with the Colombian authorities, makes suggestions on how difficulties can be addressed, and shares experience with its Colombian counterparts. During the last session of the Human Rights Dialogue, in October 2014, issues such as the land restitution process, the situation of human rights defenders and the challenges facing protection schemes were addressed. In addition, the EU and its member states support both national authorities and civil society organisations working with the protection of human rights defenders.

SOLAS was established on 27 October 2013 and funded for the remainder of the year from the residual FAS budget. SOLAS has a current full time equivalent staffing of 211.<\/p><p>  Under the Public Service Reform plan a number of bodies were merged as follows.  The Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology and Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences were merged in March 2012 to form the Irish Research Council (IRC). The IRC has been established as a sub-board of the Higher Education Authority (HEA). Its function is to award research funding, primarily for postgraduate students and early-career postdoctoral researchers. The establishment of the IRC will result in an estimated saving of &euro;100,000 on an annual basis. <\/p><p>  Under the provisions of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) and the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC) were amalgamated to form a new agency, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI).

The number of teachers vetted under the non-statutory arrangements continues to steadily increase with about 54,000 of the 90,000 teachers on the Teaching Council register now vetted. The remaining 36,000 who have not yet been vetted are typically permanent teachers who have been in the same school since prior to the introduction of non-statutory vetting in 2006.<\/p><p>  The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, will, when commenced, put in place statutory requirements for vetting of persons involved in working with children and vulnerable adults, including those working in schools. I have also recently brought forward the Teaching Council (Amendment) Bill 2015 which is currently before the Oireachtas and which will underpin the central role of the Teaching Council in the operation of the statutory vetting arrangements for registered teachers. It is intended that this Bill will, when enacted and commenced, operate in tandem with the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012. <\/p><p>  In relation to the operation of the forthcoming statutory vetting requirements for schools, a major focus of my Department is to facilitate, as far as possible, a smooth transition to the new statutory arrangements.In that regard, my Department recently published &quot;Circular 0026\/2015 - Advance preparations for the commencement of statutory requirements for Garda vetting under the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (the Vetting Act)&quot; which outlines the preparations being put in place in advance of the forthcoming statutory vetting requirements. <\/p><p>  It is also intended that all registered teachers will be vetted under the statutory vetting arrangements as soon as possible after the legislation is commenced. I consider itpreferable and more effective from a child protection perspective that the cohort of 36,000  teachers who have not been vetted to date, are vetted under the forthcoming statutory vetting arrangements for two reasons. Firstly the forthcoming statutory arrangements will include a check for both criminal offences and also any relevant &quot;soft information&quot; which is an important new element of the vetting procedures. Secondly when the Teaching Council Amendment Bill is enacted, there will a clear statutory basis for the Teaching Council to require such teachers to undergo vetting and for it to deal with any adverse vetting disclosure that might be received.<\/p><p>In the first year after the introduction of the statutory vetting arrangements the two key priorities for the Teaching Council will be to facilitate a smooth and timely flow of vetted teachers to the school system and to ensure that the vetting of the remaining circa 36,000 registered teachers who have not been vetted to date is completed as quickly as possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200073#WRW02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Curriculum","counter":1058,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200073#WRW02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1059,"qnumday":548,"qnumall":"[18600\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200073#WRW02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her Department's policy regarding schools sharing subjects in order to maximise the number of subject options available to students, particularly at leaving certificate level; the way in which schools can arrange this; the number of schools currently engaging in such arrangements; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"984","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1060,"content":"<p>Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.

Sharing arrangements between post-primary schools can help to ensure that the range of subjects available to pupils is maximized, however my Department does not hold any information in relation to the number of schools currently engaging in such sharing arrangements.<\/p><p>  At post primary level and in accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e., curricular concessions. Short term support is needed (normally for one year but not exceeding 2\/3 school years) to enable the school authority to respond to the identified difficulty in meeting essential curricular commitments to pupils within the normal staffing allocation.<\/p><p>  In order to further encourage inter school co-operation, specific account is taken where a request involves two or more neighbouring schools engaging in demonstrable co-operation arrangements, with an overall more efficient use of resources, in order to address on a collective basis the curricular needs of the schools concerned.<\/p><p>Any staffing concessions will be operated in a way to encourage inter school co-operation in the provision of efficient and effective educational services to the locality served and to encourage and facilitate good school management and planning in schools.  The detail of the curricular concession process is set out with the criteria for the allocation of posts and is also available on the website.<\/p><p>  The allocation process also includes an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The appeal procedures are also set out in the published staffing arrangements. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200073#WRW02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Tuition Scheme Administration","counter":1061,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200073#WRW02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1062,"qnumday":549,"qnumall":"[18604\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200073#WRW02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 223 of 30 March 2013, the reason her Department made an exception in this case, and entered into an agreement with one private commercial organisation, which involves the annual payment of millions of euro to that organisation, in respect of the home tuition scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The senior officer grade plays a critical background role in ensuring quality and consistent services to thepublic when these are needed.<\/p><p>In addition, the small corps of senior fire officers also provide a range of specialist statutory and community fire safety functions.  Fire officers also lead for local authorities in the area of major emergency management and co-ordinate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Service Executive.

In broad terms, the standard sets out a two-step process to facilitate the testing and categorisation of dwellings.<\/p><p>Firstly, the standard requires that a Building Condition Assessment be carried out; this comprises a desktop study and a visual non-invasive internal and external inspection of a dwelling, by a competent person, to establish the presence or absence of visible damage that is consistent with pyritic heave and to quantify the extent and significance of such damage in that dwelling.  Damage ratings of 0, 1 or 2 can be assigned to a dwelling under this process.<\/p><p>Secondly, the results of the Building Condition Assessment will inform whether sampling and testing of the sub-floor hardcore of the dwelling will be required in order to confirm the presence or otherwise of reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material.  Dwellings which have been tested and the hardcore is shown not to be susceptible to expansion are classified as Category A (i.e. green certificate).  These dwellings have a negligible risk of pyrite damage given testing has demonstrated that the hardcore is not susceptible to expansion; any damage that may be visible in such dwellings is likely to be attributable to other causes.<\/p><p>While there is no requirement on any homeowner to carry out testing on their property in order to confirm the presence or otherwise of reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore, the standard does provide an objective, reliable and robust means by which dwellings can be tested and categorised.  Accordingly, where insurance cover may be at issue, it is open to homeowners with a damage rating of 1 to proceed with the testing of the hardcore material to establish whether it is susceptible, or not susceptible, to expansion.<\/p><p>In the case of dwellings remediated under the pyrite remediation scheme, all works will be completed by competent builders to the requirements of <i>I.S. 398-2:2013 Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &mdash; Part 2: Methodology for remediation works<\/i>, and will be overseen by construction professionals in accordance with the requirements of the Pyrite Resolution Board and the Housing Agency.

New house completions in 2014 amounted to 11,016 units nationally, up 33% on the 2013 figure.  In addition, the Social Housing Strategy 2020 published in November 2014 sets out clear, measurable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list. The total targeted provision under the Social Housing Strategy of 110,000 social housing units includes the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units through Pillar 1.

The EU aims to deliver a 20% improvement in energy efficiency, a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions and 20% of our energy coming from renewable sources by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s 2020 strategy is set firmly in the global and European contexts. Our objectives accord with the policy objectives set by the European Union. These are grounded in the economic, environmental and supply security imperatives to decarbonise energy systems and diversify energy sources by fundamentally de-coupling energy from reliance on fossil fuels.<\/p>  <p>  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. To meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources. Policies and schemes are in place to incentivise the use of renewable energy and Ireland has made significant progress with regard to renewable energy deployment. To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity. <\/p>  <p>  The REFIT schemes are the principal means of supporting renewable electricity generators for renewable energy exported to the grid. These schemes support electricity generated from a range of renewable sources including small scale hydro, biomass and wind. Solar PV, wave energy, or geothermal are not supported by the REFIT schemes.<\/p>  <p>  Given the emerging policy context and the requirements of the EU target market for electricity, my Department is beginning the process of developing a new support scheme for electricity, to be available from 2016 onwards. A key component of this will be consideration of all available technologies, their cost effectiveness and the level of support required. <\/p>  <p>  As regards energy efficiency, my Department is continuing to develop and enhance policy in this area and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is continuing to implement policy with the roll out of efficiency measures in homes and businesses throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200077#WRAA02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies","counter":1233,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200077#WRAA02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1234,"qnumday":609,"qnumall":"[18430\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200077#WRAA02400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the number of agencies, quangos or other bodies within his Department, funded by or established by his Department, which have been scrapped, merged or reduced since this Government was formed; the amount saved in each case; the reduction in staff as a result; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":1235,"content":"<p>The Government, on completion of a wide ranging review of State Bodies, published its decision on the rationalisation of such Bodies in November 2012.

In this regard, my Department conducted a critical examination of the structure and operation of the institutions included in the Public Service Reform Plan and developed a comprehensive and practical approach to the implementation of the various Government Decisions in this area.  Savings were made primarily in three ways<\/p>  <p>- Through the ending of payments to Chairpersons and members of boards or advisory councils<\/p>  <p>- Through a programme of shared services between institutions, including, for example, in retail, security, marketing, procurement and storage and<\/p>  <p>- Through the provision of human resources services by my Department to the National Museum of Ireland, thus eliminating the need to incur a cost in accessing these services.<\/p>  <p>  The functions of Culture Ireland were merged fully into my Department during 2013 and the Board was replaced with an Expert Committee whose members provide their time on a pro bono basis.  In addition, the term of office of the Placenames Commission expired in October 2012 and was in turn replaced by an Expert Committee which also operates on a pro bono basis.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, a formal Framework for Co-operation and Improved Services between the National Gallery of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Crawford Art Gallery was developed and endorsed by Government.  Arising from that, the three Galleries signed a formal Service Level Agreement outlining a number of specific measures to share a number of services across the three Institutions.  In addition, legislation is being prepared to update corporate governance in the Galleries, to reduce the numbers on their boards and provide for pro bono service and gender equality on each board.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this programme of change has made a significant contribution to achieving the overall &euro;20 million savings target set out in the Public Service Reform Plan, while at the same time enhancing the operations of the bodies concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200079#WRCC02800","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Archaeological Sites","counter":1334,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200079#WRCC02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1335,"qnumday":643,"qnumall":"[18456\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051200079#WRCC03000","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"her plans to introduce the portable antiquities scheme in order for constructive metal detecting to complement regular archaeological work, reduce the heritage budget and increase archaeological knowledge, in view of the fact that archaeologists concede that items left in the soil will, over time, degrade and in the case of plough soil will be completely fragmented and destroyed.","asker":"1192","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":1336,"content":"<p>Measures to regulate the use of metal detectors were introduced in the National Monuments Act (Amendment) 1987 to protect our archaeological heritage from the irreparable damage and loss which results from indiscriminate use of metal detectors to search for archaeological objects.
